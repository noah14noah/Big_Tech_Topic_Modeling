At the event, CEO Matthew Prince openly discussed his controversial decision to drop a neo-Nazi website as a customer. While attendees largely opposed internet regulation, the feeling wasn't uniform.Matthew Prince isn't shying away from the internet censorship debate. That was clear this week when\u00a0the CEO of Cloudflare hosted the third annual Internet Summit at his company's San Francisco headquarters. </p><p>Instead of just concentrating on technology or business issues,\u00a0several of the sessions at the conference focused on the philosophical concern with which the tech industry has been wrestling lately \u2014 how and when the internet should be regulated.Oh those\u00a0neo-NazisIn late August, Prince made the decision[1] to drop The Daily Stormer as a Cloudflare customer, essentially exposing the neo-Nazi website to hacker attacks. The move followed a wave of scrutiny and condemnation of The Daily Stormer\u00a0concerning\u00a0its coverage of a white-supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u00a0 Once Cloudflare stopped providing a buffer between the neo-Nazi website and its visitors, The Daily Stormer quickly succumbed to a denial-of-service attack. It's been offline ever since. Prince has said repeatedly that he was uncomfortable and unhappy with his decision to stop protecting\u00a0the website. Since then, Cloudflare has received\u00a03,500 requests to drop support for other sites, Prince told Business Insider at the conference. The company hasn't acceded to any of those requests, but they're an indication\u00a0of what Prince\u00a0sees as\u00a0a slippery slope toward internet censorship.\u00a0 Others at the conference saw the situation similarly. Lee Rowland, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union,\u00a0openly condemned Prince. \"You put censorship blood in the water,\" she said. The First Amendment bars the government from prohibiting speech it doesn't like. But it allows private companies to do what they'd like. As Prince's decision on The Daily Stormer demonstrated, Cloudflare, because of its power, can itself effectively control who gets to speak online.\u00a0 Some conference speakers suggested that we as a society need to figure out how balance the rights of private companies with our concerns about their growing power. In particular, some suggested that\u00a0companies like Cloudflare that provide the basic, foundational layers of internet communications ought to be protected from pressures to\u00a0censor content. One suggestion was that Cloudflare and similar companies should be governed by something like the First Amendment that would prohibit them from restricting speech and require any attempts to use them to curtail speech to\u00a0go through the courts. \"Communications 2.0 makes the First Amendment almost quaint,\" said Rowland. \"The vast majority of speech that we exchange happens online. When it is hosted by private companies, the First Amendment doesn't constrain it.\" She added: \"We have a completely unaccountable private medium of communication.\"The problem with Big Data\u00a0The general consensus in the tech industry is that the government generally shouldn't be able to restrict what content goes online. However, many at the conference thought an exception to that rule might be\u00a0Big Data, and the ability of large corporations to use it to influence public opinion.\u00a0 In a conversation moderated by Prince, famed technology theorist and Harvard Law professor Larry Lessig sat on stage with Darren Bolding, the chief technology officer\u00a0of Cambridge Analytica, the data firm that worked with the Donald Trump's presidential campaign on targeted messaging. The topic was \"Will data destroy democracy?\" Bolding vehemently denied that his work \u2014 using data on past internet activity to target messages to particular voters \u2014 won Trump the election. Instead, he said, targeted messaging is a way of amplifying otherwise marginalized voices.\u00a0 \"I think personalization of information will allow individuals to better communicate with people they know. Rather than have one person broadcasting, you'll have personal relationships,\" Bolding said. \"The dispersion of the central control over the message out to individuals is very powerful.\" Lessig contended\u00a0that the US\u00a0political system has been\u00a0upended by the end of mass media and its replacement with such micro-targeted messages. In last year's election, that development\u00a0may have undermined\u00a0democracy, he said. \"If there's no common ground\u00a0of understanding, that may be good for winning elections, but not for actually governing,\" Lessig said. When it came time for audience questions, one attendee asked if regulation was the best way to prevent Big Data from swinging elections. Another\u00a0asked Bolding where he draws the line on \"absurd racial messages,\"\u00a0highlighting concerns about\u00a0whether Cambridge Analytica, to help Trump win, encouraged racial divisions.\u00a0 Bolding said he didn't believe\u00a0that Cambridge \"pushed any racially charged messaging.\"\u00a0Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017\u00a0Another topic of discussion at the conference was the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017. That bill would amend the Communications Decency Act, a law that protects internet companies including Google and Facebook from being sued or criminally charged over items posted by their users, to allow states to hold internet companies\u00a0legally accountable for content related to sex trafficking.  Historically, large tech companies and digital\u00a0right advocates have steadfastly opposed legislation that would hold internet companies accountable for what their users do on their services. At the conference, speakers Daphne Keller from the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, and Rowland from the ACLU, echoed that view, arguing that the sex-trafficking bill would set a bad precedent and would lead to censorship and the monitoring of internet\u00a0communications.\u00a0 Outside of the conference, however,\u00a0the sex-trafficking bill has found unanticipated\u00a0support from at least one big tech player \u2014\u00a0Oracle. Both the database giant and mass media company 21st Century Fox are backing the bill as part of what The Verge's Sarah Jeong calls[2] a \"proxy war over Google.\"\u00a0 All told, the event made clear that there's no longer a consensus, even in the tech community, that the internet should remain free from regulation.

At the event, CEO Matthew Prince openly discussed his controversial decision to drop a neo-Nazi website as a customer. While attendees largely opposed internet regulation, the feeling wasn't uniform.  Matthew Prince isn't shying away from the internet censorship debate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That was clear this week when\u00a0the CEO of Cloudflare hosted the third annual Internet Summit at his company's San Francisco headquarters. Instead of just concentrating on technology or business issues,\u00a0several of the sessions at the conference focused on the philosophical concern with which the tech industry has been wrestling lately - how and when the internet should be regulated.</p><h>Oh those\u00a0neo-Nazis</h><p>In late August, Prince <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/the-daily-stormer-got-pushed-offline-by-hackers-2017-8?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">made the decision</url> to drop The Daily Stormer as a Cloudflare customer, essentially exposing the neo-Nazi website to hacker attacks. The move followed a wave of scrutiny and condemnation of The Daily Stormer\u00a0concerning\u00a0its coverage of a white-supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u00a0</p><p>Once Cloudflare stopped providing a buffer between the neo-Nazi website and its visitors, The Daily Stormer quickly succumbed to a denial-of-service attack. It's been offline ever since.</p><p>Prince has said repeatedly that he was uncomfortable and unhappy with his decision to stop protecting\u00a0the website. Since then, Cloudflare has received\u00a03,500 requests to drop support for other sites, Prince told Business Insider at the conference. The company hasn't acceded to any of those requests, but they're an indication\u00a0of what Prince\u00a0sees as\u00a0a slippery slope toward internet censorship.\u00a0</p><p>Others at the conference saw the situation similarly. Lee Rowland, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union,\u00a0openly condemned Prince.</p><p>\"You put censorship blood in the water,\" she said.</p><p>The First Amendment bars the government from prohibiting speech it doesn't like. But it allows private companies to do what they'd like. As Prince's decision on The Daily Stormer demonstrated, Cloudflare, because of its power, can itself effectively control who gets to speak online.\u00a0</p><p>Some conference speakers suggested that we as a society need to figure out how balance the rights of private companies with our concerns about their growing power. In particular, some suggested that\u00a0companies like Cloudflare that provide the basic, foundational layers of internet communications ought to be protected from pressures to\u00a0censor content. One suggestion was that Cloudflare and similar companies should be governed by something like the First Amendment that would prohibit them from restricting speech and require any attempts to use them to curtail speech to\u00a0go through the courts.</p><p>\"Communications 2.0 makes the First Amendment almost quaint,\" said Rowland. \"The vast majority of speech that we exchange happens online. When it is hosted by private companies, the First Amendment doesn't constrain it.\"</p><p>She added: \"We have a completely unaccountable private medium of communication.\"</p><h>The problem with Big Data\u00a0</h><p>The general consensus in the tech industry is that the government generally shouldn't be able to restrict what content goes online. However, many at the conference thought an exception to that rule might be\u00a0Big Data, and the ability of large corporations to use it to influence public opinion.\u00a0</p><p>In a conversation moderated by Prince, famed technology theorist and Harvard Law professor Larry Lessig sat on stage with Darren Bolding, the chief technology officer\u00a0of Cambridge Analytica, the data firm that worked with the Donald Trump's presidential campaign on targeted messaging. The topic was \"Will data destroy democracy?\"</p><p>Bolding vehemently denied that his work - using data on past internet activity to target messages to particular voters - won Trump the election. Instead, he said, targeted messaging is a way of amplifying otherwise marginalized voices.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think personalization of information will allow individuals to better communicate with people they know. Rather than have one person broadcasting, you'll have personal relationships,\" Bolding said. \"The dispersion of the central control over the message out to individuals is very powerful.\"</p><p>Lessig contended\u00a0that the US\u00a0political system has been\u00a0upended by the end of mass media and its replacement with such micro-targeted messages. In last year's election, that development\u00a0may have undermined\u00a0democracy, he said.</p><p>\"If there's no common ground\u00a0of understanding, that may be good for winning elections, but not for actually governing,\" Lessig said.</p><p>When it came time for audience questions, one attendee asked if regulation was the best way to prevent Big Data from swinging elections. Another\u00a0asked Bolding where he draws the line on \"absurd racial messages,\"\u00a0highlighting concerns about\u00a0whether Cambridge Analytica, to help Trump win, encouraged racial divisions.\u00a0</p><p>Bolding said he didn't believe\u00a0that Cambridge \"pushed any racially charged messaging.\"\u00a0</p><h>Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017\u00a0</h><p>Another topic of discussion at the conference was the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017. That bill would amend the Communications Decency Act, a law that protects internet companies including Google and Facebook from being sued or criminally charged over items posted by their users, to allow states to hold internet companies\u00a0legally accountable for content related to sex trafficking.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Historically, large tech companies and digital\u00a0right advocates have steadfastly opposed legislation that would hold internet companies accountable for what their users do on their services. At the conference, speakers Daphne Keller from the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, and Rowland from the ACLU, echoed that view, arguing that the sex-trafficking bill would set a bad precedent and would lead to censorship and the monitoring of internet\u00a0communications.\u00a0</p><p>Outside of the conference, however,\u00a0the sex-trafficking bill has found unanticipated\u00a0support from at least one big tech player -\u00a0Oracle. Both the database giant and mass media company 21st Century Fox are backing the bill as part of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16308066/sex-trafficking-bill-sesta-google-cda-230\">what The Verge's Sarah Jeong calls</url> a \"proxy war over Google.\"\u00a0</p><p>All told, the event made clear that there's no longer a consensus, even in the tech community, that the internet should remain free from regulation.</p><p>NOW WATCH: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mysterious-white-stripes-on-chicken-affect-meat-quality-2017-8?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">What those mysterious white stripes on chicken are - and what it means for cooking</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Also:</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tower-meeting-russia-money-laundering-investigation-2017-9?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">New details about major Russian money-laundering investigation raise the stakes of Trump Tower meeting</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/abandoned-mcmansion-neighborhood-in-canada-photos-2017-5?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Eerie photos show a neighborhood of abandoned million-dollar McMansions</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-donation-aims-to-help-oakland-student-immigrants-refugees-2017-9?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Salesforce aims to help immigrant students with donations to San Francisco, Oakland schools</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEE ALSO:\u00a0Cloudflare CEO explains his emotional decision to punt The Daily Stormer and subject it to hackers: I woke up 'in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the Internet'</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISIUS-59bc019e38d20d41188b660b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISIUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VD6-R9D1-DXY7-W03J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465531</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1140\"/><timeReceived>09:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Insider Inc.

Here are the top three winners and a couple of laggards going into a nervous week with all eyes now riveted on the July 30-31 meeting of the Federal Reserve: 1) Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc.[2](Nasdaq:ACHN)led advancing issues last week, skyrocketing 95% to $4.65. The huge upward blast followed the New Haven, CT-based biotech's announcement ofpositive results from a Phase 1 clinical studyfor experimental oral factor D inhibitor ACH-5228. Some analysts said irrational exuberance was afoot with Achillion investors. After all, the results were only from an early-stage study. </p><p>There's a long way to go before ACH-5228 has a shot at winning regulatory approval. Investors were evidently enthralled over the potential for ACH-5228 to be a best-in-class inhibitor of the alternative pathway (AP) that's crucial in fighting immune diseases. However, good news for this early-stage pipeline candidate also appeared to boost investors' enthusiasm about Achillion's first-generation factor D inhibitor,danicopan (also known as ACH-4471). Achillion plans to initiate a Phase 3 clinical study of danicopan in early 2020. If all goes well, the biotech could be on track to launch its first drug. 2) Elsewhere, Harvard Bioscience Inc.[3] (Nasdaq:HBIO) surged 38% to $2.70 after its second-quarter earnings reflected an improved financial condition as the company focuses on improving its underlying performance.Second-quarter revenue of $29.6 million was a 6% decrease from the prior year quarter, but the Holliston, MA-based scientific instrument manufacturer slashed its net loss to $200,000 after losing $1.5 million the prior year.On a per share basis, the net loss was $0.01 for the quarter, compared to $0.04 for last year's quarter. Jim Green,named Chairman and CEO on July 8, said the company can do better despite results in-line with the company's guidance.He said the company is shifting to focus on lowering expenses and improving revenue and gross margin growth. As such, acquisitions in the near term are put on hold while previous acquisitions are integrated.Harvard Bioscience bills itself as is a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of solutions to advance life science. 3) And Anika Therapeutics Inc.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.anikatherapeutics.com/(Nasdaq:ANIK)raced\">https://www.anikatherapeutics.com/(Nasdaq:ANIK)raced</url> 37% to $55.85. The Bedford, MA-based biotech, which focuses primarily on pain management, tissue regeneration and wound care,announced positive second-quarter results. Anika's revenue and earnings actually declined from the prior-year period. However, the company handily beat Wall Street analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom lines.The smaller the company, the greater the bounce its stock receives from good news. In Anika's case, the biotech didn't just beat analysts' estimates, it demolished them. Anika reported Q2 revenue 10.5% higher than what Wall Street expected. Its earnings per share in the second quarter came in 72% higher than the consensus analyst estimate. That's the kind of earnings beat that can fire up investors. 4) But Neuralstem Inc.[4] (Nasdaq:CUR) plunged 59% to $2.39 after pricingits second underwritten public offering of 2,777,777 units at $2.70 per unit for gross proceeds of ~$7.5M. Each unit comprises one share of common stock, one short-term warrant to purchase one share of common stock and one long-term warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Shares were trading at $8.50 on July 18\u2014-a drop of an eye-watering 719% the past two weeks. The additional, staggering dilution crushed shares. The estimated net proceeds of ~$6.6M will be used for the further development of stem cell and small molecule assets, advancement of the company's acquisition and in-licensing strategy and general corporate purposes. Rockville, MD-based Neuralstem, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the research and development of nervous system therapies based on its proprietary human neuronal stem cells and small molecule compounds. 5) And Align Technology Inc.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aligntech.com/(Nasdaq:ALGN)\">https://www.aligntech.com/(Nasdaq:ALGN)</url> slumped 29% to $198.84. The maker of the popular Invisalign brand of braces, issued a profit warning last week when it reported its latest sales and earnings figures. San Jose, CA-based Align said slowing demand in China was one of the primary reasons for the weak outlook. 'Given the uncertainty in China, our outlook for the third quarter reflects a more cautious view for growth in the Asia Pacific region,' Align CEO Joe Hogan said. Although Align shipped fewer Invisalign cases than it had expected, Hogan added that the company still views China as a major market opportunity. More than 40% of the nearly 2,000 doctors in Asia the company trained last quarter were in China, Hogan noted. China's slumping economy has hurt a number of industries, ranging from Big Tech to manufacturing. We can now add dental equipment companies to the list.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mondaymorning.com/2019/08/06/with-wall-streets-attention-fixated-on-the-congressional-testimony-of-former-special-counsel-robert-mueller-medical-stocks-quietly-rise-from-the-ashes-well-mostly/#\">https://mondaymorning.com/2019/08/06/with-wall-streets-attention-fixated-on-the-congressional-testimony-of-former-special-counsel-robert-mueller-medical-stocks-quietly-rise-from-the-ashes-well-mostly/#</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pixabay.com/users/tyguy999/\">https://pixabay.com/users/tyguy999/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.achillion.com\">https://www.achillion.com</url>/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.harvardbioscience.com\">https://www.harvardbioscience.com</url>/ [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.neuralstem.com\">https://www.neuralstem.com</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-MOMO1020441565070360635251763300190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MOMO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-D751-F03R-N4JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><timeReceived>5:46 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MondayMorning</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 6, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009RNK</classCode><className>ACHILLION PHARMACEUTICALS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002JFE</classCode><className>HARVARD BIOSCIENCE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC00026U9</classCode><className>ANIKA THERAPEUTICS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS334516 ANALYTICAL LABORATORY INSTRUMENT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC3826 LABORATORY ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC3821 LABORATORY APPARATUS &amp;

If you're in the market for some insight into tech, a subscription to this newsletter is a worthy acquisition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lackquisitions</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A consensus is emerging in Washington: Big Tech is too big, and lax regulators helped it get that way. Facebook and Google bulked up with their acquisitions of Instagram and YouTube, and now they're untameable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The last time American antitrust regulators lasered in on a big tech company \u2014 Microsoft, two decades ago \u2014 Silicon Valley cheered. And certainly there will be some who applaud Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page getting their comeuppance. (Yelp, for one, has been talking about the evils of Google since as long as I can remember.)</p><p> But if antitrust enforcers really slow down tech's startup-acquisition machine, there may be unintended and far-reaching consequences \u2014 good for some, bad for others.</p><p> For the past decade or so, Big Tech has offered a safety net for startups: If you have well-connected founders and a decent bench of engineers, someone will buy you just to get its hands on your employees. And if you have a social-networking app with a glimmer of a following, all the better: Facebook will snap you up just to shut it down.</p><p> It's a heads-you-win, tails-you-win scenario that has had venture capitalists and startup founders breathing easy. There's always a Big Tech bailout waiting in the wings.</p><p> The New York Times recently reported that Facebook passed on the acquisition of Houseparty, maker of a group video chat app, over concerns it wouldn't get past the antitrust cops. Epic Games, the maker of popular video game \"Fortnite,\" bought it instead. It's a rare turnabout for a company that bought would-be rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and tried to buy Snapchat maker Snap Inc.</p><p>Google seems to have been less active in acquisitions recently, aside from its $2.6 billion Looker deal. But it got away with plenty. Besides YouTube, it got to buy DoubleClick and AdMob to beef up its online advertising services without much fuss.</p><p> The logic of these acquisitions is two-fold: They're sometimes called \"acquihires,\" short for \"acquire-hires.\" Big tech companies can't hire fast enough, so buying companies for their teams is a tool for mass recruitment. And there's strategy, too \u2014 mostly about strangling potential competitors when they're too young for anyone to notice or complain.</p><p> So what does it mean if antitrust cops put the brakes on this acquisition gravy train? For the truly brave entrepreneurs willing to compete with the giants, it could be a good thing, since they may face less pressure from investors to sell out.</p><p> But it's also possible that investors will do the rational thing and be less willing to back startups. Roelof Botha, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital \u2014 which profited handsomely from this trend, having backed YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 explicitly mentioned the possibility of selling YouTube in his memo pitching the investment to partners.</p><p> I remember watching in a small room in a downtown San Francisco high-rise as Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified at a Department of Corporations hearing about his startup's sale to Facebook. Because Instagram's 19 shareholders were all in California, only state officials, not the Securities and Exchange Commission, needed to give it clearance. After some brief remarks, regulators declared the transaction \"just, fair and equitable\" \u2014 and Systrom, much wealthier, would spend the next six years in Zuckerberg's service. (He quit Instagram in October to pursue flying lessons.)</p><p> A less acquisitive valley would be a big change from the past decade. It will probably cause some serious recalculations in South of Market and on Sand Hill Road. Will it result in a healthier tech sector? That's the big and unknowable question.</p><p> \u2014 Owen Thomas, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:othomas@sfchronicle.com\">othomas@sfchronicle.com</email></p><p> Quote of the week</p><p> \"What Twitter represents is spiritual to me.\"  \u2014 Jack Dorsey, to fitness podcaster Rich Roll</p><p> Coming up</p><p>Cisco, which just reported layoffs to the state of California, reveals its earnings Wednesday.</p><p> What I'm reading</p><p> Luke Kurtis spent $15,000 on Apple services over the past 11 years.

This article takes on the question of how surveillance and the technologies profiling migrants at borders impact trafficked people. The 1990s presented seemingly contradictory images in the United States' approach to border control and migration: one gestured towards creating free trade throughout North America under the North American Free Trade Agreement (1994), and the other created a rhetoric of war in which migration from the southern US border was presented as an 'invasion'. Such imaginings of the border supported state arguments for policing and the building of physical structures that collectively ensured a very specific goal: controlling migration.1 Immigrants experienced the consequence of such responses in which migration was made more difficult.2 In an effort to lobby public support for border surveillance and control, advocates promoting tighter border control policies portrayed the border region as a 'dangerous, out-of-control place, putting residents of the interior at mortal risk'.3</p><p>The control of immigration as a means to construct what and who counts as human in the US has meant billions of dollars are invested into surveillance equipment such as night-vision goggles, seismic sensors, low-light CCTV cameras, high-tech aircraft for nocturnal detection, helicopters, fixed-wing aircrafts, and electronic systems. As stated by Eithne Lubh\u00e9id, 'Immigration control is not just a powerful symbol of nationhood and people but also a means to literally construct the nation and the people in particular ways.'4 Although physical walls re-emerged in US discourse during the 2016 presidential debates, there was prior investment in a 'virtual wall' through the Secure Border Initiative Network (SBInet), an effort that was discontinued in 2010.5 In spite of SBInet being in hiatus, Jeh Johnson, former US Secretary of Homeland Security, framed it as: 'Surveillance technology is the wave of the future.'6</p><p>The advancements in technologies have resulted in increased policing, where border enforcement agents are spending less time tracking and watching and more time on law enforcement activities.7 These technologies of surveillance and security have further constructed and reinforced migrant 'illegality'.8 Although some technology and immigration control measures are put in place to prevent human trafficking, research shows that restrictive immigration practices actually create the conditions that make migrants vulnerable to being trafficked,9 especially when relying on smuggling networks, or refraining from reporting crimes like human trafficking due to their irregular status or fear of deportation.10</p><p>State anxieties about national security, migration and human trafficking have authorised enhanced surveillance practices that utilise ubiquitous technologies11- not unlike in the 'War on Terror'12-wiretaps, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) tracking devices, state issued identification (i.e., the US REAL ID Act of 2005 created new federal standards for identification that also led to tighter policies making it more difficult for asylum seekers), and monitoring records such as travel, telephone, money and financial transactions.13 These practices reproduce state-based monitoring through systems of evidence gathering, carceral enforcement, and militarised response. In 2015, the US military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) used Memex, in collaboration with seventeen contractors, to monitor the Dark Web.14 Memex investigates the Deep Web, also referred to as 'Dark Web' or 'Undernet',15 for criminalised activities, including human trafficking.16</p><p>The rhetorical strategies and policy implications of policing borders and migration have turned the border into a '\"zone of indistinction\" in which undocumented entrants are rendered exposed and expendable \"bare life\"'.17 Although the increased technologies and militarisation of the US-Mexico border have been ongoing since the 1990s, migrants continue to cross risking violence, trafficking and even death.18 Through advanced technologies and public discourse on the border, it is apparent that US law enforcement, policymakers, social services, and anti-trafficking stakeholders are imagining a 'homeland' where 'border security is the responsibility of Customs and Border Protection. And that national security is everyone's responsibility.'19 These imaginings of the homeland have propagated 'discourses of emergency' which are part of a 'risk management program designed to extract profit from projections of an ever-susceptible border'.20</p><p>The securitisation of borders through technological advancements and surveillance of migrants in carceral anti-trafficking strategies problematically re-reinforce whose body is encoded as innocent (whiteness as innocent).21 Therefore, there is a need to deepen the analysis of technology and human trafficking and how technological responses to immigration are impacting human trafficking survivors and antitrafficking response. As aptly stated by Jennifer Musto and danah boyd, 'A close examination of the trafficking-technology nexus and the sociotechnical interventions initiated on behalf of victims of trafficking in the United States also gestures toward broader tensions that undergird anti-trafficking politics, especially the tenuous lines and perpetually contested boundaries that exist between security and surveillance, protection and punishment, and safety and social control.'22</p><p>In this paper, I build upon the dynamic discussions regarding the technologyhuman trafficking nexus to show, through a multi-part analysis,23 how migrant labourers are experiencing this nexus through what Aimee Bahng refers to as a 'homeland futurity'. A homeland futurity encompasses policies, practices, and rhetorical strategies deployed by the state that furthers the belief of an 'alien invasion' to garner support for the militarisation of the border. Consequently, citizens, the state, migrants, and trafficked migrants alike, make decisions about their material present based on the narratives they have constructed about the future.24</p><p>The consequences of homeland futurities are not abstract. Following the theoretical framing, I offer an analysis of how a homeland futurity has material consequence for trafficked migrant labourers caused by migrant policing. This is accomplished through thematic analysis of qualitative data collected during interviews and focus groups conducted in San Francisco. I show how this global city furthers rhetorical strategies of danger and risk management, which are complicated by the fact that it serves as the epicentre of technological advancements for a homeland futurity that consequently displaces trafficked people and marginalised communities. However, migrant labourers and collaborators are resisting homeland futurities by enacting migrant futures through the use of technology. Following the discussion of San Francisco, I examine Contratados.org as an exemplar for how anti-traffickers are using technology to counter a homeland futurity by facilitating opportunities by and for migrant labourers.</p><p>Homeland Futurities</p><p>Anti-trafficking responses often further a homeland futurity. Nation-states implement policies, practices, and rhetorical strategies to further beliefs of danger at the border; these endeavours include the use of technology, which for the trafficking survivor is not without consequence. Within state-sponsored antitrafficking efforts, the border is remade and actions authorised through discursive-yet empirically questionable-heightened state authority. For example, in his 2019 remarks on the control of the southern US border, President Trump offered a particular kind of speculation with regard to the absence of a wall: 'They say walls don't work. Walls work 100 percent... you can't take human traffic-women and girls-you can't take them through ports of entry. You can't have them tied up in the back seat of a car or a truck or a van. They open the door, they look. If they can't see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied. They go through areas where you have no wall. Everybody knows that.'25</p><p>The Trump administration exemplifies how US discourse on human trafficking remakes the border as an imagined terrain where criminality and criminalised activities like human trafficking occur, and which, in turn, legitimises its containment. Trump's remarks painted a picture of the US-Mexico border as defined by invasion and threat that simultaneously erases indigeneity. Therefore, a homeland futurity is an imperial one that furthers a capitalist agenda that contains 'risk'26 through militarised responses. In the human trafficking, technology, and immigration nexus, trafficking is used to authorise state-based efforts to further a homeland futurity. Notions of homeland futurities are not limited to the United States. Speculations of risk at a country's borders are delineated in studies and news coverage regarding the risks at borders in regions such as Eastern Europe,27 or country-specific sites such as Venezuela.28 Furthermore, homeland futurities are not limited to the leadership of a country, but necessitate the participation of citizens and non-citizens alike. US anti-trafficking responses have furthered a hegemony of a homeland futurity that has implications for social and legal responses to trafficking in localised contexts. In the next section, I offer a discussion based on interviews with migrant labourers, survivors, service providers, and lawyers that highlights the everyday implications of a homeland futurity on trafficked people in a global city like San Francisco.</p><p>Implications of Homeland Futurities in Anti-Trafficking Response</p><p>In 2018, I led a study on the needs of survivors of violence in San Francisco, California, with a particular focus on human trafficking, intimate partner violence and sexual assault.29 Another central story cohered through the interviews with migrant survivors was how homeland futurities had real-life ramifications for them and organisations supporting them. A homeland futurity manifests in localised contexts in the form of anti-migrant policing and structures that protect businesses developing homeland futurity technologies, consequently creating conditions of precarity for migrants, trafficked survivors, and vulnerable communities.</p><p>San Francisco is a hub for many technology companies and the workers who support those industries. Yet, gross income inequality impacting migrant labourers and the working poor perseveres. San Francisco is considered one of the most important cities for new technology.30 In 2017, a year before the study commenced, there were 673 human trafficking survivors identified by 22 different agencies in San Francisco.31 Migrants in San Francisco are viewed as welcome, comprising 35 per cent of the population,32 and the city is recognised as providing sanctuary to undocumented migrants. Nevertheless, technological advancements in the city could not be separated from the tools needed to secure borders, enact surveillance, and control and contain people that, in effect, also displaced the most marginalised-trafficked migrants, the working poor, and the marginally housed.</p><p>The raw data for this article was obtained through citywide needs assessment of survivors of violence, including twelve focus groups (n=93) and thirty-nine individual interviews that were audio recorded (53.5 hours) and transcribed verbatim. Participants were recruited from thirty-six organisations, with 40 per cent of the participants identifying as survivors of human trafficking, sexual assault and intimate partner violence. In addition to survivors, participants included professionals who were social service providers, medical providers, attorneys, community-based organisation workers, and government workers. Interviews and focus groups were conducted in Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. To examine how homeland futurities emerged, thematic analysis was applied to the interviews where survivors spoke explicitly about human trafficking. The qualitative data was coded for themes reflecting migration and homeland futurities, in particular key words representing danger, displacement, immigration climate, and risk management.</p><p>Two seemingly contrasting imaginings of migrants were furthered in San Francisco: the perception of migrants as dangerous and the danger migrants face. As an immigration attorney conveyed,</p><p>Regardless of all the protections and laws and regulations that make us a sanctuary jurisdiction, people are telling us they're afraid to send their children to school... They're afraid to go to work. They're afraid to seek medical care. They're afraid to go to court. So that has been another overarching theme that's been really difficult.</p><p>The discourse of danger described by the migrants and service providers was not only a mechanism of containment at the border, but a means to contain migrants even within the places they call home. As Sara,33 a Latina migrant survivor said, 'The only thing I know is that people have been telling me that if somebody knocks on the door, do not open the door. And if somebody is asking questions, not to answer.' She shared with me a pocket card that she kept in her wallet. The pocket card stated the following:</p><p>I do not wish to speak with you, answer your questions, or sign or hand you any documents based on my 5th Amendment rights under the United States Constitution.</p><p>I do not give you permission to enter my home based on my 4th Amendment rights under the United States Constitution unless you have a warrant to enter, signed by a judge or magistrate with my name on it and that you slide under the door. I do not give you permission to search any of my belongings based on my 5th Amendment rights.</p><p>I choose to exercise my constitutional rights.</p><p>These Cards are available to citizens and noncitizens alike.44</p><p>Sara chose not to disclose who gave her the card. Her pocket card illuminated how even trafficked migrants live with a particular homeland futurity that comprises of everyday surveillance. However, facing restrictive migration policy and practice was also met with resistance: instead of opening her front door and drawing back the window curtains, migrants like Sara were keeping them closed to minimise neighbourly suspicion. Like Sara, other migrant labourers were holding the pocket cards on their bodies and were shutting themselves in, asserting constitutional rights. The migrant survivors highlighted how they were defined by a homeland futurity where notions of danger were part of their everyday reality. Their descriptions included fears about reporting violence and a lack of trust in the police. For some trafficked migrants, this also meant the enhanced risk of deportation.</p><p>Technological innovations furthering a nation state's vision of a homeland futurity are masked by a narrative of wealth. San Francisco's 2018 annual budget was approximately USD 11 billion. However, despite the economic growth from technological innovation, migrant labourers, US citizen-survivors of human trafficking, and the working poor experience material consequences of displacement. In spite of the city's wealth, homelessness grew approximately 30 per cent between 2017 and 2019.35 As Q, a queer youth of colour survivor conveyed:</p><p>The main problem is mental health and housing, especially in the city. Money is the problem here. That's why so many people are homeless... The root issue is housing and money for a lot of us for being black, brown, trans, queer, disabled. We have all of these intersections and what the city cares about is what? Money, white people, and tech.</p><p>What Q's reflection helps to underscore is that technological advancements have occurred alongside migrant and vulnerable communities' heightened displacement and economic precarity. The contradictions are apparent: the technological advancements in San Francisco and Silicon Valley mean that the wealthy companies create the tools needed to secure borders, enact surveillance, and control and contain people. As these aspects of a homeland futurity are furthered, the risks for migrants who seek work and refuge in the United States are also increased, effectively preventing them and other marginalised communities from accessing basic needs such as housing. While there is 'so much money'36 in San Francisco, the future of the city is foreclosed to migrants whose legality, means of employment, racialisation, and national origins are perceived as a risk in a context that seeks to manage risk. The consequence of a homeland futurity is that migrants remain silent about everyday exploitation37 when they are cheated out of their wages, work in dangerous conditions, and are trafficked.</p><p>In spite of the city's wealth, narratives of uncertainty and scarcity proliferate for trafficked migrants and the service providers working to support them. As one Asian survivor, Amy, conveyed, 'There is a perception that there's a limited amount of benefits... If there's a limited amount of benefits, then the more people you have to share it amongst, you might get a smaller cut of it.' In this scarcity, migrant survivors are pushed to the margins, living in parts of cities that are underresourced. In living on the margins, the wealth of a city like San Francisco cannot be separated from processes that manage risk.</p><p>Risk management in a homeland futurity is fostered through systems of bureaucracy. Mechanisms of bureaucracy create an image of a structure that is organised, orderly, and hierarchically determined. For migrant survivors this means lengthy wait times while navigating legal systems and accessing social services. Migrant labourers, in spite of experiencing trafficking and abuse, are compelled to participate in systems that reduce their own identities into data through participation in a system of biometrics. Take, for example, an Asian migrant survivor, Jennifer, who, in order to apply for immigration relief, was required to have her fingerprints taken as part of the mechanisms of biometrics, an automated recognition system of identity management facilitated by the Department of Homeland Security. Jennifer described her frustration of working with bureaucracies:</p><p>I found out the most important is legal aid. And sometimes my lawyer does not reply to me for three to four months. I don't know what happened... I feel so, so helpless. I don't know what to do and I don't know what is my next step. And I need to do the fingerprint [biometrics].</p><p>These bureaucracies extend beyond the legal realm into social services. Sofia, a Latina migrant survivor, stated, 'It's hard because you have to repeat everything, you have to tell them over, and then you feel like it's a waste of time. I feel like it should be faster, it should be immediate.' This expectation of immediacy is at odds with immigration bureaucracies which are not mechanisms for access, but for regulation.38 The advancements of technology and systems of bureaucracy in immigration control have created a kind of 'homeland futurity' that furthers a different type of violence. The violence of such systems is not simply that migrants wait long hours, but that the bureaucratic system itself is a mechanism of homeland futurity that relegates migrants to a bare life-waiting for extended periods to work legally, to connect with family, and to receive any benefits in a system that for some may take years to come. Without having their basic needs met-housing, food, medicines, and resources-migrants are relegated to subsisting on very little, or surviving through informal work. Migrant survivors regularly described the arduous process of trying to find shelter in San Francisco and living in sub-par, even outright inhumane conditions (i.e., rat-infested or bedbugs-infested homes), as they waited on a long waitlist for housing. The consequence of a risk management society has meant that migrant survivors are unable to afford living in a costly place like San Francisco, and are regularly viewed with suspicion when looking for housing.</p><p>The effect of scarcity and fear in current US national policy responses to the border have created an imagined 'perfect victim'39 at the 'dangerous border'. This is facilitated through 'immigration fear' where the 'immigration situation' impacts migrants' access to resources. As described by Sue, an immigration attorney, the US political climate and Trump administration are impacting survivors: 'Five years ago ... our clients [were] not as stressed about public benefits. You know, and they [did] not, I believe, have to wait as long for the pieces to be approved as compared to now because of new federal immigration policies. The [current] political landscape is very different.' Additionally, the strict visa policies mean that migrants are unable to work, earn an income, receive services, and access housing, creating conditions of vulnerability to trafficking.</p><p>Through discussing a homeland futurity, organisations, individuals, and antitrafficking responders are also resisting such determinations through speculations of a future that centre a migrant futurity. Such practices that utilised technology to create a counter speculation are illuminated in the organisation called Contratados (Contracted). Contratados is a US-based organisation created in 2013 which exemplifies how anti-traffickers can use technology to counter homeland futurity. In the next section, I analyse a particular venture where migrants use mobile and web technology to enact migrant futures as a means to prevent exploitation and empower survivors.</p><p>Migrant Futurity through Contratados</p><p>In October 2014, Centro de Los Derechos Del Migrante Inc. (Center for the Rights of Migrants-CDM) launched Contratados.org, which allows migrant labourers to anonymously rate employers.40 CDM had found that migrant workers often do not have access to computer-based Internet at home but were accessing the web through mobile phones and Internet cafes.41 In an interview with She Innovates, Rachel Micah-Jones, Executive Director of CDM, illuminates a kind of migrant futurity through the platform, when she states: 'Contratados.org, our Yelp++ for migrant workers, is changing the balance of power for migrants. Contratados pools collective worker knowledge and displays it alongside publicly available data culled from various sources. This transparency gives workers unprecedented power to make informed lifechanging decisions.'42 This means that migrants can use the platform to make decisions regarding work opportunities. In 2018, Contratados was selected as one of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 'Work of the Future Solver' teams, where the platform was described as 'allow[ing] workers to share anonymous information on workplace and recruitment abuses, access rights education materials, and view job opportunities through specific job boards'.43 Contratados is envisioned as being Yelp, plus Glassdoor and Indeed, with 'information and resources'.44</p><p>The website is in Spanish and can be translated into English for English-preferred language users. Posts by users are like a bulletin and the organisation does not alter them for legal reasons, or it would be responsible for what goes on the website.45 Contratados user posts are publicly accessible, where one can find employers (text coded in blue) and employment agencies (text coded in pink). Data from migrant labourers is supplemented by publicly available data. At its creation, the web platform was piloted with 280,000 workers in the US.46 By 2018, Contratados had provided resources and information to more than 500,000 migrants, leading to the organisation aiding 6,780 migrant workers with their legal and social needs.47</p><p>Contratados is unique in that it was co-created by migrant workers and allows them to generate content. As a homeland futurity contains 'threats' through surveillance technologies, organisations like Contratados are utilising technology to resist the relegation of migrant labourers to social death and prevent migrants from entering conditions that may lead to trafficking, by creating information sharing on work and rights across the United States. While this alone is not sufficient to resist a homeland futurity, it is an exemplar of an endeavour in which migrant futurities are possible. Recalling Amy who described scarcity of resources, Contratados provides a contrasting image of a range of jobs across the country.</p><p>Through platforms like Contratados, migrants are able to find work, resources and information through user and community generated input. It is this type of technology that makes possible migrant futurity-type of future visioning that shapes present conditions and allows one to imagine a future beyond homeland futurities. The website enables migrants to make decisions to not utilise a company that has a poor review. In one of the 194 jobs posted to the website, one worker describes their experience with an au pair company in San Francisco as follows:</p><p>They promised me that I was going to live a total American experience with the family and I am a maid in the house ... I worked for the first three weeks without ... rest ... I worked 16 hours a day. The agency did not help me at all ... The family promised me to use a car and when I arrived they restricted me ... It is a form of modern slavery. Very dangerous.48</p><p>This au pair company received one star; by contrast, a bakery in San Francisco received an anonymous perfect score of 5 stars.49</p><p>Contratados allows workers to have information at their fingertips, whereas bureaucracies and state-based agencies may be slow, as Sofia had pointed out. The website includes know your rights information, information on visas, work conditions, sexual harassment, and retaliation. Additionally, the website's resources for workplace and recruitment problems are made readily available and workers can contact CDM for direct legal representation and litigation support.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>I have illuminated in this article why it is essential for critical anti-trafficking scholars and activists to understand how surveillance technologies and nation-state responses to borders and human trafficking cohere to further a 'homeland futurity'. Understanding how homeland futurities seek to present a vision and practices about the future of a country through frames of danger, risk management, datafication, and displacement, is central to imagining and articulating new modalities of response to violence including human trafficking. At the same time, it is incorrect to suggest that all technological creations negatively impact trafficked migrants. This article is an invitation to the reader to understand how technological creations can enable responses to human trafficking that do not further a homeland futurity.</p><p>It is incumbent on anti-traffickers to take into account the real-life implications of a country's rhetorical and policy decisions regarding immigration. The responses to contain 'threats' and focus on 'danger' have implications for trafficked migrants. As seen in the context of San Francisco, migrant labourers are impacted by responses to further a nation's interest to protect its borders. Homeland futurities are not unique to the United States. Countries around the world are ramping up their immigration policies and practices to regulate and control an imagined future through surveillance, securitisation, and bureaucracy. Italy's former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini enacted policies to fine the owners of migrant rescue ships through a 'security decree';50 Mexico enacted raids of migrants to avoid US tariffs;51 and the Australian government sought to pass legislation that would expand character test provisions, in effect, setting up policy that would increase the number of people facing deportation.52</p><p>While not all migrants are trafficked, it is pressing for critical anti-trafficking scholars and activists to pay attention and be responsive to national narratives on migration that further a homeland futurity as it impacts trafficked people, who are the most vulnerable. As delineated in the case example of San Francisco, technologies that create everyday surveillance further a discourse of danger. The technologies of homeland futurities impact all migrants, including those who experience exploitation during or after crossing a national border. Additionally, it is essential for critical human trafficking scholars to contend with homeland futurities and the intersection of migration and trafficking in these precarious times. For if the future is imagined as bleak, dangerous, to be contained, securitised, and controlled, trafficked migrants, regardless of the conditions that led to their abuse, will also be impacted along with their family and community. However, the goal is not to be anti-technology when examining the human traffickingtechnology nexus. Technologies created by and for migrant labourers, and in collaboration with leaders and organisers, make possible a migrant futurity. Contratados is an example of how anti-traffickers can create technologies that counter a homeland futurity by collaborating with migrant survivors.</p><p>Acknowledgements: I extend my deep appreciation to the participants of the study in San Francisco, survivors, service providers, Carol Sacco and Dr Emily Murase of the San Francisco Department on the Status of Women, Dr Lindsay Gezinski, my former student Elizabeth Boley, Women of Color Academics at the University of Utah, Dr Hokulani Aikau, Dr Ashley Cordes, Dr Richard Medina, and the Geography Department at the University of Utah.

The paper debunks the main misconceptions that are associated with this \u201ctechlash\u201d and identifies several recommended actions and policy principles which WITSA believes can rekindle faith and trust in the technology industry for the betterment and delivery of the promise of the digital Age where everyone on earth benefits from the use of information and communications technology (ICT).The paper addresses several important subjects, including anti-trust and competition concerns, privacy concerns, disinformation and election integrity. The paper argues that while politicians around the world are increasingly calling on regulators to break up the largest Internet companies, break-up cases are by far the most difficult type of antitrust action and should be avoided whenever possible. </p><p>Before governments initiate a time-consuming and costly trust-busting crusade, they should begin with a competition policy agenda that delivers immediate, tangible results. Broader antitrust questions, if they are to be addressed, require a collaborative international effort.The paper also takes issue with critics that equate big tech with \u201csurveillance capitalism,\u201d the idea that pervasive data collection such as tracking on websites, is eroding all privacy online. However, building and maintaining trust and confidence between all users of the Internet is one of the fundamental building blocks of the Digital Age and all stakeholders have a role to play in building this trust ecosystem. To that end, WITSA advocates a principled approach, which recognizes information privacy as a fundamental human right, and seeks to balance this in context with equally important policy objectives of national security and data protection while maintaining the economic and social capability of digital information.The paper acknowledges that, in the digital era, false content has been amplified through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok and YouTube by fearmongers, Internet trolls and election-meddlers to widen social fissures, undermine democracy and strengthen authoritarian regimes by spreading content that intends to deceive, mislead ormanipulate. However, rather than rushing to create a new framework for regulating speech online, and risk inadvertently harming legitimate speech or reducing the effectiveness of industry\u2019s takedown mechanisms, the paper calls on policymakers to work with the private sector to improve such mechanisms, while ensuring platforms have moderation policies that protect free speech.\u201cOver the past few decades, innovation in ICT has brought about untold benefits and transformed millions of lives in amazing ways,\u201d, stated WITSA\u2019s Secretary General Dr. Jim Poisant. \u201cGoing forward, policymakers should understand that most people see technology as an essential and valuable part of their lives, and that they seek and desire new innovations and improvements\u2014but that where there are challenges and issues, government acts in a limited and responsible manner to deal with the problems at hand in a manner which cause the least possible harm to competitiveness, innovation, or consumer welfare. Industry stands ready to work with governments everywhere,\u201d continued Dr. Poisant.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMFNNW-IFN4410607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMFNNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPY-8Y41-F0YC-N36M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact Financial News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56566\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But you'd think he has some medical background the way he rants about hydroxychloroquine[1] being the magic bullet to cure coronavirus despite the fact that studies have been varied and inconclusive. He still won't shut up about it.In his July 28 WorldNetDaily column[2], he actually demanded that President Trump issue an executive order promoting hydroxychloroquine:Liberal, anti-Trump tech monopolies are on the rampage with their modern equivalent of book burning. Twitter suspended the account of the president's son, Don Jr., because he dared to tweet out information favorable to HCQ, and Twitter deleted retweets by the president, too.Amid this blatant censorship, it is time for President Trump to go directly to the American people. </p><p>By executive order he should command release of the more than 50 million doses of HCQ that are being withheld from the public in the Strategic National Stockpile.President Trump should also order his secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Alex Azar, to post updated lists of where the public can access COVID medication without interference by Never-Trumpers and comrades of Anthony Fauci, who has again disparaged the effectiveness of HCQ despite its success in numerous studies and many countries for treating COVID.President Trump was right to retweet complaints about interference by Democrats with timely, early treatment for COVID. The election may hinge on whether people are allowed to obtain early treatment for the disease, and blocking access interferes with Trump's reelection.Schlafly also went on an anti-vaxxer tear, dismissing a possible coronavirus vaccine as \"liberal fool's gold\" and bragged about how his fellow right-wingers have claimed they won't get a vaccine -- even though a vaccine would be better protection against COVID-19 than hydroxychloroquine. In his Aug. 4 column[3], Schlafly remembered the late Herman Cain, touting how he \"spoke out against the political interference with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as an effective preventive and early medication for COVID-19, and despite tweets from the hospital there is no indication that he timely received that beneficial treatment.\" He didn't mention the possibility that Cain contracted coronavirus at a June rally Trump held in Tulsa.Instead, he ranted further about HCQ:At age only 74, he was younger than the Democratic nominee Joe Biden who undoubtedly would receive essential early treatment to overcome COVID-19 if Biden ever does contract it. Biden would not languish in a hospital for weeks as Boris Johnson and Herman Cain did, with Cain tragically not surviving.Georgia continues to interfere with the use of HCQ to treat victims of the Wuhan virus, by enforcing unprecedented regulations written especially to block access to this medication. Liberal bureaucrats in Georgia imposed an emergency regulation to prohibit access to HCQ by Herman Cain and others unless the prescription has a diagnosis \"consistent with the evidence for its use.\"According to the opponents of Donald Trump (and Herman Cain), that regulation prevents a prescription for HCQ from ever being filled to treat COVID in Georgia. Yet had Cain been exposed to COVID in any of dozens of foreign countries that allow access to HCQ, then he could have received it early in the course of the disease and still be with us today. For his Aug. 18 column[4], Schlafly imposed his HCQ obsession on the presidential election by telling Trump to give it away like candy at his rallies: To win comfortably in less than three months, President Trump needs to find 10 million new votes. The prospect of millions of dubious mail-in ballots adds further pressure on Republicans to attract votes.[...]But in fact the 10 million new votes for Trump are there for the asking, and we even know where to look. They are among the roughly 20 million Americans who watched and supported the July 27 news conference by a group of white-coated physicians who endorse early treatment of COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).That massive audience, younger and many times the size of the viewership of cable news shows, contains the votes Republicans can have for the asking. The Big Tech monopolies certainly knew how seriously that audience threatened the candidacy of Joe Biden, so they took down the video almost as quickly as it was posted.Trump can quench the thirst of those 20 million viewers of the HCQ press conference. Neither addictive nor expensive, HCQ is reportedly consumed like water in Africa, where it is routinely used by residents and visitors alike to protect against malaria. Trump will win if he makes it available.According to Trump's liberal opponents, attending a Trump rally could be as dangerous as visiting a malaria-infected region of Africa. Just as HCQ is prescribed for travelers to Africa, it should be prescribed as a prophylaxis for attendees at Trump rallies where liberals say that participants risk deadly exposure to COVID-19 merely by attending.Better yet, Trump could arrange for open-minded pharmacists to be there to fill the prescriptions for HCQ on the spot. After taking this preventive medication, attendees would then rock the rally with new confidence and enthusiasm.Imagine the twin benefits that would yield for the 20 million Americans seeking access to HCQ: They would obtain the protective medicine they want and also have the opportunity to help reelect Trump. This would be a \"win-win\" for everyone except Joe Biden, who would ramble incoherently against it.[...]Victory in November requires saying no to unreliable mail-in voting, but yes to inexpensive, preventive treatment of COVID-19. Let the Trump rallies return with confidence, and carry him to victory. Again: Schlafly is not a doctor -- he's just parroting his equally HCQ-obsessed AAPS colleagues.

But you'd think he has some medical background the way he rants about hydroxychloroquine being the magic bullet to cure coronavirus despite the fact that studies have been varied and inconclusive. He still won't shut up about it.   In his July 28 WorldNetDaily column , he actually demanded that President Trump issue an executive order promoting hydroxychloroquine:   Liberal, anti-Trump tech monopolies are on the rampage with their modern equivalent of book burning. Twitter suspended the account of the president's son, Don Jr., because he dared to tweet out information favorable to HCQ, and Twitter deleted retweets by the president, too.   Amid this blatant censorship, it is time for President Trump to go directly to the American people. By executive order he should command release of the more than 50 million doses of HCQ that are being withheld from the public in the Strategic National Stockpile.   President Trump should also order his secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Alex Azar, to post updated lists of where the public can access COVID medication without interference by Never-Trumpers and comrades of Anthony Fauci, who has again disparaged the effectiveness of HCQ despite its success in numerous studies and many countries for treating COVID.   President Trump was right to retweet complaints about interference by Democrats with timely, early treatment for COVID. The election may hinge on whether people are allowed to obtain early treatment for the disease, and blocking access interferes with Trump\u2019s reelection.   Schlafly also went on an anti-vaxxer tear, dismissing a possible coronavirus vaccine as \"liberal fool's gold\" and bragged about how his fellow right-wingers have claimed they won't get a vaccine -- even though a vaccine would be better protection against COVID-19 than hydroxychloroquine.   In his Aug. 4 column , Schlafly remembered the late Herman Cain, touting how he \"spoke out against the political interference with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as an effective preventive and early medication for COVID-19, and despite tweets from the hospital there is no indication that he timely received that beneficial treatment.\" He didn't mention the possibility that Cain contracted coronavirus at a June rally Trump held in Tulsa.    Instead, he ranted further about HCQ:   At age only 74, he was younger than the Democratic nominee Joe Biden who undoubtedly would receive essential early treatment to overcome COVID-19 if Biden ever does contract it. Biden would not languish in a hospital for weeks as Boris Johnson and Herman Cain did, with Cain tragically not surviving.   Georgia continues to interfere with the use of HCQ to treat victims of the Wuhan virus, by enforcing unprecedented regulations written especially to block access to this medication. Liberal bureaucrats in Georgia imposed an emergency regulation to prohibit access to HCQ by Herman Cain and others unless the prescription has a diagnosis \"consistent with the evidence for its use.\"   According to the opponents of Donald Trump (and Herman Cain), that regulation prevents a prescription for HCQ from ever being filled to treat COVID in Georgia. Yet had Cain been exposed to COVID in any of dozens of foreign countries that allow access to HCQ, then he could have received it early in the course of the disease and still be with us today.   For his Aug. 18 column , Schlafly imposed his HCQ obsession on the presidential election by telling Trump to give it away like candy at his rallies:   To win comfortably in less than three months, President Trump needs to find 10 million new votes. The prospect of millions of dubious mail-in ballots adds further pressure on Republicans to attract votes.   [...]   But in fact the 10 million new votes for Trump are there for the asking, and we even know where to look. They are among the roughly 20 million Americans who watched and supported the July 27 news conference by a group of white-coated physicians who endorse early treatment of COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).   That massive audience, younger and many times the size of the viewership of cable news shows, contains the votes Republicans can have for the asking. The Big Tech monopolies certainly knew how seriously that audience threatened the candidacy of Joe Biden, so they took down the video almost as quickly as it was posted.   Trump can quench the thirst of those 20 million viewers of the HCQ press conference. Neither addictive nor expensive, HCQ is reportedly consumed like water in Africa, where it is routinely used by residents and visitors alike to protect against malaria. Trump will win if he makes it available.   According to Trump's liberal opponents, attending a Trump rally could be as dangerous as visiting a malaria-infected region of Africa. Just as HCQ is prescribed for travelers to Africa, it should be prescribed as a prophylaxis for attendees at Trump rallies where liberals say that participants risk deadly exposure to COVID-19 merely by attending.   Better yet, Trump could arrange for open-minded pharmacists to be there to fill the prescriptions for HCQ on the spot. After taking this preventive medication, attendees would then rock the rally with new confidence and enthusiasm.   Imagine the twin benefits that would yield for the 20 million Americans seeking access to HCQ: They would obtain the protective medicine they want and also have the opportunity to help reelect Trump. This would be a \"win-win\" for everyone except Joe Biden, who would ramble incoherently against it.   [...]   Victory in November requires saying no to unreliable mail-in voting, but yes to inexpensive, preventive treatment of COVID-19. Let the Trump rallies return with confidence, and carry him to victory.   Again: Schlafly is not a doctor -- he's just parroting his equally HCQ-obsessed AAPS colleagues.

Religious conservatives were going to point to the Obama-era policies, such as forcing nuns to buy birth control for their employees, that led them to believe their communities and institutions were under existential threat from the government. But I also knew I'd hear an increasing fear about the private sector, and what culturally liberal companies were trying to do to conservatives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Woke capitalism\" has triggered great alarm on the right. I have heard it described, with no sense of irony, as the greatest threat facing Western society.</p><p>Conservatives aren't just angry that corporate America seems to be siding against them in disputes such as whether football players should kneel for the national anthem; they worry about a future in which their views are censored by Big Tech, declared anathema by employers, targeted for angry mobbings by the media. And so they feel forced to support politicians such as Mr. Trump who promise to take the fight to their enemies.</p><p>I would question the effectiveness of this strategy, since, if anything, Mr. Trump seems to have emboldened the culture warriors within corporate America. But I won't try to argue that conservative fears are ungrounded. There really is an increasingly militant wing of the left that wants to use economic as well as political power to destroy their opponents, from Mozilla chief executive Brendan Eich (forced to step down for donating in support of California's Proposition 8) to James Damore (a Google engineer fired for a memo he wrote about the company's diversity policies) to the hapless NRA conventioneers who made the mistake of flying Delta. And as these examples suggest, the liquidationist wing seems to have a surprising amount of influence over corporate behavior.</p><p>But \"surprising\" doesn't mean \"large,\" since it is surprising for them to have any influence at all. In fact, I suspect that what little power they had has already peaked.</p><p>Consider Google, which just issued a rather tart advisory about the freewheeling internal discussion boards where Mr. Damore's infamous memo began its viral career. The company warns that \"disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics\" doesn't build community, adding, \"Our primary responsibility is to do the work we've each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics.\" This is a pretty stunning turnaround, given the company's long history of supporting these kinds of discussions.</p><p>Yet there's a reason companies have historically discouraged workers from spending much time arguing politics; when the argument is over, the anger often lingers. Google got away with it for so long because its core business, a virtual monopoly over internet search, throws off so much money that it can afford to indulge worker desires for an activist workplace. Effectively, bringing your politics to the job site was a form of compensation for the woke workforce.</p><p>Only that market position isn't quite as impregnable as it looked a few years ago. For reasons that have nothing to do with the political skew of the company's workforce, governments are getting more and more interested in curbing the power of tech firms, and thus their revenue. Meanwhile, Google faces competitive pressure in its non-search markets. The company can't necessarily afford the luxury of an internal message system that's getting everyone riled up, without any commensurate increase in productivity - or worse, one that helps workers to organize to force the company out of potentially profitable lines of business.</p><p>Moreover, the wokest firms are extremely geographically concentrated along the coasts. The geographic concentration is what drives the woke warrior phenomenon, since it's easiest to want to destroy people if you don't know them. But it also dramatically limits its scope.</p><p>And that scope is already limited, because large public companies aren't going to pursue their principles at the expense of any sizable self-interest. Note how many firms are quiet about the Chinese government, which is violently suppressing protest in Hong Kong and herding religious minorities into reeducation camps. I don't say that this is admirable, but I do say that it is a fact.</p><p>So while I sympathize with conservatives who fear that woke capital is selling them out, I can't agree that those fears justify selling the soul of conservatism to Mr. Trump. It's true, woke capitalism will sell you out. The thing is, if you wait long enough - and not very long at that - it will sell out your opponents, too.</p><p>Megan McArdle is a columnist for The Washington Post.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press: Google was at the forefront of woke capitalism, making politics a facet of its identity - until its power was finally challenged, by the market and regulators.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-19083025265368</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXW-W4J1-JC8R-33VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 P.G.

More than a dozen women  arrested as thousands of women staged what was supposed to be peaceful pro- women rallies and walkouts across the country for the controversial day  without a woman protest. It turned into an anti-Trump march. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to Risk and Reward. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald, in for Deirdre Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Women across the country walked off the job. White collar workers, blue  collar workers, government workers, and teachers. One teacher in  Philadelphia says it's about demonstrating support for the value of women.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think this is a big year for us women. We need to  prove that we are a big part of this economy and we're a big part of our  nation. So, I'm glad that we could get together today and speak on behalf  of that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But was that always the case, because in order to show the  vital role that women played in all fascist of this nation, the rally  organizers said women must leave their jobs for the day to protest  President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Trump does not have respect for women. But he also  doesn't know the power of women. By the time why Trump and republicans to  diminish women we know our value and we know that America doesn't function  without us. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Not every woman was on board with the statements like this. We  have also working moms and working parents telling that they were  struggling to get by and that they're now upset that their children were  left stranded with some schools cancelling classes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm appalled that they just made this decision because  people don't have the luxury like me and my family to have someone at home  with the kids. Some people working two or three jobs, some people don't  have the resources to hire a babysitter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  And it's not just teachers, government workers including house  democrats whose salaries are paid with your tax dollars they walked off the  job joining rallies in Washington, D.C. to show support. It's all part of a  plan set by the organizers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wear red in solidarity. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wear red in solidarity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The color red signifies revolutionary love. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Action and our pioneering spirit. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number two, strike. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Strike. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Strike. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do not engage in paid or unpaid work. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do not engage in paid or unpaid work. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number three. Avoid spending money. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Avoid spending money.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With the exception of small, and women and minority- owned business. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You can agree or disagree with that. But while the  protestors and organizers say they're about the moral authority of  empowering women, among the organizers and speakers at these women marchers  are three murderers. One a convicted terrorist involved in the murder of  two students. </p><p>Another in (Inaudible) starts a homicide it was on the FBI's 10 most wanted  list. And still another convicted felon involved in the kidnapping, rape  and murder of a gay man. Conspicuously missing from the list of the women  inspiring marches like this. </p><p>Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, more on that coming  up. My first guest is here to talk about how teachers were walking out to  send and anti-Trump message.</p><p>Let's bring in Bre Payton, reporter for the Federalist. Bre, was this a  woman's rally or an anti-Trump protest? </p><p>BRE PAYTON, THE FEDERALIST REPORTER:  I think it's pretty clear tha this  was an anti-Trump protest. The catalyst behind all these subsequent  marches, and day without women, and strikes, and et cetera, et cetera, is  Donald Trump's electoral victory, right, and I think pretending otherwise  isn't really tricking anyone. </p><p>I think we all know that this is an anti-Donald Trump rally. And I think we  know that a lot of these districts overwhelmingly vote -- the districts  that closed the schools today they overwhelmingly voted for Hillary  Clinton. And in some cases they didn't really need to close the doors. They  could have still let kids into the classroom and allowed parents to go to  work today, right. </p><p>MACDONALD:  But Bre, stay on that. Are you saying that your team found the  schools did have enough workers to stay open but they still shut their  doors today? Wasn't that stranding working families, including single moms  who work? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. And I think a lot of the  school districts are kind of enabling the strike instead of cracking down  and saying no you need to show up for work. This is paid for and funded by  taxpayer dollars. We need to provide the servants that we promised to  provide to parents, instead of cracking down and being tough and doing  their jobs, they decided to fold and enable teachers to allow then to  protest the president, right. I mean, this is completely absurd. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Bre, when teachers and government workers don't show up  don't pack -- taxpayers have to pay extra including for replacement  workers? Yes, protesting is a fundamental American right. You know, women,  of course you want to support women and getting the pay that they deserve.  But should protests like this be done on one's own time, say on the weekend  when taxpayers aren't stuck with the bill? </p><p>PAYTON:  Right. I mean, I would definitely think that if you're a taxpayer  funded worker, that is if your paycheck is being funded by taxpayer  dollars, you should do this on your own time and you should make them pay  for it, right. I mean, that's why we have a lot of laws like the amendment  in place that prevents taxpayer funding from going to abortion, right. </p><p>It's like a moral clause. In order to keep taxpayers for having to pay for  things that they don't agree with. I don't agree with this protest and I'm  upset that my taxpayers --my taxpayer dollars, you know, went to fund this  kind of enable this behavior. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Bre, you wonder if the parents as they agree with the  teachers going to protest like this because protest organizers say that  anyone questioning the goodness of communism, that communism acts should  liberates people, or that Islam is really a feminist religion and it's good  for women, anybody who says otherwise is an idiot or a racist. And they say  capitalism is the problem when women are routinely brutalized under these  regimes. What are your thoughts?</p><p>PAYTON:  Right. Well, you know, my kid was in a classroom and a teacher  called out to protest, to pay in this protest, I would think twice about  sending them back to school the next day, right. And I myself I'm a product  of home schooling because my parent didn't want to deal with indoctrinating  in classrooms and teachers forcing an agenda down my throat, right. </p><p>So, I think a lot of parents are probably upset by this whole ideological  battle that's being wage right now in classroom. And I think it's really  unfair for, you know, 5-year-old kids to have to navigate or deal with this  kind of propaganda that their teachers are pushing down their throats. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Bre, I mean, some of this is really just tweaks deep  accusations. You know, you see the accusations of sexism, racism, take your  'pickisms,' we get it. But they're letting in bad people like murderers and  Islamists and communists. I mean, this really is a silly led by the  sinister, right? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes. You're exactly right. And you know, this whole thing was  supposed to be a grassroots-led movement. But it's pretty clear that it's  not. It's pretty clear that there are very large organizations bankrolling  this and that it is very well organize and that it is coming from the top  down, right. It's not grassroots in any way, shape or form. And pretending  that it is really just intellectually insulting. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Bre Payton, you're always terrific. Please come back soon. </p><p>PAYTON:  As always. I'll come back whenever.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Soon. Staying on this topic, the organizers of a day  without women saying the women are encouraged to take the day off but avoid  shopping. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number three, avoid spending money. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number three, avoid spending money. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With the exception of small, women and minority-owned  businesses. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Some wondering if a group of men were protesting would not go  shopping or wearing a color be on the list of things to do. </p><p>For that let's bring in the political power panel. Conservative Review  Deneen Borelli, and democrat strategist Jennice Fuentes. Deneen, take off  from work but don't work. Is that really the new feminist message? </p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW CORRESPONDENT:  Liz, let me just tell  you that I wore red today because I felt like it. I'm going shopping after  this segment. And yes, I did work today. I was at the White House briefing.  Liz, this is nothing but progressive activism women in skirts and dresses. </p><p>What people need to understand and realize is that America is an  exceptional country. Anyone can succeed. We have women in all levels of all  different jobs and responsibilities, whether it's television,  entertainment, corporate America, you name it. </p><p>I worked hard to get where I am today to be on national television to talk  about the policies and issues that I support. And for people to go out and  protest industries the way that they are is absolutely ridiculous. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, it's good to see you. The question has been, why  should women get to walk off work to prove that women are equal to everyone  else not able to take the day off. Isn't that kind of illogical and  inconsistent? To some it's really impassively absurd because they just  don't think that that's the way to go. What are your thoughts? </p><p>JENNICE FUENTES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, there are short-term goals  and there are long-term goals here. And I think that we all three of us  women have the same goal in mind, in which we want to be treated like  ladies but we want to get paid like men. </p><p>And I think that at this day and age it misses the biggest point, which  most household in a family with children under 18 are led by women. And  that woman makes at least 80 cents on the dollar that the men make. If that  woman is a mother she makes 71 cents of that dollar that men makes. If that  woman is a single mother she makes 58. </p><p>Whether you dress in red or you beg for some establishment who doesn't  employ women and pay them right. This fight goes on beyond today. And  that's what will unite all of us. Because at the end of the day women have  to stand united to protect the wages. We have the real problem with that  wage gap.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, Jennice.</p><p>FUENTES:  And that absolutely needs to be solved.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear exactly what you're saying. And in fact, yes, women  should get paid equally as men. But Deneen, it seems like an anti-Trump  protest. To Jennice's point, we've have a really bad economy where women  are working multiple part-time jobs just to get by. </p><p>I mean, is this the way to go? It just seems that, you know, some of the  things that they're saying at these marches are so off the wall about how  communism is good and capitalism is bad. Go ahead.</p><p>BORELLI:  Well, where were the protests with the Obama administration and  females who got paid less than the male staffers under Obama's leadership.  I mean, listen, this is where it's good to have smaller government, fiscal  responsibility, and initiatives that will propel businesses to hire and  grow their business and hire people, lower taxes, less regulations. These  are the policies that President Trump is talking about in order to grow our  economy and for job growth. And that is something that he ran on as  president. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Let's switch gears. Protestors calling it a day for  women, but was it just another anti-Trump protest?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We see women uncertain of their rights. We see anti- women and anti-abortion groups emboldened. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Protestors saying they're worried about their  rights. This as the president just signed two new laws helping NASA, and  saying that NASA and to the NASA (Inaudible) nation, you know, push to get  more women and girls involved in science math and related field. </p><p>Also, the president's daughter, Ivanka and the Canadian Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau with the president, they with a dozen CEO and business  leaders to forge an international council women business leaders intending  to support women in the workplace. </p><p>So, Jennice, I hear what they're saying about abortion and those rights and  those issues. Setting that aside, I understand that. I get it. We're  talking about economic growth and what you just said about women working  part time. Is President Trump taking really taking away women's right when  it comes to economic growth? </p><p>FUENTES:  Well, they just say that I don't see anything that inspires me,  or making me feel better about myself, for my nieces and for my sisters,  and for men as well. I mean, we all have to stand united in here. But I  would like to see very specific steps to help women, single women,  especially and mothers, single mothers I meant, have a balance between work  and family. Get those skills to basically grow their business. Get access  to capital, get mentorship, get education. </p><p>It is very hard to make it in this world whether you have your own business  or whether you work for others. And if you're a mom it's doubly hard. We  already stay that you make 80 cents at the best situations, right?</p><p>BORELLI:  Then you should with Trump policies...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, I hear what you're saying.</p><p>FUENTES:  But you know what, I would like to see something very specific.  And the women marching today have the right to be heard. That's what so  great about our country.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Jennice.</p><p>FUENTES:  Now one march alone is not going to change everything. You know  that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>FUENTES:  We all agree on that. This continues and this needs follow-up and  this needs consistencies with Congress where the fight really needs to be  fought.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Deneen, go ahead. </p><p>BORELLI:  Then you should be in accordance with the policies that President  Trump is urging in urban communities where the schools are failing children  and there is a high crime rates and there are high unemployment rates. And  so what we need to do our better school choice initiative avenues and also  incentivize businesses to reinvest in these communities so people are  employed. Whether they are mothers, fathers, single parents, you name it. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Deneen and Jennice, thank you so much. You are going  to be back later. </p><p>FUENTES:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now next up, is your TV, is your cell phone, even your car  spying on you? WikiLeaks releasing a trove of documents showing how the CIA  spies on you via your devices even if they are turned off. </p><p>A big name tech company's products have been allegedly compromised. We're  talking Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft. They are upset and they're  responding to the CIA. Hear what they have to say.</p><p>Also, can you guess which state is first out of the box trying to stop the  president's refugee pause? The judge says that he would toss this suit due  to its dubious assertions. He's going to explain that next, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, (R) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE:  Look, this is early on in  the investigation, but these appear to be very, very serious. We don't know  who is responsible for this for what's happened in the latest WikiLeaks  round. So, let's just leave it at that and let them come up and let them  come out and brief you at the proper time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  WikiLeaks releasing a trove of CIA documents showing how it can  spy on you via your devices. Now the leaks contain this. Techniques to  break into smart phones, including iPhones using (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY)  listening devices, even if your TV is turned off. Instructions on how the  CIA can use Skype, Wi-Fi networks, and anti-virus computer programs to spy  on you as well. And details about how to steal your passwords over the  internet.</p><p>Big tech companies like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft up and arms over  WikiLeaks and CIA dump. They're mad at the CIA. Apple is saying this.  \"While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today  were already patched. We will continue to work rapidly to address any  vulnerabilities.\"</p><p>Let's bring in the best expert around, the judge. Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Are you worried about this?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I'm terrified about  it. You know, we've been saying for years that the mobile phones that we  all carry around in our pockets which now you can't turn off are actually  listening devices. </p><p>Now we also know that the microchip in the microwave in your kitchen can be  used as a listening device. That certain televisions when they're turned  off they only looked like off that can be used as a listening and a  monitoring device. </p><p>Here is -- here is the problem. All of this is unlawful. The CIA is not  permitted to ply its trade in the United States of America unless they are  chasing somebody from outside the United States into the U.S. The  government is spying on us without suspicion, without probable cause, and  without a warrant from a judge. </p><p>That's un-American, unconstitutional and ineffective. It doesn't keep us  safe. It produces information overload. It produces so much info...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  How much?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If it were printers on ordinary printing paper like you have  in front over here. It would be 27 times the size of the -- of the contents  of the library of Congress every year since 2005. The government doesn't  have the resources to go through all of that to look for the bad that's  buried in the good. </p><p>That's the genius of the Constitution in the fourth amendment. The  government is force to focus on people as to whom it has suspicion or  believe a crime or a terrorist activity is occurring or is about to occur.  When you focus on the bad people you leave everybody out alone. This is  spying on everybody. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, but your point is, I hear your point. The argument is that  we have to catch the terrorist here. The FBI is 900 active terror plots in  all 50 states. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The FBI does not do this. The FBI, as far as I can tell you,  and I've been monitoring and working with them within my ears in the bench  for years. The FBI when they want to listen to a conversation or otherwise  surveil you, goes to a judge and presents probable cause and gets a  warrant. </p><p>MACDONALD:  But what's the CIA doing? They trying to get terrorists? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The CIA is trying to gather all the information they can  because their theory is if they gather everything it is more efficient than  isolating the bad people. The problem with that is the Constitution  requires the isolation of the bad people. </p><p>Go to Fox News.com the headline is \"FBI Searches for CIA mole.\" How about  the headline is, \"FBI searches for CIA who have been spying on innocent  Americans.\" That's what the FBI should be searching for. That's a felony to  do it and WikiLeaks has demonstrated that it's been going on under our  noses. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Where's the outrage?</p><p>MACDONALD:  And all the leaks that are coming out of the government about  spying on people in government. Wow. </p><p>Switching gears, here's the state that is first out of the box suing the  Trump administration over its new refugee pause. It's Hawaii. Hawaii wants  to fight it out in court, calling this version of the order a quote,  \"Muslim ban.\" </p><p>Now the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii he's complaining. He is  saying this. \"This new version in the executive order inflicts a grave  injury on Muslims in Hawaii, including the imam, his family and members of  the mosque.\" Judge, is this a Muslim ban? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is not a Muslim ban. The government has removed all  references to religion. It certainly falls disproportionately on Muslims  but it is not written in order to keep Muslims out of the United States.  The government articulates in the ban the reasons why the State Department  has chosen these six countries. </p><p>It's really far more bulletproof than the first one is -- first one was.  But this Hawaii lawsuit is filled with some of the most scurrilous attacks  on President Trump that I have seen on a sitting president since the ending  days of the, of Richard Nixon. </p><p>They have taken out of context the most incendiary things he said since  long before he was even a candidate and trying to ascribe that to his  motivation now. So they're taking something he said two and a half years  ago and trying to say this is his motivation for today. </p><p>That's not an appropriate way for a court to evaluate the true motivation  of the President of the United States. Because this is an area of the law  uniquely given by the Constitution just to the president. It's foreign  policy. He decides who our enemies are, he decides who our friends are. The  Congress gives him tools. One of tools is temporary immigration bans. He's  using those tools. </p><p>MACDONALD:  If this came before you as a judge, what would you do? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I would -- I would dismiss it. Because the State of  Hawaii is the plaintiff here. And the State of Hawaii can't show that it is  harmed. You can't go into federal court just because you don't like what  the government did. You have to show how you are harmed. The state has not  been harmed at all. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Judge, you're great. Please come back soon. We love you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm just delighted to be able to work with you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Always great to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Especially when it starts this the day, starts here and then  Stuart.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Stuart Varney and you have to do...</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Does Varney around somewhere?</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, you have to do the queen's accents next time with Varney. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You got it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  He loves it.</p><p>Next more, a sanctuary state fallout. An illegal immigrant repeatedly  arrested. He was deported to Mexico five times. He's now charged in a  deadly car crash in Los Angeles that killed a woman. </p><p>Also shockingly gruesome story involving another illegal immigrant. This  time in North Carolina. That man accused of beheading his own mother. Next,  the father whose daughter was killed by an illegal immigrant react, after  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's just unbelievable. They had him handcuffed and he  was just sitting there just like he didn't have a care in the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Last month Sandra Duran killed in Los Angeles by a drunk  driver. The driver an illegal immigrant deported to Mexico five times  before. He had been arrested and charged with more than 20 felonies and  misdemeanors including gun and drug possession and driving under the  influence. </p><p>Joining me now, John Pina, another father whose daughter was also killed by  an illegal immigrant. Mr. Pina, we are so sorry for your loss, and we are  so upset we are asking you to do this. But, please, we want to inform the  viewer, what happened to your 14-year-old daughter. Can you tell us? </p><p>JOHN PINA, CHRISTY PINA'S FATHER:  Yes. She was found February 8, 1990.  (AUDIO GAP) stabbed in artichoke -- they threw her body in artichoke field  in Castroville, California. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Now, Mr. Pina, correct us if we're wrong, but is it true that  an arrest warrant for this illegal immigrant was not issued until 17 years  later? And in the meantime, he committed many more crimes? What happened?  Where is he now? </p><p>PINA:  Back in '87 he had kidnapped two 14-year-old girls. One in July, he  got put in jail, got out. And in September he came back and did kidnapped  another one. And he got out again. And then he came back and he murdered my  daughter. And then a few months later he came back and tried to kidnap a  12-year-old at 7 o'clock in the morning. And he's supposedly, supposed to  be incarcerated in Mexico for Christy's murder. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Is he in jail in prison right now, sir? </p><p>PINA:  That's what I heard last. But I haven't heard anything in almost a  year. So, I really don't know. They haven't informed me, or they haven't  contacted me for a while. So, I really don't know. I can't tell you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, it's absolutely disgrace and it's horrifying. We are so  upset for you and your family. </p><p>PINA:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And I got a story that came up, sir, we want to talk to you  about it. In North Carolina an 18-year-old illegal immigrant charged this  week with murder. Olivia Machado was decapitated by this man, her son. He  decapitated his own mother with a butcher knife. Here's what he told  authorities. He did it because he felt like it. Now he was taking  medication for a psychosis schizophrenia. He was in the United States  illegally. Should he have been deported, sir? </p><p>PINA:  Well, he should never been here in the first place, and yes, he  should have been deported. But now it's going to be kind of hard to get him  deported because now the system is going to look at him and support him and  take care of him while the taxpayers are out all that money. He should have  never been here in the first place. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mr. Pina, how do you feel about what President Trump is doing  versus what, how President Obama handled these problems. </p><p>PINA:  Donald Trump, our President, I think is doing a great job. He's  doing what he said he's going to do. I met with the man, he is sincere and  he will accomplish what he set out to do. </p><p>MACDONALD:  John Pina, thank you so much. And again, with your story, you  are helping so many people across the country. It is so difficult and  horrifying what you went through. But we're grateful you came on the show.  Thank you again.</p><p>PINA:  Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Sources telling Fox News that Jon Huntsman, Jr.  will be the next U.S. ambassador to Russia. President Trump reportedly  calling Mr. Huntsman two days ago to offer him the job, and apparently, Mr.  Huntsman accepted. </p><p>This appointment comes as President Trump and his cabinet being scrutinized  for alleged ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin. </p><p>Next up, the results are in. The president crushing job expectation in his  month in office. Find out how many U.S. jobs were added. It's a surprise  and it was a surprise to Wall Street. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He's going to bring  all these jobs back? Well, how exactly is he going to do? What are you  going to do? There is no answer to it. He just says, well, I'm going -- I'm  going to negotiate a better deal. Well, how -- what -- how exactly are you  going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's been a little over a  month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the  nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises. </p><p>Since my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Soft Bank,  Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart, and many others, have announced that they will  invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will  create tens of thousands of new American jobs.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  President Trump's first full month in office bringing a massive  employment boom. EDP reporting U.S. companies added a whopping 298,000 new  jobs in February. That's 100,000 more jobs than Wall Street had predicted.  That looks like 3 percent even 4 percent growth, to me, that's what the  president promised.</p><p>The co-chair of America -- great -- excuse me -- the Great American  Alliance, he's Eric Beach. He joins me now. Eric, what do you think of the  blistering pace of jobs that were added last month? </p><p>ERIC BEACH, GREAT AMERICAN ALLIANCE CO-CHAIR:  Look, I mean, the last two  months has been the largest increase in job creation since September of  2015, and it's interesting, we talk about the promises that he ran on, now  they're promises kept. So, I think, you know, much like the stock market  the market doesn't lie. Job creation and job growth also doesn't lie. I  think the president is just simply keeping his promises to the American  people. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. The market likes -- it looks like it likes these policies.  And companies are investing to create these jobs and these are good paying  jobs, Eric. There are construction jobs up by 66,000. Manufacturing jobs up  by 32,000. </p><p>President Obama repeatedly said, you know what, manufacturing jobs is not  coming back. How is Trump going to do that? He can't do that. Was he wrong? </p><p>BEACH:  He was wrong. And that's because he's never had a private sector  job before. And so, I think what you're seeing is you really is a culture  of confidence for the business community. For example, when Samsung is  going to move and bring in -- relocate some of their operations into the  U.S., you know, that's simply because maybe they are afraid of the border  tax proposal. Maybe they just understand that there might a better  corporate tax here inside the United States. </p><p>Whatever that might be, you know, the president is creating a culture of  confidence and once again, the market sees that. Remember when the market  was at 18,000 when he was elected. And we said, well, that was a  psychological number for the Dow. </p><p>Well, today it's 21,000. It's grown 3,000 points. And again, the market,  the business community, they understand that we have a business-friendly  president and it's good for all Americans. </p><p>MACDONALD:  But you know, NBC is already out with a headline, \"Fact check,  how many jobs has the Trump created?\" It looks like the media is not ever  going to give the president credit for any positive news. </p><p>BEACH:  Well, they haven't. But that's not really the important thing. The  media called the race wrong on November 8. The media continues to try to  digress into different areas and say look, the president is not doing this,  or it's private sector jobs. </p><p>When is the last time you heard he's only creating private sector jobs?  When was the last time you've heard off? He's only creating private sector  jobs. He's not really doing much for the public sector. But that's what he  ran on. </p><p>The American people voted for Donald Trump for a variety of reasons. You  know, they wanted to repeal and replace healthcare. They wanted to, you  know, make sure we secure America first. And then also to create jobs and  he's doing all three of those things right out of the box. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Reagan inherited, I think two recessions. He created  something like 16 million or 17 million jobs. Clinton created 22 million  jobs. So, President Obama keeps saying I inherited recession. He only  created 10 million jobs, way worse than Reagan. </p><p>I think you guys look into it. And he created an ad than that highlight  past presidents and their job performance. And also, not following through  with their promises. What do you, how do you think President Trump will  stack up? </p><p>BEACH:  Look, I think it takes courage to be president. I think when he  ran, you know, really the media and really a lot of the Washington elites,  they said, you know, he really can't get those things done. We heard time  and time again from both the punditry class as well as the democrats to  say, he'll never really try to execute on this agenda. </p><p>Well, look, the group that we formed Great America Alliance, you know,  we're out there to support the Trump agenda. Because voters overwhelmingly,  especially the middle class voters in Wisconsin and in middle America and  Michigan, and Pennsylvania, states in which he won, they have to understand  that we got to have a better culture out there to make sure that the  business -- you know, that's make sure it's business friendly. </p><p>And Donald Trump is bringing that to the table. His inauguration speech is  one of the best speeches ever given. And I think he's going to execute on  that. And it takes a lot of courage to execute on the agenda that a lot of  the elites really have been trying to stymie. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Eric Beach, always terrific. Come back soon, OK?</p><p>BEACH:  Thanks for having me, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sure. The fallout continues. It turns out that one of the  organizers of todays without women, day without woman, rather, where women  worked off their jobs. She is a convicted terrorist accused of helping to  kill two students in Israel. </p><p>Now the nice of one of her victims is now speaking out. We have what she  said after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. As we discuss earlier in the show today's day  without women is organized, help, basically supported by a convicted  terrorist. Rasmea Odeh served 10 years in prison for her involvement in the  1969 terror bombing in Jerusalem which killed two Hebrew student. </p><p>Odeh was also later convicted at the immigration fraud. She basically  didn't tell regulators here that she was involved in that bombing. </p><p>Now the niece of one of those victims speaking out condemning the protest  for supporter a murderer saying it's a day without her father. Here's the  quote. \"What is the difference between the act -- the acts of Omar Mateen,  the Boston marathon bombers and Rasmea Odeh? There's no difference. They  all carried out acts of terror in the name of their causes which resulted  in the death of innocent civilians.\"</p><p>My political panel is back with me now, Deneen Borelli and Jennice Fuentes.  Deneen, isn't having a convicted terrorist involved in these marches is a  slap in the face of these victims, isn't that sending the wrong message? </p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and my heart goes  out to the victims and their families. Listen, this is just absolutely off  the charts outrageous, Liz. This is a convicted murder, a terrorist, a  bomber who was basically been put on a pedestal. </p><p>I mean, what are the people who are involved in these events thinking to be  praising someone with such a past? I mean, you can't ignore what this woman  has done. And to put her, you know, on the pedestal to be praising her so  to speak, I think speaks volumes. It's outrageous. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Jennice, the organizers and supporters also include  the convicted felon Angela Davis, remember the communist party charge with  homicide. Four people killed in that assault in the courtroom that she  helped organized including a judge dead. Angela is in the middle of that  shot. </p><p>Also Donna Hilton, she is a convicted felon along with others. She  kidnapped a gay man and tortured him to death. I mean, isn't this  contradictory to what the march stands for to have people like this  involved? </p><p>JENNICE FUENTES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  That's where our court exists.</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, I'm talking about the march. I'm talking about rally. What  are these women involved?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  You know what, I'll tell you -- I'll tell you what is an  outrageous scandal. I think what is an outrageous scandal is that primary,  and I go back to my point because this is what matters. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Now, Jennice, just answer the question.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  It's what -- no, no, no. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, I'm sorry. And please answer the question. Jennice. </p><p>FUENTES:  Let me tell you what a scandal is this. The primary  breadwinner...</p><p>BORELLI:  She can't defend the murderer...</p><p>MACDONALD:  Deneen, hang on. Jennice, answer the question. Jennice, answer  the question. Isn't this going against what the march is about, having  murderers involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  The march is about women's parity in the workplace, isn't it. Its  about equality. It's about the end of discrimination.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So you're OK with these women being involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  I didn't organize that march. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Are you -- are you OK with being involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  I'll have (Inaudible) because the courts will have a fine of the  crimes of those women...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BORELLI:  That answers your question, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>BORELLI:  She is OK with it. </p><p>FUENTES:  No. Listen, you're trying to create a big distraction to what  scandal is this. No, you're trying to create a distraction.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, no, no. I'm asking you a flat-out question. Is it OK to  have murders involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  You guys are two women. Do you think it's fair that women have to  wait 44 years to have pay parity with men? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  We understand what you're saying. </p><p>FUENTES:  Really? Is that what I should interpret your silence to try to  deviate the question to that? It's nonsense. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Jennice, we hear what you're saying.</p><p>FUENTES:  You're trying to create a distraction here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, is it OK -- Jennice, thank you, we appreciate that.  Just hang on one second. Deneen, is it OK to have -- what kind of message  does it have, does this bring -- to have three women who are convicted  felons involved in murders, involved in a march. </p><p>BORELI:  Yes, it's horrible. And for your guest to not even address your  question, is this really outrageous. She's bought into it. These people are  murderers, they're terrorists...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  Excuse me, no.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, hang on. Jennice, sorry. </p><p>FUENTES:  You seemed to be distracted by that nonsense.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, Jennice, Jennice...</p><p>BORELLI:  You can't even answer the question. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, we let you answer. We're going to let Deneen answer.  Go again, Deneen.</p><p>BORELLI:  Right. So these people are murderers, they're terrorists, they've  been convicted. And for them to be on a pedestal just like I said before is  absolutely outrageous. And it speaks volumes to people like your guest  Jellice or whatever her name is. And people who are allowing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  My name is Jennice.</p><p>BORELLI:  ... these individuals to have a voice is outrageous. What about  the family members of the people who were murdered and killed. Innocent  people, nine people were murdered and two were killed with this Rasmea  woman. It's outrageous.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You know, Jennice, do stay with me one second.</p><p>BORELLI:  And you should be ashamed to yourself.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, two names missing to the list.</p><p>FUENTES:  No. Excuse me. Can I address that?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, please?</p><p>FUENTES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why were Hillary Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren not  listed among the women inspiring the events? </p><p>FUENTES:  I wasn't an organizer and I cannot -- I cannot comment on that. I  agree that if you've been convicted of a crime, you shouldn't be put in  charge of any event that is public that is trying to inspire the message.  But do not interpret my comments to be supporting criminals. That is what's  absurd. </p><p>And to be sidelining the issue at hand, which is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm not sideling the issue. Jennice, hang on.</p><p>FUENTES:  ... the gap parity. Yes, it is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, forgive me. We're just asking you if you support  murderers and it took -- it took you five about minutes to answer the  question. </p><p>FUENTES:  Excuse me, ladies.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's switch gears. Over the weekend in Berkeley...</p><p>FUENTES:  We were preceded by a segment above the markets.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sorry, Jennice, we're going to move on. We are going to have to  cut your mic, Jennice if you don't stop. Now over the weekend in Berkeley  10 were arrested at pro-Trump rallies where rioters clash with the  president supporters. And we have a pro-Trump mother who was accosted. She  spoke out last night. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EVA PETERS, TRUMP SUPPORTER:  Most of the protesters actually were just  coming up to me and, you know, throwing the f bomb, f you, f Trump. They  were very just rude, asking me why I liked Trump. He was a racist. That  means I'm a racist. Telling me to get out of Berkeley. I don't belong  there. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Jennice, what do you -- what do you make of the  violence at protests like that. I mean, people really getting, it looked  like they're getting hurt at those Berkeley protests, Jennice. Do you agree  with that? </p><p>FUENTES:  No, of course not. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>FUENTES:  Violence is unacceptable at any level. And the fact that that's  happening could not, that could not. And I feel bad for law enforcements, I  feel bad for protesters who want to protest peacefully. Because you can  disagree and still be very peaceful about it. </p><p>So, of course, nobody in their right mind would agree with having violence.  Nothing. Violence could lead to nothing good. And I think all the three of  us can agree on that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Jennice, notice the color Deneen and I'm wearing,  it's red. Deneen Borelli and Jennice Fuentes, thank you so much for your  time.</p><p>BORELLI:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Next up, a day without women protests, the fallout continues.  Residents of one North Carolina town blindsided after a school in their  district decided to close for the day without woman protest. An angry  resident and school district parent Mary Lopez Carter speaks out next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm appalled that they just made a decision because  people don't have the luxury like me and my family to have someone at home  with the kids. Some people working on two and three jobs. Some people don't  have the resources to hire a babysitter. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Residents of a North Carolina town upset after a school in  their district decided to close for the day without women protest. The  school cancelled classes calling today a teacher work day. </p><p>An angry resident and school district parent, Mary Lopez Carter joins me  now. Mary, were you shocked when you heard they were closing schools for  the protest? </p><p>MARY LOPEZ CARTER, PARENT ANGRY OVER SCHOOL CLOSING:  I was beyond shocked  and beyond angry about this. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So what happened, so go ahead, Mary, tell us what happened. </p><p>CARTER:  Well, it was all over Twitter and Facebook and that's how I found  out about it. And then it just kind of spread from there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, you know, working parents, working moms, working dads. I  guess they unexpectedly had to take care of their children today, right. </p><p>CARTER:  Exactly. Here's the thing. Teachers -- teaching is a profession.  And if teachers want to be politicians then they should just leave their  profession and go run for office. But what we have here is that they're all  about their emotions, they're all about their ideology, and it supersedes  logic. </p><p>Any reasonable person would agree that holding children's education hostage  is really the wrong approach. It affects the -- it affects the families, it  affects the parents, it affects the children. It's this very disruptive.  And it affects poor children who rely on breakfasts and lunches at school. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, part of the school statement reads. \"We support and  appreciate our female workers. The decision to close schools with neither a  statement nor an endorsement of the demonstration. It was entirely about  our inability to insure the safety of students due to insufficient  staffing.\"</p><p>Now, Mary, you are for equal pay for women, I take it, right, and for, you  know, empowering women and getting women better jobs. And you know, doing -  doing the right thing for women. But what did you make of the school's  statement here? </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think frankly they're just lying. Because Durham Schools  which is Durham County is right next door to Chapel Hill-Carrboro, the  Orange County school system and they said they were going to open their  doors. They were not going to close the doors on the children. So they made  the decision that no, this is not acceptable and we are just going to keep  our doors open and continue with school as usual. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Why couldn't the schools just say, you know what, we're not  going to allow the request to be absent. Shouldn't it -- you know, do they  -- did that come up? </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think what is happening is that the administration is  fully supporting this. So the thing is, you are seeing this in blue  counties. And Chapel Hill-Carrboro Schools is in a very liberal area. And  we are seeing it now in Virginia and in Maryland. Again, blue counties. So  that tells you that's political. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mary, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.  Come back soon, OK? </p><p>CARTER:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, our very own Neil Cavuto has the first interview  with Trump's labor secretary nominee Andy Puzder since he withdrew his name  from his consideration. The details coming up, don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Our own Neil Cavuto has the first interview with former Trump  labor secretary nominee, Andrew Puzder since he withdrew his name from  consideration. Tune in tomorrow at 12 p.m. Eastern Time for this exclusive.</p><p>Well, thank you for having us in your homes.

More than a dozen women  arrested as thousands of women staged what was supposed to be peaceful pro- women rallies and walkouts across the country for the controversial day  without a woman protest. It turned into an anti-Trump march. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to Risk and Reward. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald, in for Deirdre Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Women across the country walked off the job. White collar workers, blue  collar workers, government workers, and teachers. One teacher in  Philadelphia says it's about demonstrating support for the value of women.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think this is a big year for us women. We need to  prove that we are a big part of this economy and we're a big part of our  nation. So, I'm glad that we could get together today and speak on behalf  of that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But was that always the case, because in order to show the  vital role that women played in all fascist of this nation, the rally  organizers said women must leave their jobs for the day to protest  President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Trump does not have respect for women. But he also  doesn't know the power of women. By the time why Trump and republicans to  diminish women we know our value and we know that America doesn't function  without us. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Not every woman was on board with the statements like this. We  have also working moms and working parents telling that they were  struggling to get by and that they're now upset that their children were  left stranded with some schools cancelling classes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm appalled that they just made this decision because  people don't have the luxury like me and my family to have someone at home  with the kids. Some people working two or three jobs, some people don't  have the resources to hire a babysitter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  And it's not just teachers, government workers including house  democrats whose salaries are paid with your tax dollars they walked off the  job joining rallies in Washington, D.C. to show support. It's all part of a  plan set by the organizers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wear red in solidarity. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wear red in solidarity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The color red signifies revolutionary love. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Action and our pioneering spirit. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number two, strike. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Strike. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Strike. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do not engage in paid or unpaid work. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do not engage in paid or unpaid work. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number three. Avoid spending money. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Avoid spending money.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With the exception of small, and women and minority- owned business. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You can agree or disagree with that. But while the  protestors and organizers say they're about the moral authority of  empowering women, among the organizers and speakers at these women marchers  are three murderers. One a convicted terrorist involved in the murder of  two students. </p><p>Another in (Inaudible) starts a homicide it was on the FBI's 10 most wanted  list. And still another convicted felon involved in the kidnapping, rape  and murder of a gay man. Conspicuously missing from the list of the women  inspiring marches like this. </p><p>Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, more on that coming  up. My first guest is here to talk about how teachers were walking out to  send and anti-Trump message.</p><p>Let's bring in Bre Payton, reporter for the Federalist. Bre, was this a  woman's rally or an anti-Trump protest? </p><p>BRE PAYTON, THE FEDERALIST REPORTER:  I think it's pretty clear tha this  was an anti-Trump protest. The catalyst behind all these subsequent  marches, and day without women, and strikes, and et cetera, et cetera, is  Donald Trump's electoral victory, right, and I think pretending otherwise  isn't really tricking anyone. </p><p>I think we all know that this is an anti-Donald Trump rally. And I think we  know that a lot of these districts overwhelmingly vote -- the districts  that closed the schools today they overwhelmingly voted for Hillary  Clinton. And in some cases they didn't really need to close the doors. They  could have still let kids into the classroom and allowed parents to go to  work today, right. </p><p>MACDONALD:  But Bre, stay on that. Are you saying that your team found the  schools did have enough workers to stay open but they still shut their  doors today? Wasn't that stranding working families, including single moms  who work? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. And I think a lot of the  school districts are kind of enabling the strike instead of cracking down  and saying no you need to show up for work. This is paid for and funded by  taxpayer dollars. We need to provide the servants that we promised to  provide to parents, instead of cracking down and being tough and doing  their jobs, they decided to fold and enable teachers to allow then to  protest the president, right. I mean, this is completely absurd. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Bre, when teachers and government workers don't show up  don't pack -- taxpayers have to pay extra including for replacement  workers? Yes, protesting is a fundamental American right. You know, women,  of course you want to support women and getting the pay that they deserve.  But should protests like this be done on one's own time, say on the weekend  when taxpayers aren't stuck with the bill? </p><p>PAYTON:  Right. I mean, I would definitely think that if you're a taxpayer  funded worker, that is if your paycheck is being funded by taxpayer  dollars, you should do this on your own time and you should make them pay  for it, right. I mean, that's why we have a lot of laws like the amendment  in place that prevents taxpayer funding from going to abortion, right. </p><p>It's like a moral clause. In order to keep taxpayers for having to pay for  things that they don't agree with. I don't agree with this protest and I'm  upset that my taxpayers --my taxpayer dollars, you know, went to fund this  kind of enable this behavior. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Bre, you wonder if the parents as they agree with the  teachers going to protest like this because protest organizers say that  anyone questioning the goodness of communism, that communism acts should  liberates people, or that Islam is really a feminist religion and it's good  for women, anybody who says otherwise is an idiot or a racist. And they say  capitalism is the problem when women are routinely brutalized under these  regimes. What are your thoughts?</p><p>PAYTON:  Right. Well, you know, my kid was in a classroom and a teacher  called out to protest, to pay in this protest, I would think twice about  sending them back to school the next day, right. And I myself I'm a product  of home schooling because my parent didn't want to deal with indoctrinating  in classrooms and teachers forcing an agenda down my throat, right. </p><p>So, I think a lot of parents are probably upset by this whole ideological  battle that's being wage right now in classroom. And I think it's really  unfair for, you know, 5-year-old kids to have to navigate or deal with this  kind of propaganda that their teachers are pushing down their throats. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Bre, I mean, some of this is really just tweaks deep  accusations. You know, you see the accusations of sexism, racism, take your  'pickisms,' we get it. But they're letting in bad people like murderers and  Islamists and communists. I mean, this really is a silly led by the  sinister, right? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes. You're exactly right. And you know, this whole thing was  supposed to be a grassroots-led movement. But it's pretty clear that it's  not. It's pretty clear that there are very large organizations bankrolling  this and that it is very well organize and that it is coming from the top  down, right. It's not grassroots in any way, shape or form. And pretending  that it is really just intellectually insulting. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Bre Payton, you're always terrific. Please come back soon. </p><p>PAYTON:  As always. I'll come back whenever.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Soon. Staying on this topic, the organizers of a day  without women saying the women are encouraged to take the day off but avoid  shopping. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number three, avoid spending money. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number three, avoid spending money. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With the exception of small, women and minority-owned  businesses. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Some wondering if a group of men were protesting would not go  shopping or wearing a color be on the list of things to do. </p><p>For that let's bring in the political power panel. Conservative Review  Deneen Borelli, and democrat strategist Jennice Fuentes. Deneen, take off  from work but don't work. Is that really the new feminist message? </p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW CORRESPONDENT:  Liz, let me just tell  you that I wore red today because I felt like it. I'm going shopping after  this segment. And yes, I did work today. I was at the White House briefing.  Liz, this is nothing but progressive activism women in skirts and dresses. </p><p>What people need to understand and realize is that America is an  exceptional country. Anyone can succeed. We have women in all levels of all  different jobs and responsibilities, whether it's television,  entertainment, corporate America, you name it. </p><p>I worked hard to get where I am today to be on national television to talk  about the policies and issues that I support. And for people to go out and  protest industries the way that they are is absolutely ridiculous. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, it's good to see you. The question has been, why  should women get to walk off work to prove that women are equal to everyone  else not able to take the day off. Isn't that kind of illogical and  inconsistent? To some it's really impassively absurd because they just  don't think that that's the way to go. What are your thoughts? </p><p>JENNICE FUENTES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, there are short-term goals  and there are long-term goals here. And I think that we all three of us  women have the same goal in mind, in which we want to be treated like  ladies but we want to get paid like men. </p><p>And I think that at this day and age it misses the biggest point, which  most household in a family with children under 18 are led by women. And  that woman makes at least 80 cents on the dollar that the men make. If that  woman is a mother she makes 71 cents of that dollar that men makes. If that  woman is a single mother she makes 58. </p><p>Whether you dress in red or you beg for some establishment who doesn't  employ women and pay them right. This fight goes on beyond today. And  that's what will unite all of us. Because at the end of the day women have  to stand united to protect the wages. We have the real problem with that  wage gap.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, Jennice.</p><p>FUENTES:  And that absolutely needs to be solved.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear exactly what you're saying. And in fact, yes, women  should get paid equally as men. But Deneen, it seems like an anti-Trump  protest. To Jennice's point, we've have a really bad economy where women  are working multiple part-time jobs just to get by. </p><p>I mean, is this the way to go? It just seems that, you know, some of the  things that they're saying at these marches are so off the wall about how  communism is good and capitalism is bad. Go ahead.</p><p>BORELLI:  Well, where were the protests with the Obama administration and  females who got paid less than the male staffers under Obama's leadership.  I mean, listen, this is where it's good to have smaller government, fiscal  responsibility, and initiatives that will propel businesses to hire and  grow their business and hire people, lower taxes, less regulations. These  are the policies that President Trump is talking about in order to grow our  economy and for job growth. And that is something that he ran on as  president. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Let's switch gears. Protestors calling it a day for  women, but was it just another anti-Trump protest?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We see women uncertain of their rights. We see anti- women and anti-abortion groups emboldened. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Protestors saying they're worried about their  rights. This as the president just signed two new laws helping NASA, and  saying that NASA and to the NASA (Inaudible) nation, you know, push to get  more women and girls involved in science math and related field. </p><p>Also, the president's daughter, Ivanka and the Canadian Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau with the president, they with a dozen CEO and business  leaders to forge an international council women business leaders intending  to support women in the workplace. </p><p>So, Jennice, I hear what they're saying about abortion and those rights and  those issues. Setting that aside, I understand that. I get it. We're  talking about economic growth and what you just said about women working  part time. Is President Trump taking really taking away women's right when  it comes to economic growth? </p><p>FUENTES:  Well, they just say that I don't see anything that inspires me,  or making me feel better about myself, for my nieces and for my sisters,  and for men as well. I mean, we all have to stand united in here. But I  would like to see very specific steps to help women, single women,  especially and mothers, single mothers I meant, have a balance between work  and family. Get those skills to basically grow their business. Get access  to capital, get mentorship, get education. </p><p>It is very hard to make it in this world whether you have your own business  or whether you work for others. And if you're a mom it's doubly hard. We  already stay that you make 80 cents at the best situations, right?</p><p>BORELLI:  Then you should with Trump policies...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, I hear what you're saying.</p><p>FUENTES:  But you know what, I would like to see something very specific.  And the women marching today have the right to be heard. That's what so  great about our country.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Jennice.</p><p>FUENTES:  Now one march alone is not going to change everything. You know  that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>FUENTES:  We all agree on that. This continues and this needs follow-up and  this needs consistencies with Congress where the fight really needs to be  fought.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Deneen, go ahead. </p><p>BORELLI:  Then you should be in accordance with the policies that President  Trump is urging in urban communities where the schools are failing children  and there is a high crime rates and there are high unemployment rates. And  so what we need to do our better school choice initiative avenues and also  incentivize businesses to reinvest in these communities so people are  employed. Whether they are mothers, fathers, single parents, you name it. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Deneen and Jennice, thank you so much. You are going  to be back later. </p><p>FUENTES:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now next up, is your TV, is your cell phone, even your car  spying on you? WikiLeaks releasing a trove of documents showing how the CIA  spies on you via your devices even if they are turned off. </p><p>A big name tech company's products have been allegedly compromised. We're  talking Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft. They are upset and they're  responding to the CIA. Hear what they have to say.</p><p>Also, can you guess which state is first out of the box trying to stop the  president's refugee pause? The judge says that he would toss this suit due  to its dubious assertions. He's going to explain that next, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, (R) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE:  Look, this is early on in  the investigation, but these appear to be very, very serious. We don't know  who is responsible for this for what's happened in the latest WikiLeaks  round. So, let's just leave it at that and let them come up and let them  come out and brief you at the proper time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  WikiLeaks releasing a trove of CIA documents showing how it can  spy on you via your devices. Now the leaks contain this. Techniques to  break into smart phones, including iPhones using (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY)  listening devices, even if your TV is turned off. Instructions on how the  CIA can use Skype, Wi-Fi networks, and anti-virus computer programs to spy  on you as well. And details about how to steal your passwords over the  internet.</p><p>Big tech companies like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft up and arms over  WikiLeaks and CIA dump. They're mad at the CIA. Apple is saying this.  \"While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today  were already patched. We will continue to work rapidly to address any  vulnerabilities.\"</p><p>Let's bring in the best expert around, the judge. Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Are you worried about this?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I'm terrified about  it. You know, we've been saying for years that the mobile phones that we  all carry around in our pockets which now you can't turn off are actually  listening devices. </p><p>Now we also know that the microchip in the microwave in your kitchen can be  used as a listening device. That certain televisions when they're turned  off they only looked like off that can be used as a listening and a  monitoring device. </p><p>Here is -- here is the problem. All of this is unlawful. The CIA is not  permitted to ply its trade in the United States of America unless they are  chasing somebody from outside the United States into the U.S. The  government is spying on us without suspicion, without probable cause, and  without a warrant from a judge. </p><p>That's un-American, unconstitutional and ineffective. It doesn't keep us  safe. It produces information overload. It produces so much info...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  How much?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If it were printers on ordinary printing paper like you have  in front over here. It would be 27 times the size of the -- of the contents  of the library of Congress every year since 2005. The government doesn't  have the resources to go through all of that to look for the bad that's  buried in the good. </p><p>That's the genius of the Constitution in the fourth amendment. The  government is force to focus on people as to whom it has suspicion or  believe a crime or a terrorist activity is occurring or is about to occur.  When you focus on the bad people you leave everybody out alone. This is  spying on everybody. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, but your point is, I hear your point. The argument is that  we have to catch the terrorist here. The FBI is 900 active terror plots in  all 50 states. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The FBI does not do this. The FBI, as far as I can tell you,  and I've been monitoring and working with them within my ears in the bench  for years. The FBI when they want to listen to a conversation or otherwise  surveil you, goes to a judge and presents probable cause and gets a  warrant. </p><p>MACDONALD:  But what's the CIA doing? They trying to get terrorists? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The CIA is trying to gather all the information they can  because their theory is if they gather everything it is more efficient than  isolating the bad people. The problem with that is the Constitution  requires the isolation of the bad people. </p><p>Go to Fox News.com the headline is \"FBI Searches for CIA mole.\" How about  the headline is, \"FBI searches for CIA who have been spying on innocent  Americans.\" That's what the FBI should be searching for. That's a felony to  do it and WikiLeaks has demonstrated that it's been going on under our  noses. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Where's the outrage?</p><p>MACDONALD:  And all the leaks that are coming out of the government about  spying on people in government. Wow. </p><p>Switching gears, here's the state that is first out of the box suing the  Trump administration over its new refugee pause. It's Hawaii. Hawaii wants  to fight it out in court, calling this version of the order a quote,  \"Muslim ban.\" </p><p>Now the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii he's complaining. He is  saying this. \"This new version in the executive order inflicts a grave  injury on Muslims in Hawaii, including the imam, his family and members of  the mosque.\" Judge, is this a Muslim ban? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is not a Muslim ban. The government has removed all  references to religion. It certainly falls disproportionately on Muslims  but it is not written in order to keep Muslims out of the United States.  The government articulates in the ban the reasons why the State Department  has chosen these six countries. </p><p>It's really far more bulletproof than the first one is -- first one was.  But this Hawaii lawsuit is filled with some of the most scurrilous attacks  on President Trump that I have seen on a sitting president since the ending  days of the, of Richard Nixon. </p><p>They have taken out of context the most incendiary things he said since  long before he was even a candidate and trying to ascribe that to his  motivation now. So they're taking something he said two and a half years  ago and trying to say this is his motivation for today. </p><p>That's not an appropriate way for a court to evaluate the true motivation  of the President of the United States. Because this is an area of the law  uniquely given by the Constitution just to the president. It's foreign  policy. He decides who our enemies are, he decides who our friends are. The  Congress gives him tools. One of tools is temporary immigration bans. He's  using those tools. </p><p>MACDONALD:  If this came before you as a judge, what would you do? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I would -- I would dismiss it. Because the State of  Hawaii is the plaintiff here. And the State of Hawaii can't show that it is  harmed. You can't go into federal court just because you don't like what  the government did. You have to show how you are harmed. The state has not  been harmed at all. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Judge, you're great. Please come back soon. We love you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm just delighted to be able to work with you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Always great to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Especially when it starts this the day, starts here and then  Stuart.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Stuart Varney and you have to do...</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Does Varney around somewhere?</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, you have to do the queen's accents next time with Varney. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You got it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  He loves it.</p><p>Next more, a sanctuary state fallout. An illegal immigrant repeatedly  arrested. He was deported to Mexico five times. He's now charged in a  deadly car crash in Los Angeles that killed a woman. </p><p>Also shockingly gruesome story involving another illegal immigrant. This  time in North Carolina. That man accused of beheading his own mother. Next,  the father whose daughter was killed by an illegal immigrant react, after  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's just unbelievable. They had him handcuffed and he  was just sitting there just like he didn't have a care in the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Last month Sandra Duran killed in Los Angeles by a drunk  driver. The driver an illegal immigrant deported to Mexico five times  before. He had been arrested and charged with more than 20 felonies and  misdemeanors including gun and drug possession and driving under the  influence. </p><p>Joining me now, John Pina, another father whose daughter was also killed by  an illegal immigrant. Mr. Pina, we are so sorry for your loss, and we are  so upset we are asking you to do this. But, please, we want to inform the  viewer, what happened to your 14-year-old daughter. Can you tell us? </p><p>JOHN PINA, CHRISTY PINA'S FATHER:  Yes. She was found February 8, 1990.  (AUDIO GAP) stabbed in artichoke -- they threw her body in artichoke field  in Castroville, California. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Now, Mr. Pina, correct us if we're wrong, but is it true that  an arrest warrant for this illegal immigrant was not issued until 17 years  later? And in the meantime, he committed many more crimes? What happened?  Where is he now? </p><p>PINA:  Back in '87 he had kidnapped two 14-year-old girls. One in July, he  got put in jail, got out. And in September he came back and did kidnapped  another one. And he got out again. And then he came back and he murdered my  daughter. And then a few months later he came back and tried to kidnap a  12-year-old at 7 o'clock in the morning. And he's supposedly, supposed to  be incarcerated in Mexico for Christy's murder. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Is he in jail in prison right now, sir? </p><p>PINA:  That's what I heard last. But I haven't heard anything in almost a  year. So, I really don't know. They haven't informed me, or they haven't  contacted me for a while. So, I really don't know. I can't tell you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, it's absolutely disgrace and it's horrifying. We are so  upset for you and your family. </p><p>PINA:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And I got a story that came up, sir, we want to talk to you  about it. In North Carolina an 18-year-old illegal immigrant charged this  week with murder. Olivia Machado was decapitated by this man, her son. He  decapitated his own mother with a butcher knife. Here's what he told  authorities. He did it because he felt like it. Now he was taking  medication for a psychosis schizophrenia. He was in the United States  illegally. Should he have been deported, sir? </p><p>PINA:  Well, he should never been here in the first place, and yes, he  should have been deported. But now it's going to be kind of hard to get him  deported because now the system is going to look at him and support him and  take care of him while the taxpayers are out all that money. He should have  never been here in the first place. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mr. Pina, how do you feel about what President Trump is doing  versus what, how President Obama handled these problems. </p><p>PINA:  Donald Trump, our President, I think is doing a great job. He's  doing what he said he's going to do. I met with the man, he is sincere and  he will accomplish what he set out to do. </p><p>MACDONALD:  John Pina, thank you so much. And again, with your story, you  are helping so many people across the country. It is so difficult and  horrifying what you went through. But we're grateful you came on the show.  Thank you again.</p><p>PINA:  Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Sources telling Fox News that Jon Huntsman, Jr.  will be the next U.S. ambassador to Russia. President Trump reportedly  calling Mr. Huntsman two days ago to offer him the job, and apparently, Mr.  Huntsman accepted. </p><p>This appointment comes as President Trump and his cabinet being scrutinized  for alleged ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin. </p><p>Next up, the results are in. The president crushing job expectation in his  month in office. Find out how many U.S. jobs were added. It's a surprise  and it was a surprise to Wall Street. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He's going to bring  all these jobs back? Well, how exactly is he going to do? What are you  going to do? There is no answer to it. He just says, well, I'm going -- I'm  going to negotiate a better deal. Well, how -- what -- how exactly are you  going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's been a little over a  month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the  nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises. </p><p>Since my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Soft Bank,  Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart, and many others, have announced that they will  invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will  create tens of thousands of new American jobs.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  President Trump's first full month in office bringing a massive  employment boom. EDP reporting U.S. companies added a whopping 298,000 new  jobs in February. That's 100,000 more jobs than Wall Street had predicted.  That looks like 3 percent even 4 percent growth, to me, that's what the  president promised.</p><p>The co-chair of America -- great -- excuse me -- the Great American  Alliance, he's Eric Beach. He joins me now. Eric, what do you think of the  blistering pace of jobs that were added last month? </p><p>ERIC BEACH, GREAT AMERICAN ALLIANCE CO-CHAIR:  Look, I mean, the last two  months has been the largest increase in job creation since September of  2015, and it's interesting, we talk about the promises that he ran on, now  they're promises kept. So, I think, you know, much like the stock market  the market doesn't lie. Job creation and job growth also doesn't lie. I  think the president is just simply keeping his promises to the American  people. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. The market likes -- it looks like it likes these policies.  And companies are investing to create these jobs and these are good paying  jobs, Eric. There are construction jobs up by 66,000. Manufacturing jobs up  by 32,000. </p><p>President Obama repeatedly said, you know what, manufacturing jobs is not  coming back. How is Trump going to do that? He can't do that. Was he wrong? </p><p>BEACH:  He was wrong. And that's because he's never had a private sector  job before. And so, I think what you're seeing is you really is a culture  of confidence for the business community. For example, when Samsung is  going to move and bring in -- relocate some of their operations into the  U.S., you know, that's simply because maybe they are afraid of the border  tax proposal. Maybe they just understand that there might a better  corporate tax here inside the United States. </p><p>Whatever that might be, you know, the president is creating a culture of  confidence and once again, the market sees that. Remember when the market  was at 18,000 when he was elected. And we said, well, that was a  psychological number for the Dow. </p><p>Well, today it's 21,000. It's grown 3,000 points. And again, the market,  the business community, they understand that we have a business-friendly  president and it's good for all Americans. </p><p>MACDONALD:  But you know, NBC is already out with a headline, \"Fact check,  how many jobs has the Trump created?\" It looks like the media is not ever  going to give the president credit for any positive news. </p><p>BEACH:  Well, they haven't. But that's not really the important thing. The  media called the race wrong on November 8. The media continues to try to  digress into different areas and say look, the president is not doing this,  or it's private sector jobs. </p><p>When is the last time you heard he's only creating private sector jobs?  When was the last time you've heard off? He's only creating private sector  jobs. He's not really doing much for the public sector. But that's what he  ran on. </p><p>The American people voted for Donald Trump for a variety of reasons. You  know, they wanted to repeal and replace healthcare. They wanted to, you  know, make sure we secure America first. And then also to create jobs and  he's doing all three of those things right out of the box. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Reagan inherited, I think two recessions. He created  something like 16 million or 17 million jobs. Clinton created 22 million  jobs. So, President Obama keeps saying I inherited recession. He only  created 10 million jobs, way worse than Reagan. </p><p>I think you guys look into it. And he created an ad than that highlight  past presidents and their job performance. And also, not following through  with their promises. What do you, how do you think President Trump will  stack up? </p><p>BEACH:  Look, I think it takes courage to be president. I think when he  ran, you know, really the media and really a lot of the Washington elites,  they said, you know, he really can't get those things done. We heard time  and time again from both the punditry class as well as the democrats to  say, he'll never really try to execute on this agenda. </p><p>Well, look, the group that we formed Great America Alliance, you know,  we're out there to support the Trump agenda. Because voters overwhelmingly,  especially the middle class voters in Wisconsin and in middle America and  Michigan, and Pennsylvania, states in which he won, they have to understand  that we got to have a better culture out there to make sure that the  business -- you know, that's make sure it's business friendly. </p><p>And Donald Trump is bringing that to the table. His inauguration speech is  one of the best speeches ever given. And I think he's going to execute on  that. And it takes a lot of courage to execute on the agenda that a lot of  the elites really have been trying to stymie. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Eric Beach, always terrific. Come back soon, OK?</p><p>BEACH:  Thanks for having me, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sure. The fallout continues. It turns out that one of the  organizers of todays without women, day without woman, rather, where women  worked off their jobs. She is a convicted terrorist accused of helping to  kill two students in Israel. </p><p>Now the nice of one of her victims is now speaking out. We have what she  said after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. As we discuss earlier in the show today's day  without women is organized, help, basically supported by a convicted  terrorist. Rasmea Odeh served 10 years in prison for her involvement in the  1969 terror bombing in Jerusalem which killed two Hebrew student. </p><p>Odeh was also later convicted at the immigration fraud. She basically  didn't tell regulators here that she was involved in that bombing. </p><p>Now the niece of one of those victims speaking out condemning the protest  for supporter a murderer saying it's a day without her father. Here's the  quote. \"What is the difference between the act -- the acts of Omar Mateen,  the Boston marathon bombers and Rasmea Odeh? There's no difference. They  all carried out acts of terror in the name of their causes which resulted  in the death of innocent civilians.\"</p><p>My political panel is back with me now, Deneen Borelli and Jennice Fuentes.  Deneen, isn't having a convicted terrorist involved in these marches is a  slap in the face of these victims, isn't that sending the wrong message? </p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and my heart goes  out to the victims and their families. Listen, this is just absolutely off  the charts outrageous, Liz. This is a convicted murder, a terrorist, a  bomber who was basically been put on a pedestal. </p><p>I mean, what are the people who are involved in these events thinking to be  praising someone with such a past? I mean, you can't ignore what this woman  has done. And to put her, you know, on the pedestal to be praising her so  to speak, I think speaks volumes. It's outrageous. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Jennice, the organizers and supporters also include  the convicted felon Angela Davis, remember the communist party charge with  homicide. Four people killed in that assault in the courtroom that she  helped organized including a judge dead. Angela is in the middle of that  shot. </p><p>Also Donna Hilton, she is a convicted felon along with others. She  kidnapped a gay man and tortured him to death. I mean, isn't this  contradictory to what the march stands for to have people like this  involved? </p><p>JENNICE FUENTES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  That's where our court exists.</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, I'm talking about the march. I'm talking about rally. What  are these women involved?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  You know what, I'll tell you -- I'll tell you what is an  outrageous scandal. I think what is an outrageous scandal is that primary,  and I go back to my point because this is what matters. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Now, Jennice, just answer the question.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  It's what -- no, no, no. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, I'm sorry. And please answer the question. Jennice. </p><p>FUENTES:  Let me tell you what a scandal is this. The primary  breadwinner...</p><p>BORELLI:  She can't defend the murderer...</p><p>MACDONALD:  Deneen, hang on. Jennice, answer the question. Jennice, answer  the question. Isn't this going against what the march is about, having  murderers involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  The march is about women's parity in the workplace, isn't it. Its  about equality. It's about the end of discrimination.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So you're OK with these women being involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  I didn't organize that march. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Are you -- are you OK with being involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  I'll have (Inaudible) because the courts will have a fine of the  crimes of those women...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BORELLI:  That answers your question, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>BORELLI:  She is OK with it. </p><p>FUENTES:  No. Listen, you're trying to create a big distraction to what  scandal is this. No, you're trying to create a distraction.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, no, no. I'm asking you a flat-out question. Is it OK to  have murders involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  You guys are two women. Do you think it's fair that women have to  wait 44 years to have pay parity with men? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  We understand what you're saying. </p><p>FUENTES:  Really? Is that what I should interpret your silence to try to  deviate the question to that? It's nonsense. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Jennice, we hear what you're saying.</p><p>FUENTES:  You're trying to create a distraction here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, is it OK -- Jennice, thank you, we appreciate that.  Just hang on one second. Deneen, is it OK to have -- what kind of message  does it have, does this bring -- to have three women who are convicted  felons involved in murders, involved in a march. </p><p>BORELI:  Yes, it's horrible. And for your guest to not even address your  question, is this really outrageous. She's bought into it. These people are  murderers, they're terrorists...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  Excuse me, no.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, hang on. Jennice, sorry. </p><p>FUENTES:  You seemed to be distracted by that nonsense.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, Jennice, Jennice...</p><p>BORELLI:  You can't even answer the question. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, we let you answer. We're going to let Deneen answer.  Go again, Deneen.</p><p>BORELLI:  Right. So these people are murderers, they're terrorists, they've  been convicted. And for them to be on a pedestal just like I said before is  absolutely outrageous. And it speaks volumes to people like your guest  Jellice or whatever her name is. And people who are allowing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  My name is Jennice.</p><p>BORELLI:  ... these individuals to have a voice is outrageous. What about  the family members of the people who were murdered and killed. Innocent  people, nine people were murdered and two were killed with this Rasmea  woman. It's outrageous.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You know, Jennice, do stay with me one second.</p><p>BORELLI:  And you should be ashamed to yourself.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, two names missing to the list.</p><p>FUENTES:  No. Excuse me. Can I address that?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, please?</p><p>FUENTES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why were Hillary Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren not  listed among the women inspiring the events? </p><p>FUENTES:  I wasn't an organizer and I cannot -- I cannot comment on that. I  agree that if you've been convicted of a crime, you shouldn't be put in  charge of any event that is public that is trying to inspire the message.  But do not interpret my comments to be supporting criminals. That is what's  absurd. </p><p>And to be sidelining the issue at hand, which is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm not sideling the issue. Jennice, hang on.</p><p>FUENTES:  ... the gap parity. Yes, it is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, forgive me. We're just asking you if you support  murderers and it took -- it took you five about minutes to answer the  question. </p><p>FUENTES:  Excuse me, ladies.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's switch gears. Over the weekend in Berkeley...</p><p>FUENTES:  We were preceded by a segment above the markets.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sorry, Jennice, we're going to move on. We are going to have to  cut your mic, Jennice if you don't stop. Now over the weekend in Berkeley  10 were arrested at pro-Trump rallies where rioters clash with the  president supporters. And we have a pro-Trump mother who was accosted. She  spoke out last night. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EVA PETERS, TRUMP SUPPORTER:  Most of the protesters actually were just  coming up to me and, you know, throwing the f bomb, f you, f Trump. They  were very just rude, asking me why I liked Trump. He was a racist. That  means I'm a racist. Telling me to get out of Berkeley. I don't belong  there. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Jennice, what do you -- what do you make of the  violence at protests like that. I mean, people really getting, it looked  like they're getting hurt at those Berkeley protests, Jennice. Do you agree  with that? </p><p>FUENTES:  No, of course not. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>FUENTES:  Violence is unacceptable at any level. And the fact that that's  happening could not, that could not. And I feel bad for law enforcements, I  feel bad for protesters who want to protest peacefully. Because you can  disagree and still be very peaceful about it. </p><p>So, of course, nobody in their right mind would agree with having violence.  Nothing. Violence could lead to nothing good. And I think all the three of  us can agree on that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Jennice, notice the color Deneen and I'm wearing,  it's red. Deneen Borelli and Jennice Fuentes, thank you so much for your  time.</p><p>BORELLI:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Next up, a day without women protests, the fallout continues.  Residents of one North Carolina town blindsided after a school in their  district decided to close for the day without woman protest. An angry  resident and school district parent Mary Lopez Carter speaks out next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm appalled that they just made a decision because  people don't have the luxury like me and my family to have someone at home  with the kids. Some people working on two and three jobs. Some people don't  have the resources to hire a babysitter. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Residents of a North Carolina town upset after a school in  their district decided to close for the day without women protest. The  school cancelled classes calling today a teacher work day. </p><p>An angry resident and school district parent, Mary Lopez Carter joins me  now. Mary, were you shocked when you heard they were closing schools for  the protest? </p><p>MARY LOPEZ CARTER, PARENT ANGRY OVER SCHOOL CLOSING:  I was beyond shocked  and beyond angry about this. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So what happened, so go ahead, Mary, tell us what happened. </p><p>CARTER:  Well, it was all over Twitter and Facebook and that's how I found  out about it. And then it just kind of spread from there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, you know, working parents, working moms, working dads. I  guess they unexpectedly had to take care of their children today, right. </p><p>CARTER:  Exactly. Here's the thing. Teachers -- teaching is a profession.  And if teachers want to be politicians then they should just leave their  profession and go run for office. But what we have here is that they're all  about their emotions, they're all about their ideology, and it supersedes  logic. </p><p>Any reasonable person would agree that holding children's education hostage  is really the wrong approach. It affects the -- it affects the families, it  affects the parents, it affects the children. It's this very disruptive.  And it affects poor children who rely on breakfasts and lunches at school. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, part of the school statement reads. \"We support and  appreciate our female workers. The decision to close schools with neither a  statement nor an endorsement of the demonstration. It was entirely about  our inability to insure the safety of students due to insufficient  staffing.\"</p><p>Now, Mary, you are for equal pay for women, I take it, right, and for, you  know, empowering women and getting women better jobs. And you know, doing -  doing the right thing for women. But what did you make of the school's  statement here? </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think frankly they're just lying. Because Durham Schools  which is Durham County is right next door to Chapel Hill-Carrboro, the  Orange County school system and they said they were going to open their  doors. They were not going to close the doors on the children. So they made  the decision that no, this is not acceptable and we are just going to keep  our doors open and continue with school as usual. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Why couldn't the schools just say, you know what, we're not  going to allow the request to be absent. Shouldn't it -- you know, do they  -- did that come up? </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think what is happening is that the administration is  fully supporting this. So the thing is, you are seeing this in blue  counties. And Chapel Hill-Carrboro Schools is in a very liberal area. And  we are seeing it now in Virginia and in Maryland. Again, blue counties. So  that tells you that's political. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mary, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.  Come back soon, OK? </p><p>CARTER:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, our very own Neil Cavuto has the first interview  with Trump's labor secretary nominee Andy Puzder since he withdrew his name  from his consideration. The details coming up, don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Our own Neil Cavuto has the first interview with former Trump  labor secretary nominee, Andrew Puzder since he withdrew his name from  consideration.

More than a dozen women  arrested as thousands of women staged what was supposed to be peaceful pro- women rallies and walkouts across the country for the controversial day  without a woman protest. It turned into an anti-Trump march. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to Risk and Reward. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald, in for Deirdre Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Women across the country walked off the job. White collar workers, blue  collar workers, government workers, and teachers. One teacher in  Philadelphia says it's about demonstrating support for the value of women.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think this is a big year for us women. We need to  prove that we are a big part of this economy and we're a big part of our  nation. So, I'm glad that we could get together today and speak on behalf  of that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But was that always the case, because in order to show the  vital role that women played in all fascist of this nation, the rally  organizers said women must leave their jobs for the day to protest  President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Trump does not have respect for women. But he also  doesn't know the power of women. By the time why Trump and republicans to  diminish women we know our value and we know that America doesn't function  without us. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Not every woman was on board with the statements like this. We  have also working moms and working parents telling that they were  struggling to get by and that they're now upset that their children were  left stranded with some schools cancelling classes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm appalled that they just made this decision because  people don't have the luxury like me and my family to have someone at home  with the kids. Some people working two or three jobs, some people don't  have the resources to hire a babysitter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  And it's not just teachers, government workers including house  democrats whose salaries are paid with your tax dollars they walked off the  job joining rallies in Washington, D.C. to show support. It's all part of a  plan set by the organizers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wear red in solidarity. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wear red in solidarity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The color red signifies revolutionary love. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Action and our pioneering spirit. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number two, strike. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Strike. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Strike. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do not engage in paid or unpaid work. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do not engage in paid or unpaid work. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number three. Avoid spending money. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Avoid spending money.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With the exception of small, and women and minority- owned business. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You can agree or disagree with that. But while the  protestors and organizers say they're about the moral authority of  empowering women, among the organizers and speakers at these women marchers  are three murderers. One a convicted terrorist involved in the murder of  two students. </p><p>Another in (Inaudible) starts a homicide it was on the FBI's 10 most wanted  list. And still another convicted felon involved in the kidnapping, rape  and murder of a gay man. Conspicuously missing from the list of the women  inspiring marches like this. </p><p>Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, more on that coming  up. My first guest is here to talk about how teachers were walking out to  send and anti-Trump message.</p><p>Let's bring in Bre Payton, reporter for the Federalist. Bre, was this a  woman's rally or an anti-Trump protest? </p><p>BRE PAYTON, THE FEDERALIST REPORTER:  I think it's pretty clear tha this  was an anti-Trump protest. The catalyst behind all these subsequent  marches, and day without women, and strikes, and et cetera, et cetera, is  Donald Trump's electoral victory, right, and I think pretending otherwise  isn't really tricking anyone. </p><p>I think we all know that this is an anti-Donald Trump rally. And I think we  know that a lot of these districts overwhelmingly vote -- the districts  that closed the schools today they overwhelmingly voted for Hillary  Clinton. And in some cases they didn't really need to close the doors. They  could have still let kids into the classroom and allowed parents to go to  work today, right. </p><p>MACDONALD:  But Bre, stay on that. Are you saying that your team found the  schools did have enough workers to stay open but they still shut their  doors today? Wasn't that stranding working families, including single moms  who work? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. And I think a lot of the  school districts are kind of enabling the strike instead of cracking down  and saying no you need to show up for work. This is paid for and funded by  taxpayer dollars. We need to provide the servants that we promised to  provide to parents, instead of cracking down and being tough and doing  their jobs, they decided to fold and enable teachers to allow then to  protest the president, right. I mean, this is completely absurd. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Bre, when teachers and government workers don't show up  don't pack -- taxpayers have to pay extra including for replacement  workers? Yes, protesting is a fundamental American right. You know, women,  of course you want to support women and getting the pay that they deserve.  But should protests like this be done on one's own time, say on the weekend  when taxpayers aren't stuck with the bill? </p><p>PAYTON:  Right. I mean, I would definitely think that if you're a taxpayer  funded worker, that is if your paycheck is being funded by taxpayer  dollars, you should do this on your own time and you should make them pay  for it, right. I mean, that's why we have a lot of laws like the amendment  in place that prevents taxpayer funding from going to abortion, right. </p><p>It's like a moral clause. In order to keep taxpayers for having to pay for  things that they don't agree with. I don't agree with this protest and I'm  upset that my taxpayers --my taxpayer dollars, you know, went to fund this  kind of enable this behavior. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Bre, you wonder if the parents as they agree with the  teachers going to protest like this because protest organizers say that  anyone questioning the goodness of communism, that communism acts should  liberates people, or that Islam is really a feminist religion and it's good  for women, anybody who says otherwise is an idiot or a racist. And they say  capitalism is the problem when women are routinely brutalized under these  regimes. What are your thoughts?</p><p>PAYTON:  Right. Well, you know, my kid was in a classroom and a teacher  called out to protest, to pay in this protest, I would think twice about  sending them back to school the next day, right. And I myself I'm a product  of home schooling because my parent didn't want to deal with indoctrinating  in classrooms and teachers forcing an agenda down my throat, right. </p><p>So, I think a lot of parents are probably upset by this whole ideological  battle that's being wage right now in classroom. And I think it's really  unfair for, you know, 5-year-old kids to have to navigate or deal with this  kind of propaganda that their teachers are pushing down their throats. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Bre, I mean, some of this is really just tweaks deep  accusations. You know, you see the accusations of sexism, racism, take your  'pickisms,' we get it. But they're letting in bad people like murderers and  Islamists and communists. I mean, this really is a silly led by the  sinister, right? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes. You're exactly right. And you know, this whole thing was  supposed to be a grassroots-led movement. But it's pretty clear that it's  not. It's pretty clear that there are very large organizations bankrolling  this and that it is very well organize and that it is coming from the top  down, right. It's not grassroots in any way, shape or form. And pretending  that it is really just intellectually insulting. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Bre Payton, you're always terrific. Please come back soon. </p><p>PAYTON:  As always. I'll come back whenever.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Soon. Staying on this topic, the organizers of a day  without women saying the women are encouraged to take the day off but avoid  shopping. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number three, avoid spending money. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Number three, avoid spending money. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With the exception of small, women and minority-owned  businesses. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Some wondering if a group of men were protesting would not go  shopping or wearing a color be on the list of things to do. </p><p>For that let's bring in the political power panel. Conservative Review  Deneen Borelli, and democrat strategist Jennice Fuentes. Deneen, take off  from work but don't work. Is that really the new feminist message? </p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW CORRESPONDENT:  Liz, let me just tell  you that I wore red today because I felt like it. I'm going shopping after  this segment. And yes, I did work today. I was at the White House briefing.  Liz, this is nothing but progressive activism women in skirts and dresses. </p><p>What people need to understand and realize is that America is an  exceptional country. Anyone can succeed. We have women in all levels of all  different jobs and responsibilities, whether it's television,  entertainment, corporate America, you name it. </p><p>I worked hard to get where I am today to be on national television to talk  about the policies and issues that I support. And for people to go out and  protest industries the way that they are is absolutely ridiculous. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, it's good to see you. The question has been, why  should women get to walk off work to prove that women are equal to everyone  else not able to take the day off. Isn't that kind of illogical and  inconsistent? To some it's really impassively absurd because they just  don't think that that's the way to go. What are your thoughts? </p><p>JENNICE FUENTES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, there are short-term goals  and there are long-term goals here. And I think that we all three of us  women have the same goal in mind, in which we want to be treated like  ladies but we want to get paid like men. </p><p>And I think that at this day and age it misses the biggest point, which  most household in a family with children under 18 are led by women. And  that woman makes at least 80 cents on the dollar that the men make. If that  woman is a mother she makes 71 cents of that dollar that men makes. If that  woman is a single mother she makes 58. </p><p>Whether you dress in red or you beg for some establishment who doesn't  employ women and pay them right. This fight goes on beyond today. And  that's what will unite all of us. Because at the end of the day women have  to stand united to protect the wages. We have the real problem with that  wage gap.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, Jennice.</p><p>FUENTES:  And that absolutely needs to be solved.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear exactly what you're saying. And in fact, yes, women  should get paid equally as men. But Deneen, it seems like an anti-Trump  protest. To Jennice's point, we've have a really bad economy where women  are working multiple part-time jobs just to get by. </p><p>I mean, is this the way to go? It just seems that, you know, some of the  things that they're saying at these marches are so off the wall about how  communism is good and capitalism is bad. Go ahead.</p><p>BORELLI:  Well, where were the protests with the Obama administration and  females who got paid less than the male staffers under Obama's leadership.  I mean, listen, this is where it's good to have smaller government, fiscal  responsibility, and initiatives that will propel businesses to hire and  grow their business and hire people, lower taxes, less regulations. These  are the policies that President Trump is talking about in order to grow our  economy and for job growth. And that is something that he ran on as  president. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Let's switch gears. Protestors calling it a day for  women, but was it just another anti-Trump protest?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We see women uncertain of their rights. We see anti- women and anti-abortion groups emboldened. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Protestors saying they're worried about their  rights. This as the president just signed two new laws helping NASA, and  saying that NASA and to the NASA (Inaudible) nation, you know, push to get  more women and girls involved in science math and related field. </p><p>Also, the president's daughter, Ivanka and the Canadian Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau with the president, they with a dozen CEO and business  leaders to forge an international council women business leaders intending  to support women in the workplace. </p><p>So, Jennice, I hear what they're saying about abortion and those rights and  those issues. Setting that aside, I understand that. I get it. We're  talking about economic growth and what you just said about women working  part time. Is President Trump taking really taking away women's right when  it comes to economic growth? </p><p>FUENTES:  Well, they just say that I don't see anything that inspires me,  or making me feel better about myself, for my nieces and for my sisters,  and for men as well. I mean, we all have to stand united in here. But I  would like to see very specific steps to help women, single women,  especially and mothers, single mothers I meant, have a balance between work  and family. Get those skills to basically grow their business. Get access  to capital, get mentorship, get education. </p><p>It is very hard to make it in this world whether you have your own business  or whether you work for others. And if you're a mom it's doubly hard. We  already stay that you make 80 cents at the best situations, right?</p><p>BORELLI:  Then you should with Trump policies...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, I hear what you're saying.</p><p>FUENTES:  But you know what, I would like to see something very specific.  And the women marching today have the right to be heard. That's what so  great about our country.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Jennice.</p><p>FUENTES:  Now one march alone is not going to change everything. You know  that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>FUENTES:  We all agree on that. This continues and this needs follow-up and  this needs consistencies with Congress where the fight really needs to be  fought.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Deneen, go ahead. </p><p>BORELLI:  Then you should be in accordance with the policies that President  Trump is urging in urban communities where the schools are failing children  and there is a high crime rates and there are high unemployment rates. And  so what we need to do our better school choice initiative avenues and also  incentivize businesses to reinvest in these communities so people are  employed. Whether they are mothers, fathers, single parents, you name it. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Deneen and Jennice, thank you so much. You are going  to be back later. </p><p>FUENTES:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now next up, is your TV, is your cell phone, even your car  spying on you? WikiLeaks releasing a trove of documents showing how the CIA  spies on you via your devices even if they are turned off. </p><p>A big name tech company's products have been allegedly compromised. We're  talking Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft. They are upset and they're  responding to the CIA. Hear what they have to say.</p><p>Also, can you guess which state is first out of the box trying to stop the  president's refugee pause? The judge says that he would toss this suit due  to its dubious assertions. He's going to explain that next, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, (R) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE:  Look, this is early on in  the investigation, but these appear to be very, very serious. We don't know  who is responsible for this for what's happened in the latest WikiLeaks  round. So, let's just leave it at that and let them come up and let them  come out and brief you at the proper time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  WikiLeaks releasing a trove of CIA documents showing how it can  spy on you via your devices. Now the leaks contain this. Techniques to  break into smart phones, including iPhones using (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY)  listening devices, even if your TV is turned off. Instructions on how the  CIA can use Skype, Wi-Fi networks, and anti-virus computer programs to spy  on you as well. And details about how to steal your passwords over the  internet.</p><p>Big tech companies like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft up and arms over  WikiLeaks and CIA dump. They're mad at the CIA. Apple is saying this.  \"While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today  were already patched. We will continue to work rapidly to address any  vulnerabilities.\"</p><p>Let's bring in the best expert around, the judge. Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Are you worried about this?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I'm terrified about  it. You know, we've been saying for years that the mobile phones that we  all carry around in our pockets which now you can't turn off are actually  listening devices. </p><p>Now we also know that the microchip in the microwave in your kitchen can be  used as a listening device. That certain televisions when they're turned  off they only looked like off that can be used as a listening and a  monitoring device. </p><p>Here is -- here is the problem. All of this is unlawful. The CIA is not  permitted to ply its trade in the United States of America unless they are  chasing somebody from outside the United States into the U.S. The  government is spying on us without suspicion, without probable cause, and  without a warrant from a judge. </p><p>That's un-American, unconstitutional and ineffective. It doesn't keep us  safe. It produces information overload. It produces so much info...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  How much?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If it were printers on ordinary printing paper like you have  in front over here. It would be 27 times the size of the -- of the contents  of the library of Congress every year since 2005. The government doesn't  have the resources to go through all of that to look for the bad that's  buried in the good. </p><p>That's the genius of the Constitution in the fourth amendment. The  government is force to focus on people as to whom it has suspicion or  believe a crime or a terrorist activity is occurring or is about to occur.  When you focus on the bad people you leave everybody out alone. This is  spying on everybody. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, but your point is, I hear your point. The argument is that  we have to catch the terrorist here. The FBI is 900 active terror plots in  all 50 states. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The FBI does not do this. The FBI, as far as I can tell you,  and I've been monitoring and working with them within my ears in the bench  for years. The FBI when they want to listen to a conversation or otherwise  surveil you, goes to a judge and presents probable cause and gets a  warrant. </p><p>MACDONALD:  But what's the CIA doing? They trying to get terrorists? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The CIA is trying to gather all the information they can  because their theory is if they gather everything it is more efficient than  isolating the bad people. The problem with that is the Constitution  requires the isolation of the bad people. </p><p>Go to Fox News.com the headline is \"FBI Searches for CIA mole.\" How about  the headline is, \"FBI searches for CIA who have been spying on innocent  Americans.\" That's what the FBI should be searching for. That's a felony to  do it and WikiLeaks has demonstrated that it's been going on under our  noses. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Where's the outrage?</p><p>MACDONALD:  And all the leaks that are coming out of the government about  spying on people in government. Wow. </p><p>Switching gears, here's the state that is first out of the box suing the  Trump administration over its new refugee pause. It's Hawaii. Hawaii wants  to fight it out in court, calling this version of the order a quote,  \"Muslim ban.\" </p><p>Now the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii he's complaining. He is  saying this. \"This new version in the executive order inflicts a grave  injury on Muslims in Hawaii, including the imam, his family and members of  the mosque.\" Judge, is this a Muslim ban? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is not a Muslim ban. The government has removed all  references to religion. It certainly falls disproportionately on Muslims  but it is not written in order to keep Muslims out of the United States.  The government articulates in the ban the reasons why the State Department  has chosen these six countries. </p><p>It's really far more bulletproof than the first one is -- first one was.  But this Hawaii lawsuit is filled with some of the most scurrilous attacks  on President Trump that I have seen on a sitting president since the ending  days of the, of Richard Nixon. </p><p>They have taken out of context the most incendiary things he said since  long before he was even a candidate and trying to ascribe that to his  motivation now. So they're taking something he said two and a half years  ago and trying to say this is his motivation for today. </p><p>That's not an appropriate way for a court to evaluate the true motivation  of the President of the United States. Because this is an area of the law  uniquely given by the Constitution just to the president. It's foreign  policy. He decides who our enemies are, he decides who our friends are. The  Congress gives him tools. One of tools is temporary immigration bans. He's  using those tools. </p><p>MACDONALD:  If this came before you as a judge, what would you do? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I would -- I would dismiss it. Because the State of  Hawaii is the plaintiff here. And the State of Hawaii can't show that it is  harmed. You can't go into federal court just because you don't like what  the government did. You have to show how you are harmed. The state has not  been harmed at all. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Judge, you're great. Please come back soon. We love you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm just delighted to be able to work with you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Always great to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Especially when it starts this the day, starts here and then  Stuart.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Stuart Varney and you have to do...</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Does Varney around somewhere?</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, you have to do the queen's accents next time with Varney. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You got it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  He loves it.</p><p>Next more, a sanctuary state fallout. An illegal immigrant repeatedly  arrested. He was deported to Mexico five times. He's now charged in a  deadly car crash in Los Angeles that killed a woman. </p><p>Also shockingly gruesome story involving another illegal immigrant. This  time in North Carolina. That man accused of beheading his own mother. Next,  the father whose daughter was killed by an illegal immigrant react, after  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's just unbelievable. They had him handcuffed and he  was just sitting there just like he didn't have a care in the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Last month Sandra Duran killed in Los Angeles by a drunk  driver. The driver an illegal immigrant deported to Mexico five times  before. He had been arrested and charged with more than 20 felonies and  misdemeanors including gun and drug possession and driving under the  influence. </p><p>Joining me now, John Pina, another father whose daughter was also killed by  an illegal immigrant. Mr. Pina, we are so sorry for your loss, and we are  so upset we are asking you to do this. But, please, we want to inform the  viewer, what happened to your 14-year-old daughter. Can you tell us? </p><p>JOHN PINA, CHRISTY PINA'S FATHER:  Yes. She was found February 8, 1990.  (AUDIO GAP) stabbed in artichoke -- they threw her body in artichoke field  in Castroville, California. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Now, Mr. Pina, correct us if we're wrong, but is it true that  an arrest warrant for this illegal immigrant was not issued until 17 years  later? And in the meantime, he committed many more crimes? What happened?  Where is he now? </p><p>PINA:  Back in '87 he had kidnapped two 14-year-old girls. One in July, he  got put in jail, got out. And in September he came back and did kidnapped  another one. And he got out again. And then he came back and he murdered my  daughter. And then a few months later he came back and tried to kidnap a  12-year-old at 7 o'clock in the morning. And he's supposedly, supposed to  be incarcerated in Mexico for Christy's murder. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Is he in jail in prison right now, sir? </p><p>PINA:  That's what I heard last. But I haven't heard anything in almost a  year. So, I really don't know. They haven't informed me, or they haven't  contacted me for a while. So, I really don't know. I can't tell you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, it's absolutely disgrace and it's horrifying. We are so  upset for you and your family. </p><p>PINA:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And I got a story that came up, sir, we want to talk to you  about it. In North Carolina an 18-year-old illegal immigrant charged this  week with murder. Olivia Machado was decapitated by this man, her son. He  decapitated his own mother with a butcher knife. Here's what he told  authorities. He did it because he felt like it. Now he was taking  medication for a psychosis schizophrenia. He was in the United States  illegally. Should he have been deported, sir? </p><p>PINA:  Well, he should never been here in the first place, and yes, he  should have been deported. But now it's going to be kind of hard to get him  deported because now the system is going to look at him and support him and  take care of him while the taxpayers are out all that money. He should have  never been here in the first place. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mr. Pina, how do you feel about what President Trump is doing  versus what, how President Obama handled these problems. </p><p>PINA:  Donald Trump, our President, I think is doing a great job. He's  doing what he said he's going to do. I met with the man, he is sincere and  he will accomplish what he set out to do. </p><p>MACDONALD:  John Pina, thank you so much. And again, with your story, you  are helping so many people across the country. It is so difficult and  horrifying what you went through. But we're grateful you came on the show.  Thank you again.</p><p>PINA:  Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Sources telling Fox News that Jon Huntsman, Jr.  will be the next U.S. ambassador to Russia. President Trump reportedly  calling Mr. Huntsman two days ago to offer him the job, and apparently, Mr.  Huntsman accepted. </p><p>This appointment comes as President Trump and his cabinet being scrutinized  for alleged ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin. </p><p>Next up, the results are in. The president crushing job expectation in his  month in office. Find out how many U.S. jobs were added. It's a surprise  and it was a surprise to Wall Street. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He's going to bring  all these jobs back? Well, how exactly is he going to do? What are you  going to do? There is no answer to it. He just says, well, I'm going -- I'm  going to negotiate a better deal. Well, how -- what -- how exactly are you  going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's been a little over a  month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the  nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises. </p><p>Since my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Soft Bank,  Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart, and many others, have announced that they will  invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will  create tens of thousands of new American jobs.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  President Trump's first full month in office bringing a massive  employment boom. EDP reporting U.S. companies added a whopping 298,000 new  jobs in February. That's 100,000 more jobs than Wall Street had predicted.  That looks like 3 percent even 4 percent growth, to me, that's what the  president promised.</p><p>The co-chair of America -- great -- excuse me -- the Great American  Alliance, he's Eric Beach. He joins me now. Eric, what do you think of the  blistering pace of jobs that were added last month? </p><p>ERIC BEACH, GREAT AMERICAN ALLIANCE CO-CHAIR:  Look, I mean, the last two  months has been the largest increase in job creation since September of  2015, and it's interesting, we talk about the promises that he ran on, now  they're promises kept. So, I think, you know, much like the stock market  the market doesn't lie. Job creation and job growth also doesn't lie. I  think the president is just simply keeping his promises to the American  people. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. The market likes -- it looks like it likes these policies.  And companies are investing to create these jobs and these are good paying  jobs, Eric. There are construction jobs up by 66,000. Manufacturing jobs up  by 32,000. </p><p>President Obama repeatedly said, you know what, manufacturing jobs is not  coming back. How is Trump going to do that? He can't do that. Was he wrong? </p><p>BEACH:  He was wrong. And that's because he's never had a private sector  job before. And so, I think what you're seeing is you really is a culture  of confidence for the business community. For example, when Samsung is  going to move and bring in -- relocate some of their operations into the  U.S., you know, that's simply because maybe they are afraid of the border  tax proposal. Maybe they just understand that there might a better  corporate tax here inside the United States. </p><p>Whatever that might be, you know, the president is creating a culture of  confidence and once again, the market sees that. Remember when the market  was at 18,000 when he was elected. And we said, well, that was a  psychological number for the Dow. </p><p>Well, today it's 21,000. It's grown 3,000 points. And again, the market,  the business community, they understand that we have a business-friendly  president and it's good for all Americans. </p><p>MACDONALD:  But you know, NBC is already out with a headline, \"Fact check,  how many jobs has the Trump created?\" It looks like the media is not ever  going to give the president credit for any positive news. </p><p>BEACH:  Well, they haven't. But that's not really the important thing. The  media called the race wrong on November 8. The media continues to try to  digress into different areas and say look, the president is not doing this,  or it's private sector jobs. </p><p>When is the last time you heard he's only creating private sector jobs?  When was the last time you've heard off? He's only creating private sector  jobs. He's not really doing much for the public sector. But that's what he  ran on. </p><p>The American people voted for Donald Trump for a variety of reasons. You  know, they wanted to repeal and replace healthcare. They wanted to, you  know, make sure we secure America first. And then also to create jobs and  he's doing all three of those things right out of the box. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Reagan inherited, I think two recessions. He created  something like 16 million or 17 million jobs. Clinton created 22 million  jobs. So, President Obama keeps saying I inherited recession. He only  created 10 million jobs, way worse than Reagan. </p><p>I think you guys look into it. And he created an ad than that highlight  past presidents and their job performance. And also, not following through  with their promises. What do you, how do you think President Trump will  stack up? </p><p>BEACH:  Look, I think it takes courage to be president. I think when he  ran, you know, really the media and really a lot of the Washington elites,  they said, you know, he really can't get those things done. We heard time  and time again from both the punditry class as well as the democrats to  say, he'll never really try to execute on this agenda. </p><p>Well, look, the group that we formed Great America Alliance, you know,  we're out there to support the Trump agenda. Because voters overwhelmingly,  especially the middle class voters in Wisconsin and in middle America and  Michigan, and Pennsylvania, states in which he won, they have to understand  that we got to have a better culture out there to make sure that the  business -- you know, that's make sure it's business friendly. </p><p>And Donald Trump is bringing that to the table. His inauguration speech is  one of the best speeches ever given. And I think he's going to execute on  that. And it takes a lot of courage to execute on the agenda that a lot of  the elites really have been trying to stymie. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Eric Beach, always terrific. Come back soon, OK?</p><p>BEACH:  Thanks for having me, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sure. The fallout continues. It turns out that one of the  organizers of todays without women, day without woman, rather, where women  worked off their jobs. She is a convicted terrorist accused of helping to  kill two students in Israel. </p><p>Now the nice of one of her victims is now speaking out. We have what she  said after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. As we discuss earlier in the show today's day  without women is organized, help, basically supported by a convicted  terrorist. Rasmea Odeh served 10 years in prison for her involvement in the  1969 terror bombing in Jerusalem which killed two Hebrew student. </p><p>Odeh was also later convicted at the immigration fraud. She basically  didn't tell regulators here that she was involved in that bombing. </p><p>Now the niece of one of those victims speaking out condemning the protest  for supporter a murderer saying it's a day without her father. Here's the  quote. \"What is the difference between the act -- the acts of Omar Mateen,  the Boston marathon bombers and Rasmea Odeh? There's no difference. They  all carried out acts of terror in the name of their causes which resulted  in the death of innocent civilians.\"</p><p>My political panel is back with me now, Deneen Borelli and Jennice Fuentes.  Deneen, isn't having a convicted terrorist involved in these marches is a  slap in the face of these victims, isn't that sending the wrong message? </p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and my heart goes  out to the victims and their families. Listen, this is just absolutely off  the charts outrageous, Liz. This is a convicted murder, a terrorist, a  bomber who was basically been put on a pedestal. </p><p>I mean, what are the people who are involved in these events thinking to be  praising someone with such a past? I mean, you can't ignore what this woman  has done. And to put her, you know, on the pedestal to be praising her so  to speak, I think speaks volumes. It's outrageous. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Jennice, the organizers and supporters also include  the convicted felon Angela Davis, remember the communist party charge with  homicide. Four people killed in that assault in the courtroom that she  helped organized including a judge dead. Angela is in the middle of that  shot. </p><p>Also Donna Hilton, she is a convicted felon along with others. She  kidnapped a gay man and tortured him to death. I mean, isn't this  contradictory to what the march stands for to have people like this  involved? </p><p>JENNICE FUENTES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  That's where our court exists.</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, I'm talking about the march. I'm talking about rally. What  are these women involved?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  You know what, I'll tell you -- I'll tell you what is an  outrageous scandal. I think what is an outrageous scandal is that primary,  and I go back to my point because this is what matters. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Now, Jennice, just answer the question.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  It's what -- no, no, no. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, I'm sorry. And please answer the question. Jennice. </p><p>FUENTES:  Let me tell you what a scandal is this. The primary  breadwinner...</p><p>BORELLI:  She can't defend the murderer...</p><p>MACDONALD:  Deneen, hang on. Jennice, answer the question. Jennice, answer  the question. Isn't this going against what the march is about, having  murderers involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  The march is about women's parity in the workplace, isn't it. Its  about equality. It's about the end of discrimination.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So you're OK with these women being involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  I didn't organize that march. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Are you -- are you OK with being involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  I'll have (Inaudible) because the courts will have a fine of the  crimes of those women...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BORELLI:  That answers your question, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>BORELLI:  She is OK with it. </p><p>FUENTES:  No. Listen, you're trying to create a big distraction to what  scandal is this. No, you're trying to create a distraction.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, no, no. I'm asking you a flat-out question. Is it OK to  have murders involved? </p><p>FUENTES:  You guys are two women. Do you think it's fair that women have to  wait 44 years to have pay parity with men? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  We understand what you're saying. </p><p>FUENTES:  Really? Is that what I should interpret your silence to try to  deviate the question to that? It's nonsense. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Jennice, we hear what you're saying.</p><p>FUENTES:  You're trying to create a distraction here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, is it OK -- Jennice, thank you, we appreciate that.  Just hang on one second. Deneen, is it OK to have -- what kind of message  does it have, does this bring -- to have three women who are convicted  felons involved in murders, involved in a march. </p><p>BORELI:  Yes, it's horrible. And for your guest to not even address your  question, is this really outrageous. She's bought into it. These people are  murderers, they're terrorists...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  Excuse me, no.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, hang on. Jennice, sorry. </p><p>FUENTES:  You seemed to be distracted by that nonsense.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, Jennice, Jennice...</p><p>BORELLI:  You can't even answer the question. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, we let you answer. We're going to let Deneen answer.  Go again, Deneen.</p><p>BORELLI:  Right. So these people are murderers, they're terrorists, they've  been convicted. And for them to be on a pedestal just like I said before is  absolutely outrageous. And it speaks volumes to people like your guest  Jellice or whatever her name is. And people who are allowing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES:  My name is Jennice.</p><p>BORELLI:  ... these individuals to have a voice is outrageous. What about  the family members of the people who were murdered and killed. Innocent  people, nine people were murdered and two were killed with this Rasmea  woman. It's outrageous.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You know, Jennice, do stay with me one second.</p><p>BORELLI:  And you should be ashamed to yourself.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, two names missing to the list.</p><p>FUENTES:  No. Excuse me. Can I address that?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, please?</p><p>FUENTES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why were Hillary Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren not  listed among the women inspiring the events? </p><p>FUENTES:  I wasn't an organizer and I cannot -- I cannot comment on that. I  agree that if you've been convicted of a crime, you shouldn't be put in  charge of any event that is public that is trying to inspire the message.  But do not interpret my comments to be supporting criminals. That is what's  absurd. </p><p>And to be sidelining the issue at hand, which is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm not sideling the issue. Jennice, hang on.</p><p>FUENTES:  ... the gap parity. Yes, it is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennice, forgive me. We're just asking you if you support  murderers and it took -- it took you five about minutes to answer the  question. </p><p>FUENTES:  Excuse me, ladies.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's switch gears. Over the weekend in Berkeley...</p><p>FUENTES:  We were preceded by a segment above the markets.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sorry, Jennice, we're going to move on. We are going to have to  cut your mic, Jennice if you don't stop. Now over the weekend in Berkeley  10 were arrested at pro-Trump rallies where rioters clash with the  president supporters. And we have a pro-Trump mother who was accosted. She  spoke out last night. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EVA PETERS, TRUMP SUPPORTER:  Most of the protesters actually were just  coming up to me and, you know, throwing the f bomb, f you, f Trump. They  were very just rude, asking me why I liked Trump. He was a racist. That  means I'm a racist. Telling me to get out of Berkeley. I don't belong  there. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Jennice, what do you -- what do you make of the  violence at protests like that. I mean, people really getting, it looked  like they're getting hurt at those Berkeley protests, Jennice. Do you agree  with that? </p><p>FUENTES:  No, of course not. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>FUENTES:  Violence is unacceptable at any level. And the fact that that's  happening could not, that could not. And I feel bad for law enforcements, I  feel bad for protesters who want to protest peacefully. Because you can  disagree and still be very peaceful about it. </p><p>So, of course, nobody in their right mind would agree with having violence.  Nothing. Violence could lead to nothing good. And I think all the three of  us can agree on that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Jennice, notice the color Deneen and I'm wearing,  it's red. Deneen Borelli and Jennice Fuentes, thank you so much for your  time.</p><p>BORELLI:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Next up, a day without women protests, the fallout continues.  Residents of one North Carolina town blindsided after a school in their  district decided to close for the day without woman protest. An angry  resident and school district parent Mary Lopez Carter speaks out next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm appalled that they just made a decision because  people don't have the luxury like me and my family to have someone at home  with the kids. Some people working on two and three jobs. Some people don't  have the resources to hire a babysitter. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Residents of a North Carolina town upset after a school in  their district decided to close for the day without women protest. The  school cancelled classes calling today a teacher work day. </p><p>An angry resident and school district parent, Mary Lopez Carter joins me  now. Mary, were you shocked when you heard they were closing schools for  the protest? </p><p>MARY LOPEZ CARTER, PARENT ANGRY OVER SCHOOL CLOSING:  I was beyond shocked  and beyond angry about this. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So what happened, so go ahead, Mary, tell us what happened. </p><p>CARTER:  Well, it was all over Twitter and Facebook and that's how I found  out about it. And then it just kind of spread from there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, you know, working parents, working moms, working dads. I  guess they unexpectedly had to take care of their children today, right. </p><p>CARTER:  Exactly. Here's the thing. Teachers -- teaching is a profession.  And if teachers want to be politicians then they should just leave their  profession and go run for office. But what we have here is that they're all  about their emotions, they're all about their ideology, and it supersedes  logic. </p><p>Any reasonable person would agree that holding children's education hostage  is really the wrong approach. It affects the -- it affects the families, it  affects the parents, it affects the children. It's this very disruptive.  And it affects poor children who rely on breakfasts and lunches at school. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, part of the school statement reads. \"We support and  appreciate our female workers. The decision to close schools with neither a  statement nor an endorsement of the demonstration. It was entirely about  our inability to insure the safety of students due to insufficient  staffing.\"</p><p>Now, Mary, you are for equal pay for women, I take it, right, and for, you  know, empowering women and getting women better jobs. And you know, doing -  doing the right thing for women. But what did you make of the school's  statement here? </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think frankly they're just lying. Because Durham Schools  which is Durham County is right next door to Chapel Hill-Carrboro, the  Orange County school system and they said they were going to open their  doors. They were not going to close the doors on the children. So they made  the decision that no, this is not acceptable and we are just going to keep  our doors open and continue with school as usual. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Why couldn't the schools just say, you know what, we're not  going to allow the request to be absent. Shouldn't it -- you know, do they  -- did that come up? </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think what is happening is that the administration is  fully supporting this. So the thing is, you are seeing this in blue  counties. And Chapel Hill-Carrboro Schools is in a very liberal area. And  we are seeing it now in Virginia and in Maryland. Again, blue counties. So  that tells you that's political. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mary, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.  Come back soon, OK? </p><p>CARTER:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, our very own Neil Cavuto has the first interview  with Trump's labor secretary nominee Andy Puzder since he withdrew his name  from his consideration. The details coming up, don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Our own Neil Cavuto has the first interview with former Trump  labor secretary nominee, Andrew Puzder since he withdrew his name from  consideration. Tune in tomorrow at 12 p.m. Eastern Time for this exclusive.</p><p>Well, thank you for having us in your homes.

More than a dozen women arrested as thousands of women staged what was supposed to be peaceful pro- women rallies and walkouts across the country for the controversial day without a woman protest. It turned into an anti-Trump march.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to Risk and Reward. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald, in for Deirdre Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Women across the country walked off the job. White collar workers, blue collar workers, government workers, and teachers. One teacher in Philadelphia says it's about demonstrating support for the value of women.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think this is a big year for us women. We need to prove that we are a big part of this economy and we're a big part of our nation. So, I'm glad that we could get together today and speak on behalf of that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: But was that always the case, because in order to show the vital role that women played in all fascist of this nation, the rally organizers said women must leave their jobs for the day to protest President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Trump does not have respect for women. But he also doesn't know the power of women. By the time why Trump and republicans to diminish women we know our value and we know that America doesn't function without us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Not every woman was on board with the statements like this. We have also working moms and working parents telling that they were struggling to get by and that they're now upset that their children were left stranded with some schools cancelling classes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm appalled that they just made this decision because people don't have the luxury like me and my family to have someone at home with the kids. Some people working two or three jobs, some people don't have the resources to hire a babysitter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: And it's not just teachers, government workers including house democrats whose salaries are paid with your tax dollars they walked off the job joining rallies in Washington, D.C. to show support. It's all part of a plan set by the organizers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wear red in solidarity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wear red in solidarity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The color red signifies revolutionary love.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Action and our pioneering spirit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Number two, strike.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Strike.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Strike.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do not engage in paid or unpaid work.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do not engage in paid or unpaid work.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Number three. Avoid spending money.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Avoid spending money.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With the exception of small, and women and minority- owned business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. You can agree or disagree with that. But while the protestors and organizers say they're about the moral authority of empowering women, among the organizers and speakers at these women marchers are three murderers. One a convicted terrorist involved in the murder of two students.</p><p>Another in (Inaudible) starts a homicide it was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. And still another convicted felon involved in the kidnapping, rape and murder of a gay man. Conspicuously missing from the list of the women inspiring marches like this.</p><p>Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, more on that coming up. My first guest is here to talk about how teachers were walking out to send and anti-Trump message.</p><p>Let's bring in Bre Payton, reporter for the Federalist. Bre, was this a woman's rally or an anti-Trump protest?</p><p>BRE PAYTON, THE FEDERALIST REPORTER: I think it's pretty clear tha this was an anti-Trump protest. The catalyst behind all these subsequent marches, and day without women, and strikes, and et cetera, et cetera, is Donald Trump's electoral victory, right, and I think pretending otherwise isn't really tricking anyone.</p><p>I think we all know that this is an anti-Donald Trump rally. And I think we know that a lot of these districts overwhelmingly vote -- the districts that closed the schools today they overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton. And in some cases they didn't really need to close the doors. They could have still let kids into the classroom and allowed parents to go to work today, right.</p><p>MACDONALD: But Bre, stay on that. Are you saying that your team found the schools did have enough workers to stay open but they still shut their doors today? Wasn't that stranding working families, including single moms who work?</p><p>PAYTON: Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. And I think a lot of the school districts are kind of enabling the strike instead of cracking down and saying no you need to show up for work. This is paid for and funded by taxpayer dollars. We need to provide the servants that we promised to provide to parents, instead of cracking down and being tough and doing their jobs, they decided to fold and enable teachers to allow then to protest the president, right. I mean, this is completely absurd.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Bre, when teachers and government workers don't show up don't pack -- taxpayers have to pay extra including for replacement workers? Yes, protesting is a fundamental American right. You know, women, of course you want to support women and getting the pay that they deserve. But should protests like this be done on one's own time, say on the weekend when taxpayers aren't stuck with the bill?</p><p>PAYTON: Right. I mean, I would definitely think that if you're a taxpayer funded worker, that is if your paycheck is being funded by taxpayer dollars, you should do this on your own time and you should make them pay for it, right. I mean, that's why we have a lot of laws like the amendment in place that prevents taxpayer funding from going to abortion, right.</p><p>It's like a moral clause. In order to keep taxpayers for having to pay for things that they don't agree with. I don't agree with this protest and I'm upset that my taxpayers --my taxpayer dollars, you know, went to fund this kind of enable this behavior.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Bre, you wonder if the parents as they agree with the teachers going to protest like this because protest organizers say that anyone questioning the goodness of communism, that communism acts should liberates people, or that Islam is really a feminist religion and it's good for women, anybody who says otherwise is an idiot or a racist. And they say capitalism is the problem when women are routinely brutalized under these regimes. What are your thoughts?</p><p>PAYTON: Right. Well, you know, my kid was in a classroom and a teacher called out to protest, to pay in this protest, I would think twice about sending them back to school the next day, right. And I myself I'm a product of home schooling because my parent didn't want to deal with indoctrinating in classrooms and teachers forcing an agenda down my throat, right.</p><p>So, I think a lot of parents are probably upset by this whole ideological battle that's being wage right now in classroom. And I think it's really unfair for, you know, 5-year-old kids to have to navigate or deal with this kind of propaganda that their teachers are pushing down their throats.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Bre, I mean, some of this is really just tweaks deep accusations. You know, you see the accusations of sexism, racism, take your `pickisms,' we get it. But they're letting in bad people like murderers and Islamists and communists. I mean, this really is a silly led by the sinister, right?</p><p>PAYTON: Yes. You're exactly right. And you know, this whole thing was supposed to be a grassroots-led movement. But it's pretty clear that it's not. It's pretty clear that there are very large organizations bankrolling this and that it is very well organize and that it is coming from the top down, right. It's not grassroots in any way, shape or form. And pretending that it is really just intellectually insulting.</p><p>MACDONALD: Bre Payton, you're always terrific. Please come back soon.</p><p>PAYTON: As always. I'll come back whenever.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Soon. Staying on this topic, the organizers of a day without women saying the women are encouraged to take the day off but avoid shopping.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Number three, avoid spending money.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Number three, avoid spending money.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With the exception of small, women and minority-owned businesses.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Some wondering if a group of men were protesting would not go shopping or wearing a color be on the list of things to do.</p><p>For that let's bring in the political power panel. Conservative Review Deneen Borelli, and democrat strategist Jennice Fuentes. Deneen, take off from work but don't work. Is that really the new feminist message?</p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW CORRESPONDENT: Liz, let me just tell you that I wore red today because I felt like it. I'm going shopping after this segment. And yes, I did work today. I was at the White House briefing. Liz, this is nothing but progressive activism women in skirts and dresses.</p><p>What people need to understand and realize is that America is an exceptional country. Anyone can succeed. We have women in all levels of all different jobs and responsibilities, whether it's television, entertainment, corporate America, you name it.</p><p>I worked hard to get where I am today to be on national television to talk about the policies and issues that I support. And for people to go out and protest industries the way that they are is absolutely ridiculous.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennice, it's good to see you. The question has been, why should women get to walk off work to prove that women are equal to everyone else not able to take the day off. Isn't that kind of illogical and inconsistent? To some it's really impassively absurd because they just don't think that that's the way to go. What are your thoughts?</p><p>JENNICE FUENTES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, there are short-term goals and there are long-term goals here. And I think that we all three of us women have the same goal in mind, in which we want to be treated like ladies but we want to get paid like men.</p><p>And I think that at this day and age it misses the biggest point, which most household in a family with children under 18 are led by women. And that woman makes at least 80 cents on the dollar that the men make. If that woman is a mother she makes 71 cents of that dollar that men makes. If that woman is a single mother she makes 58.</p><p>Whether you dress in red or you beg for some establishment who doesn't employ women and pay them right. This fight goes on beyond today. And that's what will unite all of us. Because at the end of the day women have to stand united to protect the wages. We have the real problem with that wage gap.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, Jennice.</p><p>FUENTES: And that absolutely needs to be solved.</p><p>MACDONALD: I hear exactly what you're saying. And in fact, yes, women should get paid equally as men. But Deneen, it seems like an anti-Trump protest. To Jennice's point, we've have a really bad economy where women are working multiple part-time jobs just to get by.</p><p>I mean, is this the way to go? It just seems that, you know, some of the things that they're saying at these marches are so off the wall about how communism is good and capitalism is bad. Go ahead.</p><p>BORELLI: Well, where were the protests with the Obama administration and females who got paid less than the male staffers under Obama's leadership. I mean, listen, this is where it's good to have smaller government, fiscal responsibility, and initiatives that will propel businesses to hire and grow their business and hire people, lower taxes, less regulations. These are the policies that President Trump is talking about in order to grow our economy and for job growth. And that is something that he ran on as president.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Let's switch gears. Protestors calling it a day for women, but was it just another anti-Trump protest?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We see women uncertain of their rights. We see anti- women and anti-abortion groups emboldened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Protestors saying they're worried about their rights. This as the president just signed two new laws helping NASA, and saying that NASA and to the NASA (Inaudible) nation, you know, push to get more women and girls involved in science math and related field.</p><p>Also, the president's daughter, Ivanka and the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with the president, they with a dozen CEO and business leaders to forge an international council women business leaders intending to support women in the workplace.</p><p>So, Jennice, I hear what they're saying about abortion and those rights and those issues. Setting that aside, I understand that. I get it. We're talking about economic growth and what you just said about women working part time. Is President Trump taking really taking away women's right when it comes to economic growth?</p><p>FUENTES: Well, they just say that I don't see anything that inspires me, or making me feel better about myself, for my nieces and for my sisters, and for men as well. I mean, we all have to stand united in here. But I would like to see very specific steps to help women, single women, especially and mothers, single mothers I meant, have a balance between work and family. Get those skills to basically grow their business. Get access to capital, get mentorship, get education.</p><p>It is very hard to make it in this world whether you have your own business or whether you work for others. And if you're a mom it's doubly hard. We already stay that you make 80 cents at the best situations, right?</p><p>BORELLI: Then you should with Trump policies...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennice, I hear what you're saying.</p><p>FUENTES: But you know what, I would like to see something very specific. And the women marching today have the right to be heard. That's what so great about our country.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Jennice.</p><p>FUENTES: Now one march alone is not going to change everything. You know that.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>FUENTES: We all agree on that. This continues and this needs follow-up and this needs consistencies with Congress where the fight really needs to be fought.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Deneen, go ahead.</p><p>BORELLI: Then you should be in accordance with the policies that President Trump is urging in urban communities where the schools are failing children and there is a high crime rates and there are high unemployment rates. And so what we need to do our better school choice initiative avenues and also incentivize businesses to reinvest in these communities so people are employed. Whether they are mothers, fathers, single parents, you name it.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Deneen and Jennice, thank you so much. You are going to be back later.</p><p>FUENTES: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now next up, is your TV, is your cell phone, even your car spying on you? WikiLeaks releasing a trove of documents showing how the CIA spies on you via your devices even if they are turned off.</p><p>A big name tech company's products have been allegedly compromised. We're talking Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft. They are upset and they're responding to the CIA. Hear what they have to say.</p><p>Also, can you guess which state is first out of the box trying to stop the president's refugee pause? The judge says that he would toss this suit due to its dubious assertions. He's going to explain that next, don't go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, (R) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: Look, this is early on in the investigation, but these appear to be very, very serious. We don't know who is responsible for this for what's happened in the latest WikiLeaks round. So, let's just leave it at that and let them come up and let them come out and brief you at the proper time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: WikiLeaks releasing a trove of CIA documents showing how it can spy on you via your devices. Now the leaks contain this. Techniques to break into smart phones, including iPhones using (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) listening devices, even if your TV is turned off. Instructions on how the CIA can use Skype, Wi-Fi networks, and anti-virus computer programs to spy on you as well. And details about how to steal your passwords over the internet.</p><p>Big tech companies like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft up and arms over WikiLeaks and CIA dump. They're mad at the CIA. Apple is saying this. \"While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched. We will continue to work rapidly to address any vulnerabilities.\"</p><p>Let's bring in the best expert around, the judge. Judge Andrew Napolitano. Are you worried about this?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: I'm terrified about it. You know, we've been saying for years that the mobile phones that we all carry around in our pockets which now you can't turn off are actually listening devices.</p><p>Now we also know that the microchip in the microwave in your kitchen can be used as a listening device. That certain televisions when they're turned off they only looked like off that can be used as a listening and a monitoring device.</p><p>Here is -- here is the problem. All of this is unlawful. The CIA is not permitted to ply its trade in the United States of America unless they are chasing somebody from outside the United States into the U.S. The government is spying on us without suspicion, without probable cause, and without a warrant from a judge.</p><p>That's un-American, unconstitutional and ineffective. It doesn't keep us safe. It produces information overload. It produces so much info...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: How much?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: If it were printers on ordinary printing paper like you have in front over here. It would be 27 times the size of the -- of the contents of the library of Congress every year since 2005. The government doesn't have the resources to go through all of that to look for the bad that's buried in the good.</p><p>That's the genius of the Constitution in the fourth amendment. The government is force to focus on people as to whom it has suspicion or believe a crime or a terrorist activity is occurring or is about to occur. When you focus on the bad people you leave everybody out alone. This is spying on everybody.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, but your point is, I hear your point. The argument is that we have to catch the terrorist here. The FBI is 900 active terror plots in all 50 states.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The FBI does not do this. The FBI, as far as I can tell you, and I've been monitoring and working with them within my ears in the bench for years. The FBI when they want to listen to a conversation or otherwise surveil you, goes to a judge and presents probable cause and gets a warrant.</p><p>MACDONALD: But what's the CIA doing? They trying to get terrorists?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The CIA is trying to gather all the information they can because their theory is if they gather everything it is more efficient than isolating the bad people. The problem with that is the Constitution requires the isolation of the bad people.</p><p>Go to <person><nameText>Fox News.</nameText></person>com the headline is \"FBI Searches for CIA mole.\" How about the headline is, \"FBI searches for CIA who have been spying on innocent Americans.\" That's what the FBI should be searching for. That's a felony to do it and WikiLeaks has demonstrated that it's been going on under our noses.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Where's the outrage?</p><p>MACDONALD: And all the leaks that are coming out of the government about spying on people in government. Wow.</p><p>Switching gears, here's the state that is first out of the box suing the Trump administration over its new refugee pause. It's Hawaii. Hawaii wants to fight it out in court, calling this version of the order a quote, \"Muslim ban.\"</p><p>Now the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii he's complaining. He is saying this. \"This new version in the executive order inflicts a grave injury on Muslims in Hawaii, including the imam, his family and members of the mosque.\" Judge, is this a Muslim ban?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It is not a Muslim ban. The government has removed all references to religion. It certainly falls disproportionately on Muslims but it is not written in order to keep Muslims out of the United States. The government articulates in the ban the reasons why the State Department has chosen these six countries.</p><p>It's really far more bulletproof than the first one is -- first one was. But this Hawaii lawsuit is filled with some of the most scurrilous attacks on President Trump that I have seen on a sitting president since the ending days of the, of Richard Nixon.</p><p>They have taken out of context the most incendiary things he said since long before he was even a candidate and trying to ascribe that to his motivation now. So they're taking something he said two and a half years ago and trying to say this is his motivation for today.</p><p>That's not an appropriate way for a court to evaluate the true motivation of the President of the United States. Because this is an area of the law uniquely given by the Constitution just to the president. It's foreign policy. He decides who our enemies are, he decides who our friends are. The Congress gives him tools. One of tools is temporary immigration bans. He's using those tools.</p><p>MACDONALD: If this came before you as a judge, what would you do?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, I would -- I would dismiss it. Because the State of Hawaii is the plaintiff here. And the State of Hawaii can't show that it is harmed. You can't go into federal court just because you don't like what the government did. You have to show how you are harmed. The state has not been harmed at all.</p><p>MACDONALD: Judge, you're great. Please come back soon. We love you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm just delighted to be able to work with you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Always great to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Especially when it starts this the day, starts here and then Stuart.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Stuart Varney and you have to do...</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Does Varney around somewhere?</p><p>MACDONALD: No, you have to do the queen's accents next time with Varney.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You got it.</p><p>MACDONALD: He loves it.</p><p>Next more, a sanctuary state fallout. An illegal immigrant repeatedly arrested. He was deported to Mexico five times. He's now charged in a deadly car crash in Los Angeles that killed a woman.</p><p>Also shockingly gruesome story involving another illegal immigrant. This time in North Carolina. That man accused of beheading his own mother. Next, the father whose daughter was killed by an illegal immigrant react, after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's just unbelievable. They had him handcuffed and he was just sitting there just like he didn't have a care in the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Last month Sandra Duran killed in Los Angeles by a drunk driver. The driver an illegal immigrant deported to Mexico five times before. He had been arrested and charged with more than 20 felonies and misdemeanors including gun and drug possession and driving under the influence.</p><p>Joining me now, John Pina, another father whose daughter was also killed by an illegal immigrant. Mr. Pina, we are so sorry for your loss, and we are so upset we are asking you to do this. But, please, we want to inform the viewer, what happened to your 14-year-old daughter. Can you tell us?</p><p>JOHN PINA, CHRISTY PINA'S FATHER: Yes. She was found February 8, 1990. (AUDIO GAP) stabbed in artichoke -- they threw her body in artichoke field in Castroville, California.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now, Mr. Pina, correct us if we're wrong, but is it true that an arrest warrant for this illegal immigrant was not issued until 17 years later? And in the meantime, he committed many more crimes? What happened? Where is he now?</p><p>PINA: Back in '87 he had kidnapped two 14-year-old girls. One in July, he got put in jail, got out. And in September he came back and did kidnapped another one. And he got out again. And then he came back and he murdered my daughter. And then a few months later he came back and tried to kidnap a 12-year-old at 7 o'clock in the morning. And he's supposedly, supposed to be incarcerated in Mexico for Christy's murder.</p><p>MACDONALD: Is he in jail in prison right now, sir?</p><p>PINA: That's what I heard last. But I haven't heard anything in almost a year. So, I really don't know. They haven't informed me, or they haven't contacted me for a while. So, I really don't know. I can't tell you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, it's absolutely disgrace and it's horrifying. We are so upset for you and your family.</p><p>PINA: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: And I got a story that came up, sir, we want to talk to you about it. In North Carolina an 18-year-old illegal immigrant charged this week with murder. Olivia Machado was decapitated by this man, her son. He decapitated his own mother with a butcher knife. Here's what he told authorities. He did it because he felt like it. Now he was taking medication for a psychosis schizophrenia. He was in the United States illegally. Should he have been deported, sir?</p><p>PINA: Well, he should never been here in the first place, and yes, he should have been deported. But now it's going to be kind of hard to get him deported because now the system is going to look at him and support him and take care of him while the taxpayers are out all that money. He should have never been here in the first place.</p><p>MACDONALD: Mr. Pina, how do you feel about what President Trump is doing versus what, how President Obama handled these problems.</p><p>PINA: Donald Trump, our President, I think is doing a great job. He's doing what he said he's going to do. I met with the man, he is sincere and he will accomplish what he set out to do.</p><p>MACDONALD: John Pina, thank you so much. And again, with your story, you are helping so many people across the country. It is so difficult and horrifying what you went through. But we're grateful you came on the show. Thank you again.</p><p>PINA: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Breaking news. Sources telling <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>that Jon Huntsman, Jr. will be the next U.S. ambassador to Russia. President Trump reportedly calling Mr. Huntsman two days ago to offer him the job, and apparently, Mr. Huntsman accepted.</p><p>This appointment comes as President Trump and his cabinet being scrutinized for alleged ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Next up, the results are in. The president crushing job expectation in his month in office. Find out how many U.S. jobs were added. It's a surprise and it was a surprise to Wall Street.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's going to bring all these jobs back? Well, how exactly is he going to do? What are you going to do? There is no answer to it. He just says, well, I'm going -- I'm going to negotiate a better deal. Well, how -- what -- how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.</p><p>Since my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Soft Bank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: President Trump's first full month in office bringing a massive employment boom. EDP reporting U.S. companies added a whopping 298,000 new jobs in February. That's 100,000 more jobs than Wall Street had predicted. That looks like 3 percent even 4 percent growth, to me, that's what the president promised.</p><p>The co-chair of America -- great -- excuse me -- the Great American Alliance, he's Eric Beach. He joins me now. Eric, what do you think of the blistering pace of jobs that were added last month?</p><p>ERIC BEACH, GREAT AMERICAN ALLIANCE CO-CHAIR: Look, I mean, the last two months has been the largest increase in job creation since September of 2015, and it's interesting, we talk about the promises that he ran on, now they're promises kept. So, I think, you know, much like the stock market the market doesn't lie. Job creation and job growth also doesn't lie. I think the president is just simply keeping his promises to the American people.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. The market likes -- it looks like it likes these policies. And companies are investing to create these jobs and these are good paying jobs, Eric. There are construction jobs up by 66,000. Manufacturing jobs up by 32,000.</p><p>President Obama repeatedly said, you know what, manufacturing jobs is not coming back. How is Trump going to do that? He can't do that. Was he wrong?</p><p>BEACH: He was wrong. And that's because he's never had a private sector job before. And so, I think what you're seeing is you really is a culture of confidence for the business community. For example, when Samsung is going to move and bring in -- relocate some of their operations into the U.S., you know, that's simply because maybe they are afraid of the border tax proposal. Maybe they just understand that there might a better corporate tax here inside the United States.</p><p>Whatever that might be, you know, the president is creating a culture of confidence and once again, the market sees that. Remember when the market was at 18,000 when he was elected. And we said, well, that was a psychological number for the Dow.</p><p>Well, today it's 21,000. It's grown 3,000 points. And again, the market, the business community, they understand that we have a business-friendly president and it's good for all Americans.</p><p>MACDONALD: But you know, NBC is already out with a headline, \"Fact check, how many jobs has the Trump created?\" It looks like the media is not ever going to give the president credit for any positive news.</p><p>BEACH: Well, they haven't. But that's not really the important thing. The media called the race wrong on November 8. The media continues to try to digress into different areas and say look, the president is not doing this, or it's private sector jobs.</p><p>When is the last time you heard he's only creating private sector jobs? When was the last time you've heard off? He's only creating private sector jobs. He's not really doing much for the public sector. But that's what he ran on.</p><p>The American people voted for Donald Trump for a variety of reasons. You know, they wanted to repeal and replace healthcare. They wanted to, you know, make sure we secure America first. And then also to create jobs and he's doing all three of those things right out of the box.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Reagan inherited, I think two recessions. He created something like 16 million or 17 million jobs. Clinton created 22 million jobs. So, President Obama keeps saying I inherited recession. He only created 10 million jobs, way worse than Reagan.</p><p>I think you guys look into it. And he created an ad than that highlight past presidents and their job performance. And also, not following through with their promises. What do you, how do you think President Trump will stack up?</p><p>BEACH: Look, I think it takes courage to be president. I think when he ran, you know, really the media and really a lot of the Washington elites, they said, you know, he really can't get those things done. We heard time and time again from both the punditry class as well as the democrats to say, he'll never really try to execute on this agenda.</p><p>Well, look, the group that we formed Great America Alliance, you know, we're out there to support the Trump agenda. Because voters overwhelmingly, especially the middle class voters in Wisconsin and in middle America and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, states in which he won, they have to understand that we got to have a better culture out there to make sure that the business -- you know, that's make sure it's business friendly.</p><p>And Donald Trump is bringing that to the table. His inauguration speech is one of the best speeches ever given. And I think he's going to execute on that. And it takes a lot of courage to execute on the agenda that a lot of the elites really have been trying to stymie.</p><p>MACDONALD: Eric Beach, always terrific. Come back soon, OK?</p><p>BEACH: Thanks for having me, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Sure. The fallout continues. It turns out that one of the organizers of todays without women, day without woman, rather, where women worked off their jobs. She is a convicted terrorist accused of helping to kill two students in Israel.</p><p>Now the nice of one of her victims is now speaking out. We have what she said after this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. As we discuss earlier in the show today's day without women is organized, help, basically supported by a convicted terrorist. Rasmea Odeh served 10 years in prison for her involvement in the 1969 terror bombing in Jerusalem which killed two Hebrew student.</p><p>Odeh was also later convicted at the immigration fraud. She basically didn't tell regulators here that she was involved in that bombing.</p><p>Now the niece of one of those victims speaking out condemning the protest for supporter a murderer saying it's a day without her father. Here's the quote. \"What is the difference between the act -- the acts of Omar Mateen, the Boston marathon bombers and Rasmea Odeh? There's no difference. They all carried out acts of terror in the name of their causes which resulted in the death of innocent civilians.\"</p><p>My political panel is back with me now, Deneen Borelli and Jennice Fuentes. Deneen, isn't having a convicted terrorist involved in these marches is a slap in the face of these victims, isn't that sending the wrong message?</p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and my heart goes out to the victims and their families. Listen, this is just absolutely off the charts outrageous, Liz. This is a convicted murder, a terrorist, a bomber who was basically been put on a pedestal.</p><p>I mean, what are the people who are involved in these events thinking to be praising someone with such a past? I mean, you can't ignore what this woman has done. And to put her, you know, on the pedestal to be praising her so to speak, I think speaks volumes. It's outrageous.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Jennice, the organizers and supporters also include the convicted felon Angela Davis, remember the communist party charge with homicide. Four people killed in that assault in the courtroom that she helped organized including a judge dead. Angela is in the middle of that shot.</p><p>Also Donna Hilton, she is a convicted felon along with others. She kidnapped a gay man and tortured him to death. I mean, isn't this contradictory to what the march stands for to have people like this involved?</p><p>JENNICE FUENTES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: That's where our court exists.</p><p>MACDONALD: No, I'm talking about the march. I'm talking about rally. What are these women involved?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES: You know what, I'll tell you -- I'll tell you what is an outrageous scandal. I think what is an outrageous scandal is that primary, and I go back to my point because this is what matters.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now, Jennice, just answer the question.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES: It's what -- no, no, no.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennice, I'm sorry. And please answer the question. Jennice.</p><p>FUENTES: Let me tell you what a scandal is this. The primary breadwinner...</p><p>BORELLI: She can't defend the murderer...</p><p>MACDONALD: Deneen, hang on. Jennice, answer the question. Jennice, answer the question. Isn't this going against what the march is about, having murderers involved?</p><p>FUENTES: The march is about women's parity in the workplace, isn't it. Its about equality. It's about the end of discrimination.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: So you're OK with these women being involved?</p><p>FUENTES: I didn't organize that march.</p><p>MACDONALD: Are you -- are you OK with being involved?</p><p>FUENTES: I'll have (Inaudible) because the courts will have a fine of the crimes of those women...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORELLI: That answers your question, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>BORELLI: She is OK with it.</p><p>FUENTES: No. Listen, you're trying to create a big distraction to what scandal is this. No, you're trying to create a distraction.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: No, no, no. I'm asking you a flat-out question. Is it OK to have murders involved?</p><p>FUENTES: You guys are two women. Do you think it's fair that women have to wait 44 years to have pay parity with men?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: We understand what you're saying.</p><p>FUENTES: Really? Is that what I should interpret your silence to try to deviate the question to that? It's nonsense.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Jennice, we hear what you're saying.</p><p>FUENTES: You're trying to create a distraction here.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennice, is it OK -- Jennice, thank you, we appreciate that. Just hang on one second. Deneen, is it OK to have -- what kind of message does it have, does this bring -- to have three women who are convicted felons involved in murders, involved in a march.</p><p>BORELI: Yes, it's horrible. And for your guest to not even address your question, is this really outrageous. She's bought into it. These people are murderers, they're terrorists...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES: Excuse me, no.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennice, hang on. Jennice, sorry.</p><p>FUENTES: You seemed to be distracted by that nonsense.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennice, Jennice, Jennice...</p><p>BORELLI: You can't even answer the question.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennice, we let you answer. We're going to let Deneen answer. Go again, Deneen.</p><p>BORELLI: Right. So these people are murderers, they're terrorists, they've been convicted. And for them to be on a pedestal just like I said before is absolutely outrageous. And it speaks volumes to people like your guest Jellice or whatever her name is. And people who are allowing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FUENTES: My name is Jennice.</p><p>BORELLI: ... these individuals to have a voice is outrageous. What about the family members of the people who were murdered and killed. Innocent people, nine people were murdered and two were killed with this Rasmea woman. It's outrageous.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. You know, Jennice, do stay with me one second.</p><p>BORELLI: And you should be ashamed to yourself.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennice, two names missing to the list.</p><p>FUENTES: No. Excuse me. Can I address that?</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennice, please?</p><p>FUENTES: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: Why were Hillary Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren not listed among the women inspiring the events?</p><p>FUENTES: I wasn't an organizer and I cannot -- I cannot comment on that. I agree that if you've been convicted of a crime, you shouldn't be put in charge of any event that is public that is trying to inspire the message. But do not interpret my comments to be supporting criminals. That is what's absurd.</p><p>And to be sidelining the issue at hand, which is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm not sideling the issue. Jennice, hang on.</p><p>FUENTES: ... the gap parity. Yes, it is.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennice, forgive me. We're just asking you if you support murderers and it took -- it took you five about minutes to answer the question.</p><p>FUENTES: Excuse me, ladies.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's switch gears. Over the weekend in Berkeley...</p><p>FUENTES: We were preceded by a segment above the markets.</p><p>MACDONALD: Sorry, Jennice, we're going to move on. We are going to have to cut your mic, Jennice if you don't stop. Now over the weekend in Berkeley 10 were arrested at pro-Trump rallies where rioters clash with the president supporters. And we have a pro-Trump mother who was accosted. She spoke out last night. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EVA PETERS, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Most of the protesters actually were just coming up to me and, you know, throwing the f bomb, f you, f Trump. They were very just rude, asking me why I liked Trump. He was a racist. That means I'm a racist. Telling me to get out of Berkeley. I don't belong there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Jennice, what do you -- what do you make of the violence at protests like that. I mean, people really getting, it looked like they're getting hurt at those Berkeley protests, Jennice. Do you agree with that?</p><p>FUENTES: No, of course not.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>FUENTES: Violence is unacceptable at any level. And the fact that that's happening could not, that could not. And I feel bad for law enforcements, I feel bad for protesters who want to protest peacefully. Because you can disagree and still be very peaceful about it.</p><p>So, of course, nobody in their right mind would agree with having violence. Nothing. Violence could lead to nothing good. And I think all the three of us can agree on that.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Jennice, notice the color Deneen and I'm wearing, it's red. Deneen Borelli and Jennice Fuentes, thank you so much for your time.</p><p>BORELLI: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Next up, a day without women protests, the fallout continues. Residents of one North Carolina town blindsided after a school in their district decided to close for the day without woman protest. An angry resident and school district parent Mary Lopez Carter speaks out next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm appalled that they just made a decision because people don't have the luxury like me and my family to have someone at home with the kids. Some people working on two and three jobs. Some people don't have the resources to hire a babysitter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Residents of a North Carolina town upset after a school in their district decided to close for the day without women protest. The school cancelled classes calling today a teacher work day.</p><p>An angry resident and school district parent, Mary Lopez Carter joins me now. Mary, were you shocked when you heard they were closing schools for the protest?</p><p>MARY LOPEZ CARTER, PARENT ANGRY OVER SCHOOL CLOSING: I was beyond shocked and beyond angry about this.</p><p>MACDONALD: So what happened, so go ahead, Mary, tell us what happened.</p><p>CARTER: Well, it was all over Twitter and Facebook and that's how I found out about it. And then it just kind of spread from there.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, you know, working parents, working moms, working dads. I guess they unexpectedly had to take care of their children today, right.</p><p>CARTER: Exactly. Here's the thing. Teachers -- teaching is a profession. And if teachers want to be politicians then they should just leave their profession and go run for office. But what we have here is that they're all about their emotions, they're all about their ideology, and it supersedes logic.</p><p>Any reasonable person would agree that holding children's education hostage is really the wrong approach. It affects the -- it affects the families, it affects the parents, it affects the children. It's this very disruptive. And it affects poor children who rely on breakfasts and lunches at school.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, part of the school statement reads. \"We support and appreciate our female workers. The decision to close schools with neither a statement nor an endorsement of the demonstration. It was entirely about our inability to insure the safety of students due to insufficient staffing.\"</p><p>Now, Mary, you are for equal pay for women, I take it, right, and for, you know, empowering women and getting women better jobs. And you know, doing - doing the right thing for women. But what did you make of the school's statement here?</p><p>CARTER: Well, I think frankly they're just lying. Because Durham Schools which is Durham County is right next door to Chapel Hill-Carrboro, the Orange County school system and they said they were going to open their doors. They were not going to close the doors on the children. So they made the decision that no, this is not acceptable and we are just going to keep our doors open and continue with school as usual.</p><p>MACDONALD: Why couldn't the schools just say, you know what, we're not going to allow the request to be absent. Shouldn't it -- you know, do they -- did that come up?</p><p>CARTER: Well, I think what is happening is that the administration is fully supporting this. So the thing is, you are seeing this in blue counties. And Chapel Hill-Carrboro Schools is in a very liberal area. And we are seeing it now in Virginia and in Maryland. Again, blue counties. So that tells you that's political.</p><p>MACDONALD: Mary, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. Come back soon, OK?</p><p>CARTER: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up, our very own Neil Cavuto has the first interview with Trump's labor secretary nominee Andy Puzder since he withdrew his name from his consideration. The details coming up, don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: Our own Neil Cavuto has the first interview with former Trump labor secretary nominee, Andrew Puzder since he withdrew his name from consideration.

We can see these goals detailed in the privacy policies and terms of service that we \"agree\" to as well as companies' increasingly complicated systems of privacy dashboards, permissions and sharing controls.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This approach has failed us. Too often it has resulted in little more than threadbare privacy protections and cluttered inboxes. The control that companies promise us over our data ends up illusory and overwhelming. And even when they act transparently, they don't embrace the privacy reforms we need.</p><p> And so, over the past decade, we've witnessed a cascade of high-profile privacy failures: the Edward Snowden disclosures, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, fake news and data breach after data breach after data breach. Big tech platforms and shadowy advertising companies make their fortunes while the rest of us are watched, nudged, exploited and exposed to cyberattacks and the manipulation of our political systems.</p><p> There's a better way, but it requires us to reimagine the relationship between consumers and online companies in a way that places trust at the center. Being trustworthy in the digital age means companies must be discreet with our data, honest about the risk of data practices, protective of our personal information and, above all, loyal to us \u2014 the data subjects. And it's up to our lawmakers to make it happen.</p><p>Congress stands alone among Western democracies in failing to pass a general privacy law covering all our information. The Federal Trade Commission has worked hard to be the top U.S. privacy cop, but it lacks the legal tools and financial resources needed to do the job.</p><p> The world is watching, and the economic stakes are enormous. International data flows are essential for the global economy to function without fundamentally \u2014 and expensively \u2014 restructuring the internet. American tech companies depend on being able to smoothly bring Europeans' data here for processing, but in 2015, a European court ruled that U.S. privacy protections were so poor that it struck down the Safe Harbor agreement, which helped enable an international flow of data. Our current data-sharing agreement with Europe, called the E.U./U.S. Privacy Shield, also seems destined to fail. If it does, we will need a good replacement.</p><p> Despite the failures of our current online privacy ecosystem, some lawmakers are considering doubling down on policies that do not work. But no matter how much control companies give us over our data, it will never work online. That's because control and transparency place the burden on consumers to protect themselves and understand where their data is going. And they must do this for every one of the dozens (or more) online accounts they may have.</p><p> So let's try something different. Consider the newly introduced legislation from Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) called the Data Care Act of 2018, for which we provided feedback in its draft form. The bill, one of the first and most significant moves to establish a new American privacy identity, favors three key non-waivable obligations for companies that use the internet to collect personal information: duties of care, loyalty and confidentiality. These duties are modeled on the privacy requirements for any fiduciary, such as doctors, lawyers or accountants \u2014 all of whom are legally required to act in good faith on behalf of their patients or clients and are bound to keep our disclosures safe and confidential.</p><p> Schatz's legislation would apply more broadly, compelling tech companies to be discreet and secure, discouraging manipulative practices and keeping companies from elevating their short-term profits over our long-term interests. In other words, the bill would require such companies to act more like doctors than telemarketers. The bill would also give regulators the resources they need to enforce privacy protections and prohibit companies from using dense terms-of-use agreements to get us to waive those obligations. Companies would have to be trustworthy regardless of what we \"agree\" to online.</p><p> It's time to take a bold step forward. The United States has an opportunity to redefine itself as the country that protects the trust that people give to companies. By embracing trust, the United States can become a leader on privacy instead of following the path of false promises and diminishing returns. Call it legal innovation, if that's what it takes. But whatever we call it, the United States can pave the way for a safe, sustainable and profitable digital future.</p><p>Woodrow Hartzog is a professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University.

Marlene Malik was to join us, Fred's wife of 57 years, but sadly can't be here.  But I know that she and their family send best regards for a successful event and ongoing support for the Nixon Center and the Wilson Center.   </p><p>Hugh Hewitt, President of the Nixon Foundation, and an old friend from our press days and press conversations in--in--in--past--past decades, is here to introduce today's events, as well as to introduce our first keynote speaker.   </p><p>So, one last point.  This whole conversation today is designed, and I know, Hugh endorses this, to prevent to--present different views on China.  The Wilson Center is strictly nonpartisan.  That space has brought us enormous attention worldwide, we're ranked by our peers number one in regional expertise.  And in that spirit, it is really a pleasure to introduce Hugh, and to introduce a fascinating day.  Welcome to Hugh Hewitt. </p><p>HEWITT: Thank you, Congresswoman Harman.  As the Congresswoman mentioned, I--she and I go back to 1992, when I hosted a Los Angeles PBS show and she is the equal of any member who has ever represented any part of California.  And she would come and sit down with us and engage in the kind of conversations we're going to have today, frank, full, a lot of free flowing and full of facts as opposed to merely heat and light.   </p><p>I thought I would remind our audience at the beginning, in 1971, when the Wilson Center was founded, President Nixon spoke at its dedication.  He was introduced by Hubert Humphrey at that moment.  He recalled at that time, \"My mother and father were both Republicans\", said RN in 1971.  \"California was the state,\" as you recall, I'm sure not many people did but he said it, \"That decided the Election of 1916.  The reason was that a number of Republicans voted for Wilson.\"   </p><p>The President continued, \"My mother was one of them.  She was a devout Quaker, a dedicated pacifist.  I was only three years old in 1916, the President continued, but for years afterwards, in a friendly way, my mother and father sometimes spoke of that election, as my father had voted for Hughes.  But my mother, despite the fact that America did get into the war in 1916, always had her faith in Woodrow Wilson.   </p><p>She used to say that he was a good man.  He was a good man who believed deeply in peace.  And she believed that the United States made an error at the conclusion of World War I in not following his initiative in the League of Nations.  He inspired her with his idealism, and she in turn passed that inspiration on to me\", end the quote of President Nixon.   </p><p>I also want to join Congresswoman Harman in recognizing that Fred Malik made this conference possible, he conceived of it, it was his idea that the Center and the Foundation work together.  Indeed, Marlene and I were talking at a recent event honoring Mrs. Nixon over at the White House Historical Association, how passionate Fred was about this particular partnership.   </p><p>Julian Tricia said at the time that Fred died that no single individual had done more to preserve the good work and memory of President Nixon than Fred Malik, who is very much missed and today is very much about him.   I want to conclude with two points, before we introduce our guest speaker, our honored speaker this morning.  The first is I went to work for Richard Nixon in 1978, fresh out of college in San Clemente the elbow of America at that time, and got to spend a remarkable two years, hours and hours and hours listening to him talking about the world.   </p><p>He was writing a book at that time called The Real War and it was followed by Leaders.  I have no doubt his grandson, Christopher Cox, who is with us this morning, if your grandfather was still working on books, his next one would not be called The Real War.  It would be called The Real Competition and it would be about the U.S.-PRC, and how that competition is going to be managed, and the coalition that Dr. Kissinger writes about in--on China evolves.   </p><p>I'm also confident that his second book, Leaders. would still include, as the first one did, Mao and Zhou Enlai, for whom there are bronze life size replica statues at the library in Yorba Linda, because of his great esteem for their willingness to take the same risks that Winston Lord and Henry Kissinger and President Nixon took long ago, in the--in the early '70s.   </p><p>I want to close by quoting Frank Garren is here, President Nixon's colleague in the writing of RN, and also in some extraordinary interviews he did in 1988.  Frank asked President Nixon in 1980 about China.  And the President said, \"Reflecting on what had begun 15 years earlier, once that power of China is mobilized it is going to be an enormous force in the world for good or for bad.  I think de Gaulle hit it in usually his right way in 1969 most effectively, when he said cryptically 'better to recognize China now when they need you than wait until later when their power is such that you will need them'.\"   </p><p>With that now let me introduce our guest and honored speaker this morning, David Stilwell is the Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.  Prior to his appointment as the Assistant Secretary on June 20, 2019 he served in the Air Force for 35 years, for that we are grateful.  Beginning as an enlisted Korean linguist at 19, I don't know want to get the year '80, and he retired in 2015 as a Brigadier General, after multiple tours in Asia, in Japan, Korea as a fighter pilot, a linguist and as a commander.   </p><p>He also served as the Defense Attache at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.  And later went on to serve on the China Strategic Force Group at the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii from '17 to '19.  He's an Adjunct Senior Fellow with the East West Center in Honolulu for those three years.  He graduated from the Air Force Academy, got his Master's Degree in Asian Studies from the University of Hawaii, a Graduate of the Executive Leadership Program from the Darden School at the University of Virginia.   </p><p>He was awarded the Department of Defense Superior Service Award in 2015.  He speaks Korean, Chinese, a limited amount of Japanese so he has that against him.  But other than that, we can't have a better person to open our day today, Assistant Secretary Stilwell.  Thank you. </p><p>STILWELL: Well I appreciate that.  And it's going to be really tough to live up to that intro, but I will do my best.  Thanks for the opportunity to speak to a group of people that I've always wanted to get to meet personally.  Robert Daley and Stapleton Roy and others have done me the service of giving me time to share ideas and help adjust my vision and the--and I can feed that into the Administration's vision for where we want to go with this Asia Pacific relationship.   </p><p>China's a--a large part of that, but, you know, our own strategy and our relationships with the region are equally important.  But today we're going to focus on U.S.-China and also mostly on the U.S. strategy.   </p><p>I don't have all the answers.  I've done some outreach with a number of you, I will continue to do that to hear other thoughts.  I want to hear people who dis--just don't want to be that guy that's trudging down the--the wrong path, you know, let 100 flowers bloom since we're in this room.  I won't kill you when it's over though. </p><p>I want to start off with a quote, and I won't tell you who--whose quote it is.  I know many of you know who it is.  But it was--it was surprising me, for me to hear this language.  The quote is this, \"We must have a deep appreciation for capitalism's ability to self-correct and a full objective assessment of the real long-term advantages that the developed Western nations have in the economic, technological and military spheres.\"   </p><p>Again, I'll address the rest of this quote later when we get done.  But I think that's a very important assessment of the strengths of these--of what we represent here in, not just the United States, but in the liberal democratic world.   </p><p>Matt Potter was going to open this, and he shared me with his notes.  I can't give Matt's speech. I'm giving my own.  But he--he typically notes the three myths that have come to light that we need to discuss.  First that is engagement with the PRC will lead eventually to some sort of liberalization or an accommodation.  The second that the Chinese Communist Party's goal is simply to remain in power, to survive.  The third is that ideology no longer matters.   </p><p>Again, Ambassador Roy and I had a--a good conversation in getting ready for this event.  And you know, nothing's black and white.  Yeah you can throw these at the straw man.  But I do think we need to address these in our--as we adapt our relationship here.   </p><p>A lot of us have come to the conclusion throughout, I mean, certainly for last 10 or 20 years, we've come to our own understanding of these three ideas.  For me, you know, while I was Defense Attache in Beijing, I went there with full--full intention of helping bring the PLA and the --the Chinese government, you know, expose them to the wonderfulness of what we do.  And then bring them into what we would consider a more long term and--and more mutually beneficial relationship. </p><p>As happens with a lot of people who go to the embassy and then come back, I came back disappointed in the complete inability to--to make changes and to affect that system.  In large part due to the--the restricted nature of our interaction.  Where, you know, we were limited with who we could engage in the Chinese government and in society in general.  And that has only continued that limited--limitation on engagement.   </p><p>And--and I think that is probably, if you take anything away from this conversation, that--that to me is something that has to be addressed.  If we're going to, if this relationship is going to grow in a productive way, we're going to have to have an open conversation.  And you don't have that by limiting access.   </p><p>So, engagement is obviously an important aspect to this.  But the relationship and the Administration's perspective on U.S.-China relations right now is one of competition, strategic competition.  And that is simply a realizing that, you know, if--if you're playing ping pong and one side is competing the other side is competing, it is defined as a competitive game, you are competing.  You can't, you know, the--the side that's--that is competing defines a relationship.   </p><p>The realization I think in general came about in 2013 with several speeches.  For me it was 2012, during the 18th Party Congress.  Then those ideas with the advent of a new leader came to fruition in 2013.  And again this is where I'm going to pull some quotes here from Xi Jinping's speech in January of that year, where it became obvious that, you know, we're charting in our own path and we're going into direction, we the PRC, that is different than what many of us assumed, and we we're going to have to change our approach to that.   </p><p>Look, if there's anything, so I was in the previous Administration in uniform, and--and you--you can--I think being slow to anger and giving everybody the best possible chance, you know, to--to clarify and understand is a great strength.  And--and I think we did that very well.  But it has come down now to the point where we have to acknowledge that the relationship is different than we assumed.   </p><p>And so, the response by the--the Trump Administration is and the specific strategy, talks about three pillars.  We're going to address the security; the defense guy knows what that's all about.  That's probably the most mature part of this.  The second part we're going to address prosperity or the economic aspects of this relationship.  I think we all know what that looks like.   </p><p>But the third one is governance.  We have not really thought about governance.  And governance takes you back to ideology and--and basic, the nature of who you are national character.  Again, this came to me when--in a meeting in Beijing in 2014, with the PLA Navy.  I was handed a copy of the gov--governance of China, Xi Jinping's, you know, book, volume one.  I had then volume two. </p><p>And as you read that, it becomes clear that the concepts are different, fundamentally different.  And again, acknowledging that and reading those differences and understanding where the Chinese Communist Party is going is important.  So, I'm going to talk just briefly about what governance means.   </p><p>So, missed two and three about the perpetuation, or simple existence of the Chinese Communist Party, and that ideology--ideology isn't really a function here, going back to the end of history thoughts.  I think need to be addressed.  The language you hear in--in most speeches now is about natural--a national rejuvenation fishing.  Nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with the Chinese wanting to stand up and--and be proud and grow to their greatest potential.  You know, the issue I have is the way we're going about doing that.   </p><p>So again, it's not about survival of the party, it's about achieving what China is capable of achieving.  The Chinese Work Report, the 19th Party Congress Work Report 2017, mentions, you know, Chinese return to the--being near the center of the world's stage.  And there's other language that I'll quote here that addresses that intent of becoming not just regionally vibrant and--and significant, but globally significant.   </p><p>That explains a lot of what you're seeing outside of the--the Asia Pacific region.  But I think idealize--ideology matters and liberal democracy, my opinion, is a direct threat to a more authoritarian approach, is which, what we're seeing out of Beijing.  Hong Kong.  Hong Kong's a great example of what--what you had as a, I won't say entirely democratic, but a--a system where people had a voice and they had a choice.   </p><p>And we're going from one party two systems into a--a system that increasingly is going to make Hong Kong look just like the mainland, taking away that voice and we-re--we're again we're seeing how you--it's really difficult to put empowering the people and people who have at least some impact on how they're governed and--and bring them back into this more, as I would put it, a lower on the Maslow Hierarchy of needs, more subsistence type of--of governance.   </p><p>So, since ideology matters, I think we need to get back to fundamental Western or at least American ideology.  And that comes from of course the Declaration of Independence.  \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men are created equal.\"  It's a short phrase but it means a lot, that they are endowed with certain unalienable rights, life, liberty, and the pursuit of--pursuit of happiness.  </p><p>I mean, we-- we all know these things intuitively.  But then I started reading, you know, I read on, that one we memorize, but that the securities rights, governments are instituted by men, deriving governments, derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.   </p><p>This is the key difference is, in the one case, if--if you look back at, you know, Chinese history.  I certainly don't have a great handle on it, but I think I've seen enough to understand, let's go back to the issue with Xinjiang right now.   </p><p>The government says that what's going on in Xinjiang is counterterrorism, and that we are absolutely addressing human rights in Beijing.  And--and I--first you say that's being cynical, but in fact, they--I think they really do believe that.  Because they're addressing the rights of the many without necessarily regarding the--the rights of the few. </p><p>When they talk about human rights, and I'm not making it, I mean this is written.  Human rights are accessed to--or to the ability to prosperity and security.  You're avoiding the Chinese--the historical bent toward chaos, famine, poverty and all the rest.  So, in this sort of inverted governance model, the governance is providing for the people their human right to, you know, three square meals a day and the chance to get rich.   </p><p>It's--it's hard to disagree with that, but on the other hand, that does not comport with what we believe in that the human rights are individual.  And that's what we sign when we signed the UN Charter, individual human rights.  The rest of that we can deal with in a broader, more liberal government model.  So, I think we really should, as we have this conversation, reflect on who we are, what we stand for.  And I think that helps clarify the differences.   </p><p>The President, in terms of Hong Kong, they said it many times they want--they want liberty, they want democracy, they want what they had.  So, this sets up the--the strategic competition that we've been talking about.  And so, I would like to briefly address strengths and weaknesses.   </p><p>On the strengths side, the--the great news is that the U.S. isn't the only place in the world where we recognize the--the importance of individual human rights, of--of a government that supports the people instead of the other way around.  And we have lots of folks in Europe, Japan, Korea, I mean, you name it Southeast Asia, democracies who are, you know, of the same beliefs.   </p><p>So, having likeminded allies and partners is a, I mean, if you want to run a tally sheet about how both sides stack up, I think you'll see that the--the weight of history is on the side of liberal governance.   </p><p>On the other hand, open liberal systems have weaknesses, which can be at times both weaknesses and strengths, but in a competition a weakness of being an open system we're discovering, we're, you know, learning again, leaves--leaves you open to things like adverse messaging, you know, we--we don't have a propaganda arm.  So, you hear many voices coming out of Washington, D.C.  And that's great, right?  Let--let 100 flowers bloom. Let's have a conversation here instead of having a single party line, which again works against us in some cases, but I think over time is one of our--our great strengths. </p><p>We have fallen short I think in messaging who we are, what we stand for, what our ideals and values are.  That's one of my goals is to better message.  Again, a positive message of who we are, I don't want to keep pointing everything back to the other side.  I just want to help people understand why we--who we are how we got here.   </p><p>So, I've kind of quickly gone over our values.  I just want to note, here's what the other side believes.  And then Ambassador Roy and I are hap--happily having a conversation just now about we--we both recognize this document and these quotes as extremely relevant.   </p><p>So, the--to quote, \"Chinese Communist Party takes the historical materialist view that capitalism is bound to die out, and socialism--socialism is bound to win.  The eventual demise of capitalism and the ultimate victory of socialism will require a long historical process to reach completion.\"  It's not going to happen overnight, but we do have two goals 2021 and 2049, two centenary goals that I think that they're working to achieve those.   </p><p>So, all along we've been slow to realize, over time, with a very positive Western hope that the other side would recognize the value here.  We've been slow to recognize we're in competition, hoping to achieve our objectives through cooperation.   </p><p>I'm here to say that this--we are now in a strategic competition that does not obviate cooperation in any way.  As I said earlier, we just, you probably read last night that we announced that we're going to ask Chinese diplomats in the U.S. to notify us in advance before they go speak to our universities, our governors, mayors and municipal folks.  We're not going to say no, we just want to have an idea who they're talking to.   </p><p>And this is in response to how, again, having been there we, American diplomats are treated in China where you don't ask permission.  I mean you don't notify; you ask permission to go engage with these folks.  And you're frequently denied that.  The goal is not to, you know, cut off communication., the goal is to lower barriers to communication, to make sure both sides are having that--that discussion.  We can talk about that during the Q&amp;A if anybody has any questions on that. </p><p>The--if anybody's read Silent Invasion, Clive Hamilton, if you've looked at the Australian Experience with Malcolm Turnbull, John Garnaut, I think you understand what the--the Chinese approach has been.  It's been a very long-term deliberate approach over decades to take advantage of open systems, and then use, them manipulate them and--and adjust them, so they are not hostile to this new type ideology.   </p><p>If you look inside the Australian system, you found many, lots of evidence of that and they are busy creating laws about, you know, accepting foreign money and--and the rest.  And so, I'm characterizing all this in--in terms of my response and the administration's response is simply housekeeping.  I mean, there's broken glass on the floor from years and years of--of hope.  And we're just going to try to sweep up--sweep up to, that--that glass, get this relationship on a true even footing and--and then move out from there.  We're not trying to cut off contact, we're trying to increase contact--contact.   </p><p>So, in summary, our goal here is a region that is strong, sovereign and prosperous.  And our goal is also a relationship with China that is fair and reciprocal.  With Beijing living up to its many commitments.  Commitments like the Convention on Law of the Sea World Trade Organization.  It's joint declaration with Hong Kong, 50 years of autonomy and others.   </p><p>And the goal to do that--in order to--we asked them to live up to these commitments, because in my mind there's a--an equation here.  You've got words, that's these commitments you signed up to, and then you have actions, what you actually do.  And words times actions equals trust.  Trust is a result of stating what you're going to do, following through with what you're going to do, and you can't have trust without that.  Words alone, talk is cheap.   </p><p>So finally, I'm going to finish off with the quote the rest of that--that document here from 2013.  Just to identify major differences in these approaches, and I'll open up to questions.  So \"In the meantime, we must have a deep appreciation for capitalism's ability to self-correct,\" I mentioned this already, \"and a full objective assessment of the real long-term advantages that the developed Western nations have an economic, technological and military spheres.  Then we must diligently prepare for a long period of cooperation, end of conflict between these two social systems in each of these domains.   </p><p>For a fairly long time yet socialism, in its primary stage will exist alongside a more productive and developed capitalist system.  In this long period of cooperation and conflict, socialism must learn from the boons that capitalism has brought to civilization.  We must face the reality that people will use the strengths of developed Western countries to denounce our country's socialist development.   </p><p>Here we must have a great strategic determination, resolutely rejecting all false arguments that we should abandon socialism.  We must consciously correct the various ideas that do not accord with our current stage.  More importantly, we must concentrate our efforts on bettering our own affairs, continually broadening our comprehensive national power, improving the lives of our people, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and laying a foundation for a future where we will win the initiative and have the dominant position.   </p><p>There are people who believe that communism is an unattainable hope, or even that it is beyond hoping for, that communism is an illusion.  We should educate and guide the cadres in the broader mass of party members so that--that we can unite in our common ideal of practicing socialism of Chinese characteristics together with our lofty ideal of securing communism.   </p><p>We will be able to adhere to the correct political orientation, stand without arrogance and victory, without despair and adversity, and during all sorts of risk and adversity, consciously resisting the corrosion of decadent philosophies, forever fostering the political essence of a communist.\" </p><p>This is the challenge we face.  Thank you.  Subject to your questions.  Wow I killed it.  Sir.   </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much.  That was a wonderful presentation.  My name is Albert Keitel.  I was in the Treasury Department running the Asia office and was at the China desk for a while, and I'm now teaching the Chinese Economy at GW.  I travel to China and speak there frequently, just--just recently in May.  </p><p>I wanted to come back though to something that isn't so China centric and talk about ideology and ask you this question.  That there are democracies around the world, many of them seem to be dominated by elites.  And so the freedom of the individual needs, in one version of sort of 19th century liberalism, to be free from sort of the interference of those that have privileged access to enhance their freedoms, so that you're getting ability on the part of those with either wealth or genius to organize their rights and you get what we call in economics an unstable equilibrium where it spirals in the direction of inequality.   </p><p>The United States, there's a bit of controversy about Citizens United.  And so, the fundamental Chinese ideology is that that process of private wealth or private power, running an economy and running a country for its own benefit, is something that they seem to think they are a counter to.   </p><p>So, I wonder how--how can we fit into our sense of individual rights, limitations on the ability of some to abuse those individual rights for their own benefit when they have the capacity to do so? </p><p>STILWELL: Right.  That--that raises a couple of interesting points that we're dealing with right now.  I--I--I'm a foreign policy guy.  I can't really speak to domestic issues.  But I will note that inequality, OK from the 19th Party Congress Work Report, the number one contradiction in the PRC is uneven development.  The fact that all the wealth is concentrated on the coasts and that the hinterland is still dirt poor. </p><p>I know China rem--remedied that through a top down authoritarian system.  And I got to ask how is that going?  It's actually getting worse.  Liberal democracies as far as the--the--the disparity, the gap, this--this true communism that Xi Jinping I just quoted, would mean everybody -- </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>STILWELL: Okay--okay--okay, but--but-- </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>STILWELL: I--granted.  Okay, okay--so, forgive me for the broad brush but I--my point is that this system and this authoritarian system was supposed to allocate resources in a way that everybody was relatively equal.  And we're seeing it's not quite working in terms of a communist, you know, true communist, you know, true communism diff--definition.   </p><p>What--what I would note since you mention elite and vulnerability, is that there are many types of democracy and--and, but people--people will have a voice.  And I point to Hong Kong and there are others where, Malaysia is another great example, the election that got Najib out of power and brought Mahathir to Malaysia.  Addressed some issues that were--that people, they had a voice and they were able to make decisions.  Does it happen overnight, change doesn't happen, it's--it's a slow process.  Got to be patient.   </p><p>But what the other system does do is it does target elites.  And this is where we have problems with, you--you know, funneling, as John Garnaut says, covert, coercive or corrupting resources.  Money, right more money, more problems, into governments that are at some stage of democratic development.  And elites line their pockets and--and helping themselves to what should have been benefits for their own people.   </p><p>Again, happy to work with those folks.  And, you know, our goal, and I think you would agree, is always to live up to our ideals.  They're--they're unachievable, they're--they're very lofty ideals and where humans are there are going to be failings.  But our goal is to continue to attempt and try to live up to those.   </p><p>And that's what I hope to do in this job.  I know I didn't get at the--the direct question, but again, I don't want to comment on domestic policy, if I don't have to. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Secretary.  My name is Genie Nguyen, Voice of Vietnamese Americans.  Thank you for this presentation.  I would like to ask you and this administration about the lesson we learn from Vietnam.  And is similar it has come around with the South China Sea, and the situation in Turkey with the Kurds.  I'm surprised that this Nixon Forum did not invite Vietnam or any representative from Vietnam, and the Vietnamese refugee.  And also, the Southeast Asians, especially the Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge, where four millions people were killed as an-- </p><p>STILWELL: So, can--can--I, is there -- </p><p>QUESTION: --So I'm asking--  </p><p>STILWELL: --Thank you-- </p><p>QUESTION: --As a State Department voice, would you say the betrayal of allies serve the United States interest and security and the global international law, regarding the Paris Agreement?  Thank you.   </p><p>STILWELL: Yeah, I--I can, I--I don't, yeah.  All the other parts that question aside, I would note that Southeast Asia is an area of greater involvement by the U.S.  And--and it's always been an area where we've been interested.  But in three months, in my first three months in this job, I've been to Southeast Asia three times, basically once a month.  I--I think it's an area of great promise.  I think Vietnam brings great hope.   </p><p>I do think, again, we do a better job by engaging governments versus isolating. So, even though there are aspects of certain governments--Cambodia, Burma, and others--that we don't necessary--don't reflect our values, we can't really hope to change that by standing on the outside and throwing rocks. I--I realize there--there's legal reasons and others why we might have to isolate. But in terms of Vietnam, I see the relationship is growing quite well. We're getting past legacy issues, historical issues, and we're focusing on areas of cooperation that benefit both a great deal. This can only help--you know--with--both Vietnam domestically and with U.S. interests in the region. Thank you. Sir. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much. Josh Rogan, Washington Post. Thanks for your time today. Thank you for your service. You talked about the State Department's announcement yesterday that Chinese diplomats inside the U.S. will now be required to pre-notify when they visit academic institutions, local and government officials. The Chinese embassy tweeted quote, \"The latest restrictions imposed by the U.S. State Department on Chinese diplomats are in violation of the Vienna Convention.\" So far the Chinese site does not have similar requirements on American diplomats and consular officers in China.  </p><p>So, two-part question. The first is how can you convince the Chinese government to change its behavior if they don't acknowledge their behavior? And--you know--I guess the larger question is--you know--since any strategy is aimed at--sort of--cheating the behavior of the other side, these reciprocity measures, if they don't work then what's the next step? How do we achieve reciprocity if the pressure is not going to have any effect on the Chinese side? Thank you. </p><p>STILWELL: So, as I mentioned earlier in the presentation the goal is fairly simple. We're looking for a fair and reciprocal relationship across the board diplomatically, economically, and the rest. We're just asking to be treated--you know--and this is the golden rule. Do unto others as you would like them to do. And so, in this regard--you know--if--if restrictions--and look--I mean--any NGOs in the room? I mean--academics--how's your access in China?  </p><p>If you compare your experiences to what we just saw in that tweet, I think you'll see the disparity in what--the real issues are. I've seen a number of NGOs know how difficult it is to operate in the PRC now. You have government organized non-government organizations. That's kind of a strange way to put it. And so, I would just say that the goal here, as we said in the--in the--in the statement is not to make interaction more difficult.  </p><p>In fact, the goal is to bring down restrictions in Beijing into something that's more equitable so we can have these conversations at the local level where we can travel freely throughout the country and--and exper--experience the same Vienna Convention--you know--stated aca--accesses that you--that they enjoy here in the U.S. If they want to have a debate about exactly what that looks like--if we want to take a tour of China and see what that looks like I'd be happy to have that conversation--you know--show--you know--shishiqiushi; seek truth through facts.  </p><p>QUESTION: Good morning. Thank you so much for your remarks. I have a question related to strategic partnerships and economic partnerships. Recent reports I've read suggest that Australia, while they continue to look to the U.S. as their primary strategic partner are increasingly leaning towards China as their primary economic partner. As you think about the strategy that we are laying out for the region, do you envision in this new equilibrium that we're pointing towards here room for those partnerships to be treated separately, or do you believe that strategic partnership and economic partnership need to go hand in hand and us be the primary partner on--in both dimensions? </p><p>STILWELL: That's a great question. No--the--in--in short the answer is absolutely not. You can--you can have likeminded security partnerships while at the same time conduct a very vigorous--you know--trade relationships with whoever you want. That's the beauty of trade. It is agnostic. As long as both sides are getting what they consider something fair out of this. And Adam Smith--it matters not--or--is--a--is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the baker, or the brewer that we expect our supper. It's through their enlightened self-interest. So, trade is--trade is trade and politics are--are--are--and security are separate. But the security prospectives from the U.S.--and--and the--the Democratic--the governing ideals that we share with likeminded allies and partners like the Australians really matter.  </p><p>We had Scott--or, Prime Minister Morrison here a couple weeks ago for a state visit that came off very well. And the conversation was easy. Not to say there's no disagreements; there's always ar--areas where we can improve. But again, there's nothing--you've never seen anything out of the--out of D.C. or anywhere that says we're restricting or interested in stopping economic--economic--interaction with the PRC. We're simply asking that the interaction is fair, reciprocal. So, is that--that get to the--okay. </p><p>QUESTION: You said you'd have no issue with Huawei partnering with Australia (INAUDIBLE) communications (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>STILWELL: Trade that is apolitical is--is fine. But then when you have other ulterior activities then we have to--we have to address those--you know. We have to secure ourselves. And this takes economics into the security realm, and that's a different story. Alright. Okay. Sir.  </p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Thank you for your speech. My name is (INAUDIBLE). I am from George Washington University History Department. And my question is that you mentioned the housekeeping task of the U.S. especially in terms of the invasion of China and Chinese values to the U.S. and other countries like Australia. It reminds me of the--what Mao Zedong said in 1949. So, housekeeping first and then you invite guests. So, I wonder how does the U.S. house--housekeeping work out in the contemporary condition and how does that well influence U.S. foreign policy? Thank you.  </p><p>STILWELL: So, I would not want to conflate my description of what we're doing with what Chairman Mao said. We've already got guests, so--you know--we're just kind of tidying up a bit. I don't--there's no nefarious approach. There's nothing here that's not been completely above-board and again, our system is wide open. You can--people can talk to anybody they want to to understand where our policies are going. I think they've been very clear. We just want the same thing in--in return. We're just looking for some reciprocal access and understanding. Because that--you know--as the security environment warms up those open conversations are incredibly important. The ability to pick up a phone and have someone answer on the Beijing side is extremely important. And that's what we're asking for. These--again, these discussions have to happen in real time. They can't wait forever. So, again I think this--it's--it's--we're recognizing the importance of the relationship and we're trying to elevate it to match the importance. So, I'm not sure if I got to the answer but that's all the time I got. So, I really appreciate your attention.  </p><p>DENMARK: Alright. We're going to transition straight to the first panel. Thank you very much to Assistant Secretary Stilwell. We appreciate the Xi Jinping thought quotations and appreciate your service both in the State and in the Pentagon. Okay. So, we're going to focus on U.S.-China geostrategic tension. We are not--we're going to eschew the traditional think tank panel of sitting behind tables and having ten fifteen-minute presentations with a bit of a Q and A but rather have more of a discussion on these--on the--the broad aspects of U.S.-China geostrategic tension.  </p><p>You have everybody's bio in your--in your packets so I won't belabor them. But very quickly </p><p>, we have Dan Blumenthal from AEI. We have Jonathan Hillman from CSIS. Jean Lee from here at the Wilson Center running our Career Center and Edward Wong from the New York Times and also the Wilson Center. Thank you all for coming.  </p><p>I think taking a step back from the specific issues that Assistant Secretary Stilwell mentioned--taking a step back from that, try and understand the broad strokes of what U.S.-China geopolitical competition means. I was wondering if we could use everybody's expertise to dig a bit into have--having a better understanding of what this competition is really looking like. So, Dan maybe we can start with you to talk about what you see the U.S. and China as actually competing about. And then we can talk about how that's playing out in different realms.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Sure. Well, thank you. You know--I--I'm digging deep into finishing a book so I feel like I'm let out of a cave and I can--I can actually have interaction with human beings and so forth and--and--but--you know--I've been thinking a lot about this subject for--for many, many years as--as you have--you know--for going on 20 years now. And I--so--the--the 19th Party Congress Report is a good start. The--the Chinese--it should be read in Chinese and in English.  </p><p>It's very clear about--it's much more clear than--than we've ever seen before about exactly what--what the Chinese Communist Party wants to do. It's--it's very important--very, very important to separate the Communist Party from--from the Chinese people, because when people talk about--and I'm going off on a little aside here--the Chinese want this, and the Chinese want that. Well, we know what the Chinese Communist Party wants, but--but the Chinese are 1.2 billion people. We have no idea what the Chinese want or how much they support it. I mean--we--we know in Hong Kong they want freedom and probably throughout China they want more freedom as well.  </p><p>So--so--anyway, it's very important to distinguish. The Chinese Communist Party says very clearly that they--I'm inter--you know--I'm interpreting but it--but a different world order with China at the center. And--and--you know--there's a lot of--lot of talk about One Belt One Road and so forth. Fundamentally, it's--it's--it's a means to an end. It's--it's a--it's--it's--if people are looking for massive amounts of money spent they're--you know--they're not going to see it. It's very unprofitable for China. It's a waste of money and so forth.  </p><p>But what--what they have succeeded in doing is creating an international organization with China at the center. And--and the ability to bring 60 nations to China every year to--you know--to at least talk about the infrastructure projects even if they're not going forward with them. So, China--you know--wants a different world order. They--they are very clear about--you know--community of common destiny for all of mankind. They're not just talking about the Indo-Pacific. They're clear about wanting to propagate what they call a socialist culture. Some of these translations aren't--aren't great, but they're--they're certainly training other country's elites in what they call a socialist culture. Which basically means this Beijing model of--of elite authoritarian governance with--with some experimentation with markets.  </p><p>They're very clear on becoming a world-class military and--and much more clear on what that means in terms of technological advancements. And they've made great strides--great, great strides in doing so. They've--they've changed the--the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region with their military modernization program. Probably one of the vastest and fastest military modernization program in human history, if you look back to 1991, 1992. And the U.S. is finding itself playing catch up in--in--in a lot of different areas. A different world order also means different energy relationships because of--of Chinese deep insecurities about using the traditional energy markets.  </p><p>So, this has led to new relationships with Russia, this has led to new relationships with the stans, this has led to part of One Belt One Road's building of ports and--and other infrastructure. So--you know--the--the Chinese Communist Party essentially wants a world that is--you know--A, keeps the Chinese Communist Party safe from--from--from liberal democracies and--and B--you know--B gives the Chinese Communist Party its new raison d'etre, which is leading China into finally--you know--the--what they write about is China stood up under Mao and went through reform and opening under Dong and now it's on the cusp of achieving national rejuvenation.  </p><p>They're sort of saying to the Chinese people--you know--stick with us and we'll lead you to--to national greatness. You can talk about what the U.S. wants, and it's been fairly consistent, which is a regional balance of power that's favorable to the United States. If the United States remains the prime power in the international system then it'll continue setting the rules and the rules will be far more liberal and--and focused on human rights than they otherwise would be.  </p><p>So--you know--and--and--I--we can go on and on about that--and international free markets. Free markets in energy, free markets in LNG, freedom of the seas, freedom of air passages, freedom of the internet, freedom--you know. All the freedoms that--that the world has--has come to enjoy. I--you know--I would note that--that it's very difficult to imagine a world with all of that gone--you know--because you're sort of imagining a negative.  </p><p>We just all take it so for granted that the United States is--has retained this prime position and--and what that actually means. We can get into specifics of how the U.S. is strategically going about trying to maintain its position, but I think that's--you know--we're--we're--we're now fighting over what the world--what kind of world we're going to live in in the next--you know--20, 30 years.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yeah. </p><p>DENMARK: Edward, you've written a lot about U.S.-China competition in the New York Times. You've described the face that the Chinese are trying to present to the world as tough but not threatening. If you ask the Chinese about these issues they say they are supportive of freedom of navigation, they're supportive of open markets, they're in favor of ec--economic liberalism, all these things. How do you see this--this competition playing out and what are--and the key areas of where you think the U.S. and China are really competing.  </p><p>WONG: Thanks Abe, and thanks for inviting me to this panel. I think that there is a--we can look at it as sort of in the long term or in the short term. I think in the long term, the way I see it playing out is similar to what David Stilwell said and what Dan has alluded to also, which is that there is a fundamental difference in ideologies that--that these two countries, because of the status they occupy now in the world and because of the economic power that each exerts, it's hard to reconcile with each other. And I think that the--you know--the U.S. can work with authoritarian regimes. The question is can the U.S. coexist in a world when an authoritarian regime is as powerful as the U.S. is. And I--economically. I don't think that we've had that before. Like, in the--the Soviet Union never occupied the same economic space in the world that the U.S. does. And so, the U.S. is able to contain the Soviet Union on the--in many different areas. But most importantly, in the area of global markets. And right now, it's unable to do that with China. It's trying to figure out ways to that. So, I think that that's really--sort of--the foundation of the conflict that we're seeing emerge, is that there are these fundamentally different ideological systems.  </p><p>And--you know--the--China will say that when you talk to Chinese officials or scholars they'll say, \"Well, we're--you know--a very practical country and we don't need to export our ideology. That's not our goal.\" But at--and--you know--there--I think in the U.S. we can debate whether that's their goal or not. I don't think it's clear-cut. But I do think that there are concerns about whether they'll push certain--they'll force constraints on free society such as what we've seen with what happened with the NBA this past week, for example. That because of their power economically that we want access to their markets, and that we are--like, the U.S. supply chains are based in China. There are many different ways in which our economies are intertwined that they have so much leverage over us in this--in the capitalist system that we embrace that they are able to force constraints on us that we don't--that the U.S. doesn't want. And I think that's sort of the fundamental tension at the heart of this relationship.  </p><p>And it--and it's not an easy one to reconcile bec--and I think this--someone--this was alluded to in the Q and A with Stilwell is that there is this idea that capitalism should be unfettered to a certain degree and so, like, for example institutions, organizations like the NBA should be able to do business on whatever grounds that they want and accept these constraints. But at the same time that acceptance of that undermines the sort of liberal democratic values that we--that America is based on. So, how do you reconcile? I think that's the--that's the sort of--given the eyes of a lot of--sort of--American strategic thinkers, that's the most fundamental threat that I think China poses to America right now. And that's where sort of this clash of systems comes into play.  </p><p>I think in the--the sort of shorter term or more concrete area of competition, I think the most--probably the greatest point of tension is what China's military ambitions are in the Asia-Pacific region. And I think that Dan talked about sort of the rapid--the rapid buildup of their military capabilities in that area. And I think that the--the U.S. wants to remain the preeminent military power in the Pacific, and China wants that role. And I think that--that--that's another area that can't be reconciled easily. I think that's the--that's the most, like, immediate and concrete source of tension in terms of, like, geostrategic problems that the two countries face.  </p><p>DENMARK: Jean, you've--you lived in Seoul, you lived in Pyongyang. I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about how you see this competition playing out in the Korean Peninsula. Obviously the competition between the U.S. and China's playing out across Asia, into Europe and to Latin America. But Korea, because of its geographic proximity to China is really one of the leading indicators of how this competition is playing out. I wonder if you could share some of your observations of how it's working in Korea.  </p><p>LEE: Well, two things come to mind. First of all, we don't have to go that far back in history. But remember that in Korea we still refer to China as Jungkuk; middle--middle kingdom or middle country. And so, there's a long history that goes back centuries of China seeking to play that essential role, the central role within the Asia region. And perhaps we're--what we're seeing is a strong bid to reassert itself as the middle kingdom, as the country that can perhaps treat neighboring nations as vassal states.  </p><p>I mention it because I--in Pyongyang as well, we always assume that these two countries, North Korea and China, are as close as lips and teeth. But there was so much historical resentment in North Korea on the part of the North Koreans toward that long history of having to serve as kind of a--a--paying respects to this tributary state and having to play this subservient role to China. And that was very palpable in North Korea.  </p><p>I can tell you what China doesn't want, is U.S. troops up on its border. And I mention that because within our more recent history going back a couple decades, we have the Korean War to consider. And I mention it because next year marks the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, and 70 years since China poured troops into that conflict in order to prevent U.S. troops from being on its border. And while things have certainly changed in the 70 years since, I would say China still does not want to have U.S. troops up on its borders and has been willing to maintain North Korea as sort of a buffer state between China and the Korean Peninsula. And the 28,500 U.S. troops that are positioned and stationed in South Korea.  </p><p>So, that--that--that more immediate history is something that I think we need to take into account. And I would say also that this has been the basis for North Korea's justification for the building of its nuclear weapons program is the Korean War and this broader U.S.-China conflict. And so that's--that's something that the North Koreans have used very strategically to justify building nuclear weapons. And so, it has some bearing on what's happening today with the diplomacy between the U.S. and--and North Korea.  </p><p>Small countries like North Korea have always sought to position themselves strategically in this great power competition in North East Asia. And I think we should look at North Korea as a cautionary tale. This is a country that has--even though--this is a--an issue that has--has not--it's not new. Indo-Pacific strategy, for example, may be some--a term that we're hearing just in the last few years. But Korea has been dealing with the concept behind Indo-Pacific strategy for not only decades but for centuries. And North Korea perhaps can be seen as a cautionary tale. What happens when a small country feels like the only way that--that it can remain relevant within this larger U.S.-China competition is to arm itself with nuclear weapons. And I would go one step further and say that if the diplomacy around this issue doesn't resolve itself soon, we may start to see some of the other smaller countries in that region--South Korea and Japan--seeking to arm themselves as well to remain relevant and protect themselves within this broader U.S.-China competition.  </p><p>DENMARK: I'm wondering if just as a quick follow if you could speak a bit about South Korea as a--as a U.S. ally. 28,500 U.S. troops in--in South Korea, but also China being a critical economic partner for them. I was part of the decision process in getting THAAD to the Korean Peninsula during the Obama Administration. A lot of these gray hairs are a result of that process.  </p><p>LEE: (LAUGHTER) </p><p>DENMARK: Wonder if you could just speak about how you see--how the Koreans--how the South Koreans see themselves sort of between these great powers as well. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. It's a complicated relationship. And I think we have to remember that those South Korea owe so much to the United States for its very existence. That it--they have had--Korea has had a long relationship with China--long complicated relationship with China both historically and so much of their economy today does rely on that relationship with China.  </p><p>So, they're--they're seeing themselves having to kind of position themselves strategically. Maintain the alliance with the United States while not shutting the door to the economic prosperity that comes with a relationship with China--a financial relationship with China. However, that THAAD incident really burned South Koreans. And they saw what happens when they don't s--they don't follow the rules that China has laid out for them and how they can be punished economically. Those were unofficial economic sanctions that shuttered and shut down many, many small and medium sized and very large South Korean companies.  </p><p>And so, it put South Koreans in a posit--a very precarious position of realizing that if they put too much dependence economically on China that China very quickly and very easily could shut their business down, but also having to maintain the relationship with the United States and maintaining that alliance. So that they could maintain that protection that the United States provides. And not only protection that the United States provides against North Korean aggression, right now the United States is key to resolving or helping to resolve some of the diplomatic tensions with North Korea. So, it's a very complicated relationship. And I think THAAD really crystalized that for the South Koreans.  </p><p>DENMARK: Jonathan, you--you do a tremendous amount of work on BRI, on the Belt and  Road Initiative. Wondering if you could talk a bit about how that--that initiative is playing out in terms of China's efforts to build power, build influence around the world and how you see it as fitting in with the broader U.S.-China competitive dynamic. </p><p>HILLMAN: Sure. So, I think we're--we're just now past the six-year mark of Belt and Road being officially announced. And--you know--it was initially announced in two components; an over land component and then the maritime component. And I think it's been a difficult six years. I think the Belt and Road brand has been tarnished in many ways. And yet, even in the places in which it's really struggled--Malaysia is an example, Pakistan is--is an example--the leaders of those countries go to Beijing at the last forum and they publicly praise this initiative. And so, I think that speaks to a few things.  </p><p>You know--first, the power of inducements. This is really an effective tool for China. You know--it's--it's something that speaks to the needs of developing economies and that's--so that's why they get 130 plus countries to sign up. Although I--you know--I don't think we should make too much of every MOU that's signed. But it's--it--there's something that's very attractive about that. And I think it should cause the U.S. to think a bit about what are we offering to the rest of the world as we think about how to compete with China.  </p><p>I think infrastructure as a tool for influence can also be quite difficult. Because it's highly attractive. Everyone wants to sign up. Who wouldn't want to announce a big project? And yet, we know that in most--even in the best economies in the world, the best business environments, most big projects take longer than expected. They cost more than expected. And they deliver fewer benefits than expected. And so, all of this to me, I think points toward incentives that are slated toward announcing many projects. And there's certainly a domestic political incentive in China to announce many projects. But then actually delivering them is extremely difficult.  </p><p>And so, I think China in--in its own way is learning the lessons that a lot of Western powers have already learned and--you know--that's--there's a reason why the multi-lateral development banks exist. You know--some of that is self-interest and wanting to protect yourself financially and reputationally. And China, in going it alone, has incurred these additional risks. So, I think it's been a difficult six years. And yet, it remains quite attractive. And I think the U.S. needs to think about what could it offer to these countries as well.    </p><p>DENMARK: That's a great--great segue. I actually had a--a Chinese scholar once tell me that BRI is in some ways a physical manifestation of dialectical materialism. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Right? And it kind of shows that the theory may not be--work as well as in practice. And you reminded me, Jonathan is--a friend of mine was fighting in Afghanistan in the first few years of--of the war there and discovered that the aqueducts that they were fighting and some of the terraforming that had been done on some of the farms there had actually been built by the United States decades before as part of efforts to build infrastructure in Afghanistan. And we saw how well that turned out there.  </p><p>So, because you talked about what the U.S. could also--the second question I wanted to ask we can start with you, Jonathan. I think we can go back up the rows. We've talked a lot about how the Chinese are pursuing competition in these various areas. Wonder if we can talk about a bit about how the U.S. could go about effectively competing with the--with China. In that, the Trump Administration has attempted a few pieces of it. There's the BUILD Act, there's the trade war, there's some military developments. But I'm wondering if we can talk about how the competition is going from an American perspective, and your sense of what we could be doing to enhance our ability to compete in your various areas. Jonathan, if you want to.  </p><p>HILLMAN: Yeah, so I think--I mean, I think the Indo-Pacific framing is certainly a--that's a positive development. There are also some challenges with it too because China's not limiting itself to the Indo-Pacific, right? They're in Eastern and Central Europe, they're in Latin America. So, even if--even as we sort of zone in on Indo-Pacific, China's thinking and acting globally. And so, I do think we need sort of a broad, attractive economic vision. And it--it shouldn't be defined in opposition to the Belt and Road. I think it should be defined as something that's worth--you know--it's worthwhile on its own. It reflects our interests, not necessarily something that's against China's interests.  </p><p>And so, some of that language is in the--the description of the Indo-Pacific strategy. So, openness, freedom, I think I would throw in resiliency or sustainability because many of these developing economies, they confront--you know--long-term climate change challenges. They have witnesses the ec--the economic, environmental, and human costs of Chinese projects that are not done to the right standards. And so, I think the U.S. has quite a bit to offer--you know--very talented companies--you know--large sources of private investment that if given the right incentives could go into more of these projects. </p><p>And so--and--and--you know--and historically, trade has been a huge strength of the United State--the United States--and I think could still be one if we could get back to thinking regionally and not just bilaterally about some of our--our trade strategy. </p><p>DENMARK: Okay. Jean. </p><p>LEE: You and I were in Seoul earlier this year to talk about some of these things and I would go back to some of those themes. Which is to really work with countries in the Indo-Pacific Asia-Pacific region and encourage them to take on a--a greater role within that region. South Korea's a--a great example as a very recently developing country that is now a developed country. Eleventh world--world's largest--eleventh largest economy--and really can serve as a role model to countries in Southeast Asia and in the broader region as a country--an Asian country that can serve as a role model, rebuild its economy.  </p><p>And I think what we need to do as Americans is to encourage them to take the next step and think about the values that we share--the United States shared with countries in that region and encourage them to pick the path with values that they would like to embrace. And so, really having them see it as a choice of values that they would be making, not just commercial interests. I think with South Korea, we see that so much of the emphasis has been on the potential of commercial trade with some of the-- </p><p>(AUDIO GAP) </p><p>--as a country that understands how to deal with China, that has dealt with China for centuries and understands the cultural background and the heritage that comes with having to deal with China. But to pick the values that they want going forward as countries that are developing.  </p><p>DENMARK: Edward how do you--how do you see the competition going so far from an American perspective? </p><p>WONG: Well, I don't want to make policy recommendations since that's not my job as a-- </p><p>DENMARK: --Just your assessment how you think it's going. </p><p>WONG: I--the--so, my sense is that if you look at the various parts of the competition which the U.S. has tried to push back on China in this administration, I think that they've had some success and there has others in which they run into obstacles. So, I think that for example on the--partly on the messaging, I think that they've managed to articulate enough about the competition and challenge in which they've managed to sort of form this more or less bipartisan consensus around the--the idea of the need to confront China in certain spheres and to push back against China. So, I think domestically they've managed to sort of reinforce that notion and strengthen their position on that. </p><p>The--in the international sphere, there are certain parts in which they tried to push back on China, and I think that that's met with some resistance from other nations. And they are still struggling with this. And one of those for example is Huawei and 5G. I think we've seen from what--you know--my discussions with officials, this has been a big push in the last year. And they succeeded in getting Australia on board. Like, Australia's the one country that's explicitly said that they're not going to adopt 5G technology from Huawei. But some of the closest allies, like the U.K. and Germany have not made that decision yet. Japan is doing is but without explicitly stating it. Like, Japan is on board with the U.S. position but not explicitly stating it.  </p><p>So, I think that--and that I think has dealt a blow to both the concrete goal of extracting these promises but also the win seen in this sort of like messaging context. And it looks like that the U.S. is coming up short in terms of being able to convince other nations of--of the importance of this. And I think the same could be said for BRI, that it's sort of the Indo-Pacific--I think the framing was welcome by many other officials, but from when I talked to some diplomats or officials from other countries they say, well what--if China's offering loans and other financial incentives in large sums and the U.S. has this--you know--I think when Secretary Pompeo announced that initiative there was a certain amount attached to it that a lot of other countries thought was too small and their--and they ask how can we turn away these loans from Chinese banks and their--and the packages that come with them if the U.S. isn't offering enough to counter-balance that.  </p><p>So, I think that these are areas in which the U.S. has tried to push forward sort of a counter strategy, but it's met up with some resistance from--from the out--from other nations.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well--you know--I think--I think panels are getting boring because everyone's agreeing on China. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You know--10 years ago we'd have-- </p><p>DENMARK: --That's why we have you- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: (LAUGHTER) </p><p>I can't find any area to disagree with. So, well I--the--there's one area and I think this is part of the competition that I--I don't agree with the administration's assessment and that is--and that is to give up on engagement because it doesn't--it doesn't change China. I think that again, making a distinction between the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party is extremely important. So--so, we never made a great attempt--I think Ambassador Lord made a great attempt when he was Ambassador to China and Assistant Secretary of State to actually engage Chinese outside of the Communist party who do want change. They may not be Jeffersonians but they--you know--it's not like they love corruption and--and injustice and detention camps and not being able--you know. They're people. I mean, they're not--you know--just--so there's--there's ways to--to do a much broader engagement. And--and I would do this--you know--both as a competitive initiative to put more pressure on the Chinese Communist Party to defend itself internally.  </p><p>I mean--if we want to avoid a shooting war, I can't think of a--a--a better thing to do than focus on human rights in China. Because it forces--it forces the CCP at the very least to spend more money defending itself. So, I--in the broad sweep of things--I mean--I think we're doing okay for the past 20 years in the sense that there's been a strategic logic. The opening to India in 1999, 2000, 2001. All the administrations after that--you know--wanted better relationships with Vietnam and Indonesia and Malaysia and they are better than they were 20 years ago, much better. And that's--you know--really the core of the apple.  </p><p>I mean, the competition is going to--because of the demographics and the potential of Southeast Asia as opposed to Northeast Asia--you know--the--the core of the apple's going to be Southeast Asia. I think we've done okay in building those relationships over the last 20 years. I think every--every President over those--the course of time wanted a balance of power and--and therefore put time and energy into building out those relationships. You know--I--you know--but--but--you know--human rights and let's call it political warfare, because the Chinese--it's such an important thing they do to us. You know--and we used to do this during the Cold War. I mean--Kennan's book was about all means short of war, right? And--and so we don't do it anymore. We don't have a U.S. information agency, we don't--we just don't do it. And it could save lives over time. </p><p>And then trade, of course. I mean--look, we're in a impossible political situation in trade. I mean--you know--you have the Trump Administration and then you have potential Presidential aspirants on the other side who are not exactly calling for trade--you know--or TPP--you know. If anything, they want more tariffs, right? It--you know--we by far have the biggest and most open economy. I mean--by far, it's not even close to China. I--China's not even close to us in terms of--and so--you know--countries like Vietnam--Vietnam and--you know--they want access to the U.S. market. It's very simple--you know. They want access to the U.S. market.  </p><p>And--and so that's tremendous leverage for us to--to do a trade deal that's favorable to us not in terms of--you know--the exact reciprocity and everything, but in terms of sparking reform within those countries--you know. Dismantling the SOE structures and--you know--at the end of the day the--what the U.S. has to offer and has always had to offer is--is--you know--its market and its ability to--to spark reform such that these economies actually can take off because they're dismantling--you know--all their sort of socialist structures and so forth.  </p><p>So, we're not--you know--that's where we're not--you know--doing--doing very well. And--and the problem is I don't see much change on the horizon because I don't see any--in the political sphere any opponents kind of saying--you know--well, let's get back to--you know--to trade. You know--we--we--we can't order our SOEs to go do infrastructure and--you know--we don't have them. You know--we--we can't do that. We can improve market conditions through negotiations which helps countries take off. Which is--you know--trying saying that in Ohio though, right-- </p><p>DENMARK: --Right-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --Let's go out and improve market conditions in Vietnam so that Vietnam takes off and over time is an ally of ours. I mean--that--wow, that's a lot of words--you know. So, that--that's a huge problem in the U.S. politics. I--that--you know--we've got to kind of wait this out.  </p><p>WONG: I just want-- </p><p>DENMARK: --Go ahead-- </p><p>WONG: --To jump in bring up one quick point which I think part of the obstacle that this administration's run into in sort of building up the partnerships with other countries on this competition is that there's been very different messaging between sort of administration officials--like, Senior Administration officials and the President himself. I think when Dan, for example, brings up human rights I do think that there are certain officials who have been very outspoken on human rights. Like, we've seen Secretary Pompeo and Vice President Pence for example talk about the Xinjiang internment camps and about other issues.  </p><p>But--you know--I think anyone who reads President Trump's transcripts and looks at his speeches, whether it's Chinese officials or us, like--he very rarely talks about human rights or about sort of the liberal values that--that U--United States traditionally projects. And I think that when other nations look at that then they wonder whether--you know--that that's--then it's fine to deal with China on its terms because the U.S. doesn't--like--what used to be the beacon of these values doesn't really stand--might not stand for those any more depending on the leadership. </p><p>So, I think that that--that raises a big question in the eyes of other potential partners and nations. And also, the idea of alliances or partnerships. Like, do we value alliances or partnerships. I think that this administration has put that as a big question mark out there. And so, without--you know--on something as big as China, you need to build up partnerships and alliances. And I think Dan--you know--partly alludes to this and--and the TPP was supposed to be, for example, one sort of set of economic partnerships that was supposed to help open up markets and push reform and sort of set certain conditions for trade.  </p><p>But--but because of both the domestic debate over trade and globalization--globalized economy plus the backing away of traditional partnerships and alliances and the view of it as more transactional thing by this President, then that sort of really clouds the picture of, like, where we stand on partnerships and alliances.  </p><p>DENMARK: Actually, I have a book out--coming out next year about alliances and partnerships in Asia. So, like Dan I'm coming out from the cave and happy to hear that you think it's an important issue. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: You should--you should buy mine first. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And then move on to alliances and partnerships. </p><p>LEE: This is going to be a great debate. We'll have both of you do your book launches together-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --We agree-- </p><p>WONG: --But you need to have different views on this, on the alliance. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I--I just think if I c--if I may-- </p><p>WONG: --Yeah-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --I don't mean--I--I think Ed--Ed's right and certainly in terms of the--the tone struck and--you know--doing tariffs on Japan and South Korea and--although--you know--and Europe doesn't help matters when you're trying to focus on China. At--but--you know--but then--you know--it's--it's the joke about--you know--Wagner's--Wagner's music right? It's--it's better than it sounds. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, when you actually look at--at the policies on allies--you know--they're actually better--much better than--than--than--you know--what the President says. So--you know--the--in some ways we've maximized out--and this was--you know--the Obama administration--even though Bush administration started this, but we've sort of gone to a maximum with Vietnam and repaired relationships with Thailand even though it's a dictatorship. And--you know--we've sort of maxed out on Indonesia at this point and--and the Philippines is difficult but we've--you know--done our best. And Taiwan--you know--this administration has--I've never thought--you know--when I started in this business we wouldn't have anything left to sell to Taiwan. I mean--that's--so--you know--it's--you know--and--other--you know--I'd say other initiatives that are very positive for the alliances--you know. So, it's--it's been a mix, like everything in the administration. I mean--tone versus substance.  </p><p>DENMARK: I had two more questions I want to ask before we open things up, and I'll just throw them out for people to--to comment on. When we have a intensifying competition between two great powers, there's an intensified and increased danger of conflict, either intentional or unintentional even though both sides may want to avoid conflict. There's areas where critical interests are in pretty--pretty divergent--I was recently in Taiwan.  </p><p>Dan, I know you've done a lot of work on Taiwan. I see that as one of the driving potential areas of increased tension and potential conflict between the United States and China in the coming years. I was wondering if one of--if you could talk about--Dan, maybe you could talk a bit about how you see Taiwan going fair--fairly quickly and--and the rest of you, if there is other areas that you think we need to keep an eye on in terms of potential for competition and tension translating into actual conflict.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, quickly Taiwan's going away. I mean--you know--it's--it's-- </p><p>DENMARK: --From China's perspective. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Yeah. I mean, it's--you know--they're going to have another election in January that probably handily elects the--a DPP government yet again and--and it's a--you know--the demographics in Taiwan, the--the people under whatever age--you know--don't believe in any connect--political connection to--to China. And given--given a--a voice, a real voice they would--they would be an independent nation. And so--you know--so, structurally the Chinese are not--you know--happy about that. And--and--I--I think people kind of understate the amount of force buildup across from the top. I mean--it's probably one of the most militarized areas in the world--you know. And--I mean just the amount of missiles alone pointed at Taiwan--you know--is--no--no country--I mean, maybe--maybe Israel has to live with that--with that threat--with that pointed at them. But no country--no other country has to live with that. So, it's--it's a huge potential for conflict.  </p><p>And, so I--what I would say is--you know--obviously--you know--U.S. deterrence is always important, U.S. defense and--and so forth. Here's--you know--this is the Nixon Forum, so--you know--it--we--we need a kind of engagement with China that doesn't focus on trivia, right? So, I don't mean to belittle issues that are functional like environmental and public health. But we need a real--you know--we used to even have this with the Soviets. I mean--real summitry focus on how to avoid war and create peace despite our differences. And we--we don't do that. We never do that. I mean--we had these massive economic and political talks where every Cabinet Secretary was invited and so on, but I--I mean, Presidents--you know--Secretaries of State talking about--you know--how to keep the peace under conditions of competition.  </p><p>And--and--and that's I think one way we'll avoid conflict. I mean, to be very clear about our position on Taiwan, we know their position on Taiwan and say--but neither of us wants to risk nuclear war over this.  </p><p>LEE: Can I share something interesting that I heard from a Chinese scholar? </p><p>DENMARK: Sure-- </p><p>LEE: --Which was that he says that China would much rather have U.S. troops in South Korea focused on the threat that North Korea poses than somewhere else in the region focusing on Taiwan, for example. So, I thought that was very interesting, him pointing--the--the scholar pointing out the--the interest that China has in making sure that North Korea plays a particular role in broader geopolitics. Because they don't want their attention diverted to another possible reunification issue in the rest of the region. So, I thought that was a very interesting point.  </p><p>DENMARK: I don't know if you have anything to add-- </p><p>HILLMAN: --Yeah, I think--I mean, I think one think to keep an eye on is--you know--is China's infrastructure activities continuing to expand. We know that sort of year on year spending and activity has dropped, but they still have a pretty massive and growing global presence, especially in the maritime space--you know--where they have--you know--the--the world's largest network of foreign ports and--you know--they produce most of the world's ships.  </p><p>And I think that expansion is starting to brush up in strange ways against the U.S. security network that has been--you know--set up over decades and especially expanded after 9/11. And so, you have these just increased proximity between Chinese actors and--you know--U.S. military facilities. I think that's something to worry about. And it's--there's an added degree of difficulty there because that's not mill to mill interaction. That's something that needs to be--you know--there--there needs to be some other way of--of making sure that there are norms or rules in place to avoid miscalculation.  </p><p>And then looking--you now--further afield you see a little bit of this already. But I think--you know--as China's economic foot--footprint grows logically it's going to want some security assets to secure those economic assets and foreign workers. And so, you see--you know--a presence in Djibouti. You have--you know--they are--they are now--China's actively--it seems to be actively managing part of the TajikAfghan border, which is not necessarily against U.S. interests if that brings some stability-- </p><p>GOTO: Start in just a minute, maybe 20 seconds actually. All right. Well, thank you all very much for--for coming back. I'm Shihoko Goto with the Wilson Center; Asia program. And although we've had a very lively discussion this after--this morning, I think this is the--the panel to like focus on. </p><p>FRISBIE: Of course. </p><p>GOTO: I am of course a little bit biased, but I think that in--in all seriousness, because trade and frustration with China's economic policies have been out the center of the tensions, ongoing tensions between the United States and China. And of course, we've already had this morning discussions about the geopolitical implications of trade and economic policy between the two countries. </p><p>But let's dig a little bit deeper, and also look at some of the most recent developments on the trade front. We've been able to reach a deal of sort last week, which really has been a ceasefire of the rationing up of a tariff war. And, nothing has been formally signed as of yet, but the United States are saying that this is phase one of three phases, in a comprehensive agreement, and in reaching a trade agreement with--with China. </p><p>China, however, is not showing that language, but instead merely talking that this is progress. So, I'm excited to be able to introduce a--a--an amazing panel of speakers who are very much in the trenches on this topic. From my left, your right is Bob Davis, of The Wall Street Journal. He's also been with the Wilson Center. </p><p>Next to him is Meg Lundsager who is a public policy scholar here at the Center and also the former U.S. Executive Director to the IMF. And then to her right, is John Frisbie of Hills and Company. So, let me start with you, Bob. We've reached a deal last week that you've already tweeted that essentially, it's not a win-win, but China has come out ahead. How is that, and what are the ultimate U.S. objectives in competing with China on the economic front? </p><p>DAVIS: Right. I mean, I think we haven't reached a deal. We've reached a--a preliminary agreement on having a deal, and what's--what's the deal involved? The deals involved China buy more agricultural stuff, which before there was a trade deal, they bought a lot agricultural, you know, a lot of soybeans. And what does the U.S. get out of this? They get--presumably if it works out, they get openings in the financial services market, a currency deal that they announced in February that they already had. </p><p>So, they get basically nothing. They get only things that China was going to do on its own. I mean, I think one of the problems in this whole trade war is that we've gone--we've shifted too much to the idea that China only gets ahead by cheating, as opposed to China sees it's interest, a certain degree of reform. They were moving along a track toward opening up the financial services and manufacturing sectors, reducing joint ventures, so on and so forth. </p><p>So, you'd have to say--you'd have to ask yourself the question, if Henry Paulson was the Treasury Secretary today, would they be getting anything--would they be getting anything more than Henry Paulson would've gotten under, you know, the strategic and economic dialogue. Now, if they go beyond that to the sort of goals that were sketched out in the Section 301 report of very, very fundamental changes in the Chinese economy, that would be a big deal. But at the moment, I mean, that's a really long way away. </p><p>GOTO: All right. So again, there is no agreement as of yet. We're actually not sure of what the preliminary understanding between the two sides is either. So, with that, perhaps you could talk a little bit, John, about which sectors could potentially gain from a potential agreement. This is all very hypothetical. But we do know that from the agricultural perspective, it has suffered. American farmers have suffered a great deal over the last a year or so. </p><p>As a result, not only of the escalating tariffs that also lost opportunities because the United States has withdrawn from the TPP, does this actually become a way forward for American farmers? And what are some of the other sectors that could potentially win? </p><p>FRISBIE: Sure. I guess I'd say one thing about TPP, we were actually never in it, so we didn't quite withdraw from it. But I think for--for American companies, nothing changed last week for them, at this point. If--if you're an American company looking at the U.S.-China trade tensions, looking at the China market you still have the same amount of uncertainty today that you probably had last week. </p><p>Yes, it's nice to have some more positive signaling to perhaps arrest the--the downward slide we are on. But I wouldn't say anything has changed from--from a company's perspective that would lead them to do something different this week versus last--last week. The impact of the trade war so far in companies is--is mixed for--for some companies, they've definitely seen cost increases due to tariffs. </p><p>And for some of our manufacturers that's been on the order of several hundred million dollars for example. For others that are selling in China, they've seen loss sales and agriculture is an example of that. But it's not just them. Because think about this, if you're a company in China, whether you're a foreign multinational operating there, or if you're a Chinese company, and you're also looking at the U.S.-China trade tensions, and you have a U.S. supplier to your operation, you might be thinking, I don't know if they're still going to be able to supply me in a year's time. </p><p>Either specifically because it might be a certain technology that's under question in the debate, or even just more generally if there's some risk or if a company sees some risk in a--in a broader rift between the two countries that might call into question, the reliability that U.S. suppliers. So maybe they're also starting to look at other suppliers from other countries, not just domestically, but perhaps from European, or Japanese companies that operate in China too. </p><p>So, loss sales in China had been another one. I think agriculture in particular has been whipsawed, because it's on again off again. This year, agriculture exports to China varies by type of product, about 40 to 50 percent declines versus before. So, that's pretty serious. And I think they welcomed the news that perhaps there will be something to create some more opportunity again, but I'm guessing they're probably also thinking it's somewhat of a fragile truce. </p><p>And if they can get some sales now, we've seen some increase--increases in Chinese purchases of late, then great. I think on the economy's writ large in other words, the U.S. economy, the Chinese economy on a macro level, you know, maybe there hasn't been that much tangible impact at that level. Like I say, individual sectors perhaps, or individual situations depending on--on your business. But certainly, there's been a big impact on sentiment. </p><p>And I would say that's bigger probably than the tangible economic hit right now. And you know, the word I used at the outset, the uncertainty. If you're uncertain, it's going to impact, you know, do you go ahead with that investment right now? Do you go ahead with hiring people right now? And it's not just for an operation that a U.S. company might have in China, but even over here in some cases too. </p><p>And it clearly has an impact on market sentiment as well. So, there has been a negative impact so far. I'm not sure it's all been arrested by what happened last week. </p><p>GOTO: Right. And, which makes me think about the macro-economy and the IMF this week is having its annual conference to take a pulse of the world economy of central bankers and finance ministers from all member countries of IMF are here to assess the risks. And one of the biggest risks that they see is the global trading system. And the IMS world economic outlook report has said that the world economic outlook is actually going to face considerable challenges as--as a direct result of U.S.-China trade tensions. </p><p>Meg, given that the uncertainties persist, how resilient is the global economy to this? Are there ways to offset it? And what is the outlook for the Chinese and U.S. economies respectively as a result? </p><p>LUNDSAGER: Well, that's a really good question Shihoko, and the big uncertainty that's driving a lot of this. The IMF has raised a lot of concerns. It's just released its three flagship reports the last couple of days. You mentioned the decline, the weaker outlook for global growth and you see this across pretty much all countries. A few are doing a little bit better, but the IMF points to this ongoing trade dispute, trade war affecting sentiment, increasing uncertainty. And as a result, as John was just saying, you're not seeing a big investment decision, you're seeing people holding back a little bit because they just don't know where's the market going to be, who's going to be my supplier, who's going to be my buyer. </p><p>So, you are seeing that impact. So, the IMF is clearly worried about that. And the next point is, is that countries to deal with this, whether it's, you know, supply chains, radically changing the overall sentiment worsening. They don't have a lot of policy space. If you look at all the different regions of the world in terms of what they can do to offset that, you see monetary policy across the board has already done a lot, since the global financial crisis, and they haven't really been able to normalize to use that term. You don't really hear that much anymore. </p><p>And the new normal may be these persistently low interest rates, which of course creates some of their own problems. I think pension funds, insurance companies, that want to have very safe investments. So, overall, there's a lot of different kinds of bubbles that might emerge and might be difficult to deal with. And that I think is something that policymakers in many countries are really not focused on. How do you have all those tools in place, because it really is a constellation of tools you need. </p><p>The other thing they highlighted extensively, both IMF, World Bank is for instance, climate change. What do you do about that? Countries are not prepared for it. They are going to be huge expenses. And so, you're seeing in terms of that one specific area, a lack of preparedness, but also just in terms of having deep enough tools, fiscal policy, monetary policy, that have been stretched in many countries already. </p><p>GOTO: Let's talk about policy coordination. One issue that may be raised in phase two, phase three of this bilateral trade agreement is foreign exchange currency manipulation. To what extent is coordination amongst the--the G7, or the industrialized possible in--if China is to be labeled as a currency manipulator or such? What--to what extent is there a possibility of countries coming together on that? </p><p>LUNDSAGER: Well, the U.S. called China a currency manipulator the summer in August. I didn't hear anyone else do that. No other countries followed the U.S. in doing that. The IMF had just put out its annual assessment of the Chinese economy and its global take on exchange rate around the world. And basically, China was more or less, not totally where it should be, but not a problem. China's current account has come down dramatically the past few years. </p><p>They're not intervening in terms of showing up that their foreign exchange reserve's going up. They're not overtly pushing down the currency to be more competitive, even though they have many other ways to do that, that are not so obvious always. So, the U.S. Treasury, the Trump administration is a little bit alone in this. The IMF is not going to pick this up, because the rest of the membership is not there, certainly not the G7, because none of them have the same concern and they're all looking to preserve their trade with China. </p><p>And you won't see the emerging markets developing countries take on China also because basically when they look at what China's been doing, they've been trying to change their behavior to become a little bit more, maybe let's say mainstream in terms of how other countries manage their currencies. They're not there yet, but they pledged to keep getting there, trying to get there. It's G 20 commitment. </p><p>So, I don't see that there'll be a unified effort around currency and frankly, I don't get the sense from what I hear, whether at the fund or elsewhere that there's a big push to try and get the IMF to do anything extra on currency. </p><p>GOTO: Right. Okay. The bigger picture of course though is for the United States as well as other countries, is to change some of China's economic policies, and unfair trade practices. But although there is a consensus within the United States that China has been playing unfairly, there is a divide within Washington amongst policy makers, amongst the key players in this about how exactly to do it. </p><p>And I'm thinking especially about you know Lighthizer taking one stance, and people like Peter Navarro taking a much more scorched earth approach to dealing with China. So, Bob, looking at that what--is--is there a division, continuing division within Washington about how to approach the China challenge, and how can we reach a consensus as to what Washington wants from Beijing? </p><p>DAVIS: Well, yes. Yes. That's all we write about is the divisions. They change over time. Can I just say one thing? I'll answer that question just one thing about the currency. When the U.S. labeled China a currency manipulator was not a real assessment, they had labeled, had given China a pass a couple of months before that. It was all part of the president being angry at China, not buying agriculture purchases, which he thought they promised to do in Osaka in which the Chinese said they didn't. </p><p>They were just looking for one way to retaliate after another. It wasn't, it was--it was bogus. And we'll see. We'll see, they come there, due to come out with a report anytime soon? </p><p>LUNDSAGER: Yeah, this week. </p><p>BOB: I bet you they'll be back to--or they're probably holding it off to see, you know, its leverage for whether there's a phase one deal. And, also if I might add, I mean, what could they possibly--what does currency manipulation even mean at this point? They--there are so many, there's tariffs on so many items, and the threatening tariffs and so much others, it's--it's meaningless. </p><p>So anyway, but the--on the divisions, yes, of course. It's hugely divided. The way I think about it is that there are people in this administration who think of China as of existential threat. As the biggest threat since fascism. And there are people in this administration who think that China is a problem. You know, there've been--there are practices that they--that they do that are wrong, that hurt American companies, and that we need to address them. But you know, we're in the--in the context of a global economy that we need to keep pouring. </p><p>And Trump's not either of them. He's not a person who thinks that it's an existential threat, and he's not a person who thinks first and foremost of the global economy. And that's why you see it shift back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. Because sometimes he sort of leans toward one, and sometimes he sort of leads towards the other. Now, I mean, on the one pole, there's no--I don't think personally there's any deal the U.S. could ever get that would satisfy Peter Navarro because he would just think they would cheat no matter what the Chinese said. </p><p>I don't--Lighthizer is not as far as that. And then, there are people in their security who--who have a very, you know, trade's very secondary to them. But you know, again, have this sort of, you know, it's the second coming of the rise of fascism. And then there are people like, you know, Secretary Mnuchin who's--who's taken the role that it's a problem, but it's a problem that needs to be put in perspective. And again, as I--as I say, I don't think the president neatly fits into either of them. And that's why you see the fluctuations. </p><p>GOTO: So, for businesses, doing business in China at the moment, this is a very, very challenging time to say the least, given the uncertainties. On the other hand, China has had a very steady hand oftentimes in guiding its industrial policy. What--is there something, instead of the United States simply clamoring for a change in the systemic approach that China has, rather for American companies to--to learn something from--from China. Is there opportunity for us to actually kind of play China its own game and actually win on this? Is this something that's totally not feasible? </p><p>FRISBIE: You mean for the U.S. to have an industrial policy? </p><p>GOTO: Well, not an industrial policy per se. But are there measures that the government can actually have that would encourage some kind of tax, or protectionist measure that would make them more competitive? </p><p>FRISBIE: I guess I would put it this way. So, the--the--the American business community for several years now has had declining optimism about prospects in the future in China, primarily around the lack of a level playing field, which is a pretty broad, vague term. And being able to compete fairly, it was less of an issue maybe, you know, 20 years ago when China was a much smaller economy, and companies were dealing with those issues inside China. </p><p>But it became more of a concern as the Chinese economy expanded. And as China started to move out and go global. So, it wasn't just about perhaps the competitive environment you might face in China, but now it was your competitor in China competing with you in other markets around the globe, including the United States, and perhaps doing so from a protected base at home. And so, I think, the trend line was of concern for a lot of companies, even as they continued to grow their--their business with China. </p><p>In a previous life for me, I was president of the U.S.-China Business Council for about a dozen years, and we would always pull our membership about how they say they saw the environment. And you know, starting five, six years ago, we started to see that, and I'm saying this precisely here, decline in optimism. I'm not saying pessimism because it wasn't that, the numbers are still pretty strong amongst those who had access to China. And that's--that's a--a big caveat right there, about growth prospects in China and their ability to--to be able to participate in capturing at least some of that growth. </p><p>Maybe not as much as they would like. But China's clearly a growing market for several years now, China has been producing about a third of global GDP growth every year, more than the U.S. more than Japan, more than Europe, and most years, more than three of them combined. So, that's hard to ignore. But yes, companies wanted to be able to see more fairness in market access, particularly with Chinese companies now moving out and enjoying a more open market in the United States. </p><p>But companies are pretty strongly unanimous in saying that tarriffs are the wrong approach because there's a lot of self-inflicted harm. Not necessarily going to be the solution that will actually get China to come up with the kind of--of compromises desired. And I think what we've seen so far with the tariff back and forth, it's kind of lead each side to dig in their heels a bit. I think companies would have been much more strongly in favor of some kind of plural lateral approach. I didn't say multi-lateral, because I'm not, the WTO is not where the companies are looking for help. </p><p>But like-minded countries and economies to be able to coordinate an approach to trying to get them to change some of their practices. And I think other countries and economies, were prime to do that because it's not just U.S. companies that's faced these issues in China. It's pretty much all foreign companies, very common concern. So, I think that's where there's been a big division. It's not about what the nature of the problem is. If I would mention the--the 301 case that you USTR brought, and that's really around protection of intellectual property, and then to force technology transfer greater market access and so on. </p><p>Those are the--the right issues by and large, whether they've characterized them correctly or put them at the right size them, if you will, I think is also a subject of disagreement. But the notion that yes, those are the right issues to be addressed, but probably there would be disagreement that the approach the administration has taken is the right way to get to a solution. </p><p>GOTO: If I could follow up on the tech transfer issue. American companies have lost heavily on--on this. But some--some analysts would argue that a lot of the technology that has been forced to China is now in China's hands, and now China has the ability to take, have an advantage over American technology companies in the future. Is that a--a concern that you might have? </p><p>FRISBIE: The tech transfer issue is very acute for companies that face it. The forced technology transfer issue. And I--and I want to make sure I'm saying that in the right way there. The--the forced technology transfer issue. There is a lot of technology transfer that goes on. You know, if a company is going to enter into an agreement in China, a joint venture in particular, and you've got a Chinese company as your negotiating partner, there's going to be a desire by each partner to try to get what they want out of the deal. </p><p>And lots of times the U.S. company might be looking at that Chinese partner because they provide some market access that they wouldn't otherwise have, or some other capabilities. Increasingly, so these days where Chinese companies who've gotten much better than a couple of decades ago. And the Chinese companies probably looking to that U.S. company for a few things too. </p><p>It might be capital, although in today's China, that's--that's probably less of a concern. But typically, it's going to be around technology, or our product capabilities, or brand even, you name it. So, there's going to be tech transfer in most of these deals, but most of it voluntary, all right? You're going to get some--something out of that deal to compensate you for that technology transfer. </p><p>And, of course it can't be technologies that are under export control either by the United States as well. So, we have export control rules that are designed to prevent the transfer type of technologies that are deemed to be a national security interest. But the bigger question is when is it forced? And that is when does the Chinese government or a Chinese company knowing it has the government behind it? Say, you know, you're not going to get market access. </p><p>You're not going to get a license to do anything here, unless you transfer this technology that you don't want to. And that certainly happens in certain sectors. Cloud computing is a great example. In order to enter the cloud computing market in China, foreign companies are going to have to give up technology. They're also going to have to give up being the face to the customer. And that's just too much for them to have to do. </p><p>But on the other hand, you've got this significant market. Can you really carve that out of the global market and still remain competitive elsewhere or not? And that's why it's such a critical question for those companies that are in that situation where they have to transfer technology they wouldn't otherwise want to, to get market access. One solution to this, to--to come back to your question, is getting rid of those joint venture requirements. Because you know, three quarters of American investment in China today, and it has been this way for, I don't know, 15 years at least, is into actually an entity that the U.S. company's going to own 100 percent of. </p><p>25 percent of U.S. investment has to go into a joint venture or does go into a joint venture. Some of those by design, but some of those, because foreign companies have to joint venture, those are where the real issues are, and that's where the leverage comes from--from the Chinese government. They can also--Chinese government can also leverage transfers perhaps when it's 100 percent U.S. owned entity, saying you're not going to get a license to set up this entity unless you share some technology with some type of entity. </p><p>But it's usually it's in those joint venture requirements. And so, the business communities were very specific with this administration as well as prior ones that we need to get rid of those joint venture requirements as one means to end technology transfer, where it's not voluntary. A separate issue going to be around cyber issues, and what that's doing with technology being taken, whether it's from, you know, military, or defense and so on, or whether it's coming out of the private sector. </p><p>GOTO: All right. One question I do want to ask you Bob before we turn to the audiences. Talking about the values, we've talked a lot this morning about American values, export of the American values, and at the same time dealing with Chinese control, and relinquishing control. I'm thinking specifically about the NBA incident, and--and the NBA supporting Hong Kong protestors. But it goes far beyond that, we've seen a lot of Chinese involvement in repressing the freedom to call Taiwan, Taiwan. </p><p>The companies like Marriott and-and Gap, not being able to label Taiwan separately from the--from--from China itself, we're all assisting for instance, I'm thinking about, you know, Tom Cruise coming out with the latest film, and he can't wear the jacket that he used to, because it has the flag of Taiwan as well as Japan on it. So, it's been scrubbed out. These are the kind of incursions that we're seeing from China. What does this mean for American values for, American enterprises actually doing business? Does it--does it enter the calculus, do you think? </p><p>DAVIS: It should. </p><p>GOTO: It should but? </p><p>DAVIS: I mean, you know this is a sort of put up or shut up moment, right? I mean, it's easy in the United States to criticize anybody. You know, how much criticism from the NBA or from the NFL is there of the Trump administration? You know, endless, right? How much criticism of any, you know, policy, any history, any legacy of the United States, that is embarrassing to all of us? </p><p>Okay, fine. But what's the penalty? Nothing. Right? So, if you stand up for those values in China, you pay a penalty. You're not going to go to jail. I mean, it's a question of, you know, I mean, how much does that market mean to you compared to the values you have, and the way in which you built this company, because you built this company because you know, the freedoms of the United States mattered enormously. And so, ethics are really simple when there's no penalty or no price to pay. </p><p>These ethics get really difficult when you pay a price. And that's--that's what China confronts us with. The other thing that's interesting is that if you look at corporate behavior now, compared to corporate behavior in the 80s and 90s, when China--when Japan was the target, and the same concerns, they were--there were CEOs, after CEO condemning Japan, famous CEOs Iacocca, the head of Intel, you know, condemning Japan. </p><p>And Trump actually came into--started to talk about trade issues at that time, but he was only one of many. I mean, what's different about Trump is everybody else is sort of, you know, stopped, and he still continues on, you know, saying this sort of same things that he said, but the difference was, U.S. companies weren't in Japan. They wanted to get in Japan. And so, it was easier to criticize because they were locked out. </p><p>American companies are in China, and it's much more difficult. So it is, yeah, it's--I mean the--the thing that I find totally fascinating about China is it upends everything you think you thought. It makes you rethink, you know, what is it, what's significant about the United States? What's significant about the world? And it just, you know, it's just an enormous challenge for everybody. </p><p>FRISBIE: Yeah, I had a comment, because you--you had mentioned Taiwan for example, how a company is treated. And I--and I think I would differentiate that a bit from what happened with the NBA. You know, the--the State Department, U.S. government, United Nations, the Olympics, they all recognize there's one China. No doubt about it. And they also carefully label things. It's complicated, it's nuanced. And I think for a lot of people, it's way--way more complicated than they can appreciate. </p><p>And so, I think companies have gotten into trouble when they don't quite understand it or whoever their web person is--is--is redoing a page, and ends up making Taiwan a different color. But that's something you wouldn't see the U.S. government do either. I don't think you should ask companies necessarily to get ahead of that. But it is complicated and that's why these issues keep coming up. </p><p>And one of the things that I always advise companies is make sure you're looking at your website, make sure you're looking at making--at how you're labeling things, and not implying somehow that Taiwan is an independent country because it isn't. And even like I said, the United States, the Olympics, the UN would say that too. But these are going to continue to get tripped up on, I'm sure because it is so--so complicated. But we shouldn't be asking companies to do more than--than those organizations I mentioned are not even doing themselves. </p><p>GOTO: All right, so follow the State Department. </p><p>FRISBIE: Yeah, because it--you know, if you're advocating separatism then yes, the--that's something that is going to be crossing the line in China. And that's where I think that issue was--was--was really focused on. And I think that's a little bit different to a certain extent than what happened with the NBA. The Chinese government was trying to make it about supposedly advocating separatism for Hong Kong. </p><p>That's not what was going on, that's not what was tweeted by--by Daryl Morey. And I think in the end that the NBA Commissioner got it right. It took maybe a news cycle. But, we said, you know, this is not something we endorse, but we certainly support his right for free speech. </p><p>GOTO: Okay, great. Well, thank you. That gives us a lot of food for thought. If you have any questions, there are microphones that are roaming. If you could please raise your hand. Yes, I see a brave soul Kent. Mic, mic. </p><p>KENT: Why are we talking about an industrial policy? And it strikes me that in rethinking our approach to China, we're contrasted in a world where they have a long-term strategy. They have a set of economic priorities, and we don't. And the question is, can we really compete with that different model? We've faced it a bit in Japan. We adapted to it, we did well in--in the longer term, but can we really avoid picking a set of key priorities? Let's say semiconductors, would we like a world in which we were totally dependent on China for microelectronics? </p><p>DAVIS: Could I take a crack at that? </p><p>GOTO: Yeah. </p><p>DAVIS: I used to cover Kent years ago when he was at the Council of Competitiveness. So, I know he's raised these issues for many years. I think one of the biggest absences in this current administration's efforts towards China's exactly what Kent's talking about. If you think about it, it's all defensive, it's tariffs on these sanctions on that. You can't come here, you know, unless you do x, y, and z. But where is the affirmative agenda? You know, where is the, I mean, the U.S. leads in almost, if not all the technologies that China talks about in terms of technologies of the future. </p><p>The U.S. has a lead, so what's the U.S. plan to keep that lead? We don't do--the United States doesn't do industrial policy in the way that China does. But it's phony. Its--its mistaken to think the U.S. doesn't do industrial policy. I mean, during the Reagan era, when again, the--with the challengers, Japan, they--they built SEMATECH, which was a project to keep the semiconductor industry, you know, ahead of Japan or to--to save part of the semiconductor industry. </p><p>They created the Semiconductor Research Council or Research Corporation rather, which pooled semiconductor research. There are ways in which the United States stays ahead. It has a rich innovation system, which relies enormously on federal funding of basic research. The administration plans to cut it every single year. Congress has reinstated it, but it's--it's remarkable to me. </p><p>And I've asked--I've asked administration officials exactly what I've said, so why--you know, why don't you--what's, you know--what's holding you back? And then all of a sudden, they become traditional Republicans. \"Well, we don't pick winners or losers.\" As if tariffs isn't exactly picking a winner and loser. Right? So anyway, that's my speech on that. </p><p>FRISBIE: Yeah. I mean, I don't think we should feel like the China model is one we want to emulate, I'm not sure we want to go down to their level necessarily. And I don't think necessarily that they're going to have this great success either. They can create a lot of damage in the meantime though, through, you know, supporting certain industries, and overcapacity and everything else. But even, you know, the headline--a lot of the headlines today are around China's slow down. </p><p>And is the Chinese economy in trouble? I don't think it's as much trouble as--as a lot of folks seem to. I don't think it gets into as much trouble as the Trump administration thinks too. And I think they got a lot less leverage around that, than--than they think. And somebody else may have an opinion on that. </p><p>LUNDGER: Agreed. </p><p>FRISBIE: But they are slowing down. Part of it is the fact that the economy is so doggone big. If you just look at that real GDP growth number every year, it's going to get smaller. It's off of a bigger base. There's some math going on here, but that's not all of it. There's another portion of it that has some choices they've been making, and you know, the last five or six years, and that is, they've gone back to funneling more resources, and more credit to their state-owned sector, which is incredibly inefficient. </p><p>And that's explained some of the problems, they've had when they were doing better and how-to higher growth and more efficient growth is primarily be driven by their private sector. Their private sector is being a little more star for capital. Now you've got people like Burke Tidal can speak better to this question than--than--than I can. But I don't think their model is necessarily one that's we want to emulate. </p><p>GOTO: Okay. Yes. </p><p>LUNDSAGER: Yeah, I just wanted to pick up on what John was saying and Bob too, what it's done. This point about China's still channeling a lot of resources into the state-owned enterprise is keeping that going, and then limiting the other sectors of the economy. It drives a lot of what we would consider to be more private--privately run or private type entities into what we would call shadow banking, different sources of finance. </p><p>So, they're borrowing at higher rates. There may be not, the lenders are not necessarily doing the same sorts of credit checks assessments, and so you may have a growing sort of undercurrent of debt there that's not captured in the official statistics. And I think a lot of these entities figure in the end, \"Oh well, the government will bail us out, they'll just tell the people's bank to tell the banks to lend to these guys, and keep it going.\" Which I do think can keep things going for a long time, but it builds up and it builds up and the question is will it reach a point where that then becomes a limit on the Chinese government's ability to handle all this? Not yet. </p><p>GOTO: Right. Okay. The gentlemen here, you could hold off. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you all for a great discussion. My name's Michael Waller. I'm a member of the Wilson Center national cabinet. The predicate for my question is the assumption that one can advance one's own arguments more effectively, if you're able to articulate the arguments of the party on the other side of the table. Can you take us behind the closed doors of these trade negotiations, and give us some sense about what the Chinese are bringing to the table in terms of the main points that they want to articulate or the context they put around them in order to persuade their American counterparts to see things their way. Thank you. </p><p>DAVIS: Well, I think, how would I phrase this? I think, I mean, it's--the Americans or the demanders in the terms of you know, the trade world. I mean, so they're asking for a lot of different things, right? And I think the Chinese response is, let's try to slow it down. Let's try to stretch it out. It's one sided, you know, what about change--you know, what about restrictions? What about things that we want, you know, visas, access to new technology, you know, acquisitions that you've--you've stopped. </p><p>And they've tried to make it more what they would call balanced. I mean, that's how they would argue it. And also, fundamentally, remember these are two sovereign nations, right? The United States can't get China to do anything. China has to agree to it. I mean we--we sort of overstate the power of the United States enormously. I mean, when the United States negotiated a trade deal with Colombia, you know, a moderate sized country that's enormously dependent on the U.S., it took years, years, right? </p><p>I mean, so there's a limit to what the U.S. can do, and China has the veto of just not agreeing. I mean, the--the cost to China, if they don't agree, is tariffs on virtually everything they sell in the United States. And maybe the loss of the U.S. market. But still it's a sovereign nation, and there's a limit to what the U.S. can push. And the--and the U.S. negotiators realize that. </p><p>LUNDSAGER: Can I just add, I found in my negotiations with the Chinese, when I was at Treasury doing financial services in the WTO, or even working with counterparts at the peoples bank, at the IMF. I always tried to use arguments that would be persuasive, that would end up--we'd end up with a win-win. Trying to come up with arguments that would show to the other person's advantage, the other countries advantage that it's to their benefit to enter this agreement. </p><p>And somehow, I get the sense that may be lost as--as Bob was really just illustrating. And I think that's really unfortunate because you get much more change likely to happen if they see it in their own interest. Right now, I don't think the U.S. is negotiating it in a way which is going to make the Chinese more inclined to change their state on enterprise-based system. So, I don't think we found a way to do it effectively and we haven't brought in other allies as my colleagues were suggesting that have the same problems, you know, for a lateral approach. </p><p>FRISBIE: I guess. Here's what I would add to it. You know, also not new but certainly intensified in the last couple of years is the amount of distrust in the relationship. And it's been building, it's always been--always been there to a certain step. It's certainly been building, but over the last two years it's been intensified. And from the Trump administration's perspective, there are those who--who had the view that you can't trust China to honor an agreement. </p><p>So, they can be very careful how we negotiate, one. Two, as Bob said, those who see China as the enemy, not in the future, but today, and you don't do a trade deal with the enemy. But at the same thing coming back the other way from Beijing, a lot of distrust towards the United States, some with the president because they're very wary about how they can do a deal with him, with any confidence that they can close about a change in on them. </p><p>So, they're already wary how they--they will--will approach to doing a deal with the United States, but there are those in China too who see the U.S. as their principal enemy. And who also feel that United States is really bent on containing China's rise. Again, not new that element's been there in--in China all along. But they've been emboldened by approaches or by actions taken on--on either side. And those that are more hawkish on either side, I think are--are in a stronger position now. </p><p>This matters because in China, they've had throughout their several decades of you know, in the post Mao--Mao era factions. Yes. And I'm going to go out a little bit on a limb here, so I can see Win Lord, and I can see Stape Roy back there who know a lot more about this than I do. But generally, you get those who are more reformed minded, and those who are more conservative minded, those who might favor a more reform type economy. </p><p>Those who favor maybe more of the state planning Soviet style, those who tend to be more just by what I just said favorable towards the U.S., those who see the U.S. more suspiciously. And I would say those in--in the second camp, have probably got a stronger voice right now, because they see a lot of the actions the United States is taking. We haven't even talked about, say Huawei for example. </p><p>But they see all that part of a--a design by the United States is to try to keep China down. So, you can imagine in that environment, it kind of makes it hard in their own interagency discussion about how they do--do a deal with the United States, how much do they concede? Because you're going to have voices over there that have a lot to point to right now. I will say, you can't trust the United States and we don't necessarily want to do a deal with them, like they're demanding. </p><p>A many deal, yeah, that can be done perhaps if it's purchases. But I think we haven't seen China yet indicate how--how they're going to ink that deal, and Bob alluded to this. They're going to step up agricultural purchases. They've already started doing that. Are they going to get to the number that the president put out there? I don't know. Are they going to require anything else around Huawei? Probably. Because I think the, you know, the two things that they wanted as they went into these talks, and that has--it's actually been there since the beginning is, relief on tariffs. </p><p>And so far, we've seen there is no additional tariffs, right? Not relief of what's been out there. And you still got tariffs that might go into effect on December 15th. It will be new tariffs as well. Those are still on the table unless this deal gets done. But the other thing I think that they want to see something on is Huawei, and that's a much more difficult issue for both sides, for the reasons I just said. </p><p>DAVIS: Could I just add something? You made me think of something there. So, we're at a different point in the negotiations at the moment, right? I mean, what's hanging out there are the remaining tariffs on basically consumer goods. When the president threatened tariffs on consumer goods, everybody but Navarro tried to talk them out of it. I mean, he went ahead and threatened with it anyway. </p><p>We're--we're--I mean, tariffs are always sort of shooting yourself in the foot a little bit or maybe a lot because U.S. companies are the ones paying the--paying the price. But in this one, in what's remaining, these are like 25 percent tariffs on iPhones, 25 percent tariffs on laptops. Consumers are going to notice iPhones going up 20 percent or 15 percent. The Chinese realize that the threat of tariffs is more and more diminished the further we get along. </p><p>I think the U.S. is sort of looking for an excuse not to have to put those last tariffs into effect. Or if they put them into effect, they have some sort of process where they really don't go--they really don't go into effect. So, you don't go to a Best Buy, or go to AT&amp;T store and have to pay 20 percent more for an iPhone. So, I think the--the leverage of the U.S. diminishes on the tariff part, and on Huawei, I mean, you reminded me, is we're very close to the decision on Huawei, about what sort of licenses, if any, will be permitted. </p><p>And I mean, the expectation largely is that non national security related items will be allowed to be shipped to--provided to Huawei. Now, of course, what is national security mean? I mean, that's a very difficult decision. So, I-- </p><p>FRISBIE: And it goes right into that debate you're talking about within the administration. Those who would say everything, and those who would say, maybe cell phones are okay, but not a 5G, you know, base stations. </p><p>DAVIS: Yeah, definitely. And also, it's so technical that if you're not, I mean for the sort of average person, I mean to understand this widget versus that widget, good luck. </p><p>GOTO: All right. The lady here in the bowed white shirt. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. This is Lee Howong from IBM. So, I'd like to hear the opinion from the panelists with the U.S. admin--administration retching up the measures to impose the strict control on the technology export to China. So, going forward, are we going to see a dualistic system of technology in which there will be two separate sets of infrastructures, and the standards in technology between China and the U.S., or this decoupling will be limited within a boundary? Because the globalization of supply chain is so deep that it's just not realistic to really decouple. Thank you. </p><p>FRISBIE: I think that, you know, it's not inevitable that the U.S. and China are going to spiral down and end up in a cold war. It's certainly a plausible scenario. And I think there's other scenarios that suggest that that doesn't happen--necessarily have to be the outcome. People matter, we've got an election coming up in a year. And you know, I think it's hard to predict where things might go. But I would say no matter how things end up, and if you get maybe a more pragmatic administration that comes in may return to a more multilateral approach, for example, as some of the candidates have talked about or maybe less reliance on tariffs. </p><p>You will still see, I think some decoupling, because I think the momentum is already there and underway. But the extent of it is what's to be determined. So yes, U.S. export controls towards China are going to be tightened up, on the investment side. There will also be greater scrutiny over inbound Chinese investments. But the operative question is, to what extent is national security going to be defined? Is it going to be broadly, or is going to be more narrowly defined on legitimate security risks? </p><p>Business community would--would clearly want to see it defined, you know, on legitimate security risks as narrowly as possible, but recognizes that there needs to be a change from the current rules today because technologies change. And--and maybe there needs to be a rethink but not have it been so broad based that, you know selling a pencil to Huawei is design--is defined as being a security risk. </p><p>So, I think there'll be some, but the extent of it is still to be determined. There's also a man and woman for decoupling on the Chinese side too. They have certainly seemed to make clear to themselves their vulnerability to rely on the United States for certain technologies. You know, when you--when you put Huawei on the entities list, and then you see how much they rely on U.S. supply, even though there's maybe some work around. Yeah, that tells them that they've got vulnerabilities they need to address. </p><p>This is kind of the sad irony of--of the approach, or the business community has been concerned about China's indigenous innovation drive for a decade, and how it's designed to--to in essence be a protectionist policy that might keep American companies out of the market there. China's made in China--Made in China 2025 program, is in essence indigenous innovation with--with a different name. And it's the centerpiece of--of the trade representative Robert Lighthizer's 301 case as well, is really focused on things like Made in China 2025. </p><p>But at the same time, the other actions is being taken by other parts of the administration are leading the Chinese to conclude they need to double down on indigenous innovation because of those vulnerabilities. So, I think there's momentum for some decoupling on both sides is going to continue on. But I think there could be limits on it that might not make it as extreme as some might want on each side. </p><p>LUNDSAGER: I would just add, I am a little, well, I--I hope that's your right then it won't be that bad, but I am a little worried, because the U.S. certainly this administration has been willing to, or has been energetic about stretching that national security definition to cover all sorts of things. I mean, when we hit Canada, Canadian steel based on a national security law, I was just astounded. </p><p>I mean, how can Canada be a national security threat to the United States? So, it really--I mean, I think that's such a clear signal of how far this administration is willing to go and grab, like in the CFI's process, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which is a strengthening its rules, right as we speak. </p><p>Will that then be an opportunity, or will we start seeing this kind of thing where it gets to be instead of a technical discussion among those who really understand it and the different agencies, a much more political discussion, because they broadened the aspects of foreign investment that they're looking at under the law, the amended law? So, I am a little worried, I'm not, maybe-- </p><p>FRISBIE: It's fine to be worried. </p><p>LUNDSAGER: Yeah. So, I'll just stop there. </p><p>GOTO: All right. And also, just to add to that national security issue other countries are actually taking a leaf out of America's playbook and--and using that for justifying their own trade barriers as well. So, I know there are some other questions, but I'm afraid that we are running out of time, so hopefully our panelists will be able to take your questions offline, so to speak. But in the meantime, if you could please help me in thanking our panelists today. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>There is also lunch, which will be served across from you and I believe Senator Coons will be giving the keynote lunch address. So, I do hope you'll stay. Thank you for coming. </p><p>HARMAN: Forum on U.S. China relations, which the Wilson Center is very, very proud to co-host. I'm Jane Harman, a director and CEO of the Wilson Center. And while you're enjoying lunch, keep eating. There are sweets in the middle of the table. We'll keep supplying the brain food. Our discussion of U.S.-China relations now kicks into higher gear with remarks by the junior Senator from Delaware who should come and sit--Chris, why don't you sit in the middle? I love instructing senators. By the junior Senator from Delaware. </p><p>Chris Coons has been outspoken on China as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Co-Founder of the Senate Human Rights Caucus. A second term Senator, he's also Vice Chair of the Senate Ethics Committee, and sits on the appropriations and judiciary committees. We love the appropriations committee at the Wilson Center. Hint, hint, hint. Thank you for our increase. </p><p>When Nixon made his historic trip to China in 1972, we checked this out. Chris was nine, but he was old enough, and I'm sure he was doing this to be following--following the news coverage. And he has surely done his homework since. Appropriately enough, Senator Coons lunch address is sandwiched, pun, between our last--boo--our last panel on the trade war, and our next panel on human rights and religious freedom, issues close to his heart. And I know in the hearts of everybody here. </p><p>Chris, you and I last spoke about China in Aspen in early August, following your trip to China earlier this year, and earlier this month. As you know, the United States blacklisted 28 China tech companies and organizations for their role in enabling human rights violations against the Uighurs. This was announced just days before Chinese vice premier, Liu He visited Washington for the latest round of trade talks. The talks made progress on what President Trump called phase one of a longer term trade deal. But as Win Lord told me, there's no evidence of what this deal actually says yet. And stay tuned, maybe we will see some, just hoping that we will. </p><p>So next page is here. Meanwhile, after 130 days of protests, the unrest in Hong Kong has not waned despite the withdrawal of a bill that sparked the protests. The bill would have allowed citizens to be--that was withdrawn, would've allowed citizens to be extradited and tried in Chinese courts. The protesters anger is now focused on violent police tactics. And no one missed the import of Chinese President Xi's warning last week in Nepal. That anyone who attempts to split any region from China will have \"Their body smashed and bones ground to powder.\" </p><p>Obviously this is a complex situation and in the spirit of Richard Nixon, Hugh Hewitt is about to join me as we ask you questions, following your remarks. In the spirit of Nixon, having a relationship with China matters to all of us, despite the bumps and this effort today, and I know the efforts you make in the Senate are geared to trying to manage the relationship and manage the bumps. And it is a very good thing. I will say this about you sir, who is slightly late because there were votes in the Senate today and at noon. </p><p>COONS: We do that occasionally. </p><p>HARMAN: No comment, no comment. I will restrain myself. It is a very good thing that you serve in the Senate, and that you are serious about the international and complex issues we face. And so please welcome Senator Chris Coons for some opening remarks and then Hugh and I will pose questions. </p><p>COONS: Forgive me. Thank you for the introduction. As I struggle a little bit with logistics for a second. We have a duct taped microphone, so hopefully that will work. Great. Thank you Jane. Thank you to everybody here at the Wilson Center. Thanks for your forbearance given that I was engaging in that, all too rare, but still structurally important activity of voting, in the United States Senate. And to Hugh, thank you for the opportunity to be with you today. I look forward to what I know will be searching, challenging and well-informed questions. </p><p>And to those of you who are visiting from the Nixon Library and Foundation in California, I'm pleased you've chosen to focus on--in this conference, on not just the very important current set of issues in our bilateral relationship, but the history of how our countries got to this point, and the willingness of leaders from both the United States and the People's Republic of China to think boldly, and think creatively about ways to advance the shared interests of our countries. </p><p>What kind of world will we inhabit together in the future? What rules will govern global conduct? How will we manage a rapidly changing climate? Nuclear proliferation? The spread of deadly pandemics? The technologies that will shape our emerging future? These are the questions that the United States and China, as the world's largest economies with the most international influence and power must answer. We share an interest in working together to address these vital and pressing questions. I favor a relationship with China in which we strive to cooperate as much as we compete in our efforts to set the rules that will govern international affairs. </p><p>The reality of course, is that there will be times when our views, our values, and our interests are at odds. And those moments will require us to have frank exchanges and more engagement, not less. As Robert Daly has suggested in his work here at the Wilson Center. It will be vital critical for leaders of both countries to define and articulate our interests, and priorities precisely and dispassionately. </p><p>Inevitably, there will be areas in which we can, and should compete. And today I want to take a few minutes, and outline what I believe a sustained and bipartisan American strategy for dealing with China looks like. The goal of this strategy is fairly simple, that the United States should retake its position as the leader of free and open societies around the world, while making the necessary investments to secure our competitive edge. </p><p>We must strive to coexist, compete, and cooperate with China. And all three are possible. This strategy requires meaningful engagement from every aspect of American society. From government, to our private sector in Silicon Valley, to academia, think tanks and other critical institutions. So let me start by making a few overarching points if I could that inform my views. </p><p>First, recent talk of a renewed cold war, a cold war with China, is both inaccurate at best and self-fulfilling or even dangerous at worst. Over the last 40 years, the United States and China have benefited enormously from the establishment of strong ties and deep economic interaction with each other. Hundreds of millions of Chinese have raised themselves out of poverty through determined hard work after Deng Xiaoping embraced market forces. And as a result, China has become a pure competitor of the United States. It is time to stop talking about the rise of China, and recognize China is a peer competitor today. </p><p>Nonetheless, China's decision to neither open up politically, nor economically, sends its succession to the WTO in 2001, has forced us to a point where we now must reexamine, recalibrate, and adjust the parameters of our relationship. President Trump's tariff war, and Vice President Pence's October, 2018 speech at the Hudson Institute, have certainly gotten the attention of China's leadership and principally President Xi Jinping. And while I want to see the trade war end as do millions of American farmers, and manufacturers, and business owners, there is bipartisan consensus, that it should not end until we have rebalanced our trade relationship, to allow countries to compete on a level playing field globally. </p><p>As I've traveled across the United States, I've been to 10 city--excuse me, yes, 10 cities in the last two weeks. There is a broad anger in our country, rooted in the perception that China has literally stolen the future of our middle-class. That is a broadly shared consensus across many states and many contexts. Thus, if there is a mistaken belief that a Democrat winning the white house in 2020 would fundamentally change what other dynamics between the United States and China in terms of discriminatory economic practices, I think they will not change. And I think frankly, this is going to be a consistent pressure, and challenge from American domestic politics going forward. </p><p>We also must make it clear as a nation and a people, that we are not opposed to China's success. That we have a deep respect for China's ancient culture and many accomplishments. And that the United States seeks to partner with China on many of the critical challenges that cross transnational borders. But at the same time, we cannot be naive. </p><p>The United States must be vigilant about China's assertiveness abroad and recognize that if we want to preserve the openness that is so central, so beneficial to our country and our place in the world over the last seven decades, we need to clarify our interest to Chinese officials. Work with our allies and partners to present a united message to China, and commit ourselves to domestic democratic renewal. As former U.S. officials like Tom Donald and Richard Haass have pointed out, in the case of competing with China, our foreign policy must begin at home. </p><p>In Congress, this means working in good faith with colleagues from both sides of the aisle. To reinvest in our communities and live up to and demonstrate the capacity, the potential of our democratic values to solve the real problems facing American families and America's economy. I want to offer up four specific ways in which the United States must play a leading role in working with its like-minded partners to preserve freedom and openness. </p><p>These domains of competition, are our seas and oceans, the industries of the future, the shape of the global economy, and the values systems of our societies. I'll also lay out a series of actions we can take now within the U.S. domestic context in each of these arenas to lay a better and stronger foundation for the future. </p><p>First, we must make clear we intend to preserve open ceilings and freedom of navigation around the world. China like us, has an interest in keeping the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Straits of Malacca, other key maritime lanes open. Yet Chinese Island building in the South China Sea. The course of activity, of its maritime militia. The opening of its first overseas military base in Djibouti. All run the risk of constraining international shipping, the free flow of trade, and U.S. military operations. </p><p>U.S. leaders must work to bring their Chinese counterparts to the negotiating table, to establish an agreed upon maritime code of conduct, and maritime deterrence. The Chinese should know which of their actions we oppose, and our willingness to respond to preserve open ceilings. We should work with regional partners to improve maritime domain awareness, conduct regular freedom of navigation exercises, and maintain our military presence in the region. </p><p>Finally, the Senate should at long last ratify the United Nations convention on the law of the sea. To bolster our ability to resolve maritime disputes peacefully, and enshrine freedom of navigation as an international norm. During the summer of 2012, when I was a newly installed Senator serving on foreign relations, I watched in amazement as literally dozens of credible, serious, diplomatic military and business leaders, testified over a long series of hearings about the urgency of this matter. This treaty first advanced by the Reagan Administration, yet they were ignored by a minority in the other party who claimed that ratification would harm our sovereignty. I think the consequences have been significant, and harmful. And we have not been able to approach the developments in the South China Sea from a position of strength as a result. </p><p>There are also steps we can take to improve our ability to safeguard the seas by adjusting our defense budget. Our military doesn't necessarily need to be any larger, but it does have to become more modern. As Chris Brose has written in foreign affairs, a revolution in military affairs is occurring today as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, ubiquitous sensors, advanced manufacturing, quantum science, and other emerging technologies transform warfare and war fighting platforms and systems in ways we haven't seen in living memory. </p><p>We should reprioritize our defense spending accordingly. Brose writes, and I quote, \"A military made up of small numbers of very large, very expensive, heavily manned, harder placed systems, will not survive on battlefields. Success will require a different kind of military. One built around large numbers of small, inexpensive, expendable, highly autonomous systems.\" We look at our annual budget, which is now around 750 billion, and feel safer. By rank orderings, it say we spend more on defense than the next 10 nations combined. But we are not spending it as effectively as we should be, as we must be. Spending $15 billion on an aircraft carrier that is vulnerable to a $10 million anti-ship missile is simply unwise. </p><p>We should innovate and invest in new technologies that can swarm, dominate and overwhelm adversaries and thus deter conflict. The United States has an unquestionable and sustained interest in enduring--excuse me, in insuring open seas. Where China acknowledges this shared interest, we can work in partnership with them, but where they do not, we must work with allies and partners enshrine international norms through UNCLOS, and alter our military spending. This leads me to the next and arguably the most important area in which the United States and China are already competing. </p><p>The rules governing emergency--emerging technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing, biotechnology, and the internet of things. Unlike the world of 30 years ago, each of these new technologies, each of these new technologies has a national security application, and the technical and ethical standards of conduct in fields like cyber, outer space, internet, and in particular internet of things, have yet to be written and embraced. America's dominant position in technology and innovation has given us significant advantages in setting the stage for open, and interoperable systems that underpin the concepts of innovation, freedom, and creative development. </p><p>If that advantage instead slides and then shifts to an autocratic actor, who is designing and setting rules in different ways in these core areas, our ability to set the terms of interactions for everything, from business dealings, to social and political discourse based on ethical, inclusive and fair standards is foundationally at risk. Technology is a tool of national power, China is wielding to achieve its aims. The U.S. government and our tech industry should view this as a generational call to action. That's why I'm so determined to help shape our country's approach toward China going forward, and this issue is increasingly the focus of my legislative work on revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, protecting patent holders and patent essential standards and 5G and other emerging sectors, and supporting new technologies in my home state of Delaware and across the country. </p><p>The most important thing we can do to respond to China's rise is to strengthen our own capacity for innovation. We must reinvest in federally funded research and development, in STEM education, throughout all of our schools, we should improve coordination between the federal government, and tech hubs across our country. We should work with likeminded partners across Europe and the Indo-Pacific to regain a competitive edge, and lead efforts to form an international technology alliance and establish the rules, and regulations that will sustain, an enduring open internet and set the standards for the technologies of the future. </p><p>As we strive to keep the internet open, and the applications of these technologies ethical, we must understand some of these industries will require a degree of government protection. That's why Congress passed reforms to close loopholes in the review of foreign investment known in the United States as CFIUS. As CIS--CSIS think tank scholar, James Lewis, and others have pointed out, U.S. technological leadership has flourished by embracing openness, but this openness cannot be so lazy fair and unguided as to ultimately lead to our demise. I recommend notionally building a high fence around a small yard of our most critical insensitive technologies, but as we safeguard these crown jewels of technology, we also have to strike the right balance to avoid a situation where there is a decoupling of global tech industries between the United States and China. This brings me to my third area of competition. </p><p>Trade. Anyone thinking about trade today? We need to rethink our trade strategy, and focus it on stopping China's intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer while acknowledging that other problematic Chinese economic behaviors, like state subsidization of key industries are unlikely to change given the difference in our core models of governance. While President Trump's tariffs on China have effectively gotten president Xi's attention, they have also hit our vital allies across Europe, North America, and Japan. China has countered with forceful tariffs of its own creating uncertainty and shifting global supply chains. </p><p>There's where--there's ways we can and should restore our role, as a global leader for open markets and free trade. We have to work with our allies to reform the WTO, and enforce the rules that we helped write and establish decades ago. We also have to set the standards. When it comes to international infrastructure, especially digital and communications infrastructure. I have concerns about Belt and Road finance projects that leave recipients trapped in debt, or destroy the environment, or undermine human rights, or ignore labor and social standards. </p><p>We should encourage China in a direction embraced by Xi Jinping in his opening remarks at this year's Belt and Road Conference, to enforce the highest international standards, and build on our administration's ongoing efforts to deploy American transaction assistance teams. To train foreign governments and how best to negotiate appropriate and better terms when engaging in BRI projects. We also have to offer an alternative. As many heads of state have said to me, Belt and Road, you can criticize it, but where is your alternative? </p><p>I worked hard with the Trump Administration, and with a bipartisan, bicameral group of colleagues to pass the bill act. To create a modernized 21st century development finance corporation, an institution with an expanded scope and scale to provide a new tool in our toolkit and a meaningful response. I am excited this new agency can secure up to 60 billion in U.S. private capital, while falling short of the amount of funds that China's making available through Belt and Road, this new DFC has capabilities and authorities to allow us to partner with our allies, DFCS, in the Indo-Pacific, Europe and across the world. And it'll offer a clear alternative to Chinese financing and showcase projects that comply with the best international practices. </p><p>The fourth and final area in which we are likely to compete with China is over values. As CFR scholar Elizabeth Economy has pointed out, under the rule of President Xi Jinping, the CCP is today using over 200 million surveillance cameras to roll out a social credit system that either punishes or rewards Chinese people for their everyday behavior. The number of foreign nongovernmental organizations operating in China has plummeted from roughly 7,000 to 400 in just two years. The CCP has not only repressed a million Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang Province, but has rallied a group of illiberal states to express support for its reeducation camps. </p><p>China has raised doubts about whether it will respect Hong Kong's autonomy, and the terms of the 1997 agreement it signed with the United Kingdom, and I think they should respect that agreement, not just in word, but indeed. And the United States should support the right of peaceful protestors in Hong Kong, and encourage China to do the same. We cannot underestimate the role of the United States as a beacon of hope to those around the world who seek to follow a more open and democratic path. I believe we have a profound interest in preserving democratic space in standard--excuse me, in societies around the world. We can do this by promoting standards of good governance, transparency, press freedom, and universal values in our conduct at home, as well as in multi-lateral settings at the United Nations and abroad. </p><p>Instead of viewing the UN as a burden that somehow infringes on our sovereignty the United States should reconsider its engagement as an opportunity to display American leadership. There's areas where we can and should collaborate with China, at the UN. The fight against climate change, or in the vital work against Ebola, and addressing nuclear non-proliferation or in UN peace keeping missions. The first time I met a Chinese flag ranking officer was in visiting a UN peace keeping mission in South Sudan. But we need to clearly define our interests in using the UN to preserve the values espoused not just in our own foundational documents, but in the universal declaration of human rights. Since the Trump Administration has withdrawn, from UNESCO and the UN human rights council, China has filled that void calling itself now the champion of multilateralism. And within the human rights council, China advocates for each country to choose its own model of human rights protection in the context of its own national circumstances. </p><p>This is a basic disagreement. I believe in the universality and desirability of our democratic system, and I think we need to remain true to our values here at home. And in doing so, demonstrate the system's strengths. The ways in which democratic government can produce strong and better results for its people. Elected officials should not attack or criticize the legitimate reporting of the free press. They shouldn't vilify dedicated career public servants. Instead, we need to roll up our sleeves and demonstrate democracy works by delivering bipartisan solutions on education, infrastructure, healthcare. </p><p>We shouldn't be afraid to address our deficit, which is on an unsustainable path, and represents a national security threat in and of itself. We have to be honest with ourselves about our own shortcomings in both domestic and foreign policy, and then address them in a sustainable and bipartisan manner.  </p><p>In conclusion, I'm glad there wasn't a round of applause. In conclusion, we should use all the tools of U.S. diplomacy, capability and influence to keep the world free, and open and inclusive. Our strategy for dealing with China has to be more sophisticated than simply saying, BRIs a debt trap diplomacy, and China's treatment of the Uighurs is bad. China's theft of intellectual property is wrong. We must have a more complex, broad and deep strategy with regards to China. </p><p>While I agree with these three concerns, sentiment is not a strategy. It's an attitude, and I'm concerned it is an attitude based on fear, and a sense of our own insecurity. It is unrealistic--it is profoundly unrealistic, to think that merely repeating our view of why we don't like China's behavior will somehow cause China to change. Xi Jinping and the CCP are redoubling their dedication to their core model, and they believe they have a legitimate case to make to the rest of the world that their model of development works better. </p><p>So frankly, I think we should exercise some humility, and be realistic about our prospects of changing the CCP. Today, I've tried to lay out an alternative approach. To be vigilant and clear eyed about what China's doing. To express our disagreements with them, frankly. But, to not allow that to be our sole focus. We have to articulate and demonstrate why our ideas, our standards, and international practices are better for all nations. We need to approach our role in this century with confidence in the American way, in our model that reflects the dignity of the individual, promotes freedom of navigation, fosters economic openness, innovation and competition, through freer and fairer trade, and a model that promotes the free press and free exchange of ideas across an open internet. </p><p>That's our alternative. To a world based on authoritarian surveillance. That's the American model. And if we're to reassert and reclaim our role as the leader of free and open societies, that share our values, we have to be true to who we say we are and show the rest of the world our model works. Government by consent of the governed can be remarkably messy. But, it is still the best form of government in the world at advancing peace, prosperity, and security, and addressing the legitimate needs of its citizens. We have to set that example right here at home. Thank you. And I look forward to your questions. </p><p>HARMAN: If--just housekeeping interruption, that was a tour de force, but I've asked Chris how long he can stay, and Hugh, I'm asking you this too. I can stay until 1:10, and if--and I may bail on you, my apologies. But I--I just--let me turn this Hugh, but let me just make one comment, which is, if more members of the United States Congress had the sophistication on issues that you do in both parties, we would be in a much better place. So thank you very much for that careful speech. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>HEWITT: I'll take the first question. It's great to be with Senator Coons. We met where all conservative journalists meet, democratic senators in the SLR lounge at Penn Station. And I want a picture of me with the both of the reasonable Democrats in Washington, D.C. I--I'd like that. They're both--I said both. I said both. </p><p>HARMAN: Let's take it. </p><p>HEWITT: So the--my first question goes to your first statement. We have the Dean of Harvard Law School over here. But I'm going to quote the Dean of the Kennedy School of Government Graham Alison, \"If you don't want a cold war, prepare for a cold war.\" You began by saying you didn't believe we were in a cold war. Aren't we better off, if we were to prepare for one, even though you don't think we were in one, and that would mean an NDAA, and an increasing defense budget, and the defense transition you talked about, but all of the above? </p><p>COONS: I think that a casual talk about, we are inevitably headed into a cold war, is a mistake. But being unprepared, or ill prepared for the possibility of conflict is an equally grave mistake. So two things, in the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union, our economies and our technological systems were discrete and distinct. We are in a profoundly different place with China today, first.  </p><p>Second, we were, I think ultimately successful in the cold war because we led a global alliance of countries that had similar values and priorities. I am gravely concerned that we have weakened our standing as the nation best able to articulate, and show the benefits of open societies and democratic governance. And so if I had a central message around this, it, was not--let's not prepare. It was, let's first be clear eyed, that the weakness of the current practice of our own democracy in the capital in which I serve is one of our greatest strategic weaknesses. And we should address that. </p><p>HARMAN: Just to follow on this Hugh. Chris made a huge point about the revolution in military affairs, RMA, and the need to retool, rethink our defense budget. I think most people here would agree with that. Certainly we're--we're not fighting wars anymore with our vests on firing muskets across a, you know--a--a field. The--the way we fight wars with technology is totally different. And I would say we're under prepared as someone who has studied this. And that is a step toward being ready in the event that this thing goes south. </p><p>So, I--I just have one question, Chris, and it's on the other thing you talked about, which is the rise of technology and 5G and so forth. Some people have written about the fact that we are behind on 5G, behind China. And we may end up in a situation where we basically have two different 5G systems. Theirs and ours. And ours will be weaker, and ours will be more vulnerable than theirs. Do you see this, and do you think that Congress is doing anything to either legislate or at least consider what some better options are?   </p><p>COONS: I don't see that as the inevitable outcome, but it is a possible outcome. We--there are--there are relatively few options for the manufacturer and deployment of affordable high quality western sourced physical systems for 5G. And having met with folks from all three of the major manufacturers and purveyors from South Korea and from the Scandinavian country-- </p><p>HARMAN: None of which is a U.S. manufacturer. </p><p>COONS: None of which is a U.S. based. But, we shouldn't over privilege the physical networks, because an awful lot of what is going to make 5G, 5G is software that's going to sit on those physical networks. And it's important to recognize our significant competitive advantage in developing cutting edge software. I worry when I have conversations about 5G, and it is a conversation that is really about the United States, and deployment within the United States. We will certainly be successful in deployment within the United States, and it will be rapid, and it will be successful. </p><p>It's the developing world that I'm most focused on. I've spent, as you know, a lot of time in Africa. There are dozens and dozens of countries that already have a built out 4g backbone that will be extremely expensive and difficult to replace with a western sourced 5G backbone. And this raises basic technological questions. What is it we're seeking? What is it we're trying to do? And how do we establish standards for 5G that are sustainably promoting openness? I think there's a lot more we should be doing governmentally to advance that. </p><p>HEWITT: Let me go from the concern about under reaction to the worry about overreaction. In past competitions with the Soviets, we ended up making civil liberties a casualty of that, with a red scare in the 20s, and McCarthyism in the 50s. Now we have a concern over-- a legitimate concern over the PRCS intelligence operations in the United States, which adversely impacts our Chinese American fellow citizens and visa. What do you do to both combat the PRC--and by the way, it's legitimate for nation state to try and do that. We do it. There are efforts in the United States with the concern the Chinese Americans might feel as though they're being targeted. </p><p>COONS: That's a great question Hugh, and you know, there's about 350,000 Chinese nationals who are students at American universities. They play an absolutely central role in our advanced research and they make enormous contributions to our universities. They are great participants in what makes our university system the world's leading system of research and scholarship and work. But I'm struck at how many university leaders I've met with were either ill-informed about, or, frankly oblivious to some of the challenges around clarifying what are appropriate and what are inappropriate behaviors, what are secure and what are risky behaviors in terms of research, and who has what access to what information.  </p><p>There have been, as you know, tragic instances of overreach arguably even a racial profiling and of now widely publicized ill-considered prosecutions that have significantly harmed relationships and standing of Chinese-American researchers in this country. This requires subtlety. It requires communication across the silos of our intelligence community, and our academic community, which often are not closely aligned or even communicating. And it requires some subtlety, and some forbearance on the part of our counter-intelligence efforts to really be careful and to make certain that they are making cases where they make them, that are very well founded. Because the secondary consequences of prosecutions that are not well-founded are significant. </p><p>I'm grateful you cite two previous times in our history, where civil liberties went out the window. We have to be careful not to do that here. The first Senate campaign on which I worked on--which I worked was for a Lieutenant Governor who happened to be born in China. Became a Chinese-American and was a physics professor, and he's made me quite aware of the ways in which this is harming both academic freedom, our engagement, country to country, people to people and the careers and reputations of Chinese Americans. </p><p>HARMAN: Okay. I think I'll pass and give the audience more time. </p><p>HEWITT: Okay. That's great. Always give the court more time. Who has a question? Wait, let me start back here. </p><p>HARMAN: Please identify yourself. Do we have--we have a microphone? Yep. </p><p>QUESTION: Yeah. Thank you all very much. This issue with (INAUIBLE) Hong Kong human rights and democracy act. So this question is for Senator, do you think it can be passed in the Senate? </p><p>COONS: Was your question, will the Hong Kong human rights and democracy act pass the Senate? I have learned not to predict what will actually pass the Senate because what I'm told on Thursday, even by the majority leader, \"Oh, this is right, by sometimes, you never know.\" Likely. It has just passed the house by voice vote recently. Tuesday, it has passed the foreign relations committee. I think the odds that it will pass the Senate by an overwhelming vote are very high. And I think it will pass soon, but that prediction was free, and worth everything you paid for it, so. </p><p>HEWITT: Thank you. Let me go away to the end of this room over here. There's someone down there? I want to make sure I don't excuse. Okay, go ahead. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you Senator. My name is Jeanine Wing with Voice of Vietnamese Americans. I thank you for saying that the U.S. should take back our leadership, and especially with the international law. The laws are the--for the last 70 years, which led us till today. So thank you for that. I would like to ask your pragmatic view regarding the South China Sea. The situation of Southeast agency and like in particular the Vietnam relationship between U.S. and China. You did mention-- </p><p>HEWITT: That's great. Let's--let's leave it there, so we use it after. </p><p>QUESTION: I want to ask about the COC, because you made a particular point, saying that the U.S., China should discuss the COC that is beyond the China and as on COC. I would like to ask you to explain that too. Thank you. </p><p>HEWITT: Code of conduct. </p><p>COONS: Right. I assumed you're talking about a code of conduct. So you know, the South China Sea is a fraught area for geopolitical tensions where I think we have let too much time pass, and too much activity happen without a clear and more forceful American engagement and response. The last visit I had the honor of making to Vietnam was with Senator McCain. And I think there is a--a very strong potential for our relationship helping define what will be the future of the South China Sea. </p><p>A code of conduct as I was talking about it as simply a way to make clearer what our expectations, what are the moments when--how do we avoid conflict? How do we manage competing expectations about operations, and how do we come up with a path forward in terms of accessing the resources of the South China Sea with a--with an eye towards keeping them open, and accessible. Without engaging the international legal framework of the UN convention on the law of the sea, and without actively engaging in supporting our regional partners and allies? I'm concerned that--that the moment for freedom of navigation, and openness will pass. It is dangerously close to having done so now. </p><p>HEWITT: I'm going to inject a question because when Congresswoman Harman and Rob Litwak, who's taken her place on your left, and I put this together, we didn't expect that the NBA would be at the center of the weeks' controversy, or that LeBron James would dominate the Nixon forum. What is your advice to the commissioner of the NBA and those who compete in the league about their statements about this, and whether or not to be silent or to speak up and how to speak up? </p><p>COONS: A great question to which I don't have a great answer. I'll tell you that it was a striking development that a relatively minor communication has produced such a strong pushback, and now sort of moment professional sports has on many occasions over decades provided moments, or opportunities of protest, or engagement here in the United States. I think it is just 50 years--51 years since the protest by U.S. to U.S. track stars at the Mexico City Olympics that drew a great deal of attention. So, this certainly isn't the first time that professional sports, whether football, or basketball has drawn attention. </p><p>I am concerned that this shows the ways in which the economic relationship between the United States and China has privileged a values conversation. The United States has to be a society that stands for peaceful protest, and for democratic values. And while I respect the fact that U.S. headquartered companies are not exclusively American companies, they have global interests. This is showing more pointedly, and in more a real way to the average American that just because this is a local basketball team, that you think of as an American basketball team, doesn't mean that the business of basketball is restricted to the United States, and doesn't have other priorities. </p><p>That's true of Hollywood. It's true of Silicon Valley. It's true of our manufacturing companies. It's true of our service companies. As our companies increasingly have as much of a footprint in China in terms of their current and future growth, as they do elsewhere in the world, they've come into conflict between our values, and China's values. My hope is that in this case the NBA will speak up on behalf of peaceful protest. But I'm not optimistic about it. </p><p>And I do think it should cause a wide range of Americans to think about. What do we expect of our institutions? If we are cheering for, and buying the gear of and supporting a particular sports franchise, do we expect them to take a position that is fundamentally American, or do we really not care? Is it really not our business, what they do in the rest of the world? That's a basic challenge that we need to--to sort out, and since I'm from Delaware, the home of more American corporations than any other state in the country. </p><p>I'll tell you, this is a conversation that the business round table, and the Chamber of Commerce and others are beginning to have about, what are the obligations of business? In Delaware's courts, it is shareholder value, but there are corporate leaders who are beginning to say perhaps we should have a definition of corporate responsibility that is a--a notch broader, and I think there is the unexamined expectation, the part of most American fans, that sports franchises are American. And this is a wakeup call that no, they're not. They're global businesses that are trying to generate revenue, and the Chinese market for basketball fans and basketball viewership is enormous and very attractive. </p><p>And so this should be the moment--I think a moment that precipitates a conversation. When we have a values conflict with China, how does that impact our economic interaction, and to the American consumer and voter, what is it that you expect of name brands? As you may know, I was in house counsel for a global brand, 20 years ago, and most Americans think of it as an American invented, American headquartered, American operating company. But it's a truly global company that had as many operations in China, and in Europe as it did in the United States. And we had conversations around the C-Suite about exactly this issue that today, because of this example, is now made more present and more real, but it is an unresolved issue. </p><p>What are our expectations of corporate conduct, and what, if any, actions should we take governmentally or societally to say you're not a global company, you're an American company. </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) one more question. </p><p>HEWITT: One more question. </p><p>COONS: All right. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you for coming senator. My name is Mitchell Nakai Japan native U.S. citizen. Can you comment on the negotiation with North Korea up to this point? </p><p>COONS: Can I comment on the negotiations with North Korea up to this point? I appreciate the brevity and yet challenge embedded in that question. Look, I try to give credit where possible to our president. He certainly took a bold step in agreeing to meet in person with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un. And he accomplished in their first summit something that for the families of, our war dead from the Korean conflict is significant. But it was a framework that was paper thin and has not produced any significant progress. </p><p>The tensions between Japan and South Korea, the challenges between the United States and North Korea. The regional challenges I think are significant. And if anything have become more pressing. With the recent deployment of a submarine launched missile, and the resumption of missile tests, and the likely resumption of nuclear enrichment and our weapons production activity, the almost certain continued practice of that, this is in many ways the most pressing national security challenge we have. </p><p>And I don't think that high stakes photo op diplomacy between two leaders that aren't well prepared, by pre-negotiations that bring in regional players are likely to be successful. This is essentially a regional, and global non-proliferation problem. I think there is the possibility of a good deal with North Korea, but walking away from the JCPOA, and its structure for searching inspections, for transparency, and it was a flawed deal that did not have, the sort of, the end of the box was not drawn in, don't get me wrong. </p><p>But it was the best reasonable approximation of what a deal looked like that allowed a country to rejoin the world of nations, and to engage in open commerce. And--and my concern is that by tearing that up, we send a clear and strong signal that any deal reached between the United States and North Korea is not a reliable, longer term deal, a, b, Libya continues, I think to be a haunting challenge for those of us who would like to see a number of things in our future. And if I were advising Kim Jong-un, how's that for a sentence? Had to put oneself in those shoes. </p><p>Why would he choose to give up nuclear weapons? If Gaddafi's outcome has been less than desirable from Gaddafi's perspective, or, if Ukraine, which gave up their nuclear weapons, based on a signed agreement between the United States and Russia, is today a smaller nation as a result, and durably under assault by Russian backed separatists. You've got two examples in recent history of a country that literally gave up nuclear weapons programs and the outcomes are tragic for both. I'm sorry, there's a third, South Africa where the outcome I think is generally positive. But--so I worry about the lack of current examples, and I worry that this is a critical challenge or irritant in the U.S. China relationship, and in the regional relationship. I will remain hopeful--I will remain prayerfully hopeful that our president is successful in these negotiations. But so far I think they have been fundamentally flawed in the way in which he's approached them. </p><p>HEWITT: Please join me in thanking Senator Coons for joining us. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>LITWAK: The next panel on human rights and religious freedom will convene back in the auditorium shortly. Thank you. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: Okay, we'll get started. So, welcome everybody and welcome back. If you are here this morning, thank you for joining us for our session on human rights and religious freedom in the U.S.-China relations. My name is Katie Stallard-Blanchette. I am a fellow here at the Wilson Center before which I was based at first in Russia, then in China as a foreign correspondent for the British broadcasters Sky News.  </p><p>So, I really kind of did a lot of the--some of the issues that we're going to talk about here today up close and in person. I think the headlines that we tend to see here in the United States, understandably focus on Xinjiang and the more than one million people we believe are currently being held in internment camps. We're hearing reports of forced abortion, of rape, of sexual abuse in these camps. We're seeing these terrible pictures continually coming out of Hong Kong where mass protests are continuing and it's understandable that these issues are driving the conversation.  </p><p>But I want to be clear right from the start of our conversation that these issues go much further. We're talking about really widespread abuses right across the country. The persecution of Christians, of other minority groups like the Uighur Muslims. We're talking about the gutting of civil society with human rights lawyers being detained, workers rights activists being targeted. So, this is really widespread. There's so much to talk about. Our question to focus on here today is going to be where this fits in to the U.S.-China relationship. I want to dive right in because we have a fairly short amount of time here and a great panel to get to.  </p><p>You have their biographies in front of you, so I won't rehearse them. But just to very briefly introduce our panel here. I have Christopher Walker, Vice President for Studies and Analysis at the National Endowment for Democracy. And Nina Shea, who is director of the center for Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute. Dave Rank, Senior Advisor at the Cohen Group, retired from the U.S. Foreign Service in 2017 as a Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. embassy in Beijing. And Robert Daly, Director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States here at the Wilson Center. So, I want to turn right to Nina to start off--us off here if I can. China has been designated as a country of particular concern over religious freedom every year since 1999. Just give us a sense of where we are here in 2019. How serious, how urgent do you think the situation now is? </p><p>SHEA: Well, first of all, thank you and thanks to the Nixon forum. Hugh Hewitt was an a neighbor of mine over 30 years ago and he was only a lawyer then, but I knew he was destined at that time, even back then to be a radio host. So, I want to thank him and you. CPC, country of particular concern, is the government's shortlist for the world's worst persecutors of religious freedoms and of religious believers. And China has been on it since it was created, since the list was created under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. And there is a reason for that.  </p><p>China has always had an uneasy relationship with religion for many centuries. They--it has--freedoms have waxed and wanes since the cultural revolution. And it was more relaxed starting I guess in the 90s for Christians and Muslims. Still, there was a lot of pressure then and persecution on the Tibetan Buddhists and the Falun Gong. But now it's a scale and intensity that we really haven't seen. And the world hasn't seen because they're introducing these high-tech measures to do it. And so religion, it seems across the board is being used as an instrument of the state and it is going to be allowed so far as it can be used in that purpose, for that purpose and its religious leaders essentially party--come to this party Apparatchiks whose main purpose is to communicate and propagandize on the party's values with president Xi's twist on that. And to continue the surveillance of their followers.  </p><p>The--so to the extent that they don't go along with that, that they resist that these religions will be eradicated and are being eradicated. So, let's, you know, take the main groups. The--you mentioned the Uighur Muslims. Yes, out of 11 population, out of 11 million, 1 million, maybe up to 3 million according to the Pentagon are in some kind of concentration camps, have gone through this re-education, indoctrination, brainwashing. And then onto something called--first the Chinese Beijing denied that they existed. Then they said, \"Well, they're--now, there are vocational education and training.\" So now they're saying now they've left these camps and they've now gone on for jobs.  </p><p>But now we're finding out that these are actually slave labor camps that they're involved in. In fact, there was a customs a decision to block the importation of some of these products coming from these detention camps. And by the way, the great dissident who now to see is Terry Wu was talking about this relationship between Chinese political prisons and prisons with forced labor years ago, 20 years ago. So, this is not new, but it's now done on the scale focus targeted at a religious community. And it's beyond--I think we have to realize, yes, it is wiping out and suppressing this campaign against the Uighur Muslims. Against their customs, against their dress, their architecture, their food, what they eat, what they drink. Forcing them to drink alcohol, eat pork against their religion, forcing them to drop their languages; Turkic and Arabic and so forth.  </p><p>But even beyond that, what they're doing is forcing them to adopt another ideology other than their faith. And there are--as you mentioned, there are sexual abuse. There are anecdotal reports of sterilization. And if that's true and if we can document that, then that is genocide. That is one of the markers of genocide under international law. So, I have recently spoken to the state department about that and they said that they don't have a pattern yet and we should be looking for that. So, the Falun Gong went through something similar. They claim to be about 60 million by the 90s and strong in China and there are maybe several thousand today. Their spiritual practices, it's more of a spiritual exercises rather than a religion as we conceive of religion cause there's no organization or real leaders, are--or doctrine, are not practiced in public at all anymore in China. If they are, they are punished.  </p><p>There has been constant reports, well-documented reports of organ harvesting from Falun Gong from the 90s on. And even today this continues. In fact, there was some kind of exhibit over in Switzerland recently that was just canceled because the authorities came forward and said that they had received human rights documentation that these vivisected human forms were actually Uighur Muslims who had been prisoners. And this was some kind of exhibit, I don't know if it was scientific or art exhibit, but it was one of these bodies exhibits. And so, it was canceled.  </p><p>The Christians, they--well, let me just say quickly about the Tibetan Buddhists. Again, in the 90s, the Chinese appointed--designated a fake Panchen Lama which is the heir of the Dalai Lama. And as a young boy and the one that was designated as the authentic Panchen Lama has disappeared. And there is a great deal of fear that as the Dalai Lama is approaching--I guess he's in his 80s now, that he may be replaced by an impostor appointed by the communist party as well. So, there is a lot of anxiety about that. And he, of course, can't even live in China. He lives in India and travels a lot to bring attention to his people's plight who are totally repressed inside China.  </p><p>The Christians are--both evangelical and Catholic, are going through intense repression right now. They had been, even their underground churches, particularly in the big cities, had been tolerated for some time for a decade and more. And now there is zero tolerance of these unregistered churches. The government is taking down pictures of--Christian pictures, pictures of Jesus Christ, putting up pictures of Shay or Mao instead. Taking down staples and bell towers and crosses and any outward signs of Christianity and is appointing the leadership.  </p><p>There is a new Vatican agreement where the government has a right now to have greater control over who is appointed as bishops. The Bibles. The Bibles have been taken off the internet. You cannot buy them over the internet now and the government is going through a re-translation process. So, you have again, the content of religion. Religious ideology being replaced with communist party values and practices. Church services are being--in mass--Catholic mass is being required to sing hymns of praise to the communist party as part of their services. There--some schools, some towns, some businesses are requiring no faith pledges by their students and workers. </p><p>So, there is even in literature classes when the Chinese now students are studying foreign cultures, they scrub references in books like Robinson Crusoe's of Bibles. So, the story of Robinson Crusoe is that he finds some Bibles in the shipwreck and finds his moral compass from this. Well, that's all changed to mean to just say he found some books. So, they're really trying to eradicate the Christian symbols and leaders and deity really, and make it more atheistic, more secular, more party focused. And the religious leaders are being--who do not cooperate in this or who are too energetic in evangelizing are imprisoned.  </p><p>Some, many, many for short prison terms of a couple of months, but a number for seven-11 years, including an American permanent resident, Pastor John Kao. He is serving a seven-year term. And then I just want to, you know, mention that the --So it's the content of the religion that is changing. In the last two years really for the Christians, the perpetuation and propagation of faith is becoming impossible. Youth are not allowed to have exposure really to religion, to Christianity. They're not allowed in the churches. They're not allowed, and Bible schools have ended, Bible camps have ended. They are not allowed to participate even in Christmas celebrations or other celebrations of faith.  </p><p>And then the big tech is another new threat that is affecting all the religions. And that is this massive collection of--well, massive surveillance with facial recognition, gait recognition. There's some estimates that there a half a billion facial recognition cameras in China. Some estimates give far greater than that. And I've seen photos with just straight posts--street signs and lampposts in streets just bristling with cameras. And they--this has been foisted on the churches as well.  </p><p>The largest underground Protestant church in Beijing was just closed because--that Zion church closed over the past year because the pastor was asked to put 28 surveillance cameras inside the church, including on his pulpit, trained at the congregation. He refused to do so. So, it was shut down. And that was a church that has been around and tolerated, grew to be the biggest one in the country for 10 years--for 10 or 11 years.  </p><p>So, there's this, you know, for example, the big tech, the data analytics with all this collection of surveillance data and personal data, priests have been asked to provide some of it. Muslims when they go on the Hajj to Saudi Arabia are asked to wear custom made identity cards with GPS tracking on them while they're gone. And, of course, that's going on inside of China as well in Xinjiang.  </p><p>So, you know, I could go on and on, but let me stop there. It's a truly disturbing picture that you're painting there. Let me bring in Dave Rank who's sitting next here. I mean, you've served as U.S. diplomat in your last position as Deputy Chief of Mission rights in your position in Beijing. Give us a sense of--to the extent that you can, what options are open to U.S. officials here? How does this work? So, when you these kind of--you hear these complaints and you go in to have meetings with Chinese officials. I remember, I was always told in Beijing by British diplomats, \"We don't engage in megaphone diplomacy. It is kind of productive. It's best brought up candidly, privately.\" I mean, is that how best to go about this? What have you found actually works? </p><p>RANK: Sure, thank you Katie. So, you know, I have to preface it. I served four times in the mainland, starting in 1990 through 2017 and it was different every time. So, the--and one of the vows I made when I joined the state department was I would never work on China issues in Washington. Because as bad as it can be in Beijing or in Shanghai where I worked, it's just much tougher to deal with those issues here in Washington. So, I don't have a sort of firsthand experience on the policy formulation side, but there's a lot of the things you talked about. The ebb and flow over the last 30 years, I mean, that--Some variation of what you talked about has been part of the sort of, what's the word? The weave of Chinese life.  </p><p>And not just religion, sort of across human rights as we see them more broadly. You know, China has either become relatively a tougher place to live or the rules have relaxed a little bit, but it's always been an issue. And, you know, the role of the embassy has been--or the role of posts overseas is to some extent try to give the objective assessment of what's happening on the ground. Like I say, I never had the good fortune to sort of be on the Washington side of, \"Okay, what do we do about it?\"  </p><p>But I will say, you know, there are a couple of options. And, you know, early in the relationship, and you talked about it, you know, sort of the choice was how do we use the leverage we have? Do we use megaphone diplomacy? Do we, you know, make a big issue of problems? You know, lists of detainees and use them as--use either the prospect of megaphone diplomacy or use it itself to highlight the cases and then try to resolve those issues. I will say that the trend I noticed over the 30 years is just the waning leverage we had on those issues.  </p><p>By 2017, you know, I was--as I was thinking about what I was going to say here, the era of leverage on human rights issues is over. But I don't actually think it is, it's just kind of shifting the other direction. The NBA case highlights that the leverage is now shifting the other way, right? That the Chinese now in issues the way they define human rights, they are turning it sort of on us. That the leverage they have through our--you know, we are thinking it is a lesson to the United States and capitalism, what's going on. You know, that the Chinese realize that capitalism, their system, their embrace of at least aspects of capitalism give them leverage on how we deal with human rights issues, not necessarily through the government, but certainly through corporations. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: Is it also the case that leverage is shifting away from the kind of officials that you would have dealt with? So, the foreign ministry officials in the Chinese government may well understand how bad this looks, but that their voices are not being heard in the system. </p><p>RANK: Yeah. I mean, the foreign ministry never had a very--I think they needed the leverage of, \"Oh--.\" You know, I recall Bill Clinton when he went out in 1998. There was an effort to--ahead of that visit, to sort of put some good news on the board ahead of that. So, you know, Clinton who had run on sort of the butchers of Beijing would be able to visit and say it was a good visit. And I think that gave the foreign ministry the leverage then to go to the system with those lists of people who they--that we had asked to be released, to get some action. I think, you know, that leverage now is within the system, is greatly, greatly diminished. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: So, Chris, let me turn to you. We're looking broadly today at the U.S.-China relationship. Examining and re-evaluating aspects like trade security. And I wonder what you think about doing the same in terms of human rights and religious freedom. That the argument that we heard in other aspects of the relationship, like engagement leading to some sort of liberalization, inviting China into these international institutions would lead to results. Are we at a point now in 2019 of re-evaluating that and examining actually is this the way to go about engaging with China? </p><p>WALKER: So, first of all, thanks for the invitation to be here with you. I think we are probably at the point to reevaluate that assumption some years ago. And we're doing it later than we should have and hence it's much more difficult to identify how these new alignments of power should relate to each other. I think Nina did an excellent job in discussing just how repressive it is now within the PRC on the religious front. But this is replaying itself across civil society and the media sector, as I'm sure you experienced as a journalist there for activists and anyone else who has an alternative point of view. It's much more repressive today than it was even a few years ago. If I were to widen the lens and think about what that means for the Chinese party State's engagement overseas and the way it's manifested in recent years, I'd identify three areas that are really worth reflecting on.  </p><p>Three levels that I think are important for all of us to take into account. The first, as you alluded to is regional and international bodies, that at least coming out of the 1990s, we all thought would be the standard centers for democratic governance and human rights and free expression. And either as a result of the complacency of the democracies, perhaps coupled with the more emboldened autocracies, they are nowhere near the level of performance one would imagine. This is true in the United nations where China now has a much more forward-leaning role. And that's to be expected. It's a much more powerful country.  </p><p>But I think what we're seeing is a reforging of some of the basic assumptions we would have had in a body of that kind and the key units that deal with human rights and democracy and free expression. At the same time, China has started its own initiatives. For example, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which at the outset was really looked at with dismissiveness. That it wouldn't have much traction. And now, that body which is predominated by authoritarian States is resetting the rules in that region certainly. And I can explain how that's happening in some detail later on.  </p><p>But I think it's important to note that there is now much more active effort to reset and re-calibrate norms of human rights. The second area I'd touch on is economic and commercial engagement and how that relates to democratic governance. The vaccine situation in which the NBA finds itself today is not really new, but it's incredibly useful for elevating something that is already a global pattern. And that is when you have a meaningful economic relationship with the PRC, there are certain subjects and topics that become off limits, that are sidelined or suppressed. And so, what we're seeing with some of the most powerful people within the NBA context, whether it's in management ownership or the players, some of whom are arguably as powerful a global name or brand, there's several of them that could be alluded to in this discussion.  </p><p>Trimming their sails on basic issues of freedom of expression, it really is a cause for reflection because we're already seeing this in the university sector in North America and Europe, Australia. We're seeing it in the media sector in a whole host of ways that I can go into. The tech sector where China's engagement, both with our powerful companies that are operating from the U.S. and elsewhere, but with the companies that they themselves are creating, which now operate beyond their borders like WeChat and Tiktok. This is really a dramatic change in the landscape and how the standards and expectations are set. So, I won't go into more detail on those two areas right now, but I think it's just a scene setter.  </p><p>The third area I would emphasize now more broadly, and they're related to the first two, is the realm of ideas. Because I think coming out of the 1990s for reasons that had been stated at this conference today, but in others, there really wasn't expectation that democracy and human rights would not be challenged in any meaningful way. Certainly coming out of 1989-1991, I just returned from central Europe yesterday and during the discussions there, there was a reminder that June 4th 1989 was both the onset of the round table discussions in Poland, which led to some quite good outcomes in that part of the world coming into the 1990s and the tenement square massacre.  </p><p>And so, in a sense, looking back 30 years, we see the two courses that were taken out of that era. And I don't think we reflected hard enough about what a reinvigorated China would mean for the globe as it became more powerful and did not liberalize confounding our expectations. And so today we see, for example, in the realm of media, multi-billion dollar investments in the media space by the Chinese authorities globally, both at home and beyond their borders, which push certain ideas that rights are divisible and they should be circumscribed and that they should be limited to certain areas, usually areas of physical needs and not freedom of expression, association and so forth.  </p><p>And those are starting to get traction in some places. I would note just in conclusion that part of this, I think is a reflection of the United States and its democratic allies not making the investments that are necessary in this space where Russia, China and others are making the investments in this space. And I can recall conversations as recently as seven or eight or nine years ago where people were incredibly dismissive of what the investments by what at the time seemed quite gray authoritarian systems, even though they really weren't already at that point on what they could do in this kind of space.  </p><p>And they've actually proven they can do quite a lot. And I think unless we come to terms with that and really start to compete more meaningfully in the idea space, we're going to find ourselves on our heels for quite some time to come. And if we're having this conversation say five years from now and it's pretty much status quo, we will invariably be in a much less friendly situation. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: So, let me bring in Robert on the--had a couple of mentions there of the situation that the NBA has been grappling very publicly with. We had a sort of satirical apology from the makers of South Park on this who actually I thought captured this pretty well-- </p><p>DALY: --Hysterical meaning funny? </p><p>BLANCHETTE: Satirical. </p><p>DALY: Oh, satirical? Great apology. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: Satirical. But I think the line was we too love money more than freedom and democracy. Is that essentially the proposition that is being put to United States companies, institutions, sports teams who want to do business in China, that these are the terms of that relationship? </p><p>DALY: Certainly. And that's again, not new. It's somewhat more assertive. Now, it's more out in the open. And we've spoken earlier in the day about the airlines and about Marriott. And, of course, you know, companies like Walmart, almost anybody who goes into China functions under Chinese law which is highly repressive in all of these ways. And I think the--domestically, I'll just make a quick remark about what's going on domestically here. And then I want to get back to China. The difficulty now with a risen China, not a rising China as Senator Coons said, but with a pure competitor that is wealthy and ambitious, is that it's putting a spotlight on and pressure on inherent vulnerabilities and contradictions between core American values that have always been there and that haven't been challenged. So, you've got the security imperative value.  </p><p>You've got the commercial imperative and you have the imperative of openness, all of which are now because of China's ability to leverage its wealth to get deference or silence. They're in conflict with each other. So, companies that cooperate with China are accused of selling out the American interest in being un-American. Universities, their openness is now under pressure both because of Chinese attempts to get strategically vital information out of universities and because of Washington concerns and some policies that may close down openness. And as we've spoken about it on this stage, many, many times, industries like Hollywood but also gaming who we've tended to think of as architects of American soft power are proving to be fairly easily bought in pursuit of the Chinese market. And the security openness, the commercial interests haven't dealt with this before and they don't have a common vocabulary to speak about it.  </p><p>So, this problem is going to be exacerbated, the NBA sort of question. South Park handled it very well. It wasn't one of their funniest episodes, but I was glad they did it and it was a fine apology. On the China side, I think that, you know, if we are concerned about the welfare of the Chinese people of which human rights is a very important part, we have to look back at the past now 45 years and say, \"Well, what works? What affects change in China?\" And what I see there is that change is mostly brought about by the Chinese themselves catalyzed by concern and examples and representations from the outside to be sure those are important.  </p><p>But it's the change mostly that comes from within China. In the explosion of Christianity, for example, that Ian Johnson writes about, this is mostly being affected by Chinese ministers, not foreign missionaries. Chinese ministers, some of whom may have spent time overseas, but some of whom didn't. They're affecting the change. The very large growth in philanthropic activities in China, that's coming out--that's coming from the Chinese communities themselves. And they speak with the Gates foundation. Again, they're catalyzed, their Western examples. They're sometimes chastised from outside of China with various, you know, kinds of outcomes.  </p><p>But it tends to be the Chinese themselves who effect change. So, when I think about human rights, I tend to think of it as a conversation with the Chinese people. There's the government to government issue that we've spoken about, but we're also involved in an argument. Christopher talked about ideas. How do we talk about human rights with the Chinese people? There's three quick ideas about what I've found to be more effective. This is gradual and satisfactory, but we've--this is not just about telling the trainees that they do wrong. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: Let me just ask Dave if you agree with it. I mean, one thing that occurs to me is that the Chinese communist party has really inserted themselves as the interlocutor on behalf of the Chinese people. So, I mean, in what is effective in terms of communicating with Chinese people inside of China and in terms of areas that the United States can leverage for influence? </p><p>RANK: Yeah, I think I agree with Robert. You know, look, the country over which we have influence is our own, right? And we have tried a ton of different approaches with China. And like I say, as our leverage has decreased, all of those have become less effective. I think the best--the way we influence the conversation in China is by living our values here. And we do that to mixed degrees of success. I think we don't--we haven't shown very well recently though and that hurts. And that's probably the--that makes our job harder than almost anything else out there. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: Did those values include then still speaking? I remember Barack Obama used to say, 'When we go abroad, we don't live our values at home.\" Does that apply to American officials, American companies? </p><p>RANK: Well, I mean, I--America--Yes, American officials certainly. American companies, and I think Senator Coons talked about it very well. I mean, we--this is sort of the reckoning we have. And I agree with his take on the cold war. But if you look at the U.S.-Soviet confrontation, it strikes me that we didn't have the--we didn't have to ask, you know, where the--we developed the concept of liberal democracy and capitalism as essentially one and the same thing.  </p><p>And I think now that we look at the challenge of China, we realize you can be--and the capitalism is sort of, there's a tip ball there and you know, that the Chinese have--have figured out it's a different style of capitalism. But they are using that to push for their interpretation of what human rights or sort of what the basic social contract is. And so I think we're going to have to figure out, I don't know what the answer to that is other than if our expectation is today that American companies or companies that, as he described, you know, have their headquarters in the United States are going to defect all the bears of American values when their charters and their sort of fiduciary responsibility is to deliver shareholder value, I think our hopes are misplaced at this point. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: Yeah. Christopher, you wanted to comment on that. </p><p>WALKER: So, just to return to the question of media and communications, I think the--it's really important to stress that the Chinese authorities devote enormous resources to ensuring that their own people do not have a pluralistic media content reaching them. It may be diverse today. And this is one of the challenges we face. The media space in China today is not the media space of 1980. It's a much more diverse, vibrant space, but it's not politically plural. That's what the authorities seek to suppress.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's massive investment beyond China's borders, including to consumers of Chinese language content beyond the PRC's borders for the diaspora, which really have few choices today. And there's enormous effort made by the authorities to ensure that the state's voice is the principal voice. And I think what it tells us is that the authorities and these authoritarian States, and it's true in Russia as well, they know this is important. And hence they invent in it. We've forgotten in the democracies that it is important and therefore we haven't invested in the same way.  </p><p>So, if you were to compare just, for example, radio Free Asia which does important work, they have a preposterously small budget when it comes to their work relating to China. It's minuscule compared to what they face from the authorities in Beijing. So, I think any discussion of this kind of issue has to reckon with this incredible asymmetry and investment that has taken shape over the last several decades. I think until we do that, we're not having a serious reckoning with what we face. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: And you know, I wanted to also bring you in to--bring this onto the discussion around. We've seen the Chinese communist party enter into a provisional agreement now with the Vatican, I think a year ago. It seems that that is benefiting the communist party very much. It's not clear whether--how well that is working in the other direction. What's your view on where we are and whether, I think there is a year left now to make the decision on whether-- </p><p>SHEA: --that's right. Yeah, it is a provisional. We know two things about this agreement. One is that it's provisional and it expires in a year from last month. And we don't know which way it's going to go. And the other thing we know about is that it's secret. So, the contents we're not sure of, but we think it's about the mechanics of appointing the churches' leaders inside China and giving the Chinese communist party really the control over who gets appointed.  </p><p>Maybe the Pope has a veto power. Maybe he has the right to rubber stamp it. We don't quite know; it hasn't been tested. The one example we have is there are two bishops who have been appointed recently by the government and they had been secretly approved of by the prior Popes years ago. So, this is really not something, that part of the new process. In fact, it was so secretive that the Vatican was compelled in June to make re-make a statement about it saying that--in a very weak way, it said that bishops and priests of the Catholic church did not have to join--by Vatican standards, would not be required to join the patriotic government association.  </p><p>So, and they felt compelled to issue that statement because the government was saying that's what the Vatican had agreed to and they all had to join the government controlled Catholic association. So, the Cardinal Zen of Hong Kong Ameritas, made a very--I think as to point about this agreement saying that it was a catastrophe. And the reason why was because the party--because it's secret, we don't know the contents. Even after a year, which is extraordinary. There have been no leaks. That the government and party can go to the Catholic faithful and say this is what the Vatican wants you to do.  </p><p>The Vatican is basically saying by this agreement, \"Trust us, we're going to keep it all secret. You're not going to know, but trust us, we know what we're doing.\" And the party and government goes out and says, \"This is what the Vatican wants you to do.\" And that is to take up sinicization as communist values and ideology with a twist of president Xi. I just want to make another point. Going back to the prior discussion, Katie, if I can. And that is, you know, it was no accident that there were two divergent paths in 1989 in Europe and in Eastern Europe and then in China. The Chinese were very closely watching what was happening in Poland and they blamed the fall of communism on the Pope and the Catholic church. And the influence of churches and religion and Christian religions. And it was at that point that they made churches register, they required them to register and particularly those in the countryside. And called those who did not register on the underground as banned or evil cults. And tried to shut them down, at least in the countryside.  </p><p>So, the churches in particular have had this exponential growth to about 100 million estimated by sociologists at Purdue University. That is more or was more than the communist party, which was estimated to be about 90 million. And it's projected to be in 10 years to be the largest Christian Church in the world with 250 million. This is both underground and patriotic churches together. But the vast majority of this growth is in the Protestant underground. And that trajectory has given a lot of confidence to these Christians and the world's perception of China's being--having a large Christian presence.  </p><p>And, in fact, indeed, it is the--really the only civic society that is nationwide or the Christian churches that are independent of the government and are Chinese, not foreign media. So, this is a very important test case for not just Christianity or religion, but for sort of the political structure and civil society and freedom for China. And they are being the-- the U.S. companies are complicit in some cases with this surveillance providing parts for these cameras, for the computers, that is going into the social credit system where everybody gets a personal score and you get excluded from all the necessities of life and luxuries and benefits of life if you get a low social credit score. If you meet with foreigners who have low credit--credit scores, you will get a low credit score. So that's the theory. That's how it's supposed to be working according to the Chinese.  </p><p>And the last month, in this month, the U.S. Department of Commerce added 28 Chinese organizations to our entities list. So, U.S. companies will no longer be able to export to these companies and that are in Xinjiang or directed at Xinjiang with the--the cameras and the surveillance equipment. Likewise, the state department has put individual officials who are responsible for the torment of the Uighur Muslims on a visa restriction list.  </p><p>And there's legislation and movement to-- in the private sector, to divest pension funds from these entities that--these companies that could end up on the entities list because they're somehow involved in their surveillance system. And really, it is a national security. Their approach to surveillance, to 5G, to quantum computing is a threat to our own national security at this point. They have, you know, on the verge or do have the ability to penetrate data clouds. And that's for U.S. military. They were on the verge of this breakthrough for U.S. military, military companies and everybody else; governments, everybody else. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: Okay. So, let me ask Dave. I mean, this is a very unfair question for which I apologize, but I wonder if you can try to help us to understand the calculation from the Chinese side. In terms of--so when we're hearing Nina talk about the number of people who are converting to Christianity, for instance. Do you think the communist party looks at this and perceives it as just number one, a threat to their security before any consideration of religious freedom, human rights, reputational damage? </p><p>RANK: You're right, it is very awkward. I will pretend I can speak for the Chinese. I mean, look, I think the conclusion from 1989 and the conclusion from Falun Gong with--what was that, 2001? And the sort of fundamental rule of governing in China is survival. So, you know, something that poses a threat, the conclusion they took from, from 1989 was, you know, you can, you can reform economically, but you can't relax politically.  </p><p>The wake-up call in April--I think it was April of 2001 when 10,000 or so Falun Gong practitioners sat around, I guess, what's the moral equivalent of the White House fence or something around the Zhongnanhai, the central government--the central leadership compound, was the shock that, \"Hey, wait a second. We don't have a handle on what's going on in our country.\" And on that particular case, you know, they were able to bring--to bear the powers of a security state to a fairly obvious group or a group that was fairly because one of their precepts was to be truthful. And so, if you ask someone, \"Are you a practitioner of Falun Gong?\" They were obligated under their beliefs to say, \"Yes, I am,\" which made rest of the operation easier.  </p><p>And so, I think, you know, sort of it--it all gets to--you know, and I think a genuine belief in leadership circles in China that survival of the communist party is a good thing. Look what we've done since 1978. That we have brought development and you know, 99.99% of the people want to just look at TikTok videos and they are living a much better life than they lived in 1978. And that is the fundamental requirement. That's the fundamental obligation of government, is to deliver those things. And if the if--the consequence of that is that, you know, that small fraction of the population who is unhappy with that arrangement, you know, if that's the cost, that--that--that is acceptable. And look, the Chinese people voted in 1949 for the system. So, there we are. The views of this, you know, do not reflect the-- </p><p>BLANCHETTE: Those of Xi Jinping. Robert, I mean, even an unfair question perhaps, but I mean it strikes me that I'm not hearing any sense that there's any--there are meaningful ways to push back at this stage. I feel like I'm hearing a variety of, \"We should engage.\" I'm not clear what the options other than what we're doing at the moment which have gotten us to where we are-- </p><p>DALY: For the United States? </p><p>BLANCHETTE: Yes. </p><p>DALY: Well, I think that Nina already--in a way, she's pointed to a classic Chinese contradiction, which indicates that there are options. She started with all this list of sort of these horrible things have gone on to suppress religion in China and an anticipated 150% growth in the number of believing Christians. Well, excuse me, teacher, I have a question, right? I mean, clearly it's not the case that everybody is marching in lock step with the communist party. They're not all powerful. It's clear that they are listening to other voices. It is clear above all that China continues to change very rapidly. And that means that there are always going to be channels to have a gradual impact again, but I use the word 'catalyze' earlier. I think that is what it has always been.  </p><p>We need to stay engaged with China and so far as we can. I think that Senator Coons earlier and also in Denmark made a good case for this in large part because you need to keep other alternatives, other examples available to Chinese that they can then pick from. And it also enables the Chinese pastors or other religious leaders or philanthropists who are able to effect change. Now, engagement was never a lever that we could pull at a certain time with a certain amount of force to affect a certain outcome. Whenever we've tried to do that, we generally get egg on our faces. But best practices, global practices make a profound difference over time. And again, it's China's book isn't written. It is still changing.  </p><p>And so, we can't simply tell China and the Chinese people that China is bad because as far as we can tell in a country that doesn't vote and doesn't have polling, probably a majority of Chinese see China as increasingly good. What Dave just mentioned, they've had tremendous improvements, not only in their material well-being, but even in their individual freedom, since 1979. Before Xi Jinping came into power, I would've said, I did say, that despite all of the remaining egregious human rights violations, that should be a part of our policy. It was probably the best time in Chinese history to be Chinese, even from the point of view of individual choice.  </p><p>And so, now, we're in a much darker period. But China is still changing. And so, I think that the answer is engagement, cooperation, making an argument and making examples present to the Chinese people and so far as we can. And recognizing that just as we continue to struggle here in the States with what are rights, most of our domestic political debates are highly moralized. You know, do young children have the human right to not be facing climate change? That's one form the argument takes. Do unborn children have rights? We have--we disagree even in this country, sometimes violently about what constitutes rights. It's an evolution. We can still help to catalyze the evolution of Chinese conceptions of rights if we stay engaged. </p><p>RANK: And the other thing--I'm sorry I'm going to jump in, is we have to have some confidence in our own system, right? </p><p>DALY: Yeah. </p><p>RANK: We have to be reflective and say, \"Yes, we have challenges we need to address in the system.\" But there are reasons that the United States has been so successful. You know, we have championed individual liberty, we have formed alliances and partnerships and global institutions and led them. I mean, there are reasons that we got to where we are. And you know, as we look at the success China has had and we say, \"Oh, maybe we should try to be a little Chinese,\" we're not going to be as good as the Chinese are at it. And, and we are going to damage our own--both our systems and our appeal to other people in the world in the process. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: But is there a digit as -- So, recently, we heard the George Kennan long telegram. One of the final conclusions is about committing to the health and vigor of our own society. Is there a danger that that's not happening currently as like the media's undermined? I mean, are we taking for granted that that system is going to renew and be robust and be an example? </p><p>DALY: Yes. </p><p>SHEA: Well, you know, we don't have to guess what the Chinese are thinking on the religious growth and the Christianity growth. We have a screenshot that China A (SP) which is a remarkable human rights organization based in Texas, of Chinese dissidents, of a government website that said that we have to implement these regulations to stop the young people from going to the churches, et cetera, et cetera.  </p><p>In order to contain the overheated growth of Christianity. They're very much afraid of it. And I think that we can't say this is, you know, only a small fraction of the people are, you know, displeased by China's path. There was--the one child policy affected every single family in China. And we know that they must have chafed it, that they must have been very upset that they could not determine how many children they would have. </p><p>RANK: I see you getting me in trouble here. </p><p>SHEA: And I think that the religious believers of all stripes are very concerned by--and it has shown to be more popular, whether it's membership and growth, than the communist party itself. And we have a little glimpse of what they're thinking from Hong Kong where people are terrified, especially the young people about what is may be coming to their neighborhood real soon. So, I think that we can't conclude that only a small fraction are displeased with it because they are-- </p><p>DALY: -- I don't I think I said that. I think I said that Indications seemed to be that most Chinese see China getting better and improving-- </p><p>WALKER: -- So maybe, I think we have to be very cautious with those sorts of assumptions because we just don't know. </p><p>DALY: Right. </p><p>WALKER: We don't have elections that would express the preferences of the people and even online where there was a better chance in the recent past to get a sense of this, the authorities are getting much better in part using artificial intelligence to sensor and in some cases even preemptively sensor, which is already happening in Xinjiang. So, I think it's entirely possible that there's far more displeasure than we imagine.  </p><p>But I think because we don't know, we shouldn't imagine what we think it might be. And let me just say a word about engagement. I think the false choice in the discussion over the last several decades has been this either-or thing. Of we either engage or we isolate. I think what we could have done and what we need to do now is to engage, but with a clear understanding of what our principles are. We essentially had unconditional engagement that was driven through an economic centric lens, essentially through our lens. I mean, I say the democracy's lens, it's not just the United States, essentially every open society that was looking to engage in some form, setting aside some of these essential issues that we've been discussing here, and now we're paying a price.  </p><p>And now we're playing catch up because it's not just about the evident and systematic and clear abuses within China, but now we're contending with China's engagement beyond its borders in ways that are in so many ways, unfriendly to democratic and human rights standards. And I would say that, you know, the challenge that the NBA has brought before our eyes tells us a few things. And I'll just give a couple of examples in other parts of the world. Our most powerful figures and institutions are willing to curb their expression. If you look at the way China engages in Latin America or Sub-Saharan Africa and the way they're doing business there, we also see that when say the, and I'll use a very specific example, which is one of many.  </p><p>In Ecuador, the ECU 911 technology package that was taken in by the Ecuadorian authorities, was not discussed at all in a meaningful way in the public. And when you look at the way a satellite facility was established in Southern Argentina, in the way in which the rail-road deals in Kenya were established, a raft of deals and Serbia, purposefully picking a very diverse geographic set of countries, in every one of these cases, there's virtually no public discussion of the deals because they're cut with policy elites, political elites, typically in the executive branch in these settings.  </p><p>So, civil society, independent media, which you'll find in the countries I alluded to are cutout of the discussion. And I think when you peel the layers down a little bit, you see opacity and secrecy kind of as the pattern across all of these areas. And for our partners, for vulnerable democracies that are looking and aspiring to something better, for established democracies like Canada, Australia, the UK, and others that are contending with their engagement with China, we're all in this boat together. So, part of the solution is reforging democratic unity, democratic solidarity, not succumbing to divide and conquer tactics which are visible both at the state level and the institutional level.  </p><p>The NBA is a great example of this. If NBA's management and ownership before this ever happened, had said, \"If we are hit with something like this, we will respond in a unified way. Every team together with management that we do not compromise on free speech,\" it would have been a different dynamic. Now. Everybody's scrambling and it's the same thing that happens to universities, same things that happens to media companies, technology companies. And so, this principle of solidarity and unity is crucial. It's not easy. I don't suggest it as collective action is never easy. But until we at least start a process of thinking these things through and have some preparation and purposefulness, we'll be at a loss for quite some time. </p><p>RANK: But are you optimistic that the NBA would have said, \"We will forgo--\" I don't know what the percentage of their revenue is for the principle of free speech? </p><p>WALKER: So, I think this is the question and you've hinted at this. I think all of our institutions have to grapple with this now, whether it's publishing companies which prune their content in order to reach the Chinese market, whether it's our entertainment companies which will modify their screenplays in order to do that. At some point we have to say, \"Where do we draw the line?\" There was a line, not all that long ago that was a little bit smaller. The circle is a little bit smaller. It used to just be the T's, Tiananmen, Tibet, Taiwan. And now that circle has grown as I understand it, where people are willing to forego their speech on a host of other issues, whether it's elite corruption, politics in China, business in their own countries-- </p><p>DALY: -- BRI  </p><p>WALKER: --the BRI related things. And so, the logical extension of this, if we don't have some principles behind them, is that the circle grows. And in coming years, there's even less we'll be talking about. \"Well, we should have that discussion. I think we should have the principles and not sell them away. But that's a discussion that I think all the democracies have to have now. </p><p>BLANCHETTE: So, let me throw something leading on from that and see who wants to grab it. Like a not unforeseeable situation is that there is a violent crackdown in Hong Kong. What are the options open to the Trump administration then? What should the United States do in that situation? </p><p>SHEA: Sanctions. And there is--you know, Magnitsky sanctions can target individuals who are responsible for this crack down. They could communist party officials, for example, or the governor or whomever. And there's also legislation pending which China is very angry about. Tying special trade status with Hong Kong, tying it to how this all unfolds. So, you know, I think that we do have some tools in our arsenal to put some pressure on them. They may just well kill the goose that laid the golden egg if they go down this route with Hong Kong and they have to understand that as a deterrent. And I just wanted to take issue with one thing that I think Robert, maybe you said, that China is not all powerful. </p><p>DALY: The Chinese Communist party is not all powerful. </p><p>SHEA: Yeah, well, in fact, it's becoming at least omniscient, if not all powerful. There is a--a new app called Study the Nation, which is a propaganda app developed by the Communist Party and Alibaba. And it has a backdoor entry into your--all your social media, your internet history, your photographs, your contact list. And it's required by certain--that they require just-- </p><p>RANK: --Chinese Communist Party members are required to have them.  </p><p>SHEA: And lawyers. And I can see in not too distant future, where religious leaders would have to be--have this app. And it really does a very all-encompassing job, of monitoring what you're thinking, reading, contacting, who you're-- </p><p>DALY: --It aspires to that. We don't really quite know what the social credit system is going to be in practice, yet. And we've heard some voices that object to this from within China. There are a couple of pilot projects. It's extremely worrisome. And at its worst, it is, as Nina has described it, but we don't quite yet know what this is going to become.  </p><p>SHEA: Well, the point is they-- </p><p>DALY: --In fact-- </p><p>SHEA: --Have the capacity for this--this app, is already there. The--you know-- </p><p>DALY: --Well, capacity-- </p><p>SHEA: --Study the nation-- </p><p>DALY: --The capacity is something that a great many countries have. They're--they do have a much stronger interest in implementing it, and drift toward, kind of a techno-- </p><p>SHEA: --They have-- </p><p>DALY: --terrorism-- </p><p>SHEA: --Shown the desire to do this-- </p><p>DALY: --Yup-- </p><p>SHEA: --By their treatment of the Uighur Muslims. I mean, this is absolutely extraordinary what they've done. You know, the--the--the million people in concentration camps and trying to deny it to the world when it's obvious with--you know, as people come out or the satellite imagery or whatever.  </p><p>And then brainwashing everybody, destroying their culture and saying you're not going to be like that anymore. You're going to-- </p><p>DALY: --So, this--I think this points to one of the--as did your answer on Hong Kong, one of the really big questions we face with China now, because you say--let's say they come in with violence, with sanctions, clearly, we have to do something.  </p><p>Sanctions for how long? You know, this was what--when we pulled out after 1989. And Deng Xiaoping was presented with, well, the foreigners are leaving. He said, they'll be back. And he was right. And so, the question on a lot of these issues--and I don't mean to be--I hope I don't sound like an apologist for the Chinese here.  </p><p>I'm trying to figure out what works. It's not a questioning of the values. But the questions--one of the questions of this conference, we've identified China as our greatest long term, strategic challenge. What price are we willing to pay, to meet that challenge?  </p><p>Our politicians are allergic to naming it. Whether it's asking businesses to abandon the profit motive, they're going to see that as a pretty big price. So, we--we need to define that. I mean, Christopher's already talked a little bit about the ways in which you might do this.  </p><p>But this is the form the question takes. There's no cost free, way. When have we ever met one of our greatest strategic challenges in the past, without paying real cost? </p><p>SHEA: Robert, do you think-- </p><p>DALY: --Let's define that. What do we--what do we--what must we be willing to pay?  </p><p>SHEA: Do you think that the entities list for those components, American components of surveillance equipment, use in Xinjiang companies, is something that we shouldn't be willing to pay? </p><p>DALY: Oh, no. I-- </p><p>SHEA: --We just-- </p><p>DALY: --I--I--I am willing to. I hope we stay with it. I'm just not sure that the administration is actually going to-- </p><p>SHEA: --Is there anybody here-- </p><p>DALY: --Stick with it-- </p><p>SHEA: --On--on this panel, that's not willing to--I mean, this is--this is-- </p><p>DALY: --No, but I'm not a shareholder in those companies, nor am I--so is the White House going to stay with it? Okay, then there's a political form of this question. There's a corporate form of this question.  </p><p>It's easy for us to say yes, the entity-- </p><p>SHEA: --But seems pretty minimal. I mean, we've had--we've had sanctions in the past on torture implements for example, going exported. </p><p>DALY: That's not a huge market though, force, is it?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>STALLARD-BLANCHETTE: Anything in (INAUDIBLE) the--on Hong Kong. I think you were-- </p><p>RANK: --Right, I mean, look, my--my--my only point was, I'm sure that were there to be--you know, were the PLA to go into Hong Kong, I'm sure the Hong Kong Democracy Act--I think I've missed mis--misquoted it. </p><p>STALLARD-BLANCHETTE: Human rights and Democracy Act. Yeah. </p><p>RANK: But that's not what staying the hand of the PLA, right? I mean, it's the fact that--that the--a large percentage of China's FDI, still comes through Hong Kong, and they need the place. And that's the--I mean, so that's the leverage that's there, that's--that--that's--I mean, I--I don't think it's the fear of--of Carrie La, not being able to get a visa, that's stopping things. </p><p>STALLARD-BLANCHETTE: Christopher, you wanted to-- </p><p>WALKER: --So, I think it's important to recognize that we're in a--we're in a dramatically different place right now, than we were even three or four years ago. And understanding the challenge presented by China. Part of this has been driven by phenomenal work, by a number of people in Australia, who really started to see the challenge before many other countries.  </p><p>And their institutions are still struggling with the right balance, between how to safeguard their liberal democratic values, with the need to have proper levels of security, and a whole host of fun--and fronts. Including the integrity of their democratic institutions.  </p><p>Canada is doing some important work in this regard. And they've been put into the crucible through some of their engagement on this. And so, I think it's--it's not right to say that we can't and won't do anything meaningful on this front. It's already happening.  </p><p>I think the next step will be to sort out how we can coordinate and cooperate with our partners better. And that won't be easy. I mean, this is going to be a long-term challenge, precisely because the investments, the engagements, the purposefulness that has come from China over the last years, has a lot of momentum behind it, and we're just getting our bearings.  </p><p>But I'm confident that when open societies do get their bearings, they will respond in a way that will have their interest safeguarded, which I think will be better for the world. Let me just put a plug in for Samantha Hoffman, who's doing topflight work on the technology issue, and understanding what China's ambitions are, and how that fits into their overall strategy.  </p><p>It's really compelling reading. And I think it should be required reading for anyone who's interested in China. </p><p>STALLARD-BLANCHETTE: Thank you. I want to make sure we get a couple of questions from the audience too. So, let me ask anyone who has a question for our panel, in the center here, if you just wait for the microphone to reach you, so we can hear you on the webcast. And if you just identify yourself.  </p><p>QUESTION: Yes, my name is Carl Wykel. My question--I have two questions regarding this intriguing partnership with the Vatican. It seems unusual, or strange bedfellows. Firstly, China--the Vatican's approach worldwide towards birth control and--and abortion, are diametrically opposed by China.  </p><p>So, could the--the benefit for China be, that it offers--in its diminishing worldwide membership, it offers a spark of growth for the--for the Vatican, there isn't a new population that can expand the Catholic Church, with a much more--a modified belief system?  </p><p>And secondly, regarding that outward statement that China says that communism was the fall of--you know, of Eastern Europe and--because of communism, well, actually, the Soviet Union allowed Poland in itself, full rights with the Vatican, as 90% of the people were Catholic. </p><p>And all the other Eastern European countries, the Soviets closed down or squeezed the church. So that relationship that the Vatican had politically--and around the world, the Belt and Road initiative, all goes through the Catholic world throughout Latin America, and parts of Africa.  </p><p>So, there could be some mutual agreement, that the Vatican is losing a high moral ground and sees an association with China, that can help it in other ways. Just some thoughts. </p><p>SHEA: Yeah. Well, that's a lot to unpack they--yes, they are definitely, I think losing somewhat, high moral ground. They cannot criticize the abortion policy, or the capital punishment policy, or the immigration, you know, refugee policy of China or any other policy. They cannot criticize anything.  </p><p>They have to, in fact, tow the--the propaganda line. That's going to be required of them now. The--they have been negotiating for 30 years. 20 to 30 years, they have been negotiating an agreement with the Chinese.  </p><p>And they--Catholicism--well, Christianity came with the Nestorians in the seventh century to China. It was suppressed. It came back with the Franciscans in the 13th, and then the Jesuits in the 15th. </p><p>And so, it has had a long-checkered history there, of being tolerated, catching the imagination of some of the people, and getting converts and then--and then being totally suppressed. So, this has been a--a long project for the Vatican.  </p><p>And the--I--I read in the Catholic press, that the Pope Francis, told an underground Bishop this summer after the agreement was signed, that they felt compelled to sign this. That it was extortion. That the government was threatening to appoint 45 of its own bishops, without any involvement with the Vatican or the Pope, and call it the Catholic Church.  </p><p>So, to prevent that kind of schism, they wanted to go in this route. And they thought that it will lead--leave open a door for further negotiation, and the--their big wishes to have the--the pope come to China. That's the Vatican's wish.  </p><p>Xi went to Rome last March. He did not visit the pope, as is customary with heads of state. So, I'm not sure that they're going to get much be--beyond a booth at the heart--Horticultural Society, which they did in Beijing.  </p><p>So, it--it--it's been, I think, a bad deal for--for the Catholics. But not knowing exactly whether that story's true, whether the extortion story is true, it came from a very reliable source, but it was about third hand. So that may explain it.  </p><p>I--I--I don't think it had--it was a response to the belt on road or any new development. I think this is something they've been working on and hoping for. And--and you know, the Vatican bureaucracy likes grand gestures, and treaties and deals, just like our State Department, no offense. </p><p>But you know, they--they--they would like to have this kind of an agreement in any event. And--and--and I think it's interesting that the Secretary of State Parylene, said that after signing it, he told the press it is not a good deal. It's not a good agreement. So, he seemed to hint that they had very little choice. There was only bad choices to be made. </p><p>STALLARD-BLANCHETTE: Time for one last question. Right up at the back. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi? Rayson (PH), Wilson Center. Given how China has essentially co-opted some elements of the war on terror, to formulate policy against Muslim minorities and other Turkic minorities in Xinjiang and other provinces, what do you think constitutes a good element of U.S. foreign policy, in taking that decision by China into account? Thank you. </p><p>STALLARD-BLANCHETTE: Who wants to go with it?  </p><p>SHEA: Well, I'll--I'll just start off. Yeah, I think, you know, the sanctions that we've put on in the last month, have all been directed towards that. The Entity's list, the--the--the visa controls. We are also trying--the U.S., I've been told by our religious freedom ambassador and others, that we're trying to convince the Muslim countries in the world, to speak up.  </p><p>And, you know, talking about solidarity, and trying to build a consensus that this is not acceptable. And unfortunately, there was a letter signed by scores of countries, including Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, and Syria, and Pakistan, not only not condemning what they're doing to the Uighur Muslims, but praising them for their desire, and their approach to tackle this terror issue. So, we have a long way to go. </p><p>RANK: Yeah, I would say the lesson is, people pay attention to what we do. So, you know, the--the war on terror where we held people without trial indefinitely, where we--you know, that people watch and they know when we're being hypocrite--critical, and look, I know country can live entirely up to--to its ideals, but to the extent we fall short, it damages us sort of domestically, but it dam--damages us internationally. So--so we should enter into that sort of enterprise with great, great caution and humility. </p><p>DALY: And just building off of that-- </p><p>SHEA: But that doesn't mean-- </p><p>DALY: Christopher has been talking about, you know (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>RANK: I mean, Guantanamo was a policy. </p><p>DALY: So, Christopher has been talking about sharp power, what China is doing to export illiberal practices. And it is focused more--and that's sort of--think of that as defense. And Nina's been talking about how can we change practices within China, that--that are abhorrent for the question of--of offense? </p><p>And I think that come to--and obviously common to both of those is the nature of the Chinese Communist Party, what they want to do domestically and internationally. But I think that in terms of policy, in terms of, sort of the defense against sharp power, and offense in terms of changing China, that Dave is right. </p><p>A big part of the answer is having our own house in order, and being the best exemplar, we can be of the--the values that have always been admired. And that's--I mean, the more we look here at all these different aspects of U.S.-China relations, for everything that we're really concerned with--with China, tends to be the case that items one through eight, are get our own house in order. And then nine and 10 is, you know, hit hard to change Chinese behavior in any way we can. </p><p>SHEA: Well, I--I--don't--I can't let that go. I mean-- </p><p>WALKER: I'd like to say a quick word. So, Robert, invoked the term sharp power, which was a--came about through a report that we released in December 2017. And I think it's important to note that, you know, the definition that we came up with was really about influence that seeks to marginalize, or censor, or otherwise impair the independence of democratic institutions.  </p><p>And I think what we see in China's case, beyond their borders, is that when China engages, there can be an adverse effect in so many ways. And so, part of this, you can stipulate that the U.S. and a host of other countries, need to get their house in order.  </p><p>I think that would be wonderful. And we should seek to effectuate that. But that won't help us deal with this larger global challenge that has emerged, where our allies and partners, and independent institutions are facing enormous challenges for which they're ill prepared.  </p><p>And so, I think it's important to recognize that any discussion of getting houses in order, has to be seen as two sides of a coin. That we can refresh our own institutions, respond to our peoples and society's needs. But we can't do that in isolation, because the authoritarians, China and Russia will not hit a pause button, while we get our house in order. It's just not going to happen.  </p><p>And so, any discussion of this kind, has to have a meaningful discussion about both sides of that coin. </p><p>STALLARD-BLANCHETTE: We are out of time. I think the diplomatic (INAUDIBLE), this would be a robust candid discussion, which is always the best sort of panel. So, I want to thank you all for your attention to this, very important subject. And thank our panelists. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>WALKER: Thank you for the moderation. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)   </p><p>WALKER: Thank you. </p><p>HEWITT: So, I won't have much to say. On my immediate left is Ambassador Winston Lord. His most recent book Kissinger on Kissinger, I cannot recommend highly enough to every here. It's really a remarkable series of conversations with Dr. Kissinger about all things including China. On his left, Ambassador Ches-- Chas Freeman from the Watson Institute. And then of course, Ambassador Stapleton Roy from the Wilson Center. And I've got Rob Litwak on the far end, who is of course, the Executive Director here at the Wilson Center. He's going to lead it off and ask most of the questions as we go into our--our final sprint around the track.  </p><p>LITWAK: Thank you, Hugh. And what an honor it is to--to be participating in a conversation with three of America's most distinguished diplomats. Am I audible here? I once heard Dr. Kissinger speaking at CSIS. And the chair of the meeting said, \"Can everyone hear me?\" And from the side you hear Dr.--you hear Dr. Kissinger say, \"By definition, those who cannot hear you will not reply  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, I hope--I hope I'm audible, okay? Let me start, I guess with an obvi--an obvious point, which is that Richard Nixon was able to work with Mao Ze-Dong, because he had a clear view of American interests. And the two leaders shared the view that the foundation of bilateral relations lay encountering the Soviet Union. So, what is the foundation of the relationship now, do you think? And we'll start with Winston Lord who-- </p><p>LORD: Well, let me--can I just hit a couple of great notes first, because it's so personal to me. I can't think of a more meaningful forum to me than this one because of the combination of the two conveners. You have the Kissinger Institute, and my relationship with him. Bob Daly and I worked together in the embassy in the late '80s. Stape saved me from one crisis, I saved him from another one when we were in government. So, this is meaningful in that regards. And then the Nixon Library and Foundation, I've been out there many times, just came back. The foundation was responsible for the book you mentioned.  </p><p>Because we had a series of interviews, before we sat down with Kissinger on Nixon foreign policy then persuaded him to do what turned into the book. So, this is particularly meaningful for me. And I don't want to take time on it, but I just felt obligated and motivated to do so. One last comment about today as being relevant, we mentioned Fred Malek at the beginning. </p><p>LITWAK: Yes. </p><p>LORD: Fred Malek and my son brought baseball to Washington. And I mentioned that because the nationals are now in the World Series. Being a Mets fan, I'm not too happy about that. Anyway, they put--they got the team here and then the commissioner at the time gave it to another ownership, and I've been outraged ever since. Look, we're at a serious juncture now. And it's tempting, and this kind of question can go on for about 20 minutes.  </p><p>So, I'll try to keep this brief. We all should try to do that. But, it's the most serious juncture in our relationship. And I think we have to steer between being a panda hugger and a dragon slayer. We should recognize the importance of this relationship. In fact, we can't let it descend into conflict. We should, in my view, recognize that the Chinese both at home and abroad have been the major culprit in the deterioration of the relationship. And we need firmer pushback in certain areas. </p><p>And I think we have to recognize that we need course correction on our policy. But at the same time, we should not consider them a permanent enemy or head in that direction. So, I'm down the middle on this. But the foundations remain there, if we can work at it. And the theme today, I would emphasize now, the three major foundations of our policy toward China, which can turn it into a smart, manageable competition, not enmity and Kum Baya is get your act together at home. Both in terms of our political system and investing in the future at a showcase with democracy. Work with like-minded countries and allies, including on the trade issue where we have more leverage if we do so.  </p><p>And supplement our strength through multilateral institutions, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership we withdrew from, the Iran nuclear deal, climate change, et cetera. That's the most important thing is what we do ourselves. We should welcome the competition from China as a ways to get our own act together. We should be firm and push back, as I said, where they've been aggressive. But, we should also seek areas where we continue to cooperate and manage those areas where we can. </p><p>So, I think the foundations there are not only economic interactions, they're global challenges that we can share principles and policies on. But, in terms of getting our own act together. And so, I'm not despairing, I'm concerned. And until we get these three pillars straight of domestic strength, allied unity and international leadership that we're going to have trouble. </p><p>LITWAK: Chas. </p><p>FREEMAN: I actually didn't understand what the format was. So-- </p><p>LITWAK: Did you prepare some remarks?  </p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah, I spent a couple of days thinking about it. And so, I have about eight or nine minutes of remarks. Is that too long?  </p><p>LITWAK: No.  </p><p>FREEMAN: Okay.  </p><p>LITWAK: Thank you very much.  </p><p>FREEMAN: Then, I'll hold forth. </p><p>LITWAK: I would have taken it. I mean, it's not fair. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>FREEMAN: The Wilson Center was established 51 years ago, in 1968, which was about the time I returned to Washington from my first jar in the Foreign Service in South India, where I learned Tamil but concealed that from the authorities, which was a good thing or I would have spent the rest of my life commuting between Colombo and what is now called Chennai. At that time, man had not landed--yet landed on the moon.  </p><p>And neither Nixon nor Kissinger had arrived in Beijing. Before he was elected, and I think this is a crucial point, Richard Nixon had already concluded that no world order that excluded China could be stable. After he took office in 1969, clashes broke out along the Sino-Soviet frontier. And I think Nixon clearly feared the geopolitical consequences of a Soviet military conquest or humiliation of China. And so, his administration began the politically and institutionally difficult process of changing U.S. policy toward China. It switched from using Taiwan to contain the PRC, to enlisting the PRC to contain the USSR.  </p><p>Doing so required addressing Chinese demands that the United States withdraw our military presence from Taiwan, terminate our defense treaty with Taipei, and recognize Beijing rather than Taipei as the capital of an undivided China. Nixon knew this. He believed it was in the strategic interest of the United States. And--and he, well, proceeded. There was no sentiment in Nixon's-- </p><p>LORD: Excuse me, he didn't do any one of those three things though, they were done later. I'm not saying right or wrong way. He didn't do any one of those three in the Shanghai Communique when we were there. Not one of those three.  </p><p>FREEMAN: No, he--he addressed those questions, saying that U.S. forces in Taiwan would be reduced as--as--as the area proceeded toward peace. He--He did not address the defense treaty. And he did not switch recognition. That's all very correct. But he set in motion a process that was very clearly aimed at those things. There was no sentiment in Nixon's decision. He was famously cynical. He did not imagine that recruiting China and supporting the so called free world would result in China joining it, or embracing America's liberal democratic ideology. If he was remorseful at all about switching sides in the Chinese Civil War, he gave no sign of this. </p><p>In 1972 Nixon dramatically visited Beijing, the capital of a then hostile regime Americans did not recognize, and with which the alternative Chinese government we had long championed was locked in an unresolved Civil War. Nixon artfully finessed the Taiwan question, privately assuring Mao and Joe that he would recognize the PRC in his second term.  </p><p>Watergate then struck Nixon down. Gerald Ford's accidental pre--presidency was too politically precarious for him to implement Nixon's pledge. It was left to Jimmy Carter to normalize relations with the PRC, then led by Deng Xiaoping. Deng needed an opening to the United States for two reasons. First, tactically, to put the USSR off balance. As he used force to convince Hanoi that aligning itself with Moscow would cost it vastly more than it could ever hope to gain. And second, strategically, to de-Sovietize China's domestic political economy.  </p><p>Some Americans understood Deng's geopolitical strategy. None understood his ambitions for domestic reform. But it was Deng's opening of China to American influence that transformed, not only China, but also world affairs. It's instructive to--to compare the situation then, before Deng's policies of reform and opening with now. </p><p>In 1972, the United States was concerned about China's weakness and backwardness. Now, we're apprehensive about it strengths and technological advance. In 1972, the United States was very much the senior partner in the Sino-American relationship. Now, we must deal with China as an equal. Both countries are having trouble adjusting to this change. In 1972 Sino-American relations were remodeled by mutual accommodation. Now, they're being transformed by escalating mutual antagonism.  </p><p>In 1972, the United States was concerned about the consequences of Chinese exclusion from the Pax Americana. Now, Washington is obsessed with the consequences of China's inclusion in global and regional governance. Americans seek to preserve our global and indo-pacific prima--primacy. Chinese insist on a rolling global and regional--regional governance, commensurate with their regained economic and military power.  </p><p>In 1972, the United States and China set aside ideological differences to pursue some common interest. The United States now sees such differences as impediments to cooperation with China, even on obvious common interest. In 1972, the United States and China began to forge and entente, a limited partnership for limited purposes to check the political military threat to both that Soviet aspirations for global hegemony represented. Together, over the next two decades, Americans and Chinese helped validate George Cannon's judgment that if isolated, the Soviet Union's def-defects, would eventually bring it down. With no common military adversary to confront and contain the Nixon Carter finesse of the Taiwan issue, and the cross strait understandings that have kept the peace between Taipei and Beijing are now unraveling. The risk of a war to determine Taiwan's relationship with the rest of China is the highest it's been in decades.  </p><p>Apart from the potentially devastating consequences of mismanaging the Taiwan issue, the threats to China and the United States are global in nature and have no conceivable military solution. Human induced climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, regional instability in China's near abroad, Islamist terrorism and maintaining world order conducive to stability and prosperity are or should be concerns of both countries. These intere--these interests provide an obvious basis for cooperation. Yet, in almost every arena, the United States and China are now working at cross purposes.  </p><p>To both Americans and Chinese, it was simply inconceivable that the notoriously anti-communist Richard Nixon would reach out to the famously anti-capitalist Mao Ze-Dong.  Richard Nixon, let's remember, had been the single Republican most closely associated with Joe McCarthy. In the early 1950s, he had taken the lead in smearing America's China hands as traitors bent on enabling a communist victory over Chiang Kai-shek.  </p><p>In 1950, Mao, for his part, had taken China into alliance with the Soviet Union, then into combat with the United States in Korea. But when either Nixon or Mao saw a strategic opportunity for his country, each proved able to set aside both prejudice and the conventional wisdom to seize the opportunity. If such courageous and visionary leaders are alive today when Lord is alive, I've noticed, they are hiding themselves very, very well. Sino-American relations are in the process of returning to the fallacious stereotypes and unreasoning hostility that Nixon and Mao acted to set aside five decades ago. This promises to make the world a much more dangerous place, and a much less prosperous place than it has been since the two sides decided to replace enmity with peaceful rapprochement and expanding cooperation. </p><p>I think all three members of this panel can remember a time when China and the United States knew nothing of each other. And imagine that was everything we needed to know. Beijing and Washington each snarled and pronounced anathema on the other. Neither benefited from this, but most in both countries took it for granted that we were mortal enemies and destined to remain so. Sadly, we now seem to be headed back to a level of estrangement that endangers us and everyone associated with us. Nixon, Kissinger, Mao and Joe were right. There's more to be gained by what the Chinese called (UNTRANSLATED) seeking Common Ground while shelving differences for later resolution, than by tit for tat antagonism. </p><p>United States and China can be for each other, on some issues even as they are against each other on others. And if Americans and Chinese cannot bring ourselves to act jointly to realize common interests, we can still act in parallel, taking different roads to a common end which is (UNTRANSLATED) That common destination had better not be war, which could literally be fatal--fatal to both societies. I think the restoration of mutual respect and--and--can is necessary to ensure peace and prosperity for the people of both China and the United States. It awaits a new Richard Nixon. </p><p>LITWAK: Thank you, Chas.  </p><p>ROY: I've been doing a mathematical calculation here. Win got four minutes, Chas got eight. So, that means I get 12? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LITWAK: Of course. Go ahead.  </p><p>ROY: Let me try to answer your question, then. It was--Chas answered it, I thought eloquently. The basis for the United States relationship with China is the same as it was in 1972 with Nixon threat. It was the common reception of the Soviet Union as a threat to both countries that created the glue that enabled us to get the relationship off onto a new basis.  </p><p>And now, 40 years later, each of us sees the other as the principal threat. And our relationship is being driven by that. The threat perception on the Soviet Union was inadequate to cover the range of interests that once we had broken the ice, leaders on both sides recognized we needed a broader relationship. And right up until 1989, the Soviet threat provided sufficient underpinning for the relationship that we were able to go through the very difficult process of setting up a normal relationship from an extraordinarily abnormal relationship.  </p><p>We then went through a period, Wi--Win was in the middle of this, and I was the ambassador in Beijing at the time, when we essentially lost the Soviet threat as a basis for the relationship. Our public opinion toward China had turned hostile. And we did not have a national understanding of what the basis for the relationship should be. </p><p>By the end of the decade, we had begun to realize that China was emerging as a major country. And there was a period during the latter Clinton administration, right through the early Obama administration, when essentially we were dealing with China as a major country that we had to deal with as a major country. But then, and it was partly driven by the global financial crisis and the loss of confidence in the West, in our own future, that we increasingly began to see China emerging as a threat. Not just a--a major country, but as an emerging threat to the United States. </p><p>That's where we are at present. And that's where China is at present. The irony of the situation is that we see China as an external threat, and China, in many ways sees us as an internal threat. There has been much criticism of our engagement policy with China on the grounds that it failed in its alleged purpose, which I happen to think was not its purpose. But it's alleged purpose of turning China into a liberal democracy. And yet, what we have is a reemergence of repression in China, in which the leader of China is trying to repress the very ideas which are characteristic of liberal democracies that have taken root in China. And he is waging an ideological campaign to try to stamp out Western influences, and to insist that socialism was Chinese characteristics. Even though, in his speeches he acknowledges, doesn't have all the advantages that the democratic countries have, that the capitalist countries have. But he says, this is the only system that China can have.  </p><p>And so, what we're seeing both in Xingjiang and Hong Kong, in some ways in the way they're dealing with China. China has lots of threats. And all of them have a domestic component. You have separatism and in--in Xingjiang. It's separatism not terrorism that is the root of their oppression there. In Hong Kong, we see the yearning of the--of the Chinese people in Hong Kong, not to lose the privileges that they enjoy under the basic act that was negotiated in 1997.  </p><p>And in Taiwan, you have people who increasingly feel alienated from a Chinese personality and are beginning to think of themselves with the Taiwan personality. And this is a threat to China. But, we are also an external threat. So, in a sense, China has this double problem of us as the principal external threat and the ideas we represent as creating a more--a more difficult, domestic threat for China to deal with. At the moment, because we are seeing China principally as a threat, we are, but able to take advantage of the attractiveness of our system to pe--to the people of China. </p><p>And that is what I would call the principal flaw. Just as we required normalization of our relationship during the '70s and '80s in order to be able to take advantage of the commonalities between our two countries, the common interests. Right now, we have to get over this sense of only being driven by concern about the China threat, and begin to realize that we have to deal with that aspect of the relationship. But as both Win and Chas have touched on, there's a host of other areas where we have a common interest with China. Both of us will benefit from having a prosperous and stable Indo-Pacific region.  </p><p>And we can't get that unless the United States and China are willing to work together. If you don't have a prosperous and stable region, which we actually achieved for much of the last 40 years, because China and the United States we're working together. Then, we are going to damage the interest of all of the countries of the Indo Pacific region, and that's not going to be in our interest.  </p><p>So, I think your question is a very good one. But the problem is at the moment, we only understand the threat aspect of the basis for our relationship, and we are not showing wisdom in understanding the areas where there are opportunities for cooperation.  </p><p>LORD: Can I make a comment? These are both excellent, but since the title of this session is partly the Nixon Legacy. So, I think you are very correct, Chas, to lead off as you did. And I would like to fill in just a little bit. I thought it was a very good run down, but a little more background on the opening of what Nixon was up to here. And you can get it all in my book, but some guys should hold back a bit.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But very, very quickly, you mentioned how Nixon came in foreign affairs article, don't leave China outside his. He wanted to open up to China, primarily for world order and so on. Kissinger separately -- they didn't know each other. He--Nixon chose--Nixon, a conservative Californian, distrustful of the Ivy League, somewhat some anti-Semitic. Who does he choose as his national security advisor? A Harvard professor, immigrant Jewish person who worked for Nelson Rockefeller, his opponent. He also chose Daniel Moynihan on the domestic side. So, this man had courage from the beginning. So, that was his emphasis, Kissinger's emphasis was more balance of power.  </p><p>Now, in terms of the motives, you've hit some of them. But on the U.S. side--on the Russians part, it wasn't just the balance of Russians--Soviets, it was to improve relations with them. When we started sending public signals of the direction we were headed toward in terms of China, the Soviet experts and the State Department unanimously warned Nixon not to open up with Beijing because it would hurt our relations with Moscow. Which have, at that point, nuclear stalemate was the overriding priority. George Cannon, Chip Boland, Tommy Thompson, (INAUDIBLE) said, \"Don't open up with China, you'll hurt relations with Moscow.\" And Stape was sitting in Moscow at the time so he'll want to comment on this.  </p><p>Within--I won't go to detail because I want to save time. But within a week or two of the announcement of our secret trip, and Nixon's coming trip, the Soviets agreed to a summit which they've been dragging their feet on for two years. We made major progress in Berlin, major progress in arms control and (INAUDIBLE). So, the objective was not just China, but to have better relations with each of those communist giants than they had with each other. And it worked. </p><p>Secondly--secondary goals of Nixon and Kissinger for the opening, try to get some help bri--bringing the Vietnam War to an end. These are the two major patrons of Hanoi. So, therefore, we might isolate them at least psychologically if we opened up. Greater stability in Asia. And then two, I think, very important results and hard to quantify. Number one, we were bogged down in a war. We had riots, assassinations, protests at home, and it looked like we had no diplomatic dexterity abroad.  </p><p>And by opening up dramatically with a fifth of the world's people, we show the U.S. could be a major diplomatic giant again. And secondly, the American people who were understandably fatigued and worn out by the Vietnam War, and it was going to be an ambiguous ending no matter what happened, not a march down Fifth Avenue. By opening up with this dramatic opening, it put this messy ending of Vietnam in some context in terms of geopolitical objectives. </p><p>On the Chinese side, you mentioned a couple of their incentives to open up, but I would argue one more, get out of their isolation. At the time we went through in July '71, they had one Ambassador abroad in Egypt, their cultural revolution was still going on. They were totally isolated, and they calculated correctly that if we opened up with China, others, particularly Japan and Europe would follow suit and they'd get into the United Nations. So, (INAUDIBLE) those parts. One last point and then I want to make a point in Stape. We all talk about the courage of--of Nixon, and sure it was easier for him with his right flank protected in Hubert Humphrey. But it was still a courageous decision. But let's not forget the courage of the Chinese and their self-interest. If you look at the Shanghai Communique, and you touched on this.  </p><p>The Chinese, as you said, and one of you said, we have to kick some of these tough--I think you did, today even. Issues down the road and work where we can cooperate. They'd always insisted that you can't have a dialogue with th--them unless we solve the Taiwan issue. We wouldn't even go to China till we establish there was secret channels that they would talk about other issues. And then yes, we had to agree to a one China. We kept it fuzzy, but look at the concessions China made on Taiwan?  </p><p>We maintain diplomatic relations with Taipei, we maintained troops on Taiwan and the few we sa--we said we might reduce as the tensions inherent reduce was to give Chinese and incentive to end the Vietnam War so we could take some of those Vietnam re--related troops out. And Kissinger on Chinese soil reaffirmed our defense treaty.  So, there were tremendous courage and vision on both sides the theme of your remarks. And I just wanted to add those things to your excellent run down. </p><p>One last point, Stape has articulated, and I think this conference has that we ought to be in a smart competition with China. It is a strategic competition. But we should have every sense that we've got assets compared to them. They've got 14 neighbors, all of them are either terrorists or have nuclear weapons, have border disputes. And we've got two oceans and Mexico and Canada. There's a whole list of assets we've got they don't have, and they've got huge problems. But if we don't get our act together, if we don't work with our friends, and we pull out of international leadership, we're going to lose out. So, let's welcome this as a competition, not as inevitable conflict. </p><p>FREEMAN: Could I make just two very brief comments? First, on Kissinger. I joined the Foreign Service in part because I was bored at law school and reading history at the Warner Library and came to China and I have a long family connection with China, which I hadn't really considered. But it seems to me that the world was geopolitically unstable with China in isolation and that we would have to move to correct that. When Henry Kissinger was rather than probably, as Win said, selected to be the National Security Advisor. I was delighted primarily because of his great book, A World Restored. A World Restored, is partly--it's probably the best description of the European balance of power ever written. But it is also the description of a strategy by Metternich, the Austria-Hungarian Prime Minister, to pull the fangs of the French Revolution.  </p><p>After the Napoleonic Wars, he and others did something which we failed to remember, in the Wars of the 20th century. Namely, he reintegrated France into the order and made them part of the council's of governance of the European system. So that they had an interest in stability rather than promoting instability. And I saw this as applying very much to China. On the other hand, I think in your book, Kissinger on Kissinger, it comes across very clearly, and I saw this at the time, that because he was tactically engaged with the Vietnamese, he was more intent on the Vietnam side than Nixon was. So, there was an odd juxtaposition of Nixon as strategic thinker, determined to open to China and Kissinger, belated (INAUDIBLE) to that--to that thought The second point-- </p><p>LORD: He wasn't belated (INAUDIBLE). They each came into office thinking we should open. They just had different motives.  </p><p>FREEMAN: Exactly, yeah. The second point very briefly, is that you're--I think you're absolutely correct to emphasize the essence of the policy was to have a better relationship with Beijing and Moscow than they had with each other. We've now accomplished the opposite. </p><p>HEWITT: If I could ask a question of all three. We've got such a collection of wisdom. All day long, people have talked about China as being a force to be acted upon or which will act upon us. It's all about ca--sticks and carrots. In your collective experience, is there any persuading, I mean, talking political theory with the Chinese leadership that would persuade them on anything? For example, on religious liberty? I mean, if you want social credit score, Import Baptist are the best social credit people I know. Is there any persuading them to do things differently or does it all have to be sticks and carrots, Ambassador Roy? </p><p>ROY: My principal experience was with the Soviet Union in China. And I found them both easier to negotiate with than some of the countries of Southeast Asia where I served. Because, if you could master a good logical reason for doing something, it had impact on them. Whereas, when you're dealing as a big country with a small country, it becomes a issue of tradeoffs that has no logic behind it. I negotiated a science and technology agreement with Thailand, for example, where they wouldn't agree to correct a typo if you didn't make a concession to them because you spotted the typos.  </p><p>So therefore, for them to correct it, you have to give them something additional. That was not the case with China. The power of example, is very powerful in both countries. The Soviet Union dealt with the problem by not permitting their citizens to have any access to the outside world. So, they were able to convince many Soviet citizens when I lived there, that their standard of living was better than that of the United States. In fact, their standard of living was below that of East Germany, it was below that of Poland. It was below that of Czechoslovakia. But Soviet citizens didn't know that because they didn't have free access to Eastern Europe. </p><p>China, in an act of unbelievable self-confidence, ended up flooding us with their best and brightest students. And so, they had a very realistic understanding of the advantages of the Western economic and political system, and encouraging general prosperity in the countries. But, we didn't--we didn't persuade the Chinese of this, we let them see it. And this had--had the--the impact that Xi Jinping is struggling with right now. And in his speeches, he talks about the fact that we're going to have to deal with the fact that the--the--what does he call it? The capitalist systems of the West, are going to use our disadvantages to--to criticize us. And that's exactly what's happening. And many Chinese believe that the capitalist system or the market system, shall we say, can deliver better advantages for China, than the type of socialism that they're trying to reinstall--restore. So I--I--I find that logic works well with the Chinese. But you also need to have a powerful example to support the logic. And then you have an overwhelming ability to shift their viewpoint.  </p><p>LITWAK: Chas, before you reply. Can I just build on Hugh's comment? Because one of the -- Hugh's focuses on an important aspect of the relationship and how do we have some type of co-evolution or--or some meeting of--of interest between the two sides? But underlying a lot of our conversation today has been the relationship between foreign policy and domestic prospects in China.  </p><p>And Kissinger--Nixon and Kissinger both viewed in the realist tradition of foreign policy, focused on a stable distribution of power among states as a key to achieving international peace. The institution that I work, Wilson, that--that we memorialized, he's--he's rooted in an alternative view of international relations where you focus on domestic politics and democratic governance with market economies rooted in international institutions with norms, the proverbial rules based system. That's the key to achieving a Pacific international system.  </p><p>In your conversations, you know, at the beginning of this change relationship, which had a geostrategic kind of impetus, you know. The Ussuri River clash, the possibilities that created. Was there ever a kind of a tacit discussion of like, if the relationship changed, that there was sort of an implicit discussion--you know, assumption about the--the prospects for domestic political change in--in China? That if they integrated into the system, you create a middle class, you need rule of law for commercial transactions.  </p><p>Was there any kind of sense of implicitly that what you were trying to achieve on a geostrategic level could open the door to some type of domestic political evolution or not?  </p><p>LORD: No, no. I want to give you one quick answer, but the answer is no, it didn't come up. This is when China was very weak, and we had no sense that it'd ever grow into the--the behemoth that it has become today and also raised some of these issues. So, I can elaborate, but--and I'll get back to it. But I want to pick up, I think what--Stape gave a terrific answer.  </p><p>Really, what you're saying is logic, but you really what you're saying, you got to demonstrate to them their self-interest, their self-interest. And I'll give you just a couple examples. One, in the early '70s, the only relationship we have was conceptual, ascension. We didn't have concrete interests of negotiations or exchanges. But we did talk a lot, in the Kissinger Joe and (INAUDIBLE) conversations were incredible. But I'll give you an example. It's one of the few examples of maybe persuasion. But it really was appealing to their self-interest. When we first got there. Mao and Joe complained about the U.S.-Japan alliance. They said this was destabilizing, dangerous, a threat to China. Kissinger worked with a couple of trips saying, \".Look, you're nuts. By our way of relationship with Japan and the security umbrella, we're keeping Japan from rearming, and being more of a threat to you.  </p><p>And believe it or not, after a couple of years, the Chinese came around and said, \"I think it was primarily this argument that did it.\" In fact, after the shock that Japan when we opened up, Mao kept telling us we ought to go to Japan more. Kissinger, you know, pay attention to Japan and so on. So, that's--that's not going to happen today. And you don't have Joes and Kissingers around, not to mention Nixons and Maos.  </p><p>But I do think the same principle applies that Stape was saying, Take two current examples. The Iran nuclear agreement, we worked with China before this administration, as well as Russia. I'm sure we were making the argument you have an interest and Iran not disrupting your oil supplies which you have such a heavy interest in. And we got to get the nuclear capability under control.  </p><p>And so, I think that's the main reason China did it. They'd always acted their self-interest as most countries do, but China do it fairly well. And then climate change. I'm sure they figured it out for themselves. But I would think Obama and others made the argument, it's ruining your own economy, it's ruining your quality of life. It's producing a lot of the protests against your government over environmental issues.  </p><p>There's a lot of money to be made with clean technology, get your act together and climate change and join with us and serve--you know--in solving this world problem. So, I'm just elaborating, try to give examples of what Stape was saying. Heavy pressures, loss of face, direct confrontation is not very useful with them. Certainly, rolling over is not very useful. You've got to appeal to their self-interest. </p><p>FREEMAN: I want to try to join what Stape and Win just said. And Win, your earlier remark which I agree with completely, that the key to successful competition is getting our own act together. Instead of trying to keep China down, we should be trying to raise ourselves up. And I think the--the key one of--I would add your list of our deficiencies at this moment, with an apparent total inability to do diplomacy. Diplomacy rests on empathy. </p><p>LORD: I just barely touched on my list by the way </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>FREEMAN: No, but I mean, internationally, this goes directly to the question that--that you asked about-- Hugh about the--the, whether you can reason with the Chinese and persuade them. Yes, you can. If you are seen as friendly, not menacing. If you are seen as understanding their point of view, and their interests, and maybe persuading them to take a different view of their own interests. So, that, this is what diplomacy is all about. It's about getting the other side to accept that it's in their interest to do what you want them to do. At the moment, our approach to international affairs is almost exclusively coercive. It's not directed at recognizing and trying to use the self-interest of the other side, to get them to do things. It's militarized.  </p><p>I think we have a major conceptual problem in this country, which is the--in part, to resolve the fact that, for a long time, the Defense Department has financed international relations theory and political science in every university in the country. We have a copious literature of coercion. We have almost no literature of persuasion, (INAUDIBLE), and yet an ordinary life, when we have a problem with our neighbor, if we're wise, we don't pull the gun and say submit or else.  </p><p>Maximum pressure, the motto of this administration, now being applied to Iran, once applied to North Korea, maybe still applied to North Korea was precisely the formula that convinced the Japanese in 1941 that they needed to do something desperate. We are risking doing that in other contexts, I don't think yet with China, but certainly the approach we're taking to China is designed to humiliate and force capitulation. And I don't think that works with them or very many other foreign societies. </p><p>LITWAK: We could turn it over to the audience now I think and ask them for their questions. And while you--okay. Please identify yourself.  </p><p>HEWITT: You have to speak louder, please. I'm sorry. </p><p>FREEMAN: Microphone is probably not working.  </p><p>HEWITT: And mic, yeah. </p><p>UNKNOWN: I think it's on now.   </p><p>STALLARD-BLANCHETTE: I think it's now. Yeah. Katie Stallard-Blanchette. I'm a fellow here at the Wilson Center. Thank you so much. Sort of, one of the great things about being here is being able to have this kind of caliber of--of panel to--to enjoy. I just, I wonder whether you think there's any sort of parallel version of this conversation happening in China? And if there is what sort of conclusions they may be drawing about the state of the relationship? </p><p>LORD: Stape, why don't you take on first? Is there a (INAUDIBLE)--did you hear the question? </p><p>ROY: Yes. The short answer is, for much of the last 30 years, you have essentially had free speech in China. You couldn't publish really but even highly sensitive issues, you could have discussions in China at universities, at think tanks, with government officials. But they couldn't publish these sorts of things. The Chinese have been wondering how to deal with U.S. for all of this period.  </p><p>We're not easy to get along with, partly because of the propensity we have, particularly in the--in government, and particularly in the Congress, the U.S. threats and bullying as the way to try to get other countries to do what we want them to do, instead of persuading them that there's a common interest that will be served by going the way that we would like them to go. And this is been upsetting to the Chinese. They have held conferences, trying to deal with the question of how to manage the relationship with the United States for the better.  </p><p>The Chinese have discovered that as they have become stronger, they were--began to be seen as a threat by all of their neighbors. And so, they have put particular focus on what they call (UNTRANSLATED) which is diplomacy around your periphery. Because they found that they were losing out in the diplomacy because they were being seen as threatening, as opposed to being able to use diplomacy to persuade their neighbors to behave in a better way.  </p><p>So, the Chinese do indeed deal with these issues. The problem right now is that for the last few years, under Xi Jinping, they have been stamping out the ability to speak freely in China. And this even influences Chinese professors, think tank people, government officials, even when they come here now, they are talking less freely than they used to talk when you met with them in China even. So, I think it's more difficult now for China to have the type of free and open discussion that they need. But this has been actually quite commonly taking place in China over much of the last 30 years. </p><p>LORD: I want to echo that about the effect even on private conversations. But this doesn't directly answer your question. But I want to introduce a little balance in our discussion. We've all agreed that we can be ham handed with China. And we hurt a billion people's feelings occasionally and so on. And we've asked for a more sophisticated approach, and we agree on that. But I don't want to lose sight of the fact that the current crisis in our relationship, I believe, is primarily China's fault. </p><p>I won't go through a long list, but it started really in 2008 with the financial crisis where we fell on our face and China got some hubris, thinking that they know how to do things better than we did. Their understandable instincts to claim their rightful place on the world stage. They want to make clear they have a right to build up their military, they have a right to get greater seats at the table and international organizations. They have a right to have legitimate public diplomacy in other countries, and we've made some mistakes.  </p><p>So, I'm not saying it's all one way. But on the whole, what she had particularly been doing, since he came in and state was--referred to that, has caused this crisis. Now, we'd have a problem anyway, no matter who is president, because of the risen versus established power with changing from rising now, I guess, to risen. That's going to create tensions in adjustment, particularly when the two sides of ideological differences and national interests differences and geographic tensions. So, there's going to be a problem with any president.  </p><p>I happen to think that Trump has not responded in the correct way. I told the three things we ought to be doing and he's not doing those. But, at least he's raised--helped to raise the consciousness. However, let's not forget as we talk about how we've got to be sensitive and sophisticated that the problem, I still believe is primarily because of what China has been up to. I--I--I don't want to give a long lit, because we don't have time. But what they've been doing at home, what Xi has done to consolidate his power, the Communist Party, in charge of everything, reversing economic reforms, forced technology transfer is violating WTO, cyber theft. The South China Sea, East China Sea, Taiwan squeezed, Hong Kong squeezed, interfering in our society in coercive and corrupt ways beyond public diplomacy.  </p><p>The (INAUDIBLE) the list goes on. And--and all of that has either been there before and accentuated by Xi, or its been new elements that have introduced tension. So, there's a reason why there's a bipartisan mood in this country, is the danger of overreacting and not having a sophisticated approach and smart competition we all are in favor of. But there's a reason why the mood has shifted among think tank experts, among academics, among former government officials to harden up versus China. So, I just want to introduce that balance so we don't get overly self-flagellating here. </p><p>FREEMAN: We-- we are two continental societies. Continental societies tend to focus more on domestic than foreign affairs. And its domestic interests and issues that drive policy to a great extent in both countries. We also have in common, the fact that we're both exceptionally self-righteous. We never make mistakes on both sides. This is not conducive to an effective relationship. It's a major obstacle to good relations. Because, I spoke about empathy as the basis of diplomacy. It's not enough to understand the interests of the other side. You also have to understand how the other side sees you. And that is very difficult. And it is--seems to be particularly difficult in my experience for Chinese. </p><p>So, I think this is a fundamental issue. And I'll just second Stape's remarks about the change in the flow of information and discussion in China in the mid '80s, when--when I was Stape's successor in his first tour in Beijing. Hu Yaobang had a whole series of little informal think tanks, which were fading all kinds of ideas to him. Some of them, frankly, totally crazy. But he was willing to listen to them, and he would--he was willing to think about them. This problem of bottom up communication. But China has a far worse version of it than we do.  </p><p>LORD: You're right about the atmosphere. What--when I was--I chose being Ambassador much more smartly than state did. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Because I was there between cooling off the Taiwan problem of the communicate and the beginning of the tenement square. When I was there, you--and you said mid-80s. I was there the late 80s.  </p><p>Betty, my wife and I, would have dissidents, reformers and party officials sitting around the same table, talking about political reform. I could go on, but countless examples, but now, as you say that the atmosphere is really constricted.  </p><p>HEWITT: Yeah. Robert Daly. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Robert Daly, the Wilson Center, a number of colleagues and I were in San Diego earlier this year with a--a--a group of senators and congressmen, we did a four-day seminar on China. At the end of which, one of the congressmen said, thank you. That was very sophisticated. That was very nuanced. I get it now.  </p><p>But I can't bring all this nuance and expertise to my constituents. Can you assembled experts give me two sentences, that when I'm home, I can tell my constituents to make them understand the nature of the China challenge, to make them understand that we may have to invest or pay costs to meet the challenge.  </p><p>And can you give me two sentences that in doing that, don't demonize China across the board and subject Chinese Americans to racial profiling. And we all stared at our shoes. Very tough to get that.  </p><p>And so, I wanted to ask the three of you really, if you have any suggestions for much broader messaging, that prepares the American people for whatever comes next. I mean, it seems to me that the simple view has been--gone from China is open, to China's getting rich, and now, China is dangerous. What's--what should the message be for Congressmen, for example, for the constituents? </p><p>ROY: I think that Senator Coons in his remarks at lunch-- </p><p>QUESTION: But that was a long, two sentences. It's what we were challenged to give them.  </p><p>ROY: Two sentences is what you have to use to brief the president. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But if you're talking to the American people, you can actually use a speech such as Senator Coons did. What I liked about his speech was, he didn't gloss over all of the negative aspects of China. But he basically presented a positive view of how we could develop the overall relationship.  </p><p>And I commented to him after his speech, terrific speech here, but nobody in Congress gives a speech like that. And I think that's one of the major problems you have. I think it's a--a nice exercise to think about two sentences to do it.  </p><p>But I actually think you need more than two sentences in order to capture the sense of what you need to do. And I thought the senator did a super job of it at lunch.  </p><p>FREEMAN: So, if we don't get our fiscal act together, we are not going to be competitive. We are disinvesting in science. We are disinvesting in education. We are disinvesting in infrastructure. All of which are key to our competitiveness.  </p><p>So, this is a far bigger question than China. You cannot run a country on you indefinitely repeated credit roll overs, without eventually running up a--against a disaster. You cannot continue to increase the deficit in crumbling infrastructure and remain economically efficient. You cannot close your borders to bright minds and hope to retain scientific and technological advantages. </p><p>I would say frankly--and this is not a political statement. It is a personal judgment, quite aside from party, that what the Trump administration is doing in every respect, is crippling this country, for the future competition that we need to rise to. </p><p>So, I guess the answer is, we need a deep process of introspection and redirection in our--in our country. And we have to be able to--have to be willing to pay what it costs, to be excellent.  </p><p>LORD: I will try to respond to the two-sentence stricture, by pointing out it's a new novel about it. It was up for the Booker Prize, didn't win it. Thank God. And well, I'm serious about this. In one sentence, it goes on for 500 pages. One sentence. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, if she could do it, I can do it, right? I'll give you the components of two sentences. But Stape is right. In terms of what you need more time, and American people will--will stand for it. And--and you'll--obviously were being somewhat ironic.  </p><p>The first sentence would make the case. It would be a long sentence, and I won't give it but I--I just give you the components of, that China's not 10 feet tall. And we have tremendous assets versus China. I could elaborate but I--I--I would just put in all the problems they've got and all the inherent assets we have.  </p><p>And the end of that sentence, dangling participle would say, and therefore we should welcome this competition to get our act together. There's not an exact analogy to Sputnik. We ought to treat them like Sputnik. </p><p>The Chinese are coming. And there is an extraordinary performance by them. We got to get our act together. We can do it, because look at their problems and look at our assets. And we did it in Sputnik, you know, maybe there's other analogies of going to the moon and et cetera. </p><p>The second sentence would be, essentially, what Chas just said. That we've--and which I've already mentioned, how we go about doing a drawing on our assets, which are--we are afraid of going away. And so, I would, therefore the first one's analysis, the second one's prescription. </p><p>They'd both be long, but we can do it in two sentences. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>ROY: I--I'm going to add something on to this. Because I thought that Assistant Secretary Stilwell, he quoted from a (INAUDIBLE) speech. And in that (INAUDIBLE), said the capitalist countries have the edge on us now. In economics, in the--in military, and what was the third one?  </p><p>Whatever it was, he said they have the edge, what should we do? He said we should improve ourselves. We should raise our standard of living. So that--that--that--that--that was the--the concept.  </p><p>In other words, instead of trying to react by holding down the other side, you need to make yourself better. And that was Xi's conclusion. That we're in this long-term cooperation and struggle with the capitalist world.  </p><p>We're going to show that our system is better. But he was, frankly, acknowledging at the moment it's not better. Well, I think he was right. We actually are better. And the trouble is, we're acting as though we can't win a competition with China, and therefore we have to try to cut them off at the knees.  </p><p>Final point, the Chinese have been stealing our intellectual property for how long? Decades? What intellectual property in China is worth stealing? Except in the military sphere-- </p><p>FREEMAN: Peking Duck </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>ROY: When you steal intellectual property, you haven't gone through the process of creating it. And we still are far better creators of intellectual property, and the Chinese steal it. But there's nothing there worth stealing, that they have done in terms of developing intellectual property, so far.  </p><p>So, we have enormous advantages in this area. And at the moment, we're acting as though the only way we can do it is to cut off Huawei at the knees. Huawei is good, not because of government subsidies. It's because it is out competed us internationally, in all of the third world markets of the world and in Europe. </p><p>And that's why it is a--a tough competitor. We do not have a company to compete with--with Huawei right now. And so, we're trying to cut them off at the knees. It's not the way to win. </p><p>LITWAK: Question in the back. </p><p>QUESTION: Before--hi? Before, I asked a question in regards of the function of diplomacy. Today, I would like to say thank you to Ambassador Lord, especially after 33 years. In the month of August in 1986, you and Betty kindly received me as a residence with the D.C. Youth Orchestra in Beijing. Don't you remember?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LORD: Yes. I certainly do. </p><p>QUESTION: It was a passage of 33 years. I took the D.C. Youth Orchestra with 100 members--over 100 members performed in Qingdao. You attend our first concert, you received me at the backstage and arranged the orchestra to visit your residence after our performance in Beijing. So-- </p><p>LORD: Thank you. I remember that. </p><p>QUESTION: It was a tremendous experience to the kids from D.C. My question is, diplomacy could be going in different channels that affect multi generations from time to time. So, I heard about the function of diplomacy today, at the new cold war. </p><p>I would like to hear comments from the panelists, in regards of what can we do in the coming days, for the young people, how to deal with the current barrier, in regard of the new cold war limitations. Thank you. </p><p>FREEMAN: I guess my answer would revert to the earlier question, sir. What we are in, is a competition to demonstrate which government, ours or theirs. Which system if you will, can deliver more domestic tranquility and prosperity, to those it governs. And that is as simple as it is. </p><p>And it reinforces the point that to win that kind of competition one has to excel, and others have to see you as worth emulating.  </p><p>LORD: Quick comment. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Oh, please. Yeah. </p><p>LORD: I don't buy the assumption we're in a Cold War yet. We're in danger of sliding toward that. So, let's not make that inevitable, even as we push back. As I've suggested, we don't have to go into a Cold War. If you're touching on the question of exchanges, I'm not sure whether that was part of the question.  </p><p>Here, as I would argue on Huawei, we need a sophisticated select approach. I do think though probably--I'm not privy to the technology or classifications on the technology front, in terms of Huawei. But it does seem to be some security considerations, but we shouldn't have a need ax approach to Huawei.  </p><p>The same with Chinese students inside. That's the worst thing we can do, is to cut off the flow of they're coming here. It's in our self-interest Not to mention buffer of stability in our bilateral relationship. So, it's essential. But here there are some legitimate concerns about what some of the Chinese are doing on our soil.  </p><p>Now, again, let's separate Chinese, from Communist Chinese. So, I just want to make the point we--we want to keep the doors open. But there are some reasons for concern, and we've touched on them before.  </p><p>FREEMAN: I don't agree with Stape that, there's nothing, no intellectual property worth stealing--stealing in China. I do business there and they are becoming very, very innovative. And it--it's a matter of distress to me, that we do not have our own--the scientific intelligence component collecting information on innovation, outside our own country. I think that is too bad. But I want to make one point about--further point about competition. </p><p>China's now graduating almost 2 million STEM workers every year. We're doing 625,000. China has-- </p><p>ROY: Half of whom are Asian. </p><p>FREEMAN: Exactly. Well, depends on the function. If--if it's computer science, it's about half. If it's artificial intelligence, it's almost two thirds. So, but the--but the big point is, one fourth of the world's STEM workers are now in China, and they're just beginning their careers.  </p><p>And if you don't think that's going to produce something with all the money the Chinese are spending on advancing scientific research, you're living in a different universe than the one that I inhabit, which is the world of private business. </p><p>HEWITT: I think we're going to take one more question, Mr. McFarlane. The--the microphone is right there. </p><p>QUESTION: Thanks very much, to each of you for a superb analysis of what--where we are and what we must do to maintain stability in the years ahead. I may ask you to drill down a little bit and talk for a moment about the role of energy, primarily from China's point of view. </p><p>Historically in modern times, they've been at a disadvantage. Having only coal, a modern industrial society or transportation, China seems to have reckoned with that quite well, and moving toward electricity; both to drive, what has here to for been driven by oil. And that is automobiles. They make 30 million of them roughly every year. </p><p>So, they're solving that problem, that challenge. And they're going to maintain a big piece of that market, I think. They were in a nuclear power and civil power production, very aggressively and successfully.  </p><p>It is a source for many in our country, of concern, that China building nuclear power plants and offering to build them in emerging markets, on terms that are quite generous, enables them to establish a--tell it what it is, strategic position, political influence, and each host country as they come in, and build nuclear power plants or scale.  </p><p>Well, it doesn't have to lead to their dominance of each new emerging market. Although being able to turn the lights off, really is a fairly driving political power. What do you think is China's motive, in what appears to be a quite aggressive move into developing countries, Africa, Latin America? Where civil nuclear power--is it more political influence?  </p><p>Is it simply to enable them to have leverage to be able to practice traditional mercantilist gain in other sectors, whether it's Congo and cobalt or whatever? How do you see China's energy strategy going forward?  </p><p>FREEMAN: Do you want to say something? I'm--but a very good question but require a lot of time to answer it. For the Chinese natural resources, generally, energy being among those, are a major challenge. </p><p>They will eventually employ fracking, for example, to greatly increase their production of oil and gas. But they are--the--they have more resources than we do, in North America as a hole in that area. But those resources are in geologically complex formations, quite a bit deeper than they are in Texas and Pennsylvania. </p><p>There is no infrastructure from the past, to repurpose rights of way pipelines and the like in those areas. And finally, there is very often no water. One of the things I'm trying to do, and I don't want to get into commercial interests, but part of a group that has a process that makes concrete out of CO2, carbon dioxide, rather than water.  </p><p>It's faster, more efficient, cheaper and stronger concrete. And I'm trying to get it into China, because 28 percent of China's greenhouse gas emissions are from the manufacture of cement. In four years, we think we could cut that in half. This process retrofits.  </p><p>So, I'm very familiar with the Chinese being their own worst enemy. They have a ferociously competitive set of companies, bureaucracies. And in my opinion, we--you use the word strategy. Very often they don't have a strategy. What they do is they announce some broad objective and offer support for it. And then they let everybody that's done, put it, you know, across the river by feeling the stones. </p><p>This is the case with the BRI. There's no real strategy there. It serves strategic interest to be sure. But the specific projects are not controlled by any central authority. They're worked out directly between the--the cooperating parties.  </p><p>We have a great deal to learn from the Chinese. This is an example of innovation. They are far--they are--have a great lead in the long-distance transmission of electric power. Their systems are better than anyone else's in the world. They are now the leaders in renewables. </p><p>And well, they are not yet the leaders in nuclear, as you suggest they--they're making a lot of progress with some of their own systems, as well as those that they brought in from abroad. I--I think the answer to your question about what they're up to with exporting nuclear power plants, is a combination of all of the factors you mentioned. But with the addition of one other.  </p><p>And that is, as Adolf Barrel showed in the 1930s, what drives corporations is not the shareholders or the owners, it's the Management Committee. And Chinese state-owned enterprises, are every bit as focused on the bottom line, even if many of them are less efficient than the private sector, as everyone else.  </p><p>My experience with them, doing business with them, is that they are very much like private corporation--privately owned corporations in the United States. Well, some question is Lockheed Martin a private co--corporation? All of its money comes from the government. </p><p>Anyway, they are just as focused on keeping their distance from government minders, evading taxes if they can, and making big profits. Partly for the prestige and partly for the rake-off's that this generates for management. Because China does have a corruption problem.  </p><p>So, I think they're all of those factors; influence, prestige, market development, leverage, maybe, and profit, all combined. Very familiar story from anybody who's looked at the American oil industry and its entry into the Middle East. </p><p>ROY: Let me just add a word or two. But--but energy has been a crisis for China, for decades now. So that they have had to address the fact, that over a third of their energy requirements are imported now. So, they have done everything with developing long range gas pipelines from Central Asia, all the way to Shanghai. </p><p>If China now has a network of high-speed highways, that they've completely lacked 15 years ago. If China reaches the level automobile penetration that we have here in the United States, their daily consumption will be all of the available petroleum in the world. In terms of what's consumed now.  </p><p>So, in other words, there's a crunch coming down the way. And as a result, the Chinese are putting a lot of effort into electric vehicles. But electric vehicles require electricity, of course, to charge them and therefore, they have a problem. They're rich in coal. But the coal has polluted their atmosphere to the point where Chinese no longer are willing to live in the polluted cities. </p><p>So, that they've had this try to decrease the coal and as Chas mentions, they've moved into renewables, in a big way. But there are limits there. Chas mentioned frank--fracking. The problem is, fracking requires a lot of water, and the water crisis-- </p><p>FREEMAN: Or CO2. It can be done with CO2. </p><p>ROY: Well, if--if--if--if--if they could develop it, then they could do it with CO2, God bless them. But they--they have areas for fracking, but the problem is the water supply, they don't have.  </p><p>So that this is an area, quite frankly, where there will be both competitive factors, but also areas for cooperation between China and the United States. But from their standpoint, we are going to get lazy, because fracking has all of a sudden made us energy independent.  </p><p>And so, we're not going to do the things that we should be doing. China is being forced to do the things that they need to do it, because the crisis is everyday getting bigger. </p><p>FREEMAN: When--when they--when they-- </p><p>QUESTION: One point, in the next 30 years, there'll be about 4 billion people in addition, on the planet, who have never had electricity. When you pencil it out, it's an enormous amount, trillions of dollars, and somebody's going to provide that. </p><p>FREEMAN: And a large part of--part of the population increases in Africa. </p><p>QUESTION: Yes. Well, today many analysts would say that China is going to dominate-- </p><p>LITWAK: Need a microphone. </p><p>QUESTION: --providing electricity. They're good at it. They already have a large number of nuclear power plants in their own country. We haven't built one in 30 years. And have no real prospect of doing it.  </p><p>So, my point is this simply, that I think they're going to go very, very heavily into nuclear power, civil nuclear power, and capture that giant market. 4 billion of the 10 billion people there will be on the earth in about 30 years, will be getting their electricity, their lights and all of the other beneficiaries of nuclear power; automobiles, primarily as you described that sta--Stape. </p><p>They're onto something and it makes great sense. But it's going to shift political patrol as controlled, as well as they penetrate these markets. </p><p>FREEMAN: had wanted to add a footnote to Stape's comments. The only country that responded to our call for ships to join us in protecting tankers in the Persian Gulf, after the attacks on a Norwegian and a Japanese freighter, apparently by Iran, those are allies of the United States.  </p><p>And after the uptake in Khurais oilfield were attacked, was China. It wasn't--it was a tentative offer, if it was an offer at all. Of course, in the current atmosphere in Washington, they've got no response at all.  </p><p>Point I'm making is Stapes correct. Of the drive--the drive on the part of the Chinese to address their vulnerability in energy, is going to have geopolitical consequences. And we're either going to work with the Chinese, or we're going to find them doing things that we don't like.  </p><p>LITWAK: Well, we've had a rich full day of discussion on the U.S.-China relationship. Speaking for the Wilson Center, it's been a pleasure partnering with the Nixon foundation on this Hugh Hewitt. Hugh, over to you for a final word. </p><p>HEWITT: Just thanks to the three gentlemen, and to everyone who has been here either remotely via our live cast, or here in the auditorium. Nixon foundation and Wilson Center, hopes we can do this again. Thank you for being here today. Help me join the panel in thanking them. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB9-DP61-F15W-H020-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

And I want to thank my colleagues here at the Wilson Center, Robert Daly and the Kissinger Institute and Shakogoto (PH) and the Asia Program for being such generous and co-organizers and co-sponsors for a second year of our annual Asia Program Conference at FPRI. </p><p>Recently developments around the world, Scotland's referendum on independence from the United Kingdom, the rise of ISIS as a brutal entity exercising state like power over large loss of territory, Russia's annexation of Crimea, and the re-eruption of conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territories, have raised new doubts about the state of the state. </p><p>These have not been so prominent in East Asia, but those problems, those issues do exist in this region as well. Some of the issues that we'll be talking about today involve subnational entities, those with special international status or transnational ties, or those that have aspirations to such status, and maybe even established states that seek to demote their rivals from full state or state-like status. </p><p>These issues include Beijing's decision about the chief executive election in Hong Kong and what that tells us about the broader political development there. Concerns in Okinawa which remain a focus of long running controversies including disputes over the U.S. Military presence, and long simmering nationalist and ethnic sentiments. </p><p>In Xinjiang, where ethnic and religious unrest have been rising, prompting Chinese authorities to a certain links to international terrorism, and to move forward with a quite strict anti-terrorism law nationally, and the interesting historical controversy over the defunct kingdom--. </p><p>DALY: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Wilson Center. Welcome to those of you who are here with us in the auditorium and also those who are watching online and via a live Facebook feed. </p><p>We are talking this morning about China and global 5G, although our topic is really a little bit broader than that. And the subtitle is trying to get the questions right, trying to frame the issues that you have been reading about probably every morning, which seem to be unfolding at a dizzying rate, trying the get the questions right about what is technology based, what is national security based, what is economic.  </p><p>Over the past three--over the past five years, really, there have been three major changes in U.S. China relations all related. The first, is that a relationship that has always been both competitive and cooperative is now characterized more by contention, by adversity, than by engagement. There has been a fundamental shift to a more competitive or more contentious relationship.  </p><p>The second major change, I would argue, is that this is now a worldwide competition. This is not just Beijing to Washington. The competition is playing out globally as these two nations compete to play leading roles in shaping security architectures, trading and financial regimes, norms and practices and value systems. </p><p>And then, third large change is that these nations are also competing to play a leading role in the development sale installation and regulation of new technologies. Much as Beijing and Washington disagree, one of the issues that both sides now seem to agree on is the innovation, mastery and leadership of 5G systems, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics, merging biotechnologies. </p><p>The mastery of technology henceforth, is going to be the key to hard power, military power, economic power, soft power and global leadership. Beijing and Washington seem to agree on this. Already, this focus on innovation has caused major difficulties for Academia.  </p><p>We spent a lot of time on this at the Kissinger Institute trying to help American universities, colleges, and the national institutions that manage them understand how they can remain free and open universities while responding to very real threats from Beijing and security concerns from Washington. </p><p>So, its interest--it's of interest to academics, but it's much bigger than that. I think what we see again, if you're watching the daily flow of news, is that our technophilia and our technophobia are merging with our Sinophilia and Sinophobia and to become a way of asking about our own national well-being and our place in the world. </p><p>This tech challenge from China is causing us to rethink some of our economic models, our defense models and our modes of governance. And this is true, not only in the United States, but in many leading industrialized nations.  </p><p>And a piece yesterday in the Financial Times called, China Gains the Upper Hand Over Germany, the Author, Wolfgang Munchau, I apologize for slaughtering the pronunciation of his last name, put it like this. He said this is a fundamental, European problem. </p><p>Unlike in China, macroeconomic policy, industrial policy and foreign and security policy in Europe are run independently of each other. The Huawei 5G bid, shows that the EU is not well prepared to deal with a connection between security and industrial policy, nor have the Europeans paid much attention the impact of their fiscal rules, not least on defense and security policies. </p><p>China, by contrast, has an integrated approach to economic and foreign policy. And so, this is a new issue. It's--it touches on many aspects of our national well-being, and therefore, it's not surprising that we have been over reacting in some cases and have had difficulty framing these issues poorly. </p><p>As we said in our advertisement for this event today, there are at least three different levels that we see in our concern about 5G and Chinese technology generally. This tends to focus around questions of Huawei right now, but it's broader than Huawei. </p><p>One is the-- specific concern about espionage, about back doors and other means of spying through installed Chinese technologies, and also the vulnerability that the use of Chinese components may cause for various aspects of our national infrastructure.  </p><p>So, there's a discrete espionage in security issue. Then there's the level of commercial competition. And you will often read in the same article, the same paragraph, that this is about keeping our national champions and our own companies at the lead of these new technologies, our need, our desire to dominate these technologies and retain our preeminence also plays into the reception of Chinese components, Chinese technologies. </p><p>And there's a claim, sometimes implicit sometimes explicit, that even if China's methods of competition were licit, and they played by fair rules, and there are many cases in which they seem not to, even if they were, that China's ambitions to technological greatness are somehow illegitimate or a de facto threat, even if the-- rules of the road were observed. </p><p>And then there's also the level at which the technological competition becomes the key to a competition for global preeminence. So, obviously, there's a lot of overlap between these three kinds of concerns. But the categories are often confused in our public discourse.  </p><p>And it often reads as though the installation of Chinese made 5G routers and servers may be a key factor, not just in competition between global tech firms, but it often reads like a key factor in the historic struggle between good and evil. Some of this boils down to a who do you like? Who do you trust? America or China going forward. </p><p>So, today we're going to try to work out where we are. And we are delighted to have three leading experts of different aspects of these questions. We will hear first from Naomi Wilson, who is the Senior Director of Policy for Asia at the Information Technology Industry Council or ITI, where she focus on law enforcement and homeland security, cyber security especially with relation to China and Asia. </p><p>Before joining ITI, she was at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, where she was most recently the acting Director for Asia Pacific, where she played a leading role in cyber security, law enforcement and customs cooperation issues as a Senior Advisor to then Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson. </p><p>She also led the development and implementation of policy initiatives at the Department of Homeland Security for its engagement with China in the area of cybercrime and related issues and also worked on the U.S. China high level dialogue on cybercrime. </p><p>Prior to that, she was on the staff of the Senate Committee of Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. And like all of our speakers today, is a Mandarin speaker, a Mandarin expert. Yeah, so that--that's sort of a key criteria for taking the stage today. </p><p>She'll be followed by Jimmy Goodrich to my left, who is the Vice President for Global Policy of the Semiconductor Industry Association. In that capacity, he works closely with all of the member companies, the administration here at the White House, Congress, domestic and international stakeholders, and also foreign government officials to try to advance the Semiconductor Industry Association's international policy agenda. </p><p>He is also an executive committee member of the United States Information Technology Office, where he represents the SIA. Jimmy has over a decade of experience working with Chinese and global stakeholders on tech issues and also served recently as the Director of Global Policy at ITI, where he worked on China, Asia Pacific Tech Policy issues related to cyber security trade and internet governance. Prior to that, he also worked on government affairs, Greater China government affairs for Cisco Systems.  </p><p>Jimmy will then be followed by Dennis Wilder, who is, I think, probably known to most of you, he is assistant professor of the practice in Asia's--in Asian studies at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, and also serves as managing director of Georgetown's Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues. </p><p>Before coming to Georgetown, he served as the National Security Council's Director for China 2004 to 2005, and then as the NSC Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for East Asian Affairs for '05 to '09, which took him to Asia many times including for the Beijing Olympics in 2008. </p><p>WILDER: Absolutely. </p><p>DALY: You had a seat in the stands. </p><p>WILDER: I did. </p><p>DALY: Very good. </p><p>WILDER: I got to see Mr. Phelps do his thing in the great bubble there. </p><p>DALY: Aahh. </p><p>WILDER: And it was tremendous. And, of course, the American dream team of basketball. </p><p>DALY: Which was the opening game. </p><p>WILDER: Which was the opening game and I must say, the Chinese audience cheered just as loudly for the American team as they did for the Chinese team that night. </p><p>DALY: From '09 to 2015, Dennis served as senior editor of the President's Daily Brief. This is the worldwide intelligence update which is produced under the Director of National Intelligence, which begins the day in the White House. </p><p>WILDER: It used to. </p><p>DALY: Well, we talked about that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>We're not going to go into that today. From 2015 to 2016, he was the CIA's Deputy Assistant Director for East Asia and the Pacific. So, a great lineup today, again, thanks to all of you for coming. And I would like, in particular, to thank my colleague, Ray Joan (PH) at the Kissinger Institute who leads for us on following all things tech. It was a key driver in putting this together today. So, thanks to you, Ray. So, again, let's start with Naomi, and then we'll go to Jimmy and Dennis. Thank you. </p><p>WILSON: Sure. Well, thank you very much for having me this morning. It's great to see all of you and your interest in China and U.S. tech issues. So, I'll start off by saying, Robert, thank you for holding this event, in particular, your framing of the need to get the questions right, is especially important because we're in an environment with a lot of assumptions, a lot of assertions, and a lot of conflation where facts are--are not necessarily relied upon in the way that I think we would like to see them. </p><p>So, essentially, you can't understand the problem until you understand what question you're trying to solve for. So, discussions like this are extremely helpful. There's a definite need to have informed discussions to talk about threats and risks and what they mean in the context of the U.S. and China and tech and how and whether threats can be mitigated. </p><p>Just to say, it's China, therefore, it's a threat, is not sufficient in a global economy. And it's not instructive as we look to see how the U.S. can advance in technological innovations and compete with China going forward. </p><p>So, at ITI, which is my association, we pride ourselves on working with the public sector to develop fact-based and rigorous analysis of problems and assessments and try to find out what is the right policy solution going forward. </p><p>So, in my opening remarks today, I'd like to outline a few things. First, is how the U.S. government and industry view challenges with respect to China and tech. And I'll be pulling a little bit from my background at DHS as well as my current position at ITI working with tech companies. </p><p>I'll also speak a bit to how the U.S. government perspective has evolved over the past few years and into the current administration and the need for public and private sector partnership in order to identify these questions and work together to resolve them. </p><p>So, with that, with respect to the U.S. government and industry concerns, I would say that they are similar, yet, there are differences in tactics and approach. And obviously, for the U.S. government, in particular, there is a heavy emphasis on what constitutes a national security threat.  </p><p>I will say that I feel very fortunate in the private sector that the tech industry has such a good relationship with the U.S. government especially with issues that are of greatest concern regarding China's tech policies. The U.S. government has been great at listening to industry input and concerns in terms of understanding the dynamics of that market. </p><p>So, industry concerns should come as no real surprise. These are long standing concerns involving market access, foreign companies' inability to obtain licenses and compete on equal footing with Chinese companies, data localization requirements, force partnerships with Chinese companies and security review regimes that are ambiguous to say the least. </p><p>DALY: To add to localization requirements break that down a little bit? </p><p>WILSON: Oh, sure, that would be fine. I did not use an acronym though. Do I get points for that? So, data localization is an issue that we see, not only in China, but around the world. Tech companies, and not only tech companies, any modern day multi-national company relies on the flow of data across borders for purposes of serving their customers. </p><p>And it's not only customer data, but it's also cyber security data, for example--example, sharing vulnerabilities to determine whether certain systems are affected and how to patch those vulnerabilities. </p><p>So, that instantaneous real-time flow of information is essential to doing business and to maintaining network security. China and other countries have taken to instituting, or at least drafting policies that require data to be maintained in country. </p><p>So, companies are required to build servers that house the data in country, the idea being that if it's closer than law enforcement, government has greater access to it or easier access where they can control it to a better degree. Those are all false assumptions, but that's another conversation. So, I'll stop there on data localization. </p><p>So, in terms of the U.S. government concerns, currently we see an array of concerns. And I think this is emblematic of policy makers and U.S. citizens trying to come to terms with the competitive and cooperative dynamics between the U.S. and China. And to what extent economic security also effects national security. </p><p>So, we've seen a lot of blurred lines between these two elements that used to be dealt with pretty distinctly. And I want to make clear also that when we--when we talk about security and especially national security, I know that often there's a number of characterizations in the media of big tech companies and putting the profit first. </p><p>I want to make clear that tech companies take national security and security of systems in general extremely seriously. It is part of their livelihood. It is what they stake their name on and their consumers trust in them on. So, it's really not an either-or situation from a tech company perspective. And I want to make that clear. </p><p>In terms of what we hear most often from the U.S. government regarding their concerns, it's a mix of economic and security. A lot of them mirror our own concerns along the lines of market access and unfair Chinese tech and trade policies. And these are being dealt with currently in the context of the 301 investigation, which is led by USTR and the ongoing trade talks. </p><p>We also see concerns with respect to the economic impact of IP theft as well as what it means to have an unfair technological advantage and what risk that poses in the future. Chinese investment in the U.S. is another security concern that the U.S. government has worked on over the past year. </p><p>We've seen the reform of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. or CFIUS, which was reformed via legislation last year as well as attention to export control laws which control the export of potentially sensitive technology for national security purposes. And commerce is working on implementing an updated process of that right now. </p><p>Then we see the various supply chain concerns. And this varies from respect to specific companies or the desire to move supply chains back to the U.S. And we see it seems like on a weekly basis, new bills coming out of the Hill that have this--this focus on what does the supply chain mean to security and to American economic status generally. </p><p>And finally, there's the big question of technological competitiveness and is China winning in the race for AI and 5G? So, as the U.S. government is trying to deal with all of these things, and as the private sector is trying to keep up with their efforts to deal with all of these various policies and inform that process.  </p><p>I think it's also important to take a step back and to look at the evolution of the current USG concerns. So, over the past decade, the U.S. government has become--become somewhat used to China gaming the system and playing by its own rules.  </p><p>There had been a general thought that bringing China into the fold, into the international system would help normalize Chinese practices over time. And this has worked in some respects and not others. I think we've seen pretty dramatic changes outside of the realm of--of tech in China's approach to climate change. </p><p>But with respect to their alignment with the WTO, not so much. So, there is a general acceptance, as you mentioned, Robert, in your opening remarks of the competitive and cooperative relationship between the U.S. and China. And I think that is still true and that needs to be constantly reinforced because China's not going anywhere and we're not going anywhere. And our relationships are so intertwined that it behooves us to make sure that that relationship functions. </p><p>So, in the current administration, I've seen the U.S. become increasingly fed up with China's behavior and beginning to respond in a more assertive way. And this--this goes back to the previous administration.  </p><p>There was definitely a shift towards the end of the Obama Administration of being more assertive, tolerating more friction in the relationship and excepting that China might be embarrassed by certain things, and react. </p><p>So, we might no longer have a cyber dialogue between the two countries. And so, China responded to a number of U.S. actions including indictments of Chinese PLA hackers, public--increasing public criticism of China's theft of IP via cyber hacking including right up to the runup of President Xi's 2015 state visit with President Obama and sanctioning Chinese companies for violations of U.S. export controls. </p><p>So, in the current administration, and in Congress, there's increasingly heightened concerns and tech seems to be more and more at the center. There's even less tolerance for Chinese behavior and empty commitments. And I think there's a lot of validity to that sentiment.  </p><p>So, right now, we see the administration and, in particular, USTR Ambassador Lighthizer, coming down harder on China's unfair trade practices. We see new supply chain policies and legislation, many of which have named specific companies and intend to ban those companies, export control reform. </p><p>And this is all led to increasing--an increasing and I think, troubling drive to wall off U.S. tech in order to safeguard it and to protect our crown jewels that may be used for national security purposes and or for competitive advantage. </p><p>And there's been a lot of talk of bringing the supply chains back to the U.S. Can't you just get out of China? Why don't you make things in the U.S.? It would be so much better for the U.S. economy. Never mind that we're in a global economy with intertwined supply chains, and restricting exports of our valued technology. </p><p>So, policy makers are asking a lot of big, complex questions that will have significant ripple effects for the tech sector for the economy and for U.S. technological competitiveness. And I think now is a really important time to step back and unpack those questions and unpack the assumptions that are leading to those questions and the potential policy solutions on the table. </p><p>And this is where the private and public sector partnership is essential. And I'll take an example of cyber security so that--to be clear. So, with respect to cyber security, the U.S. government is not on private sector networks. So, they rely on the private sector to tell them what is going on, especially with respect to hacking for economic purposes. </p><p>The U.S. government certainly has its own tools, and insights, in terms of general espionage practices, but they don't have the whole picture and neither does the tech sector and the companies. So, in order to understand the problem and ask ourselves the right questions, we really need that full picture. </p><p>So, it's essential that the private sector and the public sector collaborate, compare notes and come up with the right solutions. And we can start by acknowledging that there are security concerns. There are risks. But we have to insist that any concern be dealt with in an evidence based and rigorous process-oriented approach. </p><p>So, from my perspective, we look at what is the risk? Can the risk be mitigated? What are the current tools available? And how do we scope the tools or create new tools to avoid unintended or adverse consequences?  </p><p>And speaking for ITI, we have worked extensively with Congress and the U.S. government in terms of CFIUS reform as well as export controls reform, hoping to shed some light on how to scope these important policies that are clearly geared towards a national security need appropriately, in a way that we are not jeopardizing our own innovation and technological progress going forward. I will stop there. </p><p>DALY: Thank you, Naomi. Jimmy. </p><p>GOODRICH: Sure, thanks. Naomi, I think, framed it really well in thinking about the broad picture between balancing security and economics. And my role at the Semiconductor Industry Association, I've been thinking about the U.S.-China technology competition from the dynamic of commercial competitiveness. </p><p>And I want to talk a little bit about what exactly is 5G? What are the technologies of the future? What does it mean for the U.S.? And what's China doing about them? So, we have a factual, sort of, landscape of what's at stake? What's the economic cost and incentive forward looking at these issues? </p><p>And I think we're--we're pretty well positioned to have a good outlook into this for the Semiconductor Industry at roughly about a third of everything we sell goes into a communications device. So, U.S. chip makers from Intel all the way down to companies in North Carolina and Boston are making all of the components that go into 5G and communications systems.  </p><p>So, you literally can't pass a signal through any 5G or 4G device without a U.S. chip maker. And that's, I think, also a little understood fact that the U.S. still is competitive. We haven't lost the race in many areas. And there's reasons why. And--and there are areas though, where China is making significant end roads. They are becoming successful. And there's for a mix of reasons, both state-led policy wise or simple facts regarding the size of China's economy and the level of innovation that's happening there. </p><p>And so, it's really important to isolate exactly what we're talking about. What is the technology? Where is it being deployed? And specifically, within that, because these are globalized eco systems, where do the U.S. and China? It's not just a U.S. China question either. Where does Korea, Japan, Europe, Canada, where do they play in the global eco system, because whether it's 5G, whether it's AI, whether it's semiconductors, there really is no single company or country that can dominate the full stack of the technology and the applications. </p><p>And in order to make the pie big for everybody, it has to take the world working in concert to move forward and deploy these technologies together. Specifically, thinking about 5G, which is really the hot topic that everyone's been hearing about. We just had the mobile world Congresses, the Annual Telecom Gathering Summit in Barcelona last week, all sorts of headlines about what the technology's going to bring and also around concerns raised by the U.S. government and others regarding security. </p><p>I think, you know, it's important to realize that whenever we look at the security concerns, the economic potential on the commercial side of it is tremendous. And you're talking about the fifth generation of mobile networks that's going to bring upwards of 2,500 times X in terms of download speeds. </p><p>You'll be able to download a movie roughly in ten seconds compared to about five, 10 minutes in what you do today. So, that's really the first evolution of 5G. And that's really about making the consumer experience faster whether it's downloads or watching videos.  </p><p>But 5G is going to be transformational because it's going to bring huge technological benefits to industries that use 5G. And this is really a game changer because in previous iterations of 3 and 4G it was really about making the handset or the phone experience faster, better.  </p><p>And in 5G, because you're bringing something called low latency, meaning that it's basic real time from the time the data is transmitted to the time you receive it, and also massive machine to machine communications. So, you're getting all these IOT sensors hooked up to each other. And that's really what 5G is about. </p><p>And so, that's going to transform, if you think about it, agriculture. It's going to transform healthcare, businesses, industries. And so, because of this transformational capability of 5G, I think that's really what's brought policy makers attention to this iteration of the--of the communications standard than previous standards because frankly, let's, you know, realize that, you know, telecommunications networks have never had this level of tension than they've had before. </p><p>And that's because it's so transformational. And so, let alone, for the U.S. chip industry, this is a huge opportunity for us. It's an opportunity for the United States as well. I think there's a study by IHS that says by 2035, roughly 1.3 trillion in value will be created by 5G just for the United States alone.  </p><p>And the 5G economy will be the size of the GDP of the state of Pennsylvania. So, we're talking about huge implications for the United States economically, as well. And--and those have to be weighed against all the different security considerations, political consideration that governments have worldwide because first and foremost, this is about delivering greater access, greater services to citizens worldwide so they can participate in the new economy. </p><p>And China is, you know, at the fore front in thinking about how this is a strategic technology for their country. And this is because the government has recognized for more than a decade that they need to have skin in the game when it comes to telecommunications networks.  </p><p>Looking back to the '90s and early 2000s, virtually everything that China run and operated in terms of their telecom network was imported. Now, today, Chinese vendors have about 80 percent of the domestic market share and foreign vendors have 20 percent. About 10 years ago, it was the opposite.  </p><p>So, a lot has happened in 10 years. And Chinese companies have closed the gap technologically and from a market share perspective. And today in the worldwide telecom market, you really have only five or six big key vendors, of which, two are Chinese. So, and I think-- </p><p>DALY: --None of which are American? </p><p>GOODRICH: In the radio network, so, if you think about 5G as a big ecosystem. And you have the core networks that transmit the data and process it inside the telecommunications service providers network, you have the wireless base stations that transmit the signals, then you have the cell phones and your IOT devices that help you interact-- </p><p>DALY: --IOT is Internet of Things. </p><p>GOODRICH: Internet of Things. I--I lose points for an acronym. And then--and then beyond that, you have all the components and chip vendors and to say that, you know, China is dominating the 5G, that statement is actually incorrect. Just, for example, looking at chip sets for--for one pointed example, the U.S. has about half the entire worldwide market, and for 5G communications it's more than that. </p><p>And--and the other half, frankly, are mostly not--are non-Chinese companies, South Korea and Taiwanese and others. So, there's many areas where China's been very good at--at innovating and there's other areas that are still very weak even in the 5G eco system. </p><p>And I think there's--we cannot deny for one logical reason is that the size of China's economy has driven a lot of the scale that has made Chinese companies successful. And then the second factor, of course, is that the role of the government is far more outsized than it is here in the United States and also, they're just keying on industrial planning.  </p><p>And that's something that's been historical about China and moving forward particularly under the current administration in China it seems to be strengthening and accelerating. And that brings both benefits and drawbacks for--for China's technological ecosystem.  </p><p>Just thinking about the size and scale. For China to have the world's largest fixed access network, broadband network, mobile network, internet users, number of internet transactions, nearly all the worlds cell phones, laptops, PCs, flat panel displays, they're all manufactured in China. </p><p>And so, the--China is central to this debate whether it's deployment, development, or the security issues. And they have a lot at stake. But, you know, I think we also have to recognize that China's Government has played a significant role. If you look back to 2G and 3G and 4G in China. </p><p>I lived in China through the 3 and 4G deployment, working closely with companies now known as Nortel and Motorola and others, you know, they faced a really tough challenge at the time because the government had very clear orders through their three-state owned carriers that they were going to buy domestic. And that's exactly what happened.    </p><p>And given the home court advantage that some of those large Chinese telecommunications companies had, that allowed them to build up scale and invest into R&amp;D and then also move--move into overseas markets in places like Southeast Asia, Philippines, Africa and compete usually on an underpricing strategy against global telecommunications vendors. </p><p>And that was about 10 years ago. And that's all history. It all happened. And since then, though, I think you see particularly in the telecommunication space, you know, U.S. and global companies are--are competitive today. If you look at, whether it's the patent or the IP landscape, but Chinese companies, particularly in this space have significantly closed the gap and have made a--the question of with or without China, almost impossible to answer because they're so central to both deployment and the development of the technology. </p><p>So, thinking about, you know, this--this competition or the development of this technology in the future, it has to be how--how do the U.S. and China figure out to compartmentalize and manage their security concerns and risks? And then how do they also figure out how to unleash the technology because both the United States and China both stand a benefit from whether it's 5G, AI or quantum competing being developed, from a commercial perspective and their industries stand to benefit. </p><p>And the more the governments think about regulating for security purposes, the less we're going to see those benefits given I think to consumers in either country. So, there's a lot at stake from a--from a commercial and technological perspective.  </p><p>And again, going back to Naomi's point, it's really important to think about what exactly are we talking about? What is the technology? Where are the linkages between the U.S. China and other countries? It's more than just the U.S., it's global. This is a global technology, global ecosystem. </p><p>And so, you know, no question on future technology that only can be answered with just the U.S. and China alone. So, I'll stop there. I want to save my remarks for the rest of the discussion. But just wanted to frame some of the baseline issues of what are we talking about from the technological perspective. What's the opportunity both from a commercial perspective? And then how do those influence governments perspectives on security? </p><p>And again, I think that's because these are truly transformational technologies. And more so than they were in the past. And so, we just have to live with the fact that governments are going to be paying attention. And how do we direct that attention into a positive channel? Thanks. </p><p>DALY: Thank you. We've focused so far on the technological and commercial sides. Maybe turn a little bit more to the security end of the equation now with Dennis. </p><p>WILDER: Great. First of all, let me commend Robert and the Wilson Center for putting this event together today. Given the turnout, it's obvious that it's an important issue that needs more discussion, although I would have liked to have seen how many of you showed up if we did have the snow storm today. </p><p>But you did get here. One of the wonderful things about my transition out of U.S. Government to the academic world, is I can now speak quite freely. So, let me be very clear that I speak for myself today, not the U.S. Government or Georgetown University. </p><p>I'm giving you my personal views today and some of them will be pretty candid. Let me start by reinforcing something that Jimmy and Naomi have said, and that is why are we sitting here today? We're sitting here today because we're dealing with a cutting-edge technology in 5G.  </p><p>The CEO of Cisco was on television yesterday and he said, in this particular case, the technology is living up to the hype. And I think from Jimmy's remarks about movie downloading and the rest of it, you can see that we are entering unknown territory. This is really a new, if you will, industrial revolution that we're on the verge of. </p><p>And so, with all this promise comes an unknown realm for national policy making. And national policy making, under the best of circumstances is difficult and tends to be behind the times. I think we can all agree in Washington to that. </p><p>But now we are in a phase where we're dealing with an unknown dimension, international actors and an atmosphere of distrust. That makes national policy making incredibly complicated on this issue. Now, let me say that having served in government for over three decades, I think we've, so far, understated the Xi change in American policy today. </p><p>And I want to really hit it harder. For the five, past five decades, since Kissinger went to China, the premise of American policy was that we could work with China, that we would be finding common ground. But I'm afraid, I have to say that Americans in this town, maybe not all over the United States, are now seeing President Xi, as more like Mao than like Deng Xiaoping. </p><p>We were more comfortable with Deng Xiaoping than Mao, let's face it. And we thought that Deng was bringing China closer to being more like us than less like us, whereas we now see President Xi taking steps that seem to be accentuating the differences between our two cultures and societies.  </p><p>This reassessment has been building for some time. This is not the Trump Administration. This is across the political spectrum of the United States. And one of the things that we saw, and Naomi referred to it, but I want to hit a little harder again, is that China is not playing as much by the international bill order of rules as we expected. </p><p>So, in the cyber realm, we saw the PLA and the ministry of state security becoming much bolder in their commercial cyber espionage. PLA unit 61398 in Shanghai has been labeled the APT1. It's notorious, hundreds--dozens if not hundreds of human actors involved in that PLA organization who have attacked 141 different organizations around the world. </p><p>Hackers associated with the Tianjin bureau of the Ministry of State Security labeled APT10. Similarly indicted by the Trump Administration in December of 2018 for hacking manage service providers by uploading malicious software to gain access in the economic intelligence for--from at least 12 countries and the personnel data of a hundred thousand U.S. Naval personnel. </p><p>This is not a secret. This is in the indictment, okay. These are not rouge actors. These are professionals. How do we know they're professionals? Because they do their work during office hours in China. That's how you know they're professionals. It's not that hard to figure out, okay. </p><p>Now, why does the Chinese government allow such activity? Well, simply put, there are a different set of standards. In all my years in U.S. Intelligence, and I am being absolutely truthful here, I never once handed information to an American company or considered handing information to an American firm for economic competitive reasons. </p><p>Why? There is no U.S. law that allows me to do that. Robert Gates, who was the Director of Central Intelligence and Secretary of Defense said in an interview two years ago, that he actually contemplated this. That he went to officials in the administration while he was Director of Central Intelligence and asked if he could start helping American companies. And the answer was not only no, but hell, no. We're not doing this. And we don't do this. </p><p>James Clapper, a couple years ago, said, it is not a secret that the Intelligence community collects information about economic and financial matters. What we do not, as we have said many times do is use our foreign intelligence capability to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line. </p><p>Frankly, one of the problems is, who would you hand it to? Do you hand it to Google? Do you hand it to Intel? Do you hand it to Apple? How do you decide who you give this competitive edge to? And believe me, the moment you handed it to one of them, you're going to get a lawsuit in an American court as fast as possible by the others. </p><p>So, it's not feasible. And we don't do it. That's not to say that some of our allies, by the way, don't do it. Robert Gates said that about 12 to 20 countries around the world do, do economic espionage for the benefit of their corporations. </p><p>So, I think that we--we have to understand that there is reason for the American government concern because of these aggressive behavior in the cyber espionage area. It's not a figment of our imagination. However, the question that Robert has posed today, is a different one. And that is the U.S. claims ability to install equipment to spy or attack digital infrastructure.  </p><p>Now, personally, I've seen no credible reporting, to date, that any cyber-attacks against the United States were conducted by imbedded code in Chinese supplied hardware. If we look back, for example, at the largest data breach ever involving the United States where 2.1, 21.5 million Americans personal records were lost by OPM. I think the conclusion on that is there were contractors with Chinese passports involved in that project. It had nothing to do with the equipment itself. It had everything to do with insider threat. </p><p>And the U.S. government has come forward with no evidence on Huawei or any other firm cooperating with the Chinese government for intelligence purposes. When the Australian government decided to bullet ban Huawei, they said publicly, quote, \"The government considers that the involvement of vendors who are likely to be subject to extra judicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law, may risk failure by the carrier to adequately protect a 5G network.\" </p><p>They did not say that they had evidence. We've seen some uncorroborated reports in the French press, in the Australian press, and we had this case of a Bloomberg article in October of 2018, that suggested there was, actually, a microchip. That has been totally and completely discounted as fabrication, the company did an audit. The head of Apple has said this did not occur. So, that is not factual. Somebody made up a story and gave it to Bloomberg and, unless somebody in this room has some evidence to the contrary, that story should go away and never be talked about, again, because it's just not true, it's a--it's a hoax. </p><p>So, if we have no clear evidence of Huawei's involvement in malicious Chinese government cyber-attacks, why call for the bans? Simply put, it's because it's not difficult to see how Beijing could use Huawei. You've already heard about the various Chinese laws that require Chinese firms to cooperate with the Chinese government. And I find the claims by Huawei's lawyers that these laws don't apply to them to be dubious, at best.  </p><p>Malicious codes and back doors into computer hardware is a real risk. Kill switches are, technically, a reality and would be a disaster if used suddenly, for example, to take down the entire traffic control city system of a city like London. </p><p>But the real question, here, comes down to the question of acceptable risk and mitigation. I've had the chance, and I'm sure Jimmy and Naomi have, too, to meet with officials of the U.K.'s national cyber security center. They make rather a persuasive argument that it's not about banning Huawei or ZTE, but rather hiving off those areas of the networks of greatest concern to national security and simply not using those products from China and those systems. </p><p>They left me with the impression that diversification of supplies and due diligence in testing and monitoring of installed equipment are the keys to making it more difficult for any supplier to act maliciously. </p><p>I would have to say at this moment, without further evidence, I come down on the side of not banning China companies, except in those areas of highest national security concern. China would not rely on U.S. suppliers in its national security telecommunications network and we shouldn't do the same. But banning Chinese companies, entirely, does not put us on the road, puts us on the road, excuse me, to a digital cold war that I think would have enormous detrimental effects on both sides.  </p><p>That said, let me make a few recommendations for the Chinese government and the U.S. government, very briefly. First, China needs to drop this case against the two Canadians unless it offers explicit evidence of espionage. The fact that so many Chinese officials have said these arrests are linked, the Canadian detention of Ms. Meng is outrageous and counterproductive to Beijing's long-term goals. It merely reinforces the notion that the Chinese legal system is highly politicized. U.S. has put credible evidence of Ms. Meng's crimes before the Canadian courts. These two situations are not equivalent.  </p><p>Second, China needs to consider revising its cyber and intelligence laws to make clearer that there is a bright line between private firms and the Chinese government. There must be explicit legal procedures in place on how and when the Chinese government gains access to data and capabilities of these companies.  </p><p>Third, Huawei itself, and ZTE need to be much more transparent about their relationships to the Chinese government. It's simply not credible to those of us in the West when Huawei's Chairman claims that he would deny any Chinese government request to use his company for espionage. What legal grounds does he have for such a denial? Has he ever done that? How could this firm refuse, given the nature of monopolistic and unrestrained power of the Communist party? </p><p>Fourth, the Chinese government needs to clarify the role of the Communist party in relation to private companies. We have all read the party has insisted on a greater role, recently, in the management of private Chinese firms but what does that mean? What authorities does the party representative have within a firm like Huawei? And what is the real management structure?  </p><p>On the U.S. side, let me give one big suggestion. And that is we need to end our aversion to national industrial policies. There is a great irony in our concern over foreign involvement in 5G development, while being heavily dependent on foreign suppliers for parts of the 5G network. </p><p>As with so many areas of U.S. infrastructure, U.S. presidents, and the U.S. Congress have woefully, have been woefully negligent in not coming up with ways to address our infrastructure needs. I am a firm believer that the best way to compete with China is to get our own economic house in order. </p><p>In summary, policy makers in the U.S. and other countries have legitimate concerns over China's involvement in the evolving world of 5G. I do not believe this is a case, primarily, of the United States seeking commercial advantage. But I'm not naive on that point, either. And I think some would like to see the disengagement of the United States and China in the telecommunications area. </p><p>But I think that President Trump has made the right choice, to date, not to move precipitously to ban Huawei and ZTE from the U.S. marketplace. Such a decision, if ultimately made, needs to be based on sound evidence that the risk of Chinese involvement is too great and cannot be mitigated. Such a judgment needs to be made in consultation, not only with our companies, as Naomi suggested, but with our allies and, I suspect that many of these people in the private sector understand this issue better than many of those in the U.S. government. </p><p>I'll stop there. </p><p>DALY: Well, thank you, thanks to all three of you. That's a, I think a comprehensive look at the major issues. I wonder if I could start by asking each of you one quick question and then, we'll open it up. </p><p>First Naomi, and this sort of picks up on something that Dennis mentioned, ending the U.S. aversion to national industrial policy when you think about public, private cooperation. What forms might that take? There's still a strong impulse to leave it to the market in the United States, whereas in the rest of the world, I quoted this German writer at the beginning, these are macro-economic issues that need to be dealt with across government, across industry, the financial, commercial security sectors, probably, need to be coordinated, it would seem. </p><p>But somebody, it looks like an industrial policy. What do you see as prospects for that and what do you see as the major obstacles?  Then Jimmy, will just go, be sort of one, two, three, will go for sort of quick answers. </p><p>You said that this 80, 20, shift has happened over about ten years from America supplying 80 percent of the components within Chinese domestic IT systems to 20 percent. </p><p>GOODRICH: In telecommunications. </p><p>DALY: In telecommunications. So, if that continues, I mean, having watched China for a while, we tend to get it wrong. They tend to develop more quickly than we think. What if they get semiconductors? Is that game over because that seems to be a lot at the center of some of the policies that--that you're--you haven't been advocating polices. But the description you've given depends on American leadership in semiconductors.  </p><p>What are the prospects for that going away? China with its huge market, extensive investment in R&amp;D, its ability to scale up very rapidly, as well as, perhaps, to beg, borrow, or steal other technologies. Would your basic assessment change if they get semiconductors and what are the prospects for that? </p><p>Dennis, you did speak to this, but I'd like to come back to it because you know what a lot of the attitudes are now on the Hill and in Washington, more broadly. It's understood that China is seeking what it calls comprehensive national power. Which is their way of talking about some of the prestige that we enjoy, commercial security, soft power. And because of our concern for, about China's quest for comprehensive national power, there's a growing sense that anything, any developments that are to China's benefit are to our detriment. </p><p>And we've evens seen reports of Americans overseas trying to convince allies not to install Huawei equipment, making the argument that we don't need evidence, that we know what we know about China's intentions, the nature of the regime and its desire to spread liberalism and, generally, to develop its own prerogatives worldwide and, therefore, it doesn't' have to be evidence-based, it can be a political decision. </p><p>And how, what do you think is the best answer, you've hinted at it but to that approach, So, maybe if we could just go for those and then we'll open it up to all of you. Thank you. </p><p>WILSON: Sure. So, on public, private sector cooperation and the issue of industrial policy, I will be clear that that is not what I meant by private sector, public sector cooperation. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>ITI is very much in favor of market driven economics and I would even say that China has demonstrated that industrial policy can go wrong in terms of overwhelming a certain sector with subsidies and that causing over capacity. We've seen that in steel and aluminum, probably most prominently. </p><p>So, what do I mean by public, private sector cooperation? In the security context, it has to do with risk and risk mitigation. And the public sector needs to be telling companies what they see as the risks, as the threats, and what they are using as evidence to draw those conclusions. And the private sector, also, needs to demonstrate and show what the risks are.  </p><p>They, also, there also needs to be a significant amount of work done in the private sector to demonstrate to the public sector how risks are mitigated. I think that is a big open space, right now, because it's one thing for companies to say, we mitigate risk, and our supply chain and on our networks, and it's another thing for them to tell U.S. policy makers in concrete and understandable terms, this is how we mitigate risk, this is how we make a determination as to whether there is an overwhelming risk that merits cutting something out in its entirety or if there's a way to approach this in a risk based manner. </p><p>And finally, this all leads into how to develop the appropriate response and policy and that policy needs to address any risks that cannot be mitigated or develop ways to mitigate it. But it, also, needs to ensure that it's not hamstring technological development. Our companies are developing next generation technologies. And these are the technologies that the U.S. government touts and says they want us to have a competitive advantage in, technologies related to 5G and artificial intelligence. So, if they want U.S. companies and multi-national companies to be as competitive as possible, they have to understand that there is a need to let the market make some of these determinations and to not put companies on too short of a leash. </p><p>DALY: Thank you.  </p><p>GOODRICH: So, I think just picking up on that and then going in to the China and semiconductor question which is a great question, happy to answer that one. I think it's important to remember, you know, the United States and China work to very different stages of development and works two different economic models. For China, they are a country trying to close the gap, trying to study from others and there's cases where industrial policy, where it's been very, very, inefficient, has still, ultimately, been successful from the perspective of the Chinese leadership who look at the means, sort of, look at the end, not the means. And so, sure, China wasted a whole lot of money on 3G. They did a proprietary TD-SCDMA standard, which was there version of 3G, and it was incompatible with many parts of the worldwide network. </p><p>But arguably, now, China has learned a lot from that that, that 10 time--10 billion plus investment they made allowed them to train up a work force, build up an eco-system, establish companies and put them in a position to be able to compete for 5G leadership, now that they're, they've closed the gap, technologically.  </p><p>So, yes, industrial policy can be hugely wasteful and inefficient. Looking at Japan, for example, they also built their own proprietary telecommunications network. And that led them down a dead-end road, really.  </p><p>But China is actually, in some ways, learning more than Japan and others did from their mistakes and has been willing to me more inclusive of global standards in that space. So, I think there's that industrial policy question for China has its own factors, its own reasons why it is or isn't successful. </p><p>For the United States, we don't, necessarily, need industrial pricy like China has because we're not trying to catch up with anyone. We're trying to extend the lead or innovate entirely new technology that China isn't even thinking about. And you know, one of those areas, for example, is in semiconductors where, as I mentioned, the United States, today, has the benefit of being the worldwide leader in the technology, whether it's market share, technology segments or chip feature size. </p><p>Even in the 5G space, your radio chip, your fingerprint censor, your memory chip, most of it is American in terms of the components. You can look in a European telecom box or a Korean telecom box. It's all going to be the same in terms of chip vendor dominance. And that is exactly why the Chinese government is focused on it is this is something they don't make. They see that vulnerability and they equate it to, you know, the vulnerability that China has in jet engines, a couple of other high value, high value end manufacturing goods that they just haven't been able to make on their own. </p><p>They've been trying for about 30 years to do so and they've been widely unsuccessful. And I think that's because this is an industry where you can have a lot of capital, but you also need knowledge of the market and you need to have smart people. And China, yes, they have the world's largest higher education system, but in terms of quality, they actually have a shortage of probably, a hundred to 200,000 engineers who, actually, know something about semiconductor technology to be able to apply it and be successful. </p><p>So, you know, yes, China has a lot of advantages when it comes to specific industries and technologies. Some of them are just really hard to do. Now that being said, you know, looking at what happened in telecoms or high-speed rail, or in solar, wind, steel, LED, shipbuilding, there's a track record of success on behalf of China.  </p><p>But again, that success is sort of half success in that they get an industry but at what cost and what does it do to the global innovation eco system and how much money do they have to spend, annually, just to keep parts of it alive because much of it's not very profitable. </p><p>So, you know, I think, in the semiconductor space, it's going to be a lot harder for China. The technology involved is simply at a much greater magnitude and complexity when you compare it to steel and aluminum or even shipbuilding or high-speed rail. You're talking about technology that's developed over decades and $10 billion plus advanced factories with cutting edge tools really blending physics, science, math all together.  </p><p>And that's something that we have not seen China do very well, to date. But we shouldn't dismiss the possibility that it will happen. Then, China has a lot of smart people, a big country, and so, I think we should operate on the assumption, here in the United States, that they will be successful and it's just a matter of when. </p><p>And going back to Dennis's point, that really means that we need to get our own house in order. We need to invest in areas where we have current strengths, and decide what are the industries of the future, where do we currently have advantages and we should double down and invest in those. </p><p>And in terms of industrial policy here in the U.S., what does that look like? I think it doesn't mean the government picking winners. It doesn't mean creating standard enterprises, but it does mean boosting investment into education to have the work force. It does mean increasing government investment to basic research. You know, if you look back to, say, 1980, the U.S. percentage of GDP invested into basic research is half as it was today. </p><p>And now, we're facing a far more competitive global environment and we don't, necessarily, have guaranteed success in these industries. And so, you know, Congress in particular, needs to work with the administration to double funding to basic science to, even applied science at places like DARPA and Department of Energy. There's some--some positive signals but nearly not enough and that's base. </p><p>DALY: Thank you. </p><p>WILDER: Okay, on the question of, you know, the United States going out to countries and saying, we don't need to have the evidence, it's pretty obvious what the problem is here, I think you've seen different reactions from different nations. The Australians and the New Zealanders seem to have accepted that argument and they have gone to a ban. </p><p>The U.K., Germany and others are looking at the economics of it and saying, if we do this, we will set ourselves back and we will not be economically competitive, if we simply ban Chinese corporations from involvement. </p><p>So, their assessment of risk versus benefit is very different from that of some other countries. And it's going to be interesting. The British are, right now, as you've seen in The Financial Times and other newspapers, trying to decide how they're going to come out on this. There is a report that's due sometime this spring, I'm not sure exactly when, from the British government that will try and make a choice. They're being leaned heavily upon by the United States. </p><p>But they've had a lot of experience with Huawei equipment and they are--they are really thinking this through. So, it's going to be interesting to see whether everybody buys this argument that, you know, there's obvious reason to keep Huawei out. </p><p>On national industrial policy, I'm really glad Jimmy said what he said because I'm not talking about a Chinese style national industrial policy, but I am talking about incentives, money to basic research these kinds of things. And when we say, well, the private sector can do it, my second home, my vacation home is in Chautauqua County, New York, the poorest county in the state.  </p><p>You want to talk about rural cyber, come to my county. Half the county doesn't have anything but dial up service, still. So, the private sector is not doing a fantastic job in many rural areas of the United States on this. So, I'm not so sure that leaving this all to the private sector is, necessarily, the answer to these questions. </p><p>We created the interstate highway system for a reason. And it was highly successful and General President Eisenhower did it because, as a young soldier, he took a road trip across the United States and realized that there were no good roads in the United States. I wonder, in the cyber realm, whether we need to rethink, again, this aversion to industrial policies.   </p><p>And I'll leave it there. </p><p>DALY: Okay, well thank you. Please raise your hand, if you have a question and do wait for a microphone. Yes, right back here. </p><p>QUESTION: John Owen (PH) with McClarty Associates. During the Cold War, although it was cold comfort, we had something called mutually assured, mutual assured destruction, MAD. Is there anything analogous in the cyber sphere, is there some point at which an action on one side will trigger something that would, ultimately, be a disincentive for that actor? </p><p>DALY: So, this is about threats, infrastructure, early cyber warfare. Dennis, do you want to take first? </p><p>WILDER: Sure. I actually was listening to former Director Woolsey talk about this the other day and I'll give you his point of view. And that is that the United States needs to demonstrate, more fully, our offensive cyber capabilities to the Chinese, that we need to be more up front. That if we wanted to, we could do a lot to them. </p><p>That, I guess, would be in your category of a declarative mutual third destruction strategy. John, to be honest with you, I haven't thought this question through enough, mutually assured destruction strategies are pretty extreme. But certainly, I think, I guess what I'd say is the Chinese need to think about this. </p><p>We are capable of a lot. Without going into detail, there are several books you can read on what we've done in a certain foreign country that was quite dramatic in this regard. You know, we have cyber command, we are developing offensive capabilities for use in wartime. So, I think, if the Chinese push us to this point, there may well be some point of decision to go in that direction, but I haven't seen it yet. </p><p>DALY: You talking about Stuxnet? </p><p>WILDER: I didn't say that word. </p><p>GOODRICH: I would just add to that, I think there's, also, the economic realm. We should think about the mutual interdependence, itself, should be a deterrent towards greater bifurcation of the systems. And I think, as you see, if you see an inability to contain the security concerns, you're going to see greater bifurcation or splintering, as some say, of the global ICT infrastructure.  </p><p>And that would be devastating for both countries, given that, you know, if you look at the revenue model of any global tech company, China's critical for them, and China, today, and they have a very long road to go before they're completely independent and they may never will be. So, they need access to all these systems and components, just like anyone else does. </p><p>So, the more they push on this front, the more that we push. The greater economic cost it's going to inflict on both countries, and you know, that in the past has also been another form of deterrents towards some of the most unfavorable outcomes. </p><p>DALY: Okay, over here. </p><p>QUESTION: Yes, I'm Dr. Sam Hancock of EmeraldPlanet, EmeraldPlanet TV. And this goes to Dennis, your statement about many of these rural areas. You know, there's about 48 million Americans that don't have access, really, to the internet. And Actually, in some ways, that's growing. But also, if you look at the inner city, you go to Ward 8 or Ward 7, here in Washington D.C., you have some of the same thing. So, you have many of your inner city, these legacy cities do not have, you know, the high-speed internet. </p><p>How do we bring this about in going to, you know, Jimmy's earlier comments on, you know, access and technologies and all that? How do we bring this to the people and then, are we avoiding using what's called TV white space that may be a way to easily and inexpensively bring this type of connectivity? But as we expand the technologies in this competitive world, we have to have all these people, these 48 million people are important to the economy and they're locked out. </p><p>DALY: Thank you. Maybe, after Dennis's comment, also, Naomi, is there anything you see that the public sector can do to incentivize the private sector to go into these areas that haven't been deemed profitable? </p><p>WILDER: Well, I hate to sound like some of the democratic presidential candidates here, but I think there is a socioeconomic divide in this country in terms of cyber. That is a real inequality that we don't look at. You know, I think many of us in higher socioeconomic classes in this country simply assume that everybody has what we have, and they don't. </p><p>And there are barriers based on price and there are barriers that we've talked about based on infrastructure. This is why I-I-I really reject the notion that government doesn't have a role to play, here. I think government has a big role to play and we just need to find what that role is because I agree, it is outrageous that that many Americans are not being brought into the 21st century, right now. </p><p>WILSON: So, in terms of incentives, I agree with what has been said, thus far, that government does have a role in terms of incentivizing technological development and incentivizing students to be able to and to choose the path of learning of higher technology and engineering.  </p><p>I will say, I do think that the burden is on tech companies with respect to this specific problem set. And I say that because tech does not have the best reputation, right now. And to the extent that tech can demonstrate that there is societal benefit, that they care about the rural communities and those that are not as well served as the upper, middle-class communities. </p><p>I think that is to the tech sector's advantage. So, I don't know if there's an incentive that the government can or should create in that area but I, absolutely, see it as a worthwhile endeavor for the tech sector, at large. They have the capability and we need to start demonstrating, more publicly, that there is real societal benefit to these new technologies. </p><p>GOODRICH: I'll just add one point there. I think, you know, there are ways that we can, and we have actually been successful in order to spur demand. I think, you know, government policy is good when we can think about how do we get more people using the devices, the technology across a greater swath of the economic spectrum. </p><p>And in a way, that's technology neutral so that whichever way the government stimulates that demand, it allows the private sector to fill a void. One good example we have right now, obviously, we could do better, hence your example in New York, is the Universal Service Fund where, you know, everyone pays a, literally, in your cell phone tax, your phone bill, goes back to a fund that the FCC manages to help subsidize rural broadband development in communities. And we, also, had an increase in that in the stimulus package in '08, as well. And that was during 4G and 3G deployment. </p><p>So, you know, the--obviously, the scale isn't big enough if we still have a gap there. But that's one way government can, actually, help bring technology to impoverished communities and that's, in a way, that's technology neutral, we're not picking winners. It's simply stimulating the demand side. </p><p>And incentivizing these carriers to give the technology areas where there may not be that financial incentive, to date. One other thing is, on the technology perspective, actually 5G, in some ways, will help alleviate part of the problem in that it really gets the user off the fixed network because the signal goes a lot further. It can go through a lot more buildings, get through a lot more roadblocks like mountains and other things. </p><p>So, the technology, also, will bring improvements on that front. </p><p>DALY: And is it not, also, true that Huawei and other Chinese companies are offering to help bridge this gap because they bring in lower cost components, everything from the handsets to the routers and servers. So, this has been part of their pitch in Africa and South America and around the world that they can, actually, do this at cost and fill the gap if they are permitted to. </p><p>WILDER: Yeah, many small providers in the United States use Huawei equipment because of the cost factor. </p><p>DALY: Okay, come right down front, sir.   </p><p>QUESTION: Chris McRay (PH). So, I wanted to build a bit on that a bit further. I mean, Americans are, presumably, 7 percent or 8 percent of the world's population. If we think about, sort of 5G for human development and if we go back to what Kissinger would, himself, was saying, in November 2016, you know, what do countries like India, as well as China, as well as Africa, actually want from 5G. In some ways, Huawei is actually nearer the on the ground things like education and health and agriculture.  </p><p>I mean, maybe the problem is different sectors and I understand why some sectors are really confidential for Americans but it would be a terrible shame for the whole of the world, I think, if we get all these things modeled up and don't realize that, in some ways, distributed technology, as far as I understand it with 5G which Norway and China's, you know, more massively done across huge continents also is incredibly valuable for the future. </p><p>So, I'd just like to know how you see that side of things.  </p><p>DALY: I think the panel, so far has been really careful to acknowledge this and really not to vilify Huawei's action, globally. Does anyone have anything to add. It's well said, anything to add on that? </p><p>WILDER: I-I-I think that, in the third world, Huawei products and ZTE products are incredibly important at this point. We don't make handsets that are as cheap as what a Huawei or a ZTE does. We don't make these things. So again, I think one, we get back to this question of risk benefit. And from the point of view of many third world countries, the risk of having Huawei potentially cooperating with their government is less of a concern than getting these kinds of goods and services to their people. </p><p>And so, different countries are going to make different calculations on the risk benefit scale. </p><p>DALY: But just a little pressure on that. When they begin, some countries in considering making different calculations, have heard threats from us that, if you cooperate, if you have Chinese systems, that that may limit cooperation's of certain kinds with the United States. Does anybody want to comment on that as sort of a policy or pitch? </p><p>WILDER: I think that's most important in NATO and with our allies. Because the-the question at that point becomes, how do you share sensitive information over telecommunication systems if you can't do that. Now, I will say, there is another factor that somebody brought up to me the other day that I'm still working through in my own head. </p><p>And that is allowing China influence over you. In other words, if you go Huawei, and then you do something with Taiwan that Beijing may not approve of, are you going to find that your supplies from Huawei are mysteriously delayed. You know, there is a question of, once you make this choice, have you put yourself in a position where you might be the subject of undue influence. </p><p>Again, that's a hypothetical but we certainly have seen Chinese economic sanctions against people who did things, particularly, in relation to Taiwan that they didn't like.  </p><p>DALY: Thank you, Naomi. </p><p>WILSON: I'll just add on the intent versus capability side. So, from my perspective, this is another area where we have to be careful about making assumptions and what that leads us to conclude. So, even if a Chinese--if we accept the fact that a Chinese company may be directed by the Chinese government to do something, that does not mean, in and of itself, that they have the capability to do that.  </p><p>And, or that it poses a threat and cannot be mitigated. So, those are all subsequent questions that we have to ask. To me, the can a company be influenced by a government is a very political question. And there's nothing to stop any company, really, apart from standing on its principles and its economic life, to stop a company from being influenced by any number of parties. </p><p>Any company of any origin could be influenced by an entity that seeks to buy it off. So, just to say that because a company could possibly be directed by a government, I think, is not sufficient in terms of what do we do about that from a policy perspective. </p><p>DALY: Over here, microphone. </p><p>(OFF-MIC) </p><p>QUESTION: One argument I have heard is that Huawei has a big advantage over most other competitors in 5G, a year or two, in fact, I've heard. Is that correct or not, just a factual question. Thank you. </p><p>GOODRICH: There's no doubt that Huawei is extremely competitive in telecommunications technology. It's the largest in terms of revenue and they also, now, have the largest spend into research development, surpassing their peers, particularly, from their European competitors.  </p><p>So, and in many aspects, Huawei is looking to vertically integrate their technology eco system to be able to produce even some of their own chips. Now, they're not able to do everything they need but some of those, they're very competitive or even more competitive than some of their competitors. </p><p>So, I mean, Huawei is absolutely a global giant and that's--that's not something that's going to change in terms of, you know, are they ahead or not. I think one interesting benchmark to look at, again, is R&amp;D. And if you're not able to reinvest your profits back in the research and development, if you have to, you know, pay off debt loans, restructure your workforce in other countries, those are things that Huawei, right now, is not under pressure to do, unlike their other competitors. </p><p>And so, they just have a lot more capital to spend whether it's into their people or technology and, unless that changes, it's going to be very difficult for their competitors to maintain their competitiveness with them. That being said, you know, it's not a one single winner takes all across the entire technology spectrum, you know. As I mentioned before, 5G is really an eco-system of technology and there are areas in which each telecommunications hardware vendor does things that others don't in terms of comparative advantage. </p><p>And so, some of the European vendors have very strong and excelled, the core network, these big backend data centers that process all the data from all the phones and the data. That's something really, traditionally, the European vendors have had a lot of strength in, whereas, a lot of the Chinese telecommunication vendor experience comes in the radio network which are the base stations that send the signals out to the phones and other devices. </p><p>And so, I think there's compliment--there are complimentary advantages that each has but that Huawei still, from a scale perspective, is surely ahead. </p><p>DALY: Okay, yes sir, in the middle. </p><p>QUESTION: My name is Jose (INAUDIBLE) from, I'm a graduate student at American University. And my question has to do with what, regarding the conference in Barcelona that happened a week ago. Some press had characterized as Huawei as the architect of the 5G infrastructure. So, given that fact then, Dennis mentioned the different extenders that Chinese companies have, and the Chinese government also has and all the different times that policy has regarding this technology like 5G, IOT, RAI.  </p><p>Are democracies and market economies ready to deal with this--with this competition with having a competitor like China? Are our systems, are democratic institutions ready to go with these kinds of technologies? </p><p>DALY: Who wants to go first, you want to go ahead? </p><p>WILDER: I'll give it a shot. I think you asked a really excellent question that we're struggling with. As Jimmy was talking about and I think it's an important point, one of the things that Huawei has is very deep pockets. They are able to access capital and they are able to go into markets and bid very low because they have, essentially, the backing of the Chinese government. </p><p>Our companies in democracies don't get that particular advantage, right. Our companies have to figure out how to do this on an economically efficient level and I have, when I was at the White House, and you know, I would have American companies come to me and say, we can't compete in Africa. We come in with a bid and Huawei always under bids us. And they can do that because they can take a loss that our stockholders aren't going to let us take, right. </p><p>If an American company were to go out and do a bunch of loss leaders in Africa, think what happens to it. So, there is this problem. There's no question that there is a real difference between our economic systems and our political systems that makes it hard in various markets to compete. And we haven't figured out that problem and so, I do think that this is an enormous advantage for the Chinese companies. </p><p>That said, I also think we still have enormous advantages in innovation, creativity that they don't have because one of the things that happens when you have such deep pockets is your incentive to be efficient and creative and innovate, is decreased. But I'll let Jimmy speak to that. </p><p>GOODRICH: Yeah, I think that, you know, brings us to the broader question of, you know, in terms of competitiveness, having a fair market place is really critical for the success of U.S. companies. That's where we've thrived and, you know, the--it's a well-known fact that the Chinese government certainly provides a whole lot of capital that's non-market based to their companies. </p><p>And we need to do something to figure out what are the new rules going to be because, clearly, the, you know the World Trade Organization, the organization that governs a lot of these rules, particularly around subsidies hasn't done its work that it should have because we're here, today, and none of that was every really challenged or disputed in the WTO. </p><p>And that's because the current rules where they sit are really perspective in that a country can actually challenge subsidies that were given, say, to China's domestic telecom vendors. But you have to wait until you're harmed. And so, if you're already harmed, it's basically a coroner's inquest. You're trying to get reparations for the damage that was done to you. </p><p>And so, right now, actually, the United States is working with its allies. Right now, it's just the European Union and Japan, to try to rewrite those rules because they don't want that to happen again. We all share that common goal of trying to ensure that China, you know, they want these industries, but they have to ensure that they don't destroy them in the process of creating them.  </p><p>And that's really, I think, ultimately bad for innovation, too. If you look at whether it's electric vehicles or solar or some lithium batteries. China's making huge government investments into these sectors. They might drive the cost down in terms of the commodity but they, also, cut off the innovation because they lead to a lowest common denominator of product in terms of pricing.  </p><p>And so, that really squeezes out an ability to invest into future technologies, diverse technologies, for different applications. So, I was talking to a panel of experts on solar technology and saying, actually, there's much better, more efficient, higher powered solar panels out there but because the market's been crowded out by cheap imports from China, they can't compete against them. </p><p>So, I think ultimately, how do we change the rules so this doesn't happen again and, thankfully, we're thinking about it but still a long way to go. </p><p>DALY: Naomi, any final thoughts? </p><p>WILSON: I see, right now, different dynamics in the international system and I think Jimmy is absolutely right that there are certain rules within the WTO that are no longer functioning as they should, no longer necessarily applicable. And to your point about democracies and market-oriented economies versus those that are more top down, I do think we're at a point in time where the world economy is trying to reconcile those different systems and we still do very much need agreed upon norms and rules of the road but it's fairly obvious that the ones we're currently working off of are outdated. </p><p>DALY: Well thank you, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Please do stay tuned with the Kissinger Institute and the Wilson Center as a whole will be paying increasing attention to this question of security, espionage, commerce, tech, with relation to U.S., China relations broadly and we hope you will join us again, soon. Thank you to Dennis Wilder, Naomi Wilson and Jimmy Goodrich for your time today. Thanks. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VK2-9VD1-JDPT-T3W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, September 16th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are waiting on the Fed. We will get the very latest commentary and rate decision this afternoon. A lot of focus on Fed Chair Jay Powell what he says about supporting economic recovery. No expectation that we will see any more stimulus or a change in the zero percent rates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The strength of the American consumer also on the table this morning. August retail sales numbers out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. We will have those numbers as soon as they hit the tape and show you the impact on markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ahead of the retail numbers, the Fed decision, futures are adding to this week gains.</p><p>We had a little rally underway once again this morning. The Dow Industrials up 150 points, the Nasdaq up 70 and the S&amp;P 500 higher by 21. In fact the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 score their third day of gains yesterday. The Nasdaq was the big win with a gain of 1.25 percent on the session. Once again, technology and its momentum back.</p><p>The war against the coronavirus. Eli Lilly's CEO Dave Ricks will join me coming up on a \"First on Fox\" interview at 7:10 a.m. Eastern with breaking news on company's experimental antibodies drug. You don't want to miss that. Big moves in the stock ahead of it.</p><p>Stimulus stalemate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi facing backlash this morning after senior Democrats shot down a bipartisan proposal.</p><p>And it is countdown mode to Election Day. President Trump says he has no regrets about the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. This as Joe Biden courts Hispanic voters in Florida.</p><p>History at the White House. The dawn of a new Middle East. Israel, the United Arab Emirates and now Bahrain sign a deal brokered by the Trump administration.</p><p>Coming up at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany is here to discuss that.</p><p>Hurricane Sally making landfall as a category two storm, already dumping massive amounts of rain on the region.</p><p>Plus, Madonna's new project. She's taking on multiple roles with this one.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at European indices here where the FT 100 is negative, down 7.5 points. The CAC quarante is up 4 points and the DAX index is up 8 points. Very much a fractional move of a day. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen holding her annual state of the union address today in Europe, unveiling new actions to protect the environment and compete with China and the United States.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were fairly flat. Take a look. Yoshihide Suga officially named the new prime minister of Japan. Nikkei average was the one winner overnight. It was just by a fraction.</p><p>Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, swinging through swing states. President Trump telling undecided voters in Pennsylvania he has no regrets over his response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I didn't downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up played it in terms of action.</p><p>We did a very, very good job when we put that ban on. Whether you call it talent or luck, it was very important. So we saved a lot of live when is we did that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Joe Biden making his first trip to Florida, looking to boost support among Latino voters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Look, Donald Trump has failed the Hispanic community time and time again. And that's not a secret.</p><p>The Hispanic community, Latino community, holds in the palm of the hand -- their hand the destiny of this country. You may not want to hear it, but it's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Biden will be talking about Covid-19 from Wilmington, Delaware, today. President Trump will address the National Republican Congressional Committee in Washington.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hurricane Sally making landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama, this morning. The category two storm roaring ashore with maximum winds of 105 miles an hour and a life-threatening storm surge. Parts of the central Gulf Coast region facing catastrophic conditions with up to 30 inches of rain and tornadoes. Some areas already reporting feet of rain. We'll take you there as it develops.</p><p>The air quality in Portland, Oregon, now has the worst air quality in the world as the deadly and destructive wildfires burn through the West Coast. The smoky skies forcing Alaska Airlines to suspend flights in and out of Portland and Spokane for 24 hour. The airline now resuming flights with a reduced schedule.</p><p>The smoke now drifting through the East Coast, stretching to parts of New York and Washington, D.C.</p><p>Boeing is under fire again. The House Transportation Committee slamming the company and the FAA in its report about the fatal crashes involving the 737 Max jet. The committee says the crashes were preventable and accuses Boeing of minimizing the role of a software program that led to the loss of hundreds of lives. The report also criticizes government regulators for lax oversight. Shares of Boeing in the pre-market are down about 0.75 percent.</p><p>Joining the conversation all morning long this morning, Dagen McDowell and Bob Nardelli.</p><p>It is great to see you guys this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.</p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO OF CHRYSLER: Great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it is time for the \"Word on Wall Street.\"</p><p>Joining me right now, Janney Montgomery Scott Chief Investment Strategist Mark Luschini, Payne Capital Management President Ryan Payne, and Portfolio Wealth Advisors Chief Investment Officer Lee Munson.</p><p>Great to see you, gentlemen. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>First up, markets are waiting on the Federal Reserve. Futures indicating another triple digit gain at the start of trading this morning for the Dow Industrials. And investors are expecting the Fed to leave rates where they are. August retail sales are due out in about an hour and a half, so we've got some good indicators of the economic backdrop, Mark.</p><p>What are your expectations?</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: Well, Maria, I -- certainly we've seen at the path of least resistance in general for the stock market has been up. Obviously, tech has been derated (ph) here a little bit.</p><p>But what's interesting here is that the pullback in tech stocks wasn't accompanied by a decline in yields. In fact, yields moved up a couple of basis points. And inductive of the fact that it was isolated to tech and not an indictment on global growth.</p><p>The Fed, of course, expectations on that front is that we're going to see no change in interest rates, of course.</p><p>I think the only mystery here is whether Jay Powell and company are going to add to the (INAUDIBLE) and the virtual Jackson Hole meeting. But we're talking about average inflation targeting and/or what kind of forward guidance they may offer that accompanies the dot plot (ph) relative to outcome based expectations as to what might move their rate policy or do we have them standing still impact (ph) on any further discussion, leave that to the December meeting.</p><p>And so I think that's what the markets will probably waiver on predicated upon, obviously, too, the lynchpin of retail sales, which, of course, is a great signal as to how well consumer spending is holding up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you make -- you make a good point. That's what Wall Street is waiting for. Whether or not we see a change in the forward statement.</p><p>We can tell you that the Cornerstone Macro folks are saying the Fed won't make any substantive changes to the statement in particular, no new forward guidance and no modification in the pace of QE.</p><p>Maybe that's priced into the market if we don't hear much from the Fed today.</p><p>Meanwhile, big tech is leading the way again. Amazon, Microsoft, Google parent company Alphabet, FaceBook, all finishing up better than 1.6 percent yesterday. Apple also ending the day higher.</p><p>This is another tech company now, Snowflake, is hitting the market with an IPO.</p><p>Ryan, your take on the valuation of these companies and the strength of tech as a leadership industry in this market.</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I mean it's absolute insanity, Maria, when you get down to it, when you start looking at valuations. The Snowflake IPO should come out about 33 billion, which is well above where it was priced just a couple of days ago, which is just insane.</p><p>I think you just have this crazy dynamic right now where retail investors are kind of driving the market. You have options trades that are up like 92 percent from last year. And I think Robin Hood, that trading platform that makes it just a little too easy to trade, my guess is they're going to start offering free drinks along with, you know, free trade.</p><p>But I digress.</p><p>So I think right now, you know, you've got to be really careful because tech is overvalued if you can keep going here. But, you know, we're in a world where yield is so scare. We just talked about the Fed in keeping rates low for much longer, and you've got a lot of big, blue chip companies right now paying 3 percent, 4 percent. And that scarcity of the yield I think is a really important concept. I think that's where money has to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>And, meanwhile, TikTok is the story here, continues. Time is running out. China's ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, apparently would reportedly retain a majority control in this agreement with Oracle. A deal deadline is set for Sunday.</p><p>Lee Munson, I was really struck by \"The Journal\" this morning and how \"The Journal\" is writing it, that ByteDance is going to retain a majority ownership stake in TikTok and then Oracle would have a minority stake in -- in the overall company.</p><p>This doesn't necessarily look to me like the Chinese theft of intellectual opportunity is going to end any time soon. What's your reaction to what they're talking about? Is this going to pass muster with regulators?</p><p>LEE MUNSON, CIO, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS: I don't know how it's supposed to. I mean the whole issue is data security. This is the shape of things to come, Maria. We have a two tiered bifurcated system where we're going to have U.S. dominated tech and then we're going to have the Asian dominated tech.</p><p>TikTok is more of an exception to the rule. You recall earlier this summer when, you know, we banned WeChat. I think most Americans don't know the difference between WeChat and WhatsApp. But I think the -- the -- I was going for it. I don't see how this deal is going to work.</p><p>I don't see how it's going to really solve what is the core issue, which is, when we have these major tech platforms in China come and have a wildfire success in the U.S., we now have to contend with data security. Also, we're shooting cannonballs not over the bough, but we're shooting it into the map. I think that we're going to see the same type of backlash when European and other regulators look at what FaceBook is doing with scrutiny. I mean we're already starting investigations this week into FaceBook.</p><p>So I don't think this deal is going to pass. We'll see what happens.</p><p>I think, though, it gives you a pessimistic environment in Chinese tech that I think you can buy right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I would agree with you, it certainly doesn't appear that this fixes the issues that have been so wildly talked about that TikTok's global business would also become a company based in the United States and would remain a unit of ByteDance. This is according to \"The Wall Street Journal's\" reporting this morning. So we're wait. The deadline is Sunday. You make a lot of important points there.</p><p>Mark Luschini, Ryan Payne, Lee Munson, great to see you, gentlemen. Thank you. Great \"Word on Wall Street.\"</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks for having us, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, the war against the coronavirus. Eli Lilly's CEO Dave Ricks is here on a \"First on Fox Business\" interview with the breaking news that is moving this stock and impacting millions. You don't want to miss it right after the break.</p><p>Then I'll be speaking with former acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on the stimulus stalemate.</p><p>Plus, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn is here weighing in on the 2020 race and her take on the Oracle and TikTok partnership.</p><p>Plus, next hour, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will join me.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Breaking news this morning. Eli Lilly releasing the results of its Covid-19 antibody study and it found positive results in treating patients with the virus and lowering the need for hospitalization for those with moderate cases.</p><p>Joining me right now in a \"First on Fox Business\" interview is Eli Lilly's CEO Dave Ricks.</p><p>Dave, great to have you back this morning. Thanks so much. And congratulations on these findings. Very positive news.</p><p>Tell us what strikes you most about what you learned from this -- from this phase two trial.</p><p>DAVE RICKS, CEO, ELI LILLY: Well, thanks for having me on, Maria.</p><p>It's an important day against the -- with the fight against Covid. Today we announced the first proof of concept for a new approach designed to beat Covid. The first medicines really designed from scratch to beat Covid. And Lilly's antibody in this study not only lowered viral load in patients, improves symptoms, but, most importantly, as you said, reduced hospitalization risk by 72 percent in the study. It's a smaller study. We need to replicate these findings. But this is an important day in the fight against Covid.</p><p>This study was done in what we call ambulatory patients, so people who were newly diagnosed who have risk. And those with high risk factors improved as well. So this is an exciting moment. We're, of course, encouraged by this. We have many studies ongoing with this drug and -- and leaning into this and -- as the fall season comes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean thanks to you and all of your scientists who are working so hard on this.</p><p>Tell me what it means to say with those people who have moderate cases because that was one of the key points in the results of this study, right, for those patients with moderate Covid.</p><p>RICKS: Right. So this study -- and, first of all, thank you for saying that about our scientists. We've had hundreds of people at Lilly working literally around the clock since late February to get to this moment today. And our hat go off to them, as well as our collaborators and hospitals and the 400 or so patients who volunteered to enter this study.</p><p>These patients, we didn't know if they were mild, severe, or -- or moderate yet. We took -- we entered them into the study as soon as they received a positive diagnosis. So it's really an all comers study in that respect. And we -- even with that all comer population, we saw this significant reduction in hospitalization.</p><p>Today, 50,000 -- or, yesterday, 50,000 Americans were diagnosed with Covid- 19. That's a huge number. And probably 2,000 or 3,000 of those in about a week's time will progress to hospitalization where the risk go up and the health burden on our system increases.</p><p>So the hope with this type of setting would be to use an antibody if you're newly diagnosed, particularly with high risk factors, to avoid progressing to hospitalization.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And -- and once you have the antibodies, you've had Covid, you no longer have Covid, you're -- you -- you -- there's isn't any risk for you to be around others, right, once you've -- you have those antibodies?</p><p>I want to get your take on that, as well as what you see at the FDA today, Dave, because the -- the Trump administration has been trying to take down regulations, make the barrier toward passage and -- and movement through the FDA faster. Are you seeing that in your role as head of Eli Lilly? Have you seen change in terms of the FDA efforting fast approvals?</p><p>RICKS: Well, on the first part of your question, this is an antibody that was built for and engineered to supplement the body's response to Covid-19. It last in the body four to six weeks. And another setting we're studying, and I think you've reported on, is in prophylactic use. So if you're at risk for infection, here we're studying the same antibody in nursing home where one patient has become sick, can we stop the spread? That's another application for this technology.</p><p>But it -- but it goes on top of your body's own response. I think the scientific data so far shows, if you've mounted a response against Covid- 19, it's unlikely you're going to get infected again. That's why the vaccines are -- are weighted because they simulate getting better from the disease and perhaps that will be protective. That's encouraging.</p><p>As it relates to the regulators and NIH and other collaborators within the government, it's -- they -- it's been a great collaboration from the beginning. That's one part of the Covid response that's really working. The FDA is making themselves available on a moment's notice. They're doing things in -- in record time right along with industry. And that's an important point to raise here. Not only do we have collaboration around the industry that's unprecedented. But we also have speed.</p><p>We started this project really in early March. Today we're announcing first in human results. Normally, Maria, that process might take five to seven years. We just did it in about seven months. And that's with the help of the regulator, but also the incredible work of our scientists here at Lilly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's absolutely incredible, Dave. I mean are you surprised at the speed with which you have been able to move? It seems that since this began, the pharma sector, Eli Lilly included, has been just collaborating, getting together to ensure that there is either therapeutic, there are therapeutics or a vaccine ultimately, the antibodies studies that you're doing in phase -- in these phases that has just happened sooner than so many people expected.</p><p>How is that possible to -- walk us behind the work that's been done to explain how you've been able to pick up the pace here and get this done so quickly?</p><p>RICKS: Yes, well, from the jump here at the beginning, really even before we had outbreaks in the U.S., industry started talking and working with global experts but amongst ourselves to find solutions. And there have been so many collaborations. Probably in a given day, Maria, I speak to a peer CEO one or two a day. Normally that doesn't happen in our industry, or maybe any other industry, to figure out ways to speed up and work better together.</p><p>But one important point here is, you know, the pharmaceutical industry is a U.S. industry. The scientist who did this work are here in America. And that base of -- of capability that we have, which is really unique in the world, is built up over decades of investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RICKS: And we're repurposing it against Covid. But had we not built up that base and really had this uniquely American industry, we would not be in the position we are today to mount this kind of response to Covid.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RICKS: And, in the end, science is going to beat this thing. And we're a science business. And Lilly scientists, along with the whole industry, have done just a fantastic job. It's not over yet, of course, but we need to -- but we need to celebrate that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is -- that -- that is -- that's fantastic.</p><p>And to that -- to that point, you've also got phase three diabetes drug in the works. You've got a healthy pipeline there.</p><p>RICKS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that the growth at Lilly when you look at the diabetes work, as well as even an opportunity on Alzheimer's, right?</p><p>RICKS: Yes, we've got many exciting data readouts ahead, outside of Covid. Of course we've been working in this new area. We haven't been an antivirus company before. We kind of are now.</p><p>But our main business, as you mention, is in areas of chronic disease, diabetes, in cancer. We've got an important announcement coming over the weekend of a breast cancer drug.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>RICK: And then Alzheimer's, we've got some data coming out early next year that we're quite excite excited to see. Everybody wants to breakthrough in Alzheimer's. We're in the fight on all those diseases as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, of course, we're wishing you the best of luck with all of it.</p><p>Dave Ricks, thank you so much, sir.</p><p>RICKS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dave Ricks is the CEO of Eli Lilly.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Coronavirus relief compromise. The House Problem Solver's Caucus offering a bipartisan stimulus deal worth $1.5 trillion, including another round of checks, an unemployment boost, and money for the Paycheck Protection Program. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows saying that it could provide a, quote, real opening for further discussions. House Democrats, though, shout it down, digging in their heals on a plan with a $2.2 trillion price tag.</p><p>Joining me right now is former acting White House Chief of Staff, former OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney.</p><p>Mick, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you for being here.</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, FORMER ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF AND FORMER OMB DIRECTOR: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, whether it's the Problem Solvers or any other version of another stimulus plan, it doesn't appear that real negotiations are really going on right now.</p><p>Is this just dead in the water right now?</p><p>MULVANEY: Well, I think you're right to say that those negotiations are not going on right now. That's not to say that this could not move very, very quickly in the next couple of weeks. Keep in mind the pressure is simply building on leadership in both the House and the Senate.</p><p>The folks who are most at risk for getting blamed for not having a stimulus package would be the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate. All of the House is running for re-election. Much of the Senate is running for re-election. So the pressure will continue to build on the leadership to try and get something out the door. And with the government needing to be funded by the end of September, there will be a necessary carrier bill that must get passed between now and the election.</p><p>So I think it's right to say that things have gone very slowly. There's a chance that something doesn't pass. But I do think that pressure is building to get something done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean do you feel that it's needed? You have been among those who have been prudent in term of spending. You will have one eye on the debt all the time.</p><p>Do you believe at this moment in time something is needed?</p><p>MULVANEY: No, I -- I don't. And I think there's probably a growing group of -- of -- of lawmakers in Washington who are starting to accept that, that retail numbers are good, job numbers are getting better, things are -- looks like we're turning out of the -- the depth of this -- this recession. So, no, I don't think that's necessary, but that's never been the metric in Washington, D.C.</p><p>If you think you have to pass something in order to get re-elected, lawmakers love keeping their jobs, the pressure is going to be on them again and that -- and Democrats in the House, Republicans in the Senate, to -- to pass something so that they can go back and run on that between now and November.</p><p>So, no, I think your gut instinct is correct, the economics don't mandate it, the politics, however, might.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Kevin McCarthy, GOP leader, coming out with a commitment to America yesterday, fighting to take back the House to try to indicate where the -- the Democrats have been. You know, he says they orchestrated most baseless rushed and partisan impeachment in U.S. history.</p><p>Meanwhile, the GOP is trying to triple the amount of Covid-19 testing. They've got a promise to Americans should they actually get the control of the House again, three specific objectives, restore our way of life, rebuild the greatest economy in history, and renew the American dream.</p><p>What do you think it's going to take for the Republicans to take back the majority in the House this November?</p><p>MULVANEY: The sort of turnout that we had in 2016. I'll never forget the -- the morning of that election when a friend of mine from Pennsylvania called at about 9:00 in the morning and said Donald Trump is going to be president. and we all said, why is that? He said, because I just voted in my precinct and I was number 1,150. And we said, so what. He said, well, four years ago, only 800 people voted all day. Donald Trump can drive a turnout the likes of which we've not seen in modern politics before. That's what it's going to take.</p><p>I just got back from Pennsylvania. I was in Pittsburgh over the weekend. The groundswell is there. The support is there for the president. Whether or not that translates to -- to voting on Election Day will be the make it or break it for the Republicans in both the House and the Senate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think, though, that the plans, the policies are resonating? Why are you getting that turnout? Do you think people understand that you're seeing the Republicans try to come out with solutions and you've got the critics of the president sort of wanting to sew more chaos?</p><p>MULVANEY: You and I talked about this a couple weeks back, which is, what would the election be? Would the election be Trump versus Trump, would it be a referendum on the president, or would it be Trump versus Biden?</p><p>And I think that campaign, the Trump campaign, has done a decent job in the last four or five weeks going after Biden to try and make it a binary choice. People forget that you don't get to pick your ideal candidate when it comes to any election. It's usually down to two and maybe sometimes three people. And I think the campaign has done a decent job of that.</p><p>If they can continue that, continue the momentum that they seem to have built in the last couple of weeks, I think it carries them through. Gives you a lot of coverage in the Senate. The House is going to be tough but the opportunities still exist.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Mick. Great to see you this morning. Thank you so much. Mick Mulvaney joining us there.</p><p>We will, of course, be watching and covering it.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Wednesday morning everybody. Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday September 16th.</p><p>A look at market this morning 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures are rallying. We're adding to last -- this week's gains ahead of the office retail sales numbers this morning due out in about an hour. We are also waiting on the Federal Reserve. We will hear from the Fed at 2:15 p.m. Eastern this morning.</p><p>The Dow -- this afternoon rather -- The Dow Jones Industrials are up 108 points. The Nasdaq this morning up 20 points. And S&amp;P 500 higher by 14.</p><p>On top of yesterday gains as well. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 scoring their third day of gains yesterday. The Nasdaq was the winter with a gain of 1.25 percent at 4:00 on Wall Street.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at European indices this morning. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen holding her annual state of the union address today unveiling new actions to protect the environment and compete with China as well as the United States. All the major indices in Europe are now negative, fractionally so.</p><p>In Asia overnight, it was also a negative -- flat showing, as you can see. The only winner was the Nikkei average in Japan. Yoshihide Suga officially named Japan's new prime minister.</p><p>Meanwhile Japan's parliament electing the prime minister almost in eight years. Jackie DeAngelis with the details, Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria. You mentioned it just before. Yoshihide Suga officially named Japan's new leader this morning. He replaces long-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe who resigned last month over health concerns.</p><p>Suga worked as Abe's chief cabinet secretary saying his top priorities will be fighting COVIC-19 and turning around an economy battered by the pandemic.</p><p>And Kohl's is slashing its corporate work force by 15 percent. The department store chain is trying to adjust to the economic downturn due to the pandemic. Kohl's says that the cuts will save it $65 million and they are part of broader plan to reduce cost by more than $100 million. We're watching those shares. They're up about half a percent this morning.</p><p>And fast fashion meets high fashion. Amazon is launching its luxury stores to sell high-end goods. The platform will debut with the collection from Oscar de la Renta. Luxury stores is available by invitation only to prime members via the Amazon app.</p><p>Maria, what won't Amazon get into now?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true. Unbelievable. Jackie thank you so much.</p><p>On the campaign trail meanwhile President Trump speaking at a town hall in Pennsylvania yesterday defending his record on the coronavirus but also touting the economy. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You have people that aren't wealthy but that done well because of the stock market. I have -- I have set records on the stock market even during the pandemic. And that doesn't happen by accident.</p><p>If Joe Biden ever got in, I think you have a depression the likes of which we've never seen in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile Joe Biden making his first trip to Florida as the Democratic nominee. He makes an appeal to Latino voters. A new Monmouth University poll shows a 26 point lead for the former vice president, but that is still a slimmer margin than Hillary Clinton received back in 2016 when she actually lost the Sunshine State.</p><p>Joining me right now is Tennessee senator, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senate Commerce Committee, Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Marsh Blackburn.</p><p>Senator, it's good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How are you feeling about the senate races now? What kind of reception are you seeing? This is one area that some supporters are worried about, the Republicans losing the control of Senate.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Our Senate candidates, our incumbent candidates are doing a terrific job. And their poll numbers are good. We have them gaining strength. And Maria, as I looked at these races every weekend and I'm chairing this targeted state victory program for our incumbents, they are out there. They're delivering their message.</p><p>And we're going be bringing them back, plus, we're going pick up some other states. So that race in Michigan with John James. he is -- I think, we're going to be seeing him come in as a senator. Of course, Coach Tuberville down in Alabama. You've got Ron Chetty.</p><p>You look at how the president is doing in Minnesota and Wisconsin and other areas. We're in pretty good shape. We're working hard to make certain that we hold the Senate for another four years of President Donald Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what do you think the most important issues are to voters? Will it be the economy? Will it be the handling of coronavirus? Or something else?</p><p>BLACKBURN: We hear a lot about three issues. Safety and security -- and I will tell you especially with women, that is item number one.</p><p>The second thing you're hearing a lot about is the economy because everyone wants that job security. They want the help of the economy. When you look at the performance of the economy, in 2019, and how you saw that plus up and take home income in 2019, that is what people are wanting to get back to.</p><p>The recovery that you're seeing in the economy. The way the stock market is performing. The help wanted signs that are out. This is good news. And it helps the president that he is for fracking in Pennsylvania.</p><p>And you've got Joe Biden who can't figure out if he's supposed to be for it or against it and has been on both sides of that issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator, I have got to ask you about this TikTok situation.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chinese company ByteDance holding on in this TikTok deal. We've got \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting this morning that the Chinese company would retain a majority stake in the app. This is part of the conversation even after Oracle becomes its U.S. technology partner.</p><p>Missouri Senator Josh Hawley spoke out about the dangers of the partnership. He writes this. \"Any corporate shell gain that leaves TikTok in the hands of ByteDance will simply perpetuate the original problem leaving U.S. national interests and everyday users at serious risk.\"</p><p>I mean, given what we've spoken about in terms of the threat from China, do you think it makes sense to have ByteDance keeping a majority stake in TikTok once Oracle acquires -- or becomes the technology partner, however, you want to say it?</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes. You know -- and the deal is that you have to look at what ByteDance would be, what their participation would be. And Maria, at a more granular level you have to look at what would happen with the data from U.S. consumers.</p><p>How would this -- this be transported? Is it held within the U.S.? Does ByteDance have visibility into that? Now CFIUS reviewed this yesterday. We do not know what they have come out with. But we do know that Oracle is pushing to make this happen.</p><p>Now, you know, I've had concerns for a long time about China. I'm concerned about what they are doing with data, I'm concerned about their spy networks. We do not need to let them get any tight presence that is going give them control over U.S. Consumer data and allow them to expand their spy network, period, end of sentence -- that is it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, exactly. I mean the question I keep asking is how many employees from TikTok are going to be working with Oracle? Are we going to have another situation where you've got insiders inside Oracle sending data back to the CCP? So I don't -- I don't understand that this is even being discussed.</p><p>I know that CFIUS is looking at this and you've got representatives from Treasury and Commerce so we'll wait to see what it says but you -- you answered the question exactly what I expected.</p><p>Real quick Senator, is there any negotiation going on now for another stimulus bill or is that dead in the water? It certainly doesn't feel like there's any real negotiations going on. Am I right about that?</p><p>BLACKBURN: Well, the little bit of daylight on this is that now you have a hundred House members who are pushing Pelosi. And you've got a lot of these suburban women that won. And now they are pushing back at her and saying what are you doing?</p><p>Because we put a great deal on the floor in the Senate last week. It would have covered the liability, the schools, the testing, and the PPP, the UI Plus Up (ph) and the Democrats said no. It even had post office money in there. They were so concerned about the post office.</p><p>They want the American people to suffer. And to suffer from now to November. I think that is despicable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. It certainly sounds disgraceful. Senator, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you very much.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching. Senator Marsha Blackburn --</p><p>BLACKBURN: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- this morning.</p><p>Coming up U.S. business is relying on Chinese Cotton. Once CEO weighs in on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rising tensions with China heightening. The Trump administration announce new restrictions on Monday on imports of apparel, hair products and technology goods from certain companies in China's Xinjiang region. This after, of course, the news of force labor and other human rights violations in the region where you've got one million Uighurs locked up in camps.</p><p>Bob Nardelli, the worry here is that banning things like cotton are going to impact American companies. But they're being made in this region by Uighurs who are locked up. Your take.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes, Maria. I've said several times now, one of the biggest challenges we're facing right now in the economy is getting the supply chains back in order.</p><p>To your point, a number of companies that I'm personally experiencing or hearing from their concern over supply chains. A recent CEO survey said 45 percent of the CEOs are concerned about supply chain. One, because of the issue you just mentioned. Number two, because of the tariffs. Number three, some of the reductions in tariffs whose timing now is running out and therefore the tariff number will go back on.</p><p>So I'm seeing inundation of request to move from China to other areas whether it was onshore or other countries is that are very favorable towards production, labor, material cost, et cetera whether it is in Vietnam or some of the local countries there.</p><p>So this is a big, big challenge. I think a lot of us went offshore not by design but because we're trying to compete globally, because we were disadvantaged with corporate tax. We saw that with this administration as a tremendous help. So we saw a lot of onshore and I think we're going to see a lot more of that, Maria, as a result of supply chain.</p><p>Se see some of the largest industry, the automotive industry still suffering from supply chain availability.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this is a really good point because the whole -- movement in the Trump administration to moving supply chains to America. Will we see retaliation? Will we see an impact to the companies involved?</p><p>Nancy Lazar over at Cornerstone Macro counts more than 100 companies that have already moved their supply chains and yesterday we had Ken Cuccinelli on, acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security who said these extraordinary human rights violations demanding an extraordinary response. This is modern day slavery. What's the answer?</p><p>NARDELLI: You know, I think a lot of this Maria, from again my experience when I was at General Electric or Home Depot and Chrysler, you know, we had a very deliberate organization that would go over and personally inspect the facilities to make sure that we were not involved with child labor or some of the issues. We look for safety and we look for quality. We look for humanitarian requirements.</p><p>So again, I think corporations, businesses have to be very diligent before they sign up for that. Or if they're there today they better go back and recheck all of it. But you certainly feel you get blindsided and I think we all have to be thinking about supply chain. We need to shorten supply chain. The advantage of that is less work and capital, we have less inventory on the water. And again, just the ability for continuity.</p><p>I think the street, Wall Street is going to have to reward companies who have addressed the supply chain just like they're looking at ESQ (ph) Maria. They've got to look at it. Either prices are going to go up, right or markers (ph) are going to go down. So we've got to look at that as corporate America and how we're going address it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Coming up, a programming note. Join me Friday at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, for our power panel hour.</p><p>Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, \"THE FIVE\" co-host Juan Williams and \"The Hill\" reporter Joe Concha will all weigh in on the hottest topics making headlines. That's Friday 8:00 a.m. Don't miss it.</p><p>But first Aston Martin introducing a new way you can drive in your living room. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Time for \"The Morning Buzz\".</p><p>First up, \"The Material Girl\" on the silver screen. Madonna is going to co- write and direct a film about her life. She says there's no one better to tell her story and the focus will be on the music.</p><p>Dagen, you're going to go see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would see it. She's co-writing it with Diablo Cody who wrote one of kind of the great coming of age films \"Juno\". I think she won an Academy Award for that.</p><p>What is better than movie potentially is Madonna is on social media doing videos of her working during the pandemic shutdown with Diablo on the script. And let's just say it's interesting. So that might be better than the flick.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Next up getting behind the wheel of an Aston Martin without actually leaving your home. The automaker unveils a driving simulator to give you a sense of what it is like to race.</p><p>Bob, you're a car guy. It will cost you. The simulator has $74,000 price tag. What do you think?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes. I'm a car guy. But you know, I think they advertise that as privilege gamers, which I don't fit into that category for $74,000. Maria, I'm sure it would be exciting, but I got to believe it is a pretty limited market out there.</p><p>They probably should have taken that Apple approach on having some opening price points to get people behind that wheel of the simulator.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I think that when you're talking about an Aston Martin, I frankly don't want to do it in my living room. I mean this is really going to be a seller? I think for a car -- you know what I mean Dagen? When you're a car person, and I know you are as well, I've heard all your stories about the Beamer. But you know, you want to be on the road, right Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: BMW did write and replace the automobile by the way. So I have to give them immense amount of credit for stepping up quickly without any real pressure from me on that.</p><p>But here's the issue, when you buy a high performance car you really need to kind of -- kind of let her loose. Need to take it to a track. So you can't just go out in your high performance car and hit, you know, a 150 on the interstate because you'll go to jail.</p><p>So this is a way of kind of you get the experience if you own say an Aston Martin which I never would, you could get the experience of what it's like to drive it. So I kind of understand this because and again it will keep you out of the hoosgow and you avoid getting arrested for driving recklessly or, you know, getting a speeding ticket.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Driving a 150. You've never gone that fast?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Me? Of course not. Never, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. I like to see. I'D like to see you driving on THE road in your beamer one OF these days. I know people recognize you in that car too. Recognize driving your BMW.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One, there is an I-8 that I drove which has got gold wings and it's a gas/electric hybrid. That's very recognizable. And yes, people would tweet say did I just see you driving down I-81. That actually happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's funny.</p><p>All right. We're waiting on August retail sales number this morning. We're going to get to that number as soon as it hits the tape in about 30 minutes' time 8:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Markets are rallying this morning.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, August 6th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stimulus showdown. The White House is putting pressure on Democrats to reach a compromise. President Trump once again saying that he is considering taking executive action on a stimulus plan. We have the very latest from Washington as the clock ticks toward recess at the end of this week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is pushing for a debate to take place before early voting begins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Social media taking down a post from the Trump campaign.</p><p>And the war on wealth. Bernie Sanders going on a Twitter storm, pushing for a 60 percent tax on anybody with gains during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Turning to markets this morning, futures are losing some steam. Take a look at where we stand with the Dow futures now solidly negative. We are expecting a decline at the start of trading. The Dow down 74 points, the Nasdaq down 29, and the S&amp;P down 8.5. Yesterday the Nasdaq recorded its third record close in a row. We had gains across the board. The S&amp;P 500 is within 2 percent of a new record close and the Dow Industrials yesterday closing up 373 points on the session.</p><p>Keeping China from getting your information. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo focusing on significant threats from Chinese apps and telecom companies.</p><p>Investigating the origins of the Russia probe. Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates calling of out Jim Comey yesterday. This as we await accountability.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning -- well, global markets this morning with a negative tone. Take a look at the FT 100, now at the lows of the day. The FT is down 122. The Bank of England warning of a slow economic recovery. It held interest rates steady this morning at a record low one tenth of a percent. The CAC quarante is down 60 and the DAX index in Germany is lower by 107.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mixed, mostly lower. The Kospi in Korea hit a 22 month high. It is up better than 60 percent from its March 19th low. The other majors are fractionally moving overnight.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, Dagen McDowell, Joseph Pinion and Ryan Payne.</p><p>Great to have everybody this morning. Good to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.</p><p>JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, FOUNDER AND CEO, PINION ENTERPRISES: Good to be here.</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, recess is fast approaching in Washington. So far no stimulus deal. President Trump is threatening to take executive action if Democrats and administration officials do not find common ground by tomorrow's deadline. White House officials and top Democrats met for two hours yesterday. The two big sticking points, enhanced jobless benefits for 30 million workers and extending a moratorium on evictions.</p><p>Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates slamming former FBI Director James Comey's handling of the Michael Flynn investigation. It was a fiery testimony yesterday on Capitol Hill. Yates told the Senate Judiciary Committee the FBI interview of then incoming National Security Adviser Flynn back in 2017 was done without her authorization.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SALLY YATES, FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: I was upset that Director Comey didn't coordinate that with us and acted unilaterally, yes, I was.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R-SC): Did Comey go rogue?</p><p>YATES: You could use that term, yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yates went on to say she still supports the investigation into Flynn. Yates was appointed by former President Obama.</p><p>The Trump administration stepping up its offensive against China, meanwhile. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling for the removal of untrusted Chinese apps, like TikTok and WeChat. The removal from U.S. app stores. The move part of the administration's so-called clean network program to eliminate potential national security risks.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination for president due to coronavirus concerns. The Democratic National Committee announced all of the convention speeches, including Biden's, will be now delivered virtually from across the country. The DNC is set to kick off its convention on August 17th virtually.</p><p>Time for the \"Word on Wall Street.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is the Bahnsen Group CEO and managing partner, David Bahnsen, Portfolio Wealth Advisors president and chief investment officer, Lee Munson, and IHT Wealth Management president, Steve Dudash.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you for being here.</p><p>First up, Goldman Sachs is warning that the approval of a Covid-19 vaccine could upend markets. Goldman telling clients that the approval could spark a selloff in bonds, shifting money from technology stocks to cyclical stocks.</p><p>David, your thoughts on this? What kind of movements would you expect should a vaccine happen sooner rather than later?</p><p>DAVID BAHNSEN, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, BAHNSEN GROUP: Yes, I thought their piece was interesting, Maria, because it did kind of suggest that something ominous would happen. And then you read the piece and most of it sounded quite positive.</p><p>I think a rotation from the big tech and some of those real cyclicals into some of the areas that have been underappreciated would be a good and healthy thing for markets and certainly the yield curve steepening would be really appreciated by the banks and some of the financial stocks. And so I'm not sure that I would see it as a totally negative.</p><p>The only thing I might disagree with is that they don't believe that a vaccine has been that priced into markets yet. I think a lot of it has been. I think that the markets largely expect a vaccine is coming. There's certainly more upside ahead if it were to come. But I'm not -- I'm not sure that it would be upending of markets as much as it would just sort of shift some of the underlying ingredients.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think I agree with you. I mean no surprise that we would see a rotation, right? I mean, you know, toward -- toward the companies or securities that investors think will be the growth stories post a vaccine. So that's not such a surprise, I guess.</p><p>Initial jobless claims are going to be coming out this morning, 8:30 a.m. Eastern today. We'll have those numbers in an hour and a half. That's, of course, ahead of tomorrow's jobs report. The ADP report yesterday reported a major miss in private payroll additions.</p><p>Steve, what are you expecting today and do you expect a weak spot that we're entering in terms of jobs right now for the month of July?</p><p>STEVE DUDASH, PRESIDENT, IHT WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Has there ever been a time where estimates have been so wildly apart? I mean you've got people saying plus millions on the upside, plus millions on the downside. And, I mean, frankly, we think that it won't be as strong as it was in June. We'll see some gains, marginal gains. But there's a lot of uncertainty still around there.</p><p>However, like you guys were just touching on, the most important part moving the market here moving forward is the fact in the next 60 days we should have clarity on what the vaccine path looks like. Maybe not the final results, but -- and who the ultimate winner is, but a really good idea of what the path is.</p><p>And that's why we keep telling people right now, you know, if you made money on the tech run in the Covid world, that's great, congratulations, but you have to start positioning yourself now for the post-Covid world. What does this world look like one year from now? Is it still going to be the same handful of tech companies that have run through the roof? Probably not. You guys had just mentioned it, there needs to be some rotation. The Zooms of the world that have done wonderful in the last six months, do you think we're still using it to the same degree of six, 12 months from now? Because I don't. I think a lot of people are Zoomed out. And so if you're going to buy or stay in the tech world, be specific on it. And if you're not, look at the ones that are getting crushed right now, like the airlines. The government has come out and put a floor on it, or -- not officially, but they're coming out to put a floor on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DUDASH: Don't you think the world travels more 12 months from now? Don't you think that people are sick of doing this, the video calls. Wouldn't -- I would much rather be sitting in your -- in your office right now talking about it versus doing it video, virtual like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DUDASH: That is happening across the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I think you make good points.</p><p>DUDASH: So picture what it is 12 months from now and buy into that world, not today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you want to get ahead of it, how our world changes within a year?</p><p>DUDASH: Get ahead of it. Absolutely. Buy the airlines. Buy the casinos. Buy the telemeds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: David Bahnsen, I see you -- yes, I see you nodding. It sounds like -- OK. Yes.</p><p>So you -- so telemed is something we're doing now. So I guess then you believe there are some things that will still penetrate in the digital economy once we get out of this, like telemedicine.</p><p>DUDASH: Exactly. I 100 percent agree. There's going to be winners. Amazon is a winner. I don't care what happens with the vaccine tomorrow, Amazon is going to keep doing what they've been doing. People aren't going to change it. But parts of our lives will be fundamentally changed forever.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DUDASH: The telemed world, which to be, full disclosure, I own a piece of, but those have fundamentally change how people have the doctor experience. That won't go away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DUDASH: The Zooms of the world that are more short-term flashes, I think those revert back to the mean a little bit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>DUDASH: So if you're going to stay in the tech world, if you're a robin hooder and you made a bunch of money, congrats. But you've got to be a lot more selective. And like you were just saying, and Goldman has said, start rotating your portfolio now. Don't wait for that vaccine announcement to come out 60 days from now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. What -- what about the dollar? It's still struggling. The high number of Covid-19 cases could slow U.S. economic recovery.</p><p>Lee, you're -- well, you're focused on the dollar. What's your take?</p><p>LEE MUNSON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS: You know, the dollar's been my sort of post-Covid trade. As opposed to tech, I've been really in the gold miners, energy. I've been long the emerging markets. And that's -- that's helping those positions.</p><p>I think the dollar -- what nobody's really talking about is with this dollar decline, I think we see a pause here. Everybody in the narrative has said that the weaker dollar has helped stocks in July. I think that's going to continue. I think it's going to -- I think the real story is nobody's talking about the 10-year Treasury being, you know, at 0.5 something for the last two weeks. I think we're going to get an opportunity here, just on a technical basis. If you look at the charts, for those people that look at charts, everybody's looking at the dollar and thinking that this decline we're at, this sort of kiss or kill moment where the dollar's found support on a technical basis, but if that continues to drop -- because, honestly, we're printing more money than Japan, which just kind of sounds weird if you would have told me this a year ago. That's going to continue to get momentum behind things like the gold miners and the gold trade, which is directly inverse to what the dollar is doing.</p><p>And I also think it's going to give a lot of credence to people like me who like the cyclicals, like the first guess, you know, we love the value names. You know, that's like the next big trade for next year. But also it's causing your entire emerging market basket to rise.</p><p>So I think if you see a little dollar strength over the next week or so, I think that's your opportunity to get into those emerging market names. Definitely stay away from Europe, stay away from Japan. There's a million reasons why I think those economies are just not going to have the oomph that emerging markets. And so if you want to diversify out of the United States, you know, get -- not just be in tech or not be in my favorite places, which are the cyclicals, the banks, the industrials, things like that, then I think that the dollar weakness, if that subsides over the next week, I think you get into the emerging market names and I think you ride that. I think that is going to continue because the Fed's balance sheet is going to have to continue to expand for the next six to 12 months, period.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Getting into emerging markets, meaning going into those local markets, like China, India, Brazil, et cetera, or buying companies that are exposed to the emerging markets, Lee?</p><p>MUNSON: I would much rather own the actual foreign companies through -- you know, you can just get a diversified ETF that's invested in China or that's invested in emerging markets in general. Because we have to remember, the emerging market performance over the past three months rivals that, if not has done slightly better than the Nasdaq, than the Qs have been. And that's, again, based on that dollar weakness.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MUNSON: And so that's -- that's where I'm at. I understand the play and why we want to buy caterpillar or plays that, you know, sell a lot there. I want to buy those little (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MUNSON: Also, Maria, remember, a few months ago, these things were selling at book value.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MUNSON: So I think to get the same type of oomph as the Nasdaq 100 with a completely different valuation structure, you can make money being a value oriented guy like me today in this market but you have to -- you have to look at the dollar to help you make that money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Great conversation, guys.</p><p>David Bahnsen, Lee Munson, and Steve Dudash. We'll see you soon. Thank you so much.</p><p>DUDASH: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a market that has completely rolled over. It is now firmly negative, down 57 points.</p><p>Coming up this morning, CVS Health President and CEO Larry Merlo will join me on second quarter earnings, the future of the company, coming up.</p><p>And then dude ranch vacations.

You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Social media and misinformation. FaceBook, Twitter and Google owned YouTube all taking down a clip posted by the campaign which was part of President Trump's interview from \"Fox and Friends\" yesterday, citing coronavirus misinformation.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This thing's going away. It will go away like things go away. And my view is that schools should be opened. If you look at children, children are almost -- and I would almost say definitely, but almost immune from this disease.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Trump campaign responding, saying, quote, the president was stating a fact that children are less susceptible to the coronavirus. Social media companies are not the arbiters of truth.</p><p>While not immune, the World Health Organization has stated recently of the 6 million infections recorded between February and July, only 4.6 percent were children aged five to 14.</p><p>Dagen, what do you make of this?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that this is a move by these social media companies -- using the word immune, it's the wrong one. If you listen to the testimony of Dr. Anthony Fauci last week on Capitol Hill, the Democrats kept going at that -- it -- this phrase that the president has used in the past, almost immune, and they kept using it, trying to get him on the record to basically disagree with the president. Fauci would just simply say, children can get this disease, although the complications or death are rare for children.</p><p>That being said, these social media companies are on the lookout for any reason to censor the president, the administration, and take down things he says. That is just -- they are -- they are desperate to appease the left, appease the blue check mark crowd and satiate their desire to shut up and shut down this president. So when they see an opening, they do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and I think that they like to wear it as a badge of honor, that they took down a tweet, that they pushed back on the president.</p><p>This has been going on the entire term of this president. They wear it as a badge of honor.</p><p>Joseph, do you see that?</p><p>PINION: I mean at this point we just need to call -- go ahead and call it what it is, which is election tampering. I mean it's hard to tell if the DNC is not perhaps the largest shareholder at Twitter through some network of secret LLCs because at this point, you know, when you talk about the type of censorship that we see on conservative speech, I mean their true measure, their true standard, this truth in media or truth in tweets, then there are a wide variety of Democratic politicians who tweet mistruths all the time. There's -- FaceBook is permeated with mistruths that are perpetrated by the left all the time.</p><p>So the issue seems to me that they're not interested in truth, they're interested in cutting down the president, they're interested in cutting down conservatives. And that is why I think inevitably they are digging their own graves even if it doesn't happen before this election is over.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, Ryan, you've -- you've had tweets from \"The Global Times,\" which is state-run media of China. They've never taken anything down there. You've had -- you've had tweets from the head of Iran with -- with fighting words. Never took that down either.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, exactly right. And Elon Musk had a quote that was very similar to what Trump said back in March. That wasn't taken down. So I think it also -- just the bigger picture is, if big tech can get involved in censorship, doesn't that speak to the fact that they should be regulated then because if, you know, the government is really the one that's supposed to be involved with censorship, I think that just speaks to their -- again, like Joseph just said, they're kind of digging their own grave in terms of regulation. And I think they're just basically setting the pathway for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can we -- Maria, can we take this tweet down?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: World Health Organization, January 14th, this year, preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the novel coronavirus.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They can take that tweet and stick it where the sun doesn't shine if they're going to censor what is being said here in the United States.</p><p>PINION: The tweet's still up, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. Bingo.</p><p>All right, stay with us. We'll be right back. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The nuclear arms race. \"The Wall Street Journal\" out with an exclusive report saying that Saudi Arabia has expanded its nuclear program with the help of China. A new facility in the country's northwest region is raising flags. It's reportedly being used to harvest yellow cake uranium.</p><p>Joining me right now is presidential envoy for arms control, Ambassador Marshall Billingslea.</p><p>And, Ambassador, thanks very much for being here.</p><p>Can you give us the status check on what's going on in terms of this new facility in Saudi Arabia and the nuclear ambitions there?</p><p>AMB. MARSHALL BILLINGSLEA, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR ARMS CONTROL: Well, it's great to be with you this morning, Maria. And let me start by congratulating you for the 25th anniversary of your reporting on the New York Stock Exchange. That's just an incredible trailblazing on your part. And as the father of two young daughters, I hope they can in due course blaze their own trails as you have.</p><p>I saw the press reporting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. I appreciate that.</p><p>BILLINGSLEA: Absolutely.</p><p>The press reporting highlights an issue actually that I was asked about in a Senate hearing two weeks ago and what I would say is that it's going to be crucial that the Saudis commit, and I'm sure they will, to full safeguards under the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency. I also said that I think, with regard to U.S. nuclear cooperation, and, again, this is for civil nuclear purposes, for power generation, we should negotiate, and I'm sure we will, a set of agreements that forego enrichment and reprocessing, which are really the two kinds of technologies that would be most concerning in terms of pivoting from a civil program to a weapons program.</p><p>But what's key here, Maria, is to recognize that the companies that the Saudis are doing business with in China are state-owned enterprises, and those very companies are the same ones involved in China's massive nuclear buildup, it's nuclear weapons crash program. And that's -- that's, I think, of great concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I know that China is also partnering with Iran on certain things, economic things. There was a report in \"Forbes\" magazine the other day, there's a $400 billion deal being talked about between Iran and China. Is that concerning to you? We know that Iran has the ambitions to get their own nuclear weapons, right?</p><p>BILLINGSLEA: Right. I mean the president has been very clear that the JCPOA, the agreement that was cut under the Obama administration, was a bad deal for the United States because it did nothing to check the Iranian nuclear ambitions. And their doing business with the Chinese should ring all kind of alarm bells.</p><p>You know, today marks the 75th anniversary of Hiroshima, which ushered in the nuclear area. And I think it's entirely appropriate that today we talk about what the president has been doing in driving the next generation of nuclear arms control agreements. It's essential that we do not see a destabilizing nuclear arms race emerge, particularly in Asia. And, unfortunately, the Chinese are taking us there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Well, President Trump speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the phone a few weeks ago, looking to renegotiate the New Start program, the last nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia. We're waiting on details of that. They've not been released.</p><p>But last week the president said that -- this outside of Marine One. He said, right now we are the great nuclear power. We've upgraded our nuclear tremendously since. We have the most power, Russia is second, and China is third. China is surging, they'll be there at some point. And, yes, we would want to talk to China eventually about this.</p><p>Meanwhile, China's doing these side deals, Ambassador.</p><p>BILLINGSLEA: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the one with Iran, to me, seems most concerning.</p><p>BILLINGSLEA: Well, it is. But I would actually suggest that most concerning is what China is doing itself. Just with -- like with the coronavirus, China is throwing up a great wall of secrecy to the world regarding its nuclear buildup. In the last segment you mentioned \"The Global Times,\" which is the Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece. And nothing is written from an editorial standpoint in that paper that isn't sanctioned at the highest levels of the Chinese government. That newspaper, just a few months ago, called for China to have 1,000 deployed nuclear warheads. Just for comparison, the United States and Russia, under the New Start Treaty, have limited themselves to 1,500 warheads. So we are talking about a really alarming and secretive buildup by the Chinese Communist Party under Chairman Xi.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. This is very concerning.</p><p>And I know that \"The Global Times\" is an asset of the CCP because of the way they report things. In the middle of the pandemic, \"The Global Times\" comes out with a report saying, well, maybe we should question whether or not China should export prescription drugs if the United States wants to kill -- keep poking General Xi about tariffs. So pretty much what the CCP wants the world to know, they do it through \"The Global Times.\"</p><p>BILLINGSLEA: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so I'll be watching to see what they report on the nuclear situation as well.</p><p>Ambassador, this is a very important subject. We hope you'll come back and continue this conversation. Thank you so much, sir.</p><p>BILLINGSLEA: Thanks for having me so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ambassador Marshall Billingslea joining us there in Washington.</p><p>Coming up, CVS Health in focus. President and CEO Larry Merlo is here to discuss second quarter earnings and the future of the company. It is among the big testers out there of Covid.</p><p>Plus, dude ranch vacations. Americans getting a test of -- taste of the old west. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, August 6. A look at markets right now, 7:32 A.M on the east coast, futures indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning, although we are well off of the lows, the DOW futures down 33 points, the NASDAQ futures down 7 and the S&amp;P 500 down 4.5.</p><p>The NASDAQ reporting its third record close in a row yesterday. The S&amp;P 500 is within 2 percent of the new record high close. Yes, because I keep hearing myself back. Global markets this morning are mostly lower. Take a look at European indices after -- I can't, it's too much coming back at me.</p><p>Bank of England warning of a slow economic recovery. It held rates steady at the meeting today at a record low, one tenth of a percent at the meeting, European indices are down across the board with the FT down 111 points right now. They keep hitting new lows this morning in Europe. The CAC is down 50 and the DAX index this morning is down 84.</p><p>Let's check Asian markets here, and they are mixed. The Kospi index hit a 22 month high. It is up better than 60 percent from its March 19th low. The others, as you see, fractionally moving. Well, at least nine people are dead this morning in the wake of that massive tropical storm. Cheryl Casone now with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST: That's right Maria, good morning.</p><p>And one of the victims from Isaias was a 5-year-old girl. Police found the body of Eliza Talal near her home in Pennsylvania. Eliza who had autism, walked out of her home during the storm. Nearly three million people are still without power days after Isaias brought heavy rain, tornadoes and misery to the East Coast.</p><p>Crews are working to restore service after high winds brought down trees. And then check this out, this is incredible video from New York's bravest and finest, the FDNY saved two people stranded on a boat near queens in almost zero visibility. That of course the video from inside of the cab of their fire truck. Well, check your refrigerator, the USDA is putting out a public health alert.</p><p>A number of products, including salads, sold at some Walmart, Kroger, and HGB stores in five states may contain recalled onions. The affected states are Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Mississippi. The onions from Thompson International may be contaminated with salmonella.</p><p>Well, certain travelers headed to New York city better be ready to quarantine. They're not messing around now. Police are cracking down and setting up check points at major entry points at main bridges and tunnels, airports, even at the train stations.</p><p>Right now 35 high risk infectious states and Puerto Rico who come from those states into New York City, you've got to quarantine for 14 days. If you don't, you could face a hefty fine.</p><p>And then on the west coast the mayor of Los Angeles is cracking down on those who throw big house parties, threatening to cut off their utilities. Eric Garcetti authorizing the move to stop the spread of coronavirus, Maria. And those are you headlines from the news room. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Thank you so much. CVS Health posting solid second quarter earnings, also raising its outlook for the year. The drug store giant saying that it's prepared to whether the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue from its insurance business, Aetna offsetting lower foot traffic in the stores and pharmacies.</p><p>Joining me right now is the CEO and president of CVS health, Larry Merlo. Larry, it is great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me. Characterize the quarter for us. Tell us what struck you most and what were the leading headlines in the quarter.</p><p>LARRY MERLO, CEO AND PRESIDENT, CVS HEALTH: Well, Maria, thanks for having me and congratulations on 25 years. And Maria, the story in the quarter is really the acceleration of our strategy.</p><p>You now CVS and Aetna came together about 18 months ago and we set out to make healthcare more accessible by meeting people where they are, whether it's in the community and the home or in the palm of your hand.</p><p>And the pandemic has really created the need for us to accelerate that transformation. And we've seen very, very tangible and meaningful examples of that come to life. Whether it's testing in the community or what are infusion nurses are doing in the home, freeing up the important hospital bed capacity or simply the growth of tele-medicine, providing care from the palm of your hand.</p><p>So we're quite proud of what our CVS product is able to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've done such a great job, Larry, you're overseeing many acquisitions as well as dealing with this disaster of COVID. There is some worry about test result weight times. Tell me where we stand in terms of your COVID-19 testing and -- and whether you can -- you can get those weight times down.</p><p>MERLO: Yes, Maria, we saw a spike in the demand for testing coming out of the July 4th holiday. And -- and obviously that was accompanied by a spike in the turnaround times from testing.</p><p>And you know those delays were -- were far too long. We took immediate action in terms of actually reducing the number of test we were doing by about 25 percent while working with our labs as they were working to increase their capacity.</p><p>And you know since that time we now have four labs processing these results across the country and you know we have already seen dramatic improvements in that turnaround time.</p><p>You know and I would say within the next 7 to 10 days, we'll be back in that three to four day turnaround time range.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you see in terms of margins on -- on prescriptions, Larry? What can you tell us in terms of in store investments and response to the COVID and -- and what you're seeing at the pharmacy?</p><p>MERLO: Well, Maria, one of the biggest priorities that we've had going back to March was insuring the safety and health of our colleagues and our customers. And we've certainly invested whether it's PPE or some of the protective -- I'll refer to them as barriers across the store to create, I'll say social distancing and certainly cleaning protocols.</p><p>There have been schematic (ph) cost there. But again, I couldn't be prouder of the work of our colleagues in terms of what they've been able to do to continue to satisfy the needs of our -- of our customers.</p><p>We have seen a dramatic increase in the utilization of home delivery for prescriptions. And again, that's another service that -- that we've been able to provide. And you know -- and Maria, when you talk about the cost of pharmaceuticals. What's -- you know what's interesting today is about 90 percent of all the prescriptions that are dispensed in the country are -- are of the generic variety.</p><p>And that has proven to lower cost per plan sponsors as well as consumers. And you know our pharmacy benefit manager chair mark, over the past year, you know as we look at the work that they do with their clients.</p><p>They actually held year over year growth to less than 1-1/2 percent. And importantly, they'll also reduce member out of pocket cost by 3-1/2 percent. So it's really a great story in terms of what they PBM continues to reduce the overall cost of pharmaceuticals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So tell me how the company looks different in -- in two or three years, Larry, in terms of the investments that you're planning in the second half of the year and all of the things that need to change as a result of what we're living through right now.</p><p>MERLO: Well, Maria, it's really the integration of these assets as i mentioned earlier that are coming to life in meaningful ways. And the opportunity -- we all see the complexities that we face in healthcare. It's a system that is very difficult to use and navigate. We've got to make it simpler. We talk about our North Star as helping people on their path to better health.</p><p>And Maria, you look today, we've got more than two-thirds of all Americans that have one or more chronic diseases. We know their names, it's diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and it's those conditions that are accounting from 70 to 80 percent of healthcare costs.</p><p>But yet, those individuals are not achieving their best health outcomes. So this combination of assets we believe can, again, make healthcare more simple and accessible in terms of how to use it, how to navigate the system. And at the same time, help people achieve a better health outcome and in doing so reduce overall healthcare costs. And, again, we're well on our way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MERLO: We have tangible evidence of that coming to life.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What -- what you're saying is so important, Larry. And i know that it's certainly resonating with our audience. I mean, the key here is getting ahead of some of these diseases that ultimately will -- can send you bankrupt, costing so much money just treating some of these things that are actually preventable.</p><p>Let me -- let me switch gears and ask you about facial recognition, because as you know, Rite Aid has been called -- has been called out using facial recognition software in its stores. Do you use facial recognition throughout CVS stores?</p><p>MERLO: No, Maria, we -- we don't today and -- and by the way, we have no plans to do so as we think about the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Larry, it's great to have you, sir. Thanks very much. Good to see you, Larry. Thank you, Larry Merlo. Coming up, please come back, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo desperate to get people back to New York City. What he is offering and promising if you go back to the big city.</p><p>Then get back on that horse, Americans getting a taste of the old west, dude ranch vacations gaining popularity during COVID-19. Plus it's time to ask the panel. Send us your questions, ask the panel will debut later this month. Send us a video question and we may very well put it on-air by our panelists. You're watching \"Mornings With Maria\" live on fox business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo making a small offer, begging New Yorkers who have fled the city to come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): I literally talk to people all day long who are now in their Hamptons house or in their Hudson Valley house or in their Connecticut weekend house. And I say, you've got to come back. When are you coming back? We'll go to dinner. I'll buy you a drink.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joseph, with crime rising and high taxes, a possible dinner or drink, I don't know if it's going be enough. What do you think?</p><p>PINION: There's clearly a theme developing here, because first he's legalized boozy ice cream, now he wants to buy everyone a drink and I think it's because you'd have to be drunk to want to return to New York State and live under the rule of King Cuomo and his exorbitant in taxes and if opposed by Mayor De Blasio or AOC running Amazon out of town. So, I-- the moral of the story is, drink up and you'll see things through rose colored Cuomo glasses.</p><p>BARTIROMO: My god. Oh my god. Look, there's a bigger story here Joseph. It's getting bad. New York City is loosing revenue left and right and crime is rising in the double digits.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, New York City's Upper East Side reported a 286 percent increase in robberies, shootings, murder, frankly no one in this city wants to be seen with the governor in public, because he's an embarrassment and he's one of the reasons that we're suffering the way that we are right now. And all those elderly people died in nursing homes because of his order.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, don't forget about Mayor De Blasio, Dagen, he's up there too. Come on, I mean, when you talk about crime in New York City, look, let's talk motivation for a second. When it comes to motivation, competition rules apparently. Sixty-seven percent of workers say competing with colleagues pushes them to do a better job according to a new study.</p><p>Research shows less than 50 percent of those asked says job performance reviews are helpful. Ryan, does competition motivate you?</p><p>PAYNE: A hundred percent. I think if wasn't for competition I'd be the laziest man in the world. So, you know, I have the lazy gene, but I have the competitive gene and that's what basically gets me through every single day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like it. Me too. Same. Finally this, yesterday -- yesterday was mac and cheese for breakfast. Well now it's Cheetos getting in on the game, putting out its own version of the kid favorite with three flavors. They hit Walmart shelves on Saturday.</p><p>Dagen, I don't know if this is vegan. Would you try it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not vegan. By the way, vegan, that fake vegan cheese does make very delicious mac and cheese, because it melts really well, because it's essentially oil. What is that Cheetos, the real hot one, somebody get in my ear and tell me. The flaming hot, my mother loved flaming hot Cheetos.</p><p>She used to eat bags of them and we would find -- she would get up in the middle of the night because she couldn't she sleep when she was fighting cancer and she'd walk around the house eating bags and bags of flaming hot Cheetos and there'd be Cheeto dust everywhere.</p><p>And you're like, what is that all over my shirt. And it was Joyce McDowell flaming hot Cheeto dust everywhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joyce would like this segment right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She would.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, that -- that stuff stains I feel like.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It does.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, President Trump just tweeted on mail-in -- right? President Trump just tweeted out on mail-in ballets. Here's what the president just wrote. \"How can voters be sending in ballots starting, in some cases, one month before the presidential debate. Move the first debate up, a debate to me is a public service, Joe Biden and i owe it to the American people\" writes the president this morning.</p><p>We'll slip in a break and then we got a lot more on the other side of that. Stay with us, coming up dude ranch vacations, are you in. Americans getting a taste of the old west. We're checking it out. You're watching \"Mornings With Maria\" live on fox business.</p><p>How about some horsing around, dude ranches spurring interest, growing in popularity this year. Grady Trimble is live this morning from Cedar Creek Ranch in Cedar Point, Illinois with more.</p><p>Grady, good morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>GRADY TRIMBLE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning Maria. I am on Carly, the horse that's drake in front of me there and Paul Williams, the owner of Cedar Creek Ranch. We're about to do a little creek crossing here for you, so bear with us. But yes, this has been big business lately. Paul, tell us what you've been seeing, people just -- city slickers like us trying to get out and explore the outdoors.</p><p>PAUL WILLIAMS, OWNER, CEDAR CREEK RANCH: You know, Grady, it's been awesome. We've been able to give people an experience to come out and enjoy the outdoors, come out and be with nature. And splash through the water and see the wild west out here at Cedar Creek Ranch in Cedar Point.</p><p>TRIMBLE: And you've got all sorts of options for people. If they don't want to ride a horse, they can do duck boats, ATV's, you've even got a petting zoo for the little kids. A lot of options out here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Absolutely.</p><p>TRIMBLE: This isn't quite a dude ranch, but I know dude ranches have been booming as well. You don't really do overnights here, but out west, people just kind of want to control their environment. What have you seen compared to previous years? After the shutdown, things started opening back up, what happened?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, we're very fortunate to be back open and now that we can give people the outdoor experience, we're just a two hour drive from Chicago so people can come down for the day, spend the day on the ranch and have a great outdoor experience with our animals, with our houses and all kinds of stuff here on the ranch.</p><p>TRIMBLE: And a lot of people trying to get last minute trips in while summer is still here, especially in Chicago it doesn't last too long, so trying to take advantage of it, Maria, while they can and explore the great outdoors.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. Looking good on that horse, Grady. Thank you so much.</p><p>Who wouldn't like that? Dagen, you in?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I am definitely in. So I lust after my friends' vacations on Instagram and my old friend from high school, Julie Caldwell (ph), took her family to the Sweet Grass Ranch, which is actually a working cattle ranch and it's a cattle operation that's family owned and it's a guest ranch that's out in Montana.</p><p>And I am so jealous of just what they got to do in terms of it because they were literally helping work the ranch.

They're reporting large profit declines as they increase provisions against bad loans.</p><p>Some of the top stories we're watching this morning, more unrest in Portland.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details.</p><p>Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Dagen, rough weekend. The violence following a clash over the weekend between supporters of the president and counter protesters. One person was shot and killed.</p><p>Meantime, a war of words breaking out between the president and the mayor of Portland. President Trump calling Mayor Ted Wheeler a fool. Wheeler firing back, blaming the president for Portland's riots and violence.</p><p>Well, holding off. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers asking President Trump to reconsider his visit to Kenosha tomorrow. Protests in the area not letting up just one week after the shooting of Jacob Blake by police officers. Evers say he's concerned that the visit will, quote, hinder their healing.</p><p>Well, new restrictions from China slowing talks to sell the U.S. operations of TikTok. The rules issued Friday affect the export of artificial intelligence technology and reportedly are aimed at delaying, but not banning a preliminary deal. China will reportedly have to approve any deal. TikTok's parent company ByteDance now in talks with Microsoft, Walmart and Oracle. Shares of all three companies trading lower in the pre-market. Walmart down almost 4 percent. That is a Dow component.</p><p>Well, the head of the Food and Drug Administration reportedly is willing to fast track a Covid-19 vaccine before the end of phase three trials. Stephen Hahn telling London's \"Financial Times,\" that decision would be based on the science and the data, not political pressure from the White House. The FDA recently approved the use of convalescent plasma for Covid-19 patients after President Trump accused the FDA of deliberately slowing down its work to approve new treatments and vaccines.</p><p>Well, United Airlines announcing it will no longer charge travelers $200 change fees on domestic flights for good. And American Airlines is cutting capacity by 55 percent in October as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hurt travel. The airliner announced earlier this month the plans to suspend service to 15 U.S. cities. That starts October 7th. Both American and United are higher in pre-market trading, Dagen.</p><p>And those are your headlines.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl, we'll see you at the bottom of the hour.</p><p>Joining the conversation, meantime, all morning long, Lee Carter and Cabot Phillips. We'll hear from you in just moments.</p><p>Right now it's time for the \"word on Wall Street.\"</p><p>Joining me now, Bulltick Capital Markets head of global research, Kathryn Rooney Vera, Michael Lee Strategy's Michael Lee, and the Bahnsen Group's CEO and managing partner David Bahnsen.</p><p>Futures are pointing to gains ahead of the last trading day of the month. The Dow finishing its best August in more than 30 years as markets bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic. That gauge seeing a 57 percent rise since March.</p><p>David, your take on these markets right here, right now?</p><p>DAVID BAHNSEN, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, THE BAHNSEN GROUP: Well, it's certainly been a very robust August and I think that what you have to see next is that leadership democratized. You need a broader penetration, get past just the big tech and see it move into other sectors.</p><p>It started to do so, but that gap between those five companies and the other 495 is still too big. We want to see that come in a bit and we think that it will. We think the financials are deeply undervalued. Energy, same story. And you're going to see continued market strength with a lot of Fed support and recovery out of these lows of the Covid moment.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Turning to TikTok. A deal to sell the apps' U.S. division reportedly stalling over new Chinese restrictions on exporting artificial intelligence, or AI. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in talks with companies, including Microsoft and Walmart and Oracle. The Trump administration set a mid-September deadline for the deal.</p><p>Mike, is this a hurdle that can't be overcome? What do you say?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: You know, Dagen, the irony here should be lost on no one that the Chinese Communist Party is worried about proprietary technology being exported. It's important to remember the gentleman last week at the Republican National Convention said that the Chinese Communist Party is not just the enemy of America, it's the enemy of humanity. And this -- the reason we're in this situation is TikTok is essentially a spyware app on teens and preteens as the Chinese Communist Party seems to -- seeks to become the Saudi Arabia of data.</p><p>So I think this story has got lots of twists and turns and it may be -- end up being banned here in the U.S. I think China is a little bit worried that once the U.S. gets our hands on it, they'll do an accurate damage assessment to see just how much they've exported from there. So I think there's going to be daily news coming of out, this leading up to September 15th.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Michael, that's the issue is how do you -- how do you separate China and the communist government and a Chinese-based company and, you know, cut off the U.S. division? How do you separate the data, the code, and then the people? How do you really protect the asset that you're buying, so-to-speak, and protect the users in the future?</p><p>LEE: Yes, I'm not -- I'm not hopeful for a -- for a deal to get done. Like, if TikTok goes away, I mean, it's a nice little business. It's cool for the young kids to play with this and it's funny to see those little videos, but if it just didn't exist tomorrow, would anybody's life be seriously set back? No. I mean this is just antics on the side. It's a nice revenue opportunity for either Oracle or Microsoft or whoever gets their hands on it. But, in the end, national security and putting a hard line in front of the Chinese Communist Party, in my mind, is much more significant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The August jobs report is due out on Friday. The estimate right now is pointing to a job creation of 1.4 million jobs during the month of August. The unemployment rate falling to 9.8 percent.</p><p>Katherine, what are your expectations for Friday and please explain the disconnect between markets and an economy that we haven't even recovered half the jobs lost in February, March and April.</p><p>KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS: Well, the disconnect can be explained, Dagen, by the aggressive hand of the federal government and the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is effectively propping up the markets and moving them to record highs while we have 20 million people unemployed. And 30 million people, there's a disconnect between unemployed people and those who are collecting unemployment benefits because the unemployment benefits have been made far more generous and the requirements to attain them have been loosened.</p><p>So I expect a moderation, Dagen, this month. I expect less than market consensus. So between 1 and 1.4 million, which, of course, would be less than the previous month. We are on track to drop the unemployment rate, but it's still going to be in double digits. So this is a spectacular phenomenon where you have the -- as one of your other guests said, the five biggest companies really smashing records in terms of new wealth created.</p><p>And let's not -- let's not forget, Dagen, it's public information what the Fed is buying. The Fed is actually subsidizing the national champions. This reminds me, as an emerging markets strategist in my -- in my history, of an emerging markets country. You have the BNDES in Brazil which does effectively exactly the same thing. So I think it's to the detriment of small and medium enterprises where the government is effectively crowding out the private sector.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's really incredible. And small businesses have gotten virtually no help from anyone. And particularly in -- not to bring it back to these cities that are in flames, but these businesses are just being destroyed. And who's going to help them.</p><p>VERA: They're being walloped.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>VERA: Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Who's going to help them recover?</p><p>Katheryn, great to see you --</p><p>VERA: Thank you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Along with Michael Lee and David Bahnsen, Katheryn Rooney Vera. Great to see all three of you.</p><p>Much more ahead this morning.

Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, announcing that he's scaling back in-person congressional intelligence briefings, accusing Congress of leaking classified information for political gain. Ratcliffe saying that the leaks are meant to portray Russia as a greater threat than China. Congressional Democrats say the move is meant to downplay Russia's involve in the 2020 election. Ratcliffe defending his decision to Maria Bartiromo in an exclusive interview yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX HOST, \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\": Tell us why you're making this change to change the way you brief Congress on security matters.</p><p>JOHN RATCLIFFE, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: I reiterated to Congress, look, I'm going to keep you fully and currently informed as required by the law, but I also said, we're not going to do a repeat of what happened a month ago, when I did more than what was required at the request of Congress to brief not just the Oversight Committees but every member of Congress. When I did that, Maria, I said, my only condition is that you treat this information with the respect that it deserves and you keep it private. And yet, within minutes of that -- one of those briefings ending, a number of members of Congress went to a number of different publications and leaked classified information.</p><p>We've had a pandemic of information being leaked out of the intelligence community and I'm going to take the measures to make sure that that stops.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining me now, Ohio congressman, House Intelligence and House Ways and Means Committee member, Brad Wenstrup.</p><p>Congressman, what do you make of this? It's surely going to become a lightning rod for criticism from the Democrats.</p><p>REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH): Well, it probably will be a lightning rod for them. But the real lightning rod is what they have been doing for the last several years. Keep in mind that Director Ratcliffe was on the Intelligence Committee and he knows firsthand how we would have classified briefings and apparently members of the other party were leaking. Someone was leaking on a routine basis. Sometimes while we were even still in hearings. So he's very familiar with the behavior that has taken place.</p><p>And I look at situations where even last week \"The New York Times\" was calling me, asking me about something that happened during a classified briefing. And we always tell them, we don't talk about anything that happened in a classified setting.</p><p>You know, former acting Director Grenell has stated that former staffers, people that worked for both sides of the aisle as far as administrations had told him, don't go to The Hill if you don't have to because they're going to misconstrue things that you said and leak it.</p><p>I remember going to a CNN reporter two or three years ago during all the Russian collusion narrative and I said, you know, if you really want to be an American patriot, you might reveal who's doing the leaking. And he just grind and said, oh, I can't do that, and walked away.</p><p>You know, we're the committee that's supposed to be seen and never heard from. And that goes throughout Congress if you're in a classified setting. And what has been taking place over the last few years is really despicable and it's really made a shambles out of the Intelligence Committee in Congress and it's got to stop.</p><p>And I think that the director made a good decision. They can't say that they're not being informed. But they can't just run out to the swath of reporters that are sitting outside of briefings and go ahead and reveal information that they shouldn't be talking about.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lee Carter, jump in here.</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT, MASLANSY AND PARTNERS: Well, I -- the thing that I'm really curious about is how do you navigate the -- I mean, obviously, putting things in writing is going to be very, very important. But everything that we talk about, everything that's said is misconstrued and we -- how do you define your own narrative for yourself when it's constantly being twisted?</p><p>WENSTRUP: Well, it's very difficult because at the same time that someone is doing that, twisting the narrative and going out and making it public, we're respecting what -- we're respecting the oath that we took, a signed oath that we took, as a matter of fact. So it does make it challenging. And I think that it becomes very important for Director Ratcliffe to take an action like this and let the country know why he is taking it because the American people need to know that, one, not only are these people that aren't -- that these are people that aren't adhering to their oath, but they are misrepresenting an people need to be aware of that misrepresentation and keep that in mind when they hear certain things that are coming out through leaks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The stimulus stalemate, let's talk about that, Congressman. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows blaming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for stalling negotiations for the next round of Covid-19 relief.</p><p>Is there any way, ever, that the Democrats get on-board with stimulus and more rescue money this close to an election?</p><p>WENSTRUP: I don't think they -- I don't think Speaker Pelosi wants to do anything that would make the president look good and make the president look like he's reacting to what the American people need, which is what he has been doing and is doing. And same with the Senate. And so she has stalled. We have not been engaged with conversations as far as the House of Representatives go. Republicans have been shut out. And as far as I know, most of the Democrats have too. It seems to me that Nancy Pelosi and -- and her staff have written any bills that have come forward. And -- from -- from their side.</p><p>So it is -- it is a stalemate. She plays politics as hard as anyone and puts the American people second. That's what's taking place. We should be addressing the needs of schools as they reopen. We should be addressing reopening and we should be addressing some of the glitches we found in the programs that we did put in place that have helped the American people. And she doesn't seem willing to do that. It's all about the election and it has been for the last couple of years, at least, especially since she took control of the House as speaker and it's a shame because most of us went to Congress to try and take care of the American people and guide our of country in the appropriate fashion.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She also called you an enemy of the people, so we have that. I'm talking about Republicans, the one in the White House and the ones in Congress.</p><p>WENSTRUP: Yes. Well, as somebody -- as -- that was one of the most despicable things I've ever heard. You know, what motivated the man who shot at us on the baseball field? Her rhetoric and the rhetoric that had been coming out of the Democrat Party from Bernie Sanders to -- to Joe Biden now and -- and Speaker Pelosi. That drove that man to try and assassinate us that day. And so that -- that statement there by itself is - - is shameful and way beneath the dignity of the office of speaker of the House.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman Brad Wenstrup, good to see you. Thank you, sir.</p><p>WENSTRUP: You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, a terrifying ride. A toddler airborne. The accident going viral. Oh, it's getting buzz this morning.</p><p>Plus, get in line. Apple ready to release its newest iPad. We're taking a look straight ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're less than two weeks away from the kickoff of the NFL season, but the looming question remains how will the coronavirus affect the game?</p><p>Cabot, we've seen how the pandemic has impacted the NBA and Major League Baseball. The NFL has had more time to prepare. What do you think?</p><p>CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Well, the problem is they're not able to do this bubble situation like the NBA did because of the size of their rosters, the prominence of injuries and the season is a lot longer than some of the other seasons with the condensed NBA season, condensed MLB season. There's going to be a much longer season, more opportunity for players to get sick.</p><p>And you've got to look at what's going to happen if some of these marquee players get sick. On a Sunday morning, if Tom Brady tests positive for the coronavirus, is the NFL going to seriously say, well, we're going to roll the team out there without Tom Brady, maybe on a Sunday night football game. You're going to have -- start to have serious questions there about what they're going to do when some of their marquee players go down and if this is going to be able to last into flu season. The playoffs are scheduled for January and February. What's going to happens if we have a resurgence of the virus there as these players are traveling around more.</p><p>I love the NFL. I hope it's able to stick around. I hope that, you know, everything goes well, but I'm not entirely optimistic that they're going to make it a full season.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, with the NBA, I saw -- and this is not about the protests, but a friend of mine posted something on Instagram about how the NBA, oh, they had made this great sacrifice to play basketball and they were putting their lives on the line. I'm like, it's called risk/reward and they get paid to take on that risk. And I was like, maybe you say that about nurses and doctors and healthcare workers or even people who were running registers at grocery stores to make sure we were fed during the height of the pandemic, but not handsomely paid basketball players.</p><p>I digress.</p><p>We're looking at more than professional sports. A controversial situation developing in Ohio where high school football is ready to play but the state's top college team, Ohio State, excuse me, The Ohio State University, won't be hitting the field. The Big Ten delaying the season but other college teams in the state are playing.</p><p>Lee Carter, what do you make of this?</p><p>CARTER: Listen, I think that it's all so tough to follow. I think that everybody's got such different opinions about what's appropriate and the risk/reward of different things.</p><p>You know, I -- I feel like schools not playing sports is a really big deal for these kids. This is so much of their life. It's so much of their future. They're all counting on it to happen. I think that we've got to do whatever we can to get the kids back as safely as we can.</p><p>And when you think about the equipment these kids are wearing, how close are they getting to each other, when you think about football players, or you think about these kinds of things. I think sometimes common sense has to prevail.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Cabot, final word to you on The Ohio State University and high school ball.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, it's ironic. They -- they're allowing students on campus to play intramural sports, but they're not letting the football team play football. And I think also you've got to look at how a lot of these athletes are actually safer when they're on campus. They're following all sort of health protocols, CDC regulations. If they aren't playing football, they're going to be spending a lot more free time hanging out with their friends, maybe going back home, transmitting the virus there. I think this is a short-sighted move. They're a lot more concerned with liability, which I understand. I just don't think this is a solution to keep them from playing this fall.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great talk, fella and lady.</p><p>Next up, former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is here to talk about the ongoing unrest in Kenosha.</p><p>Plus, the old college try. Students looking for new ways to make money as classes shift to remote learning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Welcome back. I'm Cheryl Casone.

Dagen, those are your headlines.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Thank you so much Cheryl. Love that. President Trump planning to visit Kenosha, Wisconsin tomorrow. Wisconsin governor Tony Evers urging the president to reconsider saying this,\" I'm concerned your presence will only hinder our healing. I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together.\"</p><p>Joining me now former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. Governor, should the president visit and is that a political statement being masked as something that's well heartfelt?</p><p>SCOTT WALKER (R) FMR GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN: Well, I think the president should absolutely go to Kenosha, first and foremost because I think people want to thank him. His leadership last week, dramatically changed it back after three nights of violence and sadly two deaths and we finally saw local and state leaders responding to the president's request or his offer I should say for more assistance.</p><p>But not only that, I think it's really important when you think about so many of the businesses that were boarded up and some that were even burnt down early in the week, I think it's important for the President to hear from those employers and find out what the federal government can do to partner with local leaders there, both elected leaders but more importantly employers to get this great community back up on its feet again and help improve it for everyone. The President can do just that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is it important for the president to meet with Jacob Blake and his family? Is that a possibility?</p><p>WALKER: Well, I think right now the important thing is Wisconsin has an independent investigation and this is the Kenosha news - newspaper locally that historically endorses Democrats went after the very governor who put that letter out, attacking him for really inflaming the situation until it got to the point where the rioters came and that's because he jumped to a conclusion here.</p><p>Seeing the video I know many Americans myself included, were disturbed by what we saw but there's a process to look into this. And day after day, as we hear more information that's a process that should be handled by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. That's not something the president should be involved in.</p><p>He denounced what happened to George Floyd as did the vice president, others, rightfully so. In this case, we need to have all the facts but the community itself needs to heal. Thankfully the president's leadership brought us back to a sense of calm and some peace in terms of ending the rioting, providing the force that was needed to support the local law enforcement.</p><p>Now the next step is making sure and - and for example Congressman Brian Stiles has been putting this together so it's a perfect time to bring people together, business, community and civic leaders to figure out what do we do next to help Kenosha move forward.</p><p>And in terms of the unrest and the violence and the just outright mayhem that you've seen in places not just Wisconsin but particularly in Seattle and in Portland, why is it so difficult for these governors and local leaders to understand their basic constitutional, not only right to provide safety but their obligation to protect those people who they govern?</p><p>It's the tenth amendment of the constitution. Why is this so difficult for people to stand up and do what is - what is in their charge under our constitution?</p><p>WALKER: What is politics and it's unfortunate because the number one responsibility of the government at any level is to protect the public. Public safety in the truest sense of the word and they're feeling in these communities and unfortunately what we saw early on was a governor who'd first didn't even return the a call from Mark Meadows after he branched out, tried to get help from the federal government.</p><p>And they reached out and then they finally did but remember, it wasn't till later on Wednesday and I sadly, I think more than anything it was probably because focus groups came back and found out that the president offered to help but the presidential nominee, Joe Biden for the Democrats didn't say anything about the violence until after the three nights of riots after the two sad deaths.</p><p>You saw the same time the governor, a Democrat; the Attorney General, a Democrat; all put out statements on Wednesday. I have to believe, it was because of focus groups and polls. Donald Trump doesn't need a focus group to stand up and do what's right to protect people be it in Kenosha; in Madison, Wisconsin; in Seattle, Portland; Chicago or anywhere else across the country.</p><p>What he's saying is just reach out, let us know if you need assistance. It will be there and that's what we expect out of a President, someone who actually doesn't focus on the focus groups but focuses on the safety of the American people.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's called craven self-interest when it's the polls that wake you up, not the actual underlying violence and destruction of people's lives and livelihoods. Scott, I want to ask you about the police reform, I mentioned earlier. Just as a reminder that with the Senator Tim Scott bill, the Senate Republicans tried to open the floor debate on that bill in June.</p><p>All the proposals would be guaranteed an up or down vote, both Democrats and Republicans and the Democrats voted filibuster and wouldn't even send it up for debate.</p><p>WALKER: Tim Scott obviously talked about this in his remarkable speech he gave last week at the national convention. As you know, he's been working on this for years and he rightfully is upset with Senate Democrats who as he said and I believe he's right, cared more about a political point, using this as a political issue, going into the November elections as opposed to actually passing and enacting meaningful reform.</p><p>It can be done, I know again because I signed the law years ago, the very first independent investigation law in the country we can do it but we got to set politics aside and we got to make sure that we not only protect against horrible situations like what happened in Minneapolis with George Floyd but at the same time we then protect the good and decent honorable men and women who every day law enforcement are protecting us and keeping us safe. There can't be that balance.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll just point out that Senator Kamala Harris last week said, the Republican Convention is designed for one purpose to suit the Donald Trump's ego. What a slap in the face to all the people who spoke, especially Senator Tim Scott. Scott Walker, good to see you.</p><p>WALKER: Good to be with you. Have a great morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good to see you. Coming up, college students getting resourceful. Many finding new ways to make money as classes shift to remote learning plus I got to break it to you. I must break you again rather. Sylvester Stallone taking a new swipe at Rocky and Ivan Drago's battle in the rank. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Putting skills to work. College students faced with a somewhat decimated job market, doing what they can to make money. Gerri Willis shows us how they're changing course, Jerry.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey good morning Dagen, that's right. Those RA jobs, waitressing, bartending, all that stuff is gone, right? So most of the students are getting really, really creative. Studies show that a third of students lost their job because of the pandemic.</p><p>Tamarek Sweat is one student who has tapped her creativity to pay the bills. The sophomore at Texas A&amp;M has started a custom clothing business which she runs from her apartment near campus. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAMAREK SWEAT, TEXAS A&amp;M SOPHOMORE: I do have to pay rent and I have a light bill and I have to also juggle that and school, stuff like as far as books and access codes and this other stuff that college requires so I knew I needed money and I knew I needed it fast and so I just found a way to get money.</p><p>WILLIS: Her cousin lent her the money to start her venture and in July she bought a machine to cut cloth and a heat press. Tamarek takes orders from students in over 30 universities, most of her business is done on Instagram where she sells sweatshirts, T-shirts, hoodies and masks. She's made about $2000. Listen.</p><p>SWEAT: So it started off for financial reasons but now it is truly something that makes me happy. I enjoy seeing everyone when they get their stuff and they take videos and they tag me on Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: Among the things, college students are doing door to door sales, customer research. Some of them are selling homemade Ramen noodles and one young woman is reading tarot cards Dagen. I got to tell you, some folks are saying this is a new generation of entrepreneurs because they're looking what seemingly might be chaos in finding opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Go Aggies is this I'll say to that, industrious young woman. Thank you so much Gerri. Cabot, how are students harnessing technology to create these money making opportunities?</p><p>CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Yes well, I've seen this first-hand at CampusReform, we have a team of college students that write for us. We've had a huge increase in the number of students that are coming forward and saying, hey, I need some extra money. How can I get paid to write for your website? Can I learn the trade of writing and journalism.</p><p>I've seen this first-hand. Also my brother in law. He got laid off from his job at Applebees. He's a student at Oregon state. You know what he did? He took a pickup truck, he started his junk removal business in Scappoose, Oregon so he could make some money to get by.</p><p>That is capitalism. That's the beauty of America and so for the next generation to get to see, hey, capitalism actually isn't that bad. I can go out, I can use my talents. I can work hard. I can provide a service for people and like that student in the video earlier said, I feel good that I'm helping people.</p><p>This is a great entry way for people and the next generation to realize that in America, you have the freedom to start something. You don't have to sit around and wait for other people to give it to you. Hopefully we can change some people's minds about the beauty of the free market in the next generation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Lee, it really is easier than ever nowadays to start your own business, particularly if you're selling something online like they awesome T-shirts and sweatshirts that this young Aggie was making?</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Yes, it's amazing. I mean the very entry is nothing. I mean these kids seem to know how to harness technology but one of the things that I think is so fascinating too and looking at studies is how much innovation is accelerated over the last six months.</p><p>Things that we never thought would happen with virtual work, with virtual connections and these kinds of moments really breed innovation and entrepreneurial spirit so I can't wait to see what innovations come out of this time, as hard and challenging it is, American spirit rises up and great things can happen. I love seeing these kinds of stories so more to come.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great stuff, guys. Coming up, a terrifying ride, a toddler goes airborne. The accident goes viral. We take a look and that little lady is OK. Plus Amazon keeping you fit. The new fitness tracker contract more than just your steps.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's time for the morning buzz. First up, Rocky Balboa and Ivan Drago getting a rematch sort of. Sylvester Stallone making a director's cut of Rocky IV to celebrate the film's 35th anniversary. One thing we do know about the bizarre poly robot is being removed.</p><p>Someone says the robot is going to the junk yard for ever. Cabot, do we need a director's cut of Rocky IV?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, if they say if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I don't think we need to change a thing about this movie. I remember watching this as a very young kid, elementary school, getting fired up by it. I wanted to go fight the Soviets, my parents had to tell me that the Cold War was long over. I didn't need to worry about that but I think that also the thing you got to keep in mind here is at least we're not getting a new Rocky completely.</p><p>Don't put it past along to come out and say he's just going to film a new one even though he's a little bit advanced in age. We've seen him revamping Rambo. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw an entirely new Rocky film in the next couple years but this is an absolute classic. No need to change it though I'm excited to see what Stallone has to add.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So speaking of that, I'm watching Terms of Endearment on show time over the weekend and there's a scene where Aurora and Garrett, Shirley MacLaine and Jack Nicholson first kiss out in the water in the Gulf of Mexico and he grabs her in an appropriate way and she fights back and runs off.</p><p>That was edited completely out of the version that's on showtime with no warning so I'm just raising the question of like who said it's sensitive that they couldn't watch that and make a judgment about it themselves and why would showtime cut that out. Very, very disturbing if you ask me.</p><p>Next terrifying moments, watch this. Captured on video, a three-year old girl caught in a kite and taken up about a 100 feet into the sky. Look at that. This is during a festival in Taiwan. The crowd got the girl down and she reportedly only suffered some scratches but isn't it amazing that this child wasn't seriously injured and as a mom, relatively new mom, it makes you worried about like situations your child can get into.</p><p>CARTER: You just can't imagine how terrified that family was. That little girl, she's 28 pound, three-years old. I have a 16 month old. I am devastated just watching that video. Thank the Lord that she just came out with scratches and the goodness of all the people that come together and try and help her but my Lord, I cannot imagine. I cannot imagine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So - so here's a quick story. My brother - well, my mother was standing at the window at the kitchen sink and she was looking out in the backyard and just saw this hatchet flying up in the air and my brother at three had gone into the shed and gotten a hatchet.</p><p>And was playing like hatchet toss and throw it in the air. I think it took my mother 20 years to recover from that so finally I - little boys you know. You got a little girl. Be grateful. Finally a love for the ages.

Gosh, they should give us all, some tips. That's amazing almost - almost 80 years, I mean that's beautiful. In 1941. Think of all that's happened in the world since they've been together and what they've seen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Lee, Cabot just got married.</p><p>CARTER: Amazing. Congratulations.</p><p>PHILLIPS: I'm four months in. I'm going to do some research on what the tips were here and you got to think that at a certain point, they're just continuing to relish in proving their family is wrong and I'm sure their families have come along at this point. they probably have so many children and grandchildren. I love stories like this. I have a lot to learn though. I'm very excited.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You only need to learn two words Cabot. 'Yes dear.'</p><p>PHILLIPS: I've learned that one very quickly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes dear. Can you go and change the tires on the car? Yes dear.

Europe is in the red territory this morning. Losses down more than 1 percent in England, France and Germany. In Asia overnight there were also losses. The Nikkei closed for the holiday. Shanghai losing almost 4 percent.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, Alli McCartney, Emily Jashinsky and Michael Lee.</p><p>Welcome one and all. We'll see you shortly.</p><p>Meantime, China ordering the United States to shut down a consulate in Chengdu.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti has the details.</p><p>Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Dagen, good morning.</p><p>This is one of five U.S. consulates in the country.

Hundreds gathering outside the home of Mayor Lori Lightfoot last night -- look at that -- demanding the city defund police as the White House announced plans to send federal agents to the windy city and other cities across the nation to help combat the recent surge in violence.</p><p>And, overnight, this iconic statue of Christopher Columbus was removed from Chicago's Grant Park.

That according to \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Amazon's venture capital fund took a stake in a tech start-up called Defined Crowd and gained access to its finances and other confidential information. Well, \"The Journal\" says, about four years later, Amazon rolled out an artificial intelligence product very similar to one of Defined Crowd's products. Amazon denies any wrong-doing but shares are down $25 ahead of the opening bell.</p><p>Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Lauren.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti.</p><p>Time for the \"Word on Wall Street,\" where top financial analysts are here to help you and your wallet.</p><p>Joining me now the Fitz-Gerald Group Principal Keith Fitz-Gerald, Federated Hermes Senior Equity Strategist Linda Duessel, and the Bahnsen Group CEO and Managing Partner David Bahnsen.</p><p>Great to see all of you.</p><p>Keith, let's start with you.</p><p>Futures under pressure on global tensions with China. This follows the selloff yesterday largely led by big tech. Intel reporting better than expected results yesterday but the shares are slipping after a drop in third quarter outlook.</p><p>What do you make of tech's tumble? Is it the --is it the air coming out of a bubble?</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, PRINCIPAL, THE FITZ-GERALD GROUP: You know, I wouldn't use the word \"bubble\" because that brings to mind connotations of 1999. I think it's a decided concentration of risk. It's a concentration of funds at work. People are simply taking their foot off the gas. To me, it's, so far, normal. The selling isn't panic driven. It's simply a lot of money coming off, they've decided to sell, and I'm not reading a lot into that yet.</p><p>China, on the other hand, does concern me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What else are you watch -- well, let's talk about China because we had Zach Cooper (ph) on last hour and he said something very interesting. And -- he said that closing -- by China closing the consulate in Chengdu, that that is actually a de-escalation of tensions because it's not really an important consulate and so it was a message that they're trying to take their foot off the gas somewhat, so-to-speak.</p><p>But how do you see it?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: Well, I tell you, respectfully, I've spent nearly 30 years in that part of the world. I've done a lot of business in mainland China. I have exactly the opposite impression. I think Chengdu is a significant operation because it's near and dear to the manufacturing community, it's been a presence for the United States basically since World War II. I think that we have got a significant number of chips on the table. So I read that as not a de-escalation, but very much a tit-for-tat. Houston was important to the Chinese. We hit them where it hurt. They're going to do the same to us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we can't back off now, can we? We can't stand by, which we did literally for decades, and allow the Chinese to steal our intellectual property and some of America's greatest resources?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: Oh, I agree with that. I think that, you know, we've had 40 years of failed policy. In fact, the only thing we've gotten correct with regard to China over the last 40 years has been that we've under-estimated them. They've changed psychologically, just like the Soviets did, from an animal that's looking for food and love, to an animal that believes it can survive once it gets outside its cage. That makes it very, very dangerous. And the futures reflect that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The next coronavirus stimulus package, a work in progress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delaying the release of the Republican stimulus plan.</p><p>David, what is the market impact here? It's like -- Ron Johnson, the senator, has an editorial in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today saying, we don't even know where the first $3 trillion went.</p><p>DAVID BAHNSEN, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, THE BAHNSEN GROUP: Well, I think that the market has to sort of process two realities at once. One is that it's going to be a little bit ugly getting a deal done. There's going to be a lot of back and forth. And it's not two parties negotiating anymore. This is not Democrats versus Republicans. It's House Democrats, it's Senate Republicans, and it's the White House. And there's a sort of tri-party element that makes it a bit more complicated.</p><p>But do I think that the market believes that there's any question they're going to end up getting some deal done, even if it's a little bit awkward along the way and delayed, no, the market knows a deal's coming and we're sitting around debating if it's going to be 2 trillion or 1.5 trillion. It's going to be massive. It's going to have some good things in it and it's going to have some awful things in it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It has helped, though. Let's be clear. The money that has flowed specifically to consumers, those who are working, you get the checks and then the enhanced unemployment benefits. The housing market, we have the new home sales report out later today. But June existing home sales topped 4.72 million in sales in June. It was the highest record -- it was a record for the month and boosted by low mortgage rates, but also money in people's pockets.</p><p>Linda, what do you say?</p><p>LINDA DUESSEL, SENIOR EQUITY STRATEGIST, FEDERATED HERMES: Housing is a huge piece of our economy and that is really one of the big positives that we can point to as bulls, we at Federated Hermes are bullish. So the 30 year mortgage rate now I think is maybe the lowest that it's ever been. And a lot of people are taking advantage of this. This also has to do with people moving out of the cities more into the suburbs and some new home buyers and first time home buyers. So that's all really good news as we work our way through fits and starts, which you normally would do in the summertime with the market.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But do we need -- do you think we need $2 trillion in additional stimulus here to keep the economy and businesses propped up until we can get a vaccine?</p><p>DUESSEL: Yes. Yes, unfortunately, the really bad -- the really bad thing out there is the unemployment situation. The unemployment claims again yesterday I think -- we're now maybe 17 weeks in a row where you've had ridiculously high unemployment figures come out. These are brand-new unemployment claims, people that were not unemployed before. So throughout this whole time period, people who lost their jobs were getting that $600 - - extra $600, they knew it was a temporary loss. Now they're wondering if it's going to be a permanent loss.</p><p>So this is something that really needs to right itself. We see great news from the housing side. We see lots of people still losing their jobs. People losing their jobs are the lowest income cohorts out there. And those are the ones that really need the lifeline. And I believe very much, particularly in an election year, you will see new monies flow to those people and new monies flow to the PPP program.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Linda, great to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>Linda Duessel, Keith Fitz-Gerald and David Bahnsen, thanks one and all.</p><p>Much more ahead this morning.</p><p>Next, Indiana Congressman Jim Banks on growing tensions with China as Beijing closes a U.S. consulate in a major Chinese city.</p><p>At 8:00, former senior adviser to President George W.

The CDC issuing new guidelines on how students should return to the classroom. Details ahead.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Tensions between the United States and China rising. China ordering the closure of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu overnight. This in retaliation to the U.S. forcing the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston over intellectual property theft.</p><p>Joining me now, Indiana Congressman and House Armed Services Committee member Jim Banks.</p><p>Congressman, the timing might be awkward for our economy, our market, but this is necessary, is it not?</p><p>REP. JIM BANKS (R-IN): It's absolutely necessary, Dagen. And -- and this is a sign of probably much more of what's -- what's to come in the months and years ahead. We finally have a president, after 40 years of presidents who have turned a blind eye to the activities of China, we have a president and a secretary of state, by the way, who have ventured to do something about it.</p><p>Yesterday, Secretary Pompeo gave, I believe, the most pivotal speech of the entire four years that he -- that -- that this Trump administration has been in office, in talking about uniting the free world against communist China. And what you saw in closing the consulate in Houston is a necessary step, is a hub of intellectual property theft on behalf of the Chinese and United States of America, but there is so much more to do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Speaking of the secretary of state, let's listen to a little bit of what he says. He doubled down on his hard line against China, announcing the end of blind engagement with the communist party.</p><p>Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: The old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won't get it done. We must not continue it. We must not return to it.</p><p>If the free world doesn't change, doesn't change, communist China will surely change us. We can't return to the past practices because they're comfortable or because they're convenient.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We also need to point out, just in recent days, the U.S. indicting two Chinese nationals or allegedly hacking American firms involved in coronavirus research. And, again, this is a virus that has killed hundreds of thousands of people around the globe that came out of China, that China lied about for weeks, if not months.</p><p>BANKS: That's exactly right. And this is just skimming the surface. This is what the American people are becoming awakened to more than ever before because this administration is exposing something that has largely been hidden from us for decades in the past.</p><p>But this is just skimming the surface. And that's why Kevin McCarthy and the House of Representatives formed the China Task Force. And by October 1st, we will -- we will release an extensive whole of government approach that the administration can take and Congress can support in how we deal with China moving forward.</p><p>This is the issue of our time. This is the greatest existential threat that America faces today. And thank God that we have a president and an administration with those like Secretary Pompeo are doing something about it.</p><p>I contend that this is what's at stake on the ballot in November when we vote as well, will we continue to put pressure on communist China for another four years or will we backtrack to the times of past -- with Republicans and Democrat administrations -- where we turn a complete blind eye to these activities. Thank God we have a president who's doing something about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But four years ago President Trump really clearly connected China and all of the jobs and the economic malaise, particularly in rural parts of America. So that has to continue to -- because people have to feel. And if it's not the virus, then it's certainly the economic impact of all those jobs being shipped overseas for literally decades.</p><p>I want to get your take on this, though.</p><p>GOP leaders have delayed the release of their ideas about the next coronavirus aid package. The long awaited plan is now expected to be introduced next week following days of negotiations of what should go into the bill. It doesn't look like a payroll tax cut is going to go into that. But I'll point this out, one of the sticking points is that extra $600 a week that people are receiving in unemployment benefits and that effectively will end in many states this weekend.</p><p>Where do you stand on it, because you can't hold this up?</p><p>BANKS: Yes, I serve as chairman of the Budget and Spending Task Force of the Republican Study Committee. I can tell you that later today we're going to release a letter that will include a majority of House Republicans saying enough is enough, we can't keep adding to the national debt. We have to address it. And we can't keep incentivizing people to stay home and not go to work.</p><p>I hear from businesses in northeast Indiana, which I represent, every single day talking about this being the greatest challenge that they have, how do we get employees to come back to work if the federal government is incentivizing them to stay home. So there is a debate within the Republican Party, a larger debate within our country, of how -- where do we go from here?</p><p>I'm not giving up on the payroll tax cut. It should be something that should be included. And I stand -- I stand with President Trump on that. I hope we don't back off of that -- that debate. And there have been -- there have been some signs that the administration is still fighting for it. But I can tell you that -- that many House Republicans, like myself, are fighting for it too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In terms of the 600 supplemental, the extra $600 per week, be specific, are you in favor of reducing it or getting rid of that extra $600?</p><p>BANKS: Yes, I believe it's unhealthy all together. We should eliminate it. It should not be included in a future package. We need to -- we need to find ways to incentivize Americans to go back to work. That's what will make America's economy healthy again, by reopening our economy, getting America back to work, not to reward people, incentivize people to stay at home instead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, America needs to be healthy in order to go back to work. And given the -- certainly the rising number of virus cases in some states, that's not a possibility. So you're not in favor of giving those people who can't go back to work, their businesses aren't open, you see this jump in jobless claims for the week that came out yesterday.</p><p>BANKS: Yes, understood, Dagen. I have three daughters who are 10 and under. Their generation is going to hold the bag for the $3.2 trillion we've added to the national debt already. Another package that would add trillions more, that -- that will impact the economy for a lot longer than the -- the short-term pain that we're feeling in this economy at the moment. That -- that's what I'm concerned about. We can't do -- we can't do more harm to our -- to our kids and our grandkids' future by growing this national debt even further.</p><p>And that's why House Republicans like myself are going to be releasing in a letter shortly addressing that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right</p><p>BANKS: And putting our foot down, saying enough is enough.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, on the other side of that you've got to take care of those children today and parents will tell you they need that extra money to literally put food on the table and clothes on their backs.</p><p>Congressman Jim Banks, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BANKS: Thank you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols.</p><p>But every district should be actively making preparations to open. Again --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Trump urging schools to resume in-person learning this fall. The CDC releasing its long awaited guidelines for reopening with a heavy emphasis on getting students back into classrooms. The new guidelines include this, implement mitigation strategies which include social distancing, masks, and hand hygiene, clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, take into account community transmission, repurpose spaces to increase classroom space, keep students in pods throughout the day and develop plans for positive tests and case tracing.</p><p>Mike, your take?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: Yes, look, Dagen, I think kids need to be back in the classroom. There's no evidence that children pass this to adults. We've had no confirmed cases from that worldwide. The U.S. is one of the only countries in the world pushing back on sending kids back to the classroom. I think this is led by the teachers unions in a political effort to get Trump. I think teachers with underlying conditions that are really at risk are more at risk from getting it from other teachers and should be offered an opportunity to take a year off and get paid on disability until a vaccine is available. There's a lot of workable solutions.</p><p>But there was a doctor from Johns Hopkins on Fox last night saying that calls to social services are down 75 percent. Considering what we've been through since March, with all the stress and all the children locked inside and a lot of parents that aren't able to handle this, you'd think they'd be up 75 percent. So there is a real public health problem happening from kids being out of school. They need to be back in the classroom in August as soon as possible.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Alli, do you agree?</p><p>ALLI MCCARTNEY, PRIVATE WEALTH ADVISER, UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES: Look, there are two things going on here. The first is that everything that we've been through in the last number of months clearly points to the divide in terms of the lack of progress and sufficiency of our system. We need to get kids in school. We need to figure this out.</p><p>The second is from an economic point of view. We just talked about the $600 benefit, which if it doesn't materialize is going to be quite a negative surprise to the market. But you cannot get working class people back in school -- back to work and the economy going and unemployment below 11 percent if you don't have children in schools.</p><p>So this -- this is one of those issues and it's going to continue to highlight a lot of the divides we see socially, economically and politically, but we have to work towards getting kids back in school for their health and for the health of the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I read a quote, it was in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Emily, that said that without education and schools, that women particularly, if they have to stay at home without child care, without schools being open, it will wipe away a generation of gains for women in the workplace. Really astonishing.</p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, COMMENTARY WRITER, THE FEDERALIST: Yes, and -- no, that is a really good point because we have to think about all of the sort of like tangential or the downstream impacts of something like this. And women absolutely will bear the brunt of it in terms of families. And, you know, these guidelines, I think, are really innovative. I think when you look at polling, you know, we say that AP poll yesterday found around 60 percent of the country believes that schools should be open with either major changes or minor changes in the fall. We can't really even comprehend how -- it's - - because it's not just what they're learning in the classroom. And we know that it's tough for kids to learn over Zoom. But it's also the socialization aspect of it, being around other children as you learn and grow. So I think, you know, we can't even understand the impact that closing in the fall would have totally. And that's why it's so important to find innovative ways to keep the schools open.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, we've heard from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine weighing in on this of how important it is for particularly children with special needs or kindergarten through third grade to be in schools around one another in classrooms because that's when you're developing the skills to regulate your behavior, attention, emotions.</p><p>You couple that with the way our elderly are being isolated in nursing homes and hospitals and the dementia and literally the delirium that results from that and these are the long-lasting consequences of how we've chosen to fight this virus. And it will change us as a nation potentially forever.</p><p>Coming up, changing course.

In Chicago, hundreds of protesters gathered outside Mayor Lori Lightfoot's house last night demanding that she defund the city's police department and decrying President Trump's decision to send in federal agents.</p><p>Meantime, President Trump telling Fox News that he would also send a CBP team to Seattle as protests in the Pacific Northwest have expanded outside of Portland and both cities are anticipating riots this weekend.</p><p>Joining me now, chief political correspondent at \"The Washington Examiner\" and Fox News contributor, Byron York.</p><p>Byron, the messaging gets nuttier every day. So, in Chicago, where people are being murdered every single day, they want to defund the police to stop crime?</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's -- it's so -- it just makes absolutely no sense. And, you know, from the very beginning of the most recent attention to this defund the police idea, critics have said, well, what happens if you defund the police and there's a murder or an armed robbery or any -- all sorts of violent crimes that take place? And the proponents of that have never had a good answer.</p><p>Now, on this Portland stuff, Seattle stuff, Chicago, the guiding principle for federal involvement is some threat to a federal facility. That's what's going on in Portland are nightly attacks on the Hatfield Federal Courthouse. And federal law enforcement from the Department of Homeland Security are protecting the courthouse. So if you saw something similar in another city like Seattle, you would have some more federal intervention.</p><p>But in cities that have just seen a crime spike, like Chicago and New York, if there were federal intervention, it would not be the same as all. It would be sending more agents, FBI, DEA, ATF, to do what they already do, which is assisting local law enforcement.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That is exactly right, Byron. And that's what's happening in Chicago. These are agents that are helping with investigative work, say ATF using special technology to study ballistics evidence.</p><p>YORK: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And if it's a federal crime being committed, which is a drug crime, if it's gang related, chances are it's a drug crime. Eighty percent of gang activity it's drug related. Drug offenses are federal offenses. The feds don't need any permission to go into a city to address a drug or racketeering related crimes. These are federal crimes. And if they're charged in federal court, they actually could carry longer sentences.</p><p>So what if -- what if, in Chicago, this actually works?</p><p>YORK: Well, we've seen this before. Here, again, the important thing to say is, federal agents are already in Chicago, in New York, in cities around the country, as part of the everyday work supporting local law enforcement. That's what's going on. So if you -- if you send more of them, because the problem has gotten worse, that is not a federal takeover, that is not an invasion of the city, that is not a first step toward Marshall law, which some on the left are talking about these days. That's none of that. This is a continuation of existing practices and also a realization that things, for whatever reason, have gotten worse in recent days and need to be address.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You said -- used the phrase \"martial law.\" And I want to raise an issue, something you were talking about on Twitter. I -- I follow you religiously. It's the language from the left, from progressives and even Democrats in power. But then that language is then being picked up and used throughout many corners of the media, and it's really insidious. And it shows a lack of critical thinking and, quite frankly, a laziness on the part of members of the media. And I would use the phrase \"martial law.\" The insistence that these protests are peaceful when we see -- when we see the city burning, or fires outside of a courthouse. Nancy Pelosi used the phrase \"storm troopers.\" The -- here -- here is one of my -- oh, secret police, I think that that was one that -- that you mentioned. The insistence that these are -- that these federal agents are anonymous, that they're not wearing their names. Well, of course they're not, it's because -- to -- it's to protect their families.</p><p>But here was the one that really made me angry. The Portland -- here's the headline, the Portland mayor tear gassed by federal agents. You saw that everywhere. What do you make of that?</p><p>YORK: Well, it's just more -- first of all, the protesters, the tear gas was used to respond to protesters who were throwing burning bags of garbage over the fence toward the federal courthouse because they've been trying to start fires around there for days and days and days. This is day 54 or 55 of their protest. So the Portland mayor kind of joined the mob that was throwing this garbage and he was there for the tear gas as well.</p><p>But you're right about this phraseology. \"Secret police\" is particularly nutty because they're from the -- these law enforcement officers are from the Department of Homeland Security. DHS holds press conferences about what they're doing. Various officials have come on TV to do interviews about what they're doing. They're simply not \"secret police.\"</p><p>A growing one is martial law. You're seeing Ron Wyden, the senator -- Democratic senator from Oregon, said that we might be looking at martial law in the future if -- if this federal intervention in Portland, specifically to protect the federal courthouse, were to continue.</p><p>And now you're seeing on some -- (INAUDIBLE) of the left speculation that the president is planning a martial -- the imposition of martial law to cancel the election in November. And -- and I'm -- this stuff has been in \"The Washington Post,\" it's been on MSNBC. This is not in the -- in the crazy nut fringes, this is mainstream media speculation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it's the same media that was speculating -- not even speculating, accusing President Trump of colluding with Vladimir Putin. So, again, that's why there's such a distrust.</p><p>YORK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it's very -- but it's a little more subtle with the use of language, the use of language like \"secret police.\" It's to evoke a nation of Nazis. That's -- that's the whole -- the meaning of it.</p><p>YORK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It doesn't quite go as far as Nancy Pelosi using the term \"storm troopers,\" but it's -- it's -- it's planned and it's tactical by the media and the left.</p><p>YORK: You know, and you'll hear people in Portland, especially, and you can understand this, saying, look, Portland is not on fire. There's this big city and this is not going on everywhere in the big city. There's plenty of places you could be in Portland, you would never have any idea. It's going on in a very small place. But if it's a small, targeted thing, how could it be this national martial law imposition that people on the left talk about.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to not get chased and harassed and robbed on my way to work. Is that too much to ask?</p><p>Byron York, good to see you.</p><p>YORK: In some cities, apparently it is too much to ask. But the -- look, the defund police movement, you've talked about it, President Trump talked about it last night on Sean's show, is this idea of redirecting funds, is - - is, in essence, defunding. If you -- if you -- if you take funds from Project A and redirect it to Project B, you've taken money away from Project A, you've defunded Project A. So if you take money from the police to move to public housing or mental health counseling or any of the other of programs that some Democrats have talked about, that is in effect defunding the police. It just is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Byron York.</p><p>And, by the way, Joe Biden did say that like a week and a half ago in an interview or a couple weeks ago.</p><p>YORK: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He said -- talked about moving funds. Guess what, that's defunding police.</p><p>Sorry, I know, it's early, 7:43 in the morning.</p><p>Byron York, thank you. It was great to see you.</p><p>Coming up, concerts adapting to a new normal.

The country music star and special guests Gwyn Stefani and Trace Adkins performing for one night only as 300 drive-in locations across the United States and Canada tomorrow night. The drive-in concert is part of a series produced by Encore Live.</p><p>Joining us now, the CEO of Encore Live, Walter Kinzie.</p><p>Walter, this is the second concert you've produced. The first was with Garth Brooks. Tell us about the response from getting -- that you're getting from music fans to this -- to the last event and this one.</p><p>WALTER KINZIE, CEO, ENCORE LIVE: Well, we've had one concert so far. Our next one will be tomorrow night. Over 350,000 people showed up to see Garth Brooks at the end of June. And we've amassed over 12 billion, with a b, impressions throughout media online in the last 30 days.</p><p>And so the world is talking about it and we're the only ones producing live entertainment on -- with scale. So it's a -- it's no wonder that everyone's talking about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Who else can we expect to see performing the rest of the summer?</p><p>KINZIE: Well, I'll tell you, we have a big announcement coming next week that you're not going to want to miss. (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, we're not waiting till next week, so you just better tell us now.</p><p>KINZIE: You have to wait until next week. I'm so sorry. But it is -- we're -- we're -- we're all focused on tomorrow night. We -- we're expecting several hundred thousand people to come out across the United States and Canada to see Blake.</p><p>But I will tell you with confidence, a major announcement is coming out next week and -- and --</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. Give me a hint. Well, give me a hint, is it a rock band?</p><p>KINZIE: You're intuition is very sharp. It's a --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Foo Fighters. Foo Fighters.</p><p>KINZIE: That -- that -- it's going to be a really big show, I will promise you that, by one of the greatest bands of all time. And -- and we fully expect we'll have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people from around the country and around Canada come out to see the show.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So -- my guess is Foo Fighters. We will check back in with you next week.</p><p>One -- one quick thing, though, because these concerts are shown in -- in drive-ins. Are you seeing -- I guess there's a -- there are a dearth of drive-ins in the United States. Are there more -- there's some abandoned screens around where I grew up. Like -- are you seeing people actually try to move to open more drive-in theaters thinking this is something that will be lasting?</p><p>KINZIE: You know, I tell you what, the entrepreneurial spirit has been incredible across the country. We're talking to farmers that didn't get their crops in the ground and so they converted their farms into movie theaters. Abandoned drive-in theaters from across America. When we realized in April that the rest of our industry thought we would be touring again by June and we're sitting there saying, what rock are you guys living under, we got really busy and we started acquiring these theaters across the country for exclusive content.</p><p>And now, today, we'll have Blake tomorrow night on over 398 showings and we're -- we're going to -- we're -- we have the content. We have the scale. And I've been very impressed in the resurgence in small town America and the entrepreneurial spirit.</p><p>About a week ago, or rather about three weeks ago, our team said, we have to capture this moment in time because nothing else is ever going to happen like this again. And so we actually have a pilot debuting next week where we're going to be talking about the building of this entrepreneurial spirit and the resurgence of small town America.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Awesome.</p><p>KINZIE: So it's an exciting time to be in the music industry.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Two words, Keysville, Virginia, look into it.</p><p>Walter Kinzie, thank you, sir. We'll see you soon.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Time for the \"Morning Buzz.\"</p><p>First up, new season, new name.

So I know you have some strong views on this.</p><p>I will say that anybody who knows me knows that this is the first and last time I will ever talk on TV about any professional sport. This -- wow, this just points to the politicism and divide in our country that the only name we can come up with is the name of the city.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's better than the Washington politicians.</p><p>Next, take a walk with chicken. KFC and Crocs teaming up again with a limited edition of chicken clogs. Each pair is made to resemble and smell like the iconic KFC fried chicken. They clogs, the Crocs, are available next week for $59.</p><p>Emily?</p><p>JASHINSKY: OK, first of all, ridiculous price point. Second of all, I don't understand why they have to smell like chicken. But what's interesting is that Popeye's has a clothing line as well. And so KFC, I think, saw what Popeye's was doing and said, let's put the chicken on a clog that was made by Crocs. And I think it's just -- it's really just a beautiful American creation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would rather men wear Crocs than flip-flops, even if they do smell like chicken. I'm against men in flip-flops as a rule.</p><p>JASHINSKY: And they're practical.</p><p>Let me get to this story. Finally, Bill and Ted are back. The long awaited third film from -- \"Bill and Ted: Face the Music\" will be released on demand in September. Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves are reprising their roles as the dynamic duo, taking a time travel adventure.</p><p>Mike, I'm a huge fan particularly of the first one. What do you say?</p><p>LEE: Hey, Dagen, I'm with you. I saw the first two in the movie theater. And I've got a countdown clock to September 1st to watch this to see the triumphant return of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan as Wyld Stallyns. This -- this will be another opportunity for my wife to stare at her phone and roll her eyes at me as I'm laugh historically on the couch to extremely sophomoric humor. So, September 1st, here we come.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's still got Keanu Reeves and the guy is still killing it, even -- well, even now. He does not age.</p><p>Still ahead, poking fun at life's everyday worries. The Insta-stars is making you laugh when you want to cry, next hour, on MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020072402cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60F2-1JB1-JB20-G3VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6907\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 24, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jim Banks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Police</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Seattle</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chicago</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Portland</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Entertainment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Music Industry</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp;

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 29th. Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the nose.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a big day in Washington this morning. Big tech on The Hill. CEOs of FaceBook, Amazon, Google and Apple will all appear for an anti-trust hearing this morning. What's at stake for these industry giants coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, the battle over stimulus is on. We are looking at the differences between the Republican and the Democratic plans this morning and how they impact your wallet coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is also Fed day. Investors listening closely to what Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has to say about the economic impact of the coronavirus after the central bank announced it is extending its emergency lending program. We'll hear from Jay Powell this afternoon at 2:00 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>A fiery hearing, meanwhile, on Capitol Hill between William Barr and Democrats. The hearing appeared to have more questions than answers, at least that were allowed. But as he was grilled, the AG had a question of his own, how long will we let our cities burn.</p><p>Meanwhile, federal agents pulling out of Seattle. Other cities could follow despite ongoing violence throughout. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is here this morning joining me live at 7:30 a.m. Eastern with more on the unrest in America and battling rising crime.</p><p>It's another big day for earnings. Dow component Boeing set to report any time. Meanwhile, General Electric posted results. It said it expects to return to positive cash flow in 2021. Health insurer Anthem with a double beat this morning. People delayed non-essential procedures due to Covid-19. All three of those stocks are trading up this morning.</p><p>The rest of the market, meanwhile, looks like this. Take a look at futures indicating a fractional move at the start of trading. It is positive. Dow futures up 7 points, Nasdaq futures up 47, and the S&amp;P right now higher by 5 points.</p><p>Stimulus uncertainty and the economy hit companies -- are taking -- due to the coronavirus, fueling losses on Wall Street yesterday. DowIndustrials were down 205 points yesterday, The Nasdaq was down 134, and the S&amp;P down 21 at 4:00 on Wall Street.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>And global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at European indices with the FT 100 up 13, the CAC quarante up 35, the DAX index in Germany is lower by 14 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher. Coronavirus cases are rising in Hong Kong. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam warning that the city is on the verge of a large scale community outbreak and that the hospital system could face collapse. The price of the Hang Seng index was up a half a percent nonetheless. The Shanghai composite the best performer, up 2 percent overnight.</p><p>Gold prices this morning working their way toward $2,000 in price. Now 660 this morning again. It's been on a huge run. Gold sitting at $1,970 and change.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, Dagen McDowell, Philip Wegmann and Scott Martin.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: Hi.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, President Trump says that he does not 100 percent support some provisions in the next coronavirus stimulus relief plan, calling them semi-irrelevant during his briefing yesterday. He added that the Democrats want Republicans to go with their needs. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says liability protection is a top priority.</p><p>The GOP is proposing a second round of $1,200 checks for Americans making less than $75,000 a year. Also in the plan, that $1 trillion plan of the GOP cutting the amount of the federal government pays in unemployment benefits from $600 currently to $200 a week. Democrats are looking for those payments to go up to $6,000 per household. They want to keep the $600 a week unemployment extension intact.</p><p>Sparks flying on Capitol Hill as Democrats spar with Attorney General Bill Barr yesterday during a heated House hearing. Democrats grilling Barr on the long list of topics yesterday, including his handling of the civil unrest in Portland. Barr fired back, accusing Democrats of turning a blind eye to ongoing violence across the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Federal courts are under attack. Since when is it OK to try to burn down a federal court? If someone went down the street to the Prettyman Court here, that beautiful courthouse we have right at the bottom of the hill, and started breaking windows and firing industrial grade fireworks in to start a fire, throw kerosene balloons in and -- and start fires in the court, is that OK? Is that OK now?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Barr also denying accusations that he's carrying out President Trump's political wishes. It was a big show in that hearing yesterday. All for show.</p><p>Grim, new milestones, meanwhile, in the Covid-19 pandemic. Six states reporting one-day records for deaths yesterday as Texas becomes the fourth state to pass the 400,000 Covid case mark. Dr. Anthony Fauci now warning parts of the Midwest, there are early sign that a coronavirus outbreak could be brewing in Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky.</p><p>Well, big tech is on the hot seat today on Capitol Hill. CEOs from Amazon, Apple, FaceBook and Google will testify by video before the House Judiciary Anti-Trust Subcommittee. They're expected to be grilled over their growing influence and the impact on competition. The testimony could help build public pressure for government action.</p><p>In separate statements, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai all emphasized competition that their companies face, as well as their contributions to the U.S. economy. Take a look at big tech in the pre- market. This morning we are looking at money moving into technology stocks once again. They are all up across the board.</p><p>Time for the \"Word on Wall Street\" where we look at what's driving markets and the economy. A major focus on earnings today.</p><p>Joining me right now is Kingsview Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Scott Martin, Walser Wealth Management President Rebecca Walser and Fairlead Strategies Founder, Managing Partner, Katie Stockton.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>First up, futures are higher, fractionally so, ahead of a big day in earnings. We are waiting on Boeing, General Motors, General Dynamics, other companies as well, all expected to report second quarter results before the opening bell.</p><p>Rebecca, how has the earnings period been so far from your standpoint and what are you expecting?</p><p>REBECCA WALSER, PRESIDENT, WALSER WEALTH MANAGEMENT: I mean I think it's been good so far. Obviously we've had some surprises. Starbucks yesterday was a surprise with a 7 percent, you know, same sales -- store increase. It shows that people are still willing to buy a seven -- you know, a $5 coffee. Obviously, you know, we're always -- we're expecting everything to be mixed. Some are down, some are up. It depends on what specifically is going on with that specific stock. Obviously cloud services, computing, Amazon buying, those kinds of things all this week. We expect, you know, sales to look good, robust. Cloud computing obviously robust.</p><p>But it's a mixed bag of retail. Obviously very hard hit. All of the travel very hard hit, Maria. So it's a -- it's a mixed bag.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Gold prices, meanwhile, reaching a new all-time high amid the economic uncertainty in the market.</p><p>Katie, you're also watching Bitcoin. Your reaction to what's taking place in Bitcoin but, more importantly, gold hitting a record high.</p><p>KATIE STOCKTON, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, FAIRLEAD STRATEGIES: Well, yes, I mean, both are positively correlated. Gold reached new all-time high, as you mentioned, clearing final resistance from 2011. And that breakout, if it's confirmed in price and time, bodes well for upside follow through. It's already a very well-established, long-term uptrend. But the gains have been very impressive. It was up, I think, about 11 percent from this month's low to this month's high. So really a pretty strong breakout for gold prices. And we're seeing the same from Bitcoin, which was up about 28 percent from this month's low to this month's high. That breakout there targets prices well above current levels, around 13,850 for Bitcoin. So some impressive breakouts there, irrespective of the drivers, the momentum is certainly behind gold and Bitcoin.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So in terms of gold, you would be -- you would be buying in here? Does this chart indicate this rally continues?</p><p>STOCKTON: Breakouts tend to be pretty actionable on the upside. I'd like to see them confirmed. And by that I like to see the securities fund more than just a day or two above a resistance level. So as long as gold can hold up above this 1920 level, which was that final resistance from 2011, I think that's a real breakout and it is something that is actionable from a long- term perspective, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Meanwhile, many investors rushing into money market funds, go figure with rates where they are, Scott. Is there a flight to cash?</p><p>MARTIN: Yes, I don't get it, Maria. Actually there has been. And I think that's just like a general de-risking that investors are doing. I mean at Kingsview we get a lot of inquiries every day about going to cash, which is a strange thing, to your point, because money markets don't pay anything and there's really no inflation, so you're not getting that erosion there. And also, I mean, the value of the dollar is dropping faster than, say, players on the Miami Marlins baseball team. So it's interesting as to why you'd want to hold cash here. So that's what I think is also boosting markets. And I think to the point that Katie made, it seems like gold and Bitcoin, Maria, may be taking that place of cash, at least in has in our portfolio, as a way to hedge or de-risk from equities and bonds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There -- there is a reason to believe if you've got increasing cash levels, Scott, then you've got potential for this market to go higher because of all of that dry powder, right?</p><p>MARTIN: Yes, big time. You've got pent-up demand. And I think you get that FOMO trade going again, Maria, where you just don't want to sit in the money market because you're lucky to get 1 percent these days at the banks, or sit at your brokerage house. So as that money kind of starts to see these companies, Rebecca talked about the tech stocks and how well they've done, as those start to get boosted up in price, the money's going to chase those names for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like that. FOMO, fear of missing out. Good one.</p><p>Katie Stockton, Rebecca Walser, thank you so much.</p><p>Scott Martin, you're here all morning, so we appreciate you being here.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning. We'll slip in a break.</p><p>Up next, Oklahoma Senator James Langford is here talking the latest on the stimulus bill and this mysterious story, scenes reportedly from China ending up in your mailboxes. Oh, yes.</p><p>Then, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is here on the growing unrest in largely Democratic cities. We will zero in on that.</p><p>Next hour, Delaware Senator Chris Coons talking stimulus and his new manufacturing legislation.</p><p>And then Trump 2020 Campaign Press Secretary Hogan Gidley talking the latest on the race for the White House.</p><p>Plus, who is watching you. One prominent pharmacy secretly using facial recognition technology for nearly a decade watching you while you shop. Don't miss that coming up.</p><p>All that and a lot more.</p><p>But first, this programming note.</p><p>Fox Business will be covering today's technology hearing on Capitol Hill. You can watch it all live right here starting at noon Eastern, don't miss it, on Fox Business.</p><p>Then this, you've got questions, we've got answers. Our new segment \"Ask the Panel\" begins next month. Send in your video questions at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:maria@foxbusiness.com\">maria@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Stimulus struggles. The battle over the next round of Covid-19 aid rages on in Washington days after the GOP unveiled its newest version. Democrats and some Republicans not sold on the newest proposal. President Trump weighed in yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All of the people involved, Steven Mnuchin's done a great job, keeps everybody together, both Democrat and Republican, and we'll see. We want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the economy because that means jobs and lots of good things, all right?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Oklahoma Senator, Homeland and Governmental Affairs and Finance Committee member James Langford.</p><p>And, Senator, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK): Good to see you again as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where are the sticking points? Tell us. We understand that liability protection is real important and then there's a debate around the $600 unemployment benefit a week. Steven Mnuchin's plan to do 70 percent with the federal government adding 20 percent to the state's 50 percent, that would be about $200 a week.</p><p>What's your take on where we are in all of this today?</p><p>LANKFORD: Yes, you're right onto the sticking points there, Maria. Obviously liability protection's a key thing. Businesses can't reopen. Schools can't reopen until they know there's some basic liability protection that are there dealing with this pandemic.</p><p>Now, this is not about gross negligence. Obviously if there's gross negligence that company or that institute would be responsible for -- but for basic operations, we believe that there should be liability protections across the country. As you mention before about the unemployment insurance, I've been overwhelmed with the number of people that have contacted me and said I have jobs open. I've been trying to hire for a long time now and people are saying, I will return after the unemployment benefits go down but I make more now on unemployment than I do on employment so it's better for my family to stay unemployed than it is to go back to employment.</p><p>Obviously that's discouraging to people that are actually still working, that they're working and earning their money and other people are staying home and earning more. That is always a problem. And that breaks the basics of unemployment insurance. So the target here for us is to be able to present an additional amount to individuals but not to get to what their previous salary was. Obviously we have to have an encouragement to return to work. That's what unemployment is in the past.</p><p>Another piece you hadn't mentioned before was on schools. The plan that we have given some assistance to every school across the country, but those that open will need more assistance. And so those schools that reopen actually will get additional dollars because they're going to have higher expense as well. It's not just blanketing money out to be able to target to every school as if they're the same. Some will have higher needs than others. And we're trying to target those with the highest need.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about some of your colleagues who don't want to vote for any new money and any new stimulus package? You've some people, like Senator Rand Paul, and Senator Ted Cruz who say, look, we've already got three stimulus packages, the last one still on the table with money yet spent.</p><p>LANKFORD: Right, there's still Paycheck Protection Program funding that's still out there. This new proposal changes some of the way that it happens, targeting towards the great -- the business with greatest need. They have to have 50 percent revenue loss for them to be able to get it. So I do see some companies that will need help to be able to survive this. There's no goal to be able to try to make everyone whole. But we're trying to do enough to be able to get everyone through this so we can still have an economy on the other side.</p><p>I see the virus moving health wise as it does economic wise. Some people get the virus, they really have no evidence on that. Some people end up in the hospital on a ventilator where there's mortality with it. It's -- the same thing happens to the economy. We have some segments of the economy and some companies that have thrived through this, that have had no effect or their business has gone up because they're in one of those businesses of highest need. Other businesses have had dramatic effects though this. So the main goal that I have is to make sure we're targeting funds towards those who need the help the most and not pouring somebody else's money, which is what tax dollars are, somebody else's money into individuals that don't need it or into companies that don't need it. so we have to have a more surgical approach than what happened in March.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right, because the PPP money in March went to some business who didn't need it, some big businesses as well. So I agree this focus on smaller business and those in need is really critical right now.</p><p>Where are the discrepancies with the Democrats? Is it just the fact that they want to have a much bigger package, $3.5 trillion? Are there specifics you can share with us in terms of where you're finding pushback?</p><p>LANKFORD: Yes, so there's significant pushback here. Take the unemployment assistance. That additional $600 per week that now goes away July the 31st, they want to take that $600 a week and extend it all the way into next spring, regardless if we have a vaccine, regardless of what it may be. $600 additional a week to everyone in the country, I think that's a terrible idea.</p><p>They want to also extend the economic checks that are going out to individual. They want to extend those to people that don't have a Social Security Number, those are people who have a tax ID and many of those people are illegally present in the United States. We certainly don't want to be able to do that.</p><p>They want to be able to change the way that we vote in America permanently and this has become suddenly a new proposal for them to be able to change voting, take away all voter ID laws across the country to federalize all elections. We look at that and say, well, what does this have to do with Covid-19 long-term.</p><p>And so there's lots of issues that they've got in their bill that we say that's absolutely absurd, we're not going to change all voting in America permanently. We're not going to do checks to people who are illegally present in the country. They have a lot of different proposal there on the environment, on things that would go OK, that that has nothing to do with Covid-19. So we want to try to keep the focus on issues that are actually related to health issues and to try to get through the economy, not to use this as a big wish list and over $3 trillion in a single bill is larger than the previous four bills combined.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. I mean the numbers that you're talking about, what your colleagues on the left want, it's like there's no acknowledgement whatsoever of the $21 trillion in debt that this country faces.</p><p>LANKFORD: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to switch gears and ask you about what is a mysterious story to us. Americans across the country have been receiving mystery seeds from China in the mail. Officials are urging people not to open or plant these seeds. What can you tell us about this?</p><p>LANKFORD: Yes, this has happened all over the country. And it's one of those issues that everyone says, oh, my gosh, the Chinese are trying to sneak invasive seeds into us. I think it's actually more just typical Chinese fraud that is happening. It looks like it's called -- what's called a brushing scam where a retailer, an online retailer, will just mail out packages, mislabel them. They're labeled jewelry or they're labeled toys. They get to a real address and once they're delivered to a real address they then take that address, use a fake e-mail address and write a positive review on their website saying I purchased this toy or I purchased this jewelry, it was delivered and it can be verified that something was delivered to them, but then they write a fake review on it to be able to bump it up.</p><p>So, again, I go back to the most basic thing, don't believe everything you read on the Internet, even some of those reviews that are out there, because it looks like this company is trying to bump up their reviews.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>Senator, wow, another scam.</p><p>Senator, good to see you this morning. Thank you so much.</p><p>James Langford joining us in D.C.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to have a choice in the first week in August and I promise I'll let you know when I do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was former Vice President Joe Biden teasing his running mate announcement coming next week. Biden was also photographed yesterday showing talking points on California Senator Kamala Harris, a potential frontrunner.</p><p>Dagen, did he give it away with that Kamala Harris talking points? What was your reaction?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maybe accidentally, but he needs to pick somebody who can be an effective not just fundraiser, Kamala Harris is, but also can be out there and campaign in public, in person, and that at least voters will feel comfortable with their ideas. Because, again, Joe Biden, he hasn't really proved that he is, well, all there, if you will. I think that there are definitely concerns about, again, his cognitive sharpness and he needs people not just his running mate, but people around him.</p><p>I think there's going to be pressure on him put to show who would be in his cabinet, who he's getting his ideas from, because he's already teamed up with Bernie Sanders. People who are still, you know, kind of left of center, not sure they would be comfortable with his, say, climate change program, which would send energy prices skyrocketing in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, well, that -- that unity document was something with Bernie Sanders. And like I have reported in the past, there's some on Wall Street who believe Elizabeth Warren will be a critical voice in his -- whether it's his cabinet, but a critical voice on economic policy.</p><p>Who is the person no one is looking at, Philip, that could get the VP nod? What do you think?</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Well, there's -- there's a universe of possibilities out here. To Dagen's (ph) point a second ago, the one thing that I would add on top of Biden needing a candidate who's going to help energize his base, who's going to help, you know, bring the party back together, both the more progressive side and the centrist, is that, you know, Biden needs someone who is going to be a loyal legislative lieutenant because if he does win the White House back, there's going to be a brawl with Senate Republicans and it's going to be a big fight to get anything to the finish line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Scott Martin, real quick, what do markets want to see? What do you think investors are betting on when it comes to the Biden camp?</p><p>MARTIN: Oh, they're betting on higher taxes, Maria, and more regulation on Wall Street and they don't like it. So I think going into the election, you're going to see a lot of volatility especially if the polls continue to show trends that we're showing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will keep watching that.</p><p>We're going to take a break. When we come back, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is here to discuss the growing unrest in largely Democratic cities.</p><p>And then caffeine jolt. Find out why Starbucks is seeing a jump in its stock this morning. It's rallying.</p><p>We're back in a minute.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 29th. A look at markets right now 7:31 am on the east coast it is a big day in Washington, big tech CEOs are testifying there.</p><p>Futures right now up 17 points and NASDAQ up 45 and the S&amp;P up 5.25 right now. Boeing is crossing the tape as we speak with an earnings miss on expectations. It was expected that it would report a loss of $2.54. It's actually reporting a loss of 479.</p><p>Revenue is also missing expectations as Boeing hits the tape right now. We're watching Futures to see if we get a larger reaction than just Boeing stock as we see the markets trading off this morning with the DOW up about 11 points. Losses yesterday on Wall Street yesterday as well take a look at 4:00 on Wall Street we had a triple digit decline.</p><p>The DOW Industrials are down 205 points and NASDAQ lower by 134 and the S&amp;P gave up 21 points yesterday. Global markets this morning with a firmer tone. European Indices right now are mixed with FT100 up 5 points, the CAC Quarante up 37 but the DAX Index is lower by 7 and three quarters.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher, best performers once again China the SHANGHAI Composite up better 2 percent. Boeing is out as you just heard. Let's get more details from Cheryl. She's got the numbers Cheryl right now.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, CORRESPONDENT, FOX BUSINESS: Well, first we were looking for a loss of 254 for the earnings per share Maria. We got a loss of 479. But if you look at the revenue, that was also a miss for Boeing. As you can see the revenue, 13.16 billion was the estimate. They came in at 11.8 billion.</p><p>But it's more about the commentary from the company that really Wall Street cares about right now. There goes the stock into the negative a couple things, the 737 Max, big area of focus right now for investors. Resuming production of the Max in May they already did that. But it's a very slow process they're telling investors right now.</p><p>They're also saying that this production of the 737 Max is coming in at low rates. Remember the FAA is still testing the Max right now. The Max has not been cleared to fly. We also heard the FAA say that they're going to actually have public comments on the Max.</p><p>The other issue is Coronavirus. They're saying that there is a big impact from Coronavirus and also officially ended production of the 747 and they're really slowing down the 787 and the 777. So it's a big production problem. Their numbers hurting GE earlier this morning because that's a jet engine maker, GE has a big engine business.</p><p>So a lot of triple - ripple effects excuse me from the Boeing numbers. As you can see, the stock is down and it's DOW component, down almost 1 percent right now. And also they're going to be talking in the call it looks like a lot more about employee retention rates and also staffing at the company.</p><p>We'll get more on the call from Dave Calhoun, the CEO. But again, we're watching Boeing stock in the red right now after reporting earnings. The only DOW component we're going to get this morning Maria.</p><p>Also I want to talk about Starbucks right now. We're watching this stock right now. They're saying that more than 5 percent increase, they were up more than 5 percent in the afterhours. Now the stock is up about 5.6 percent. 97 percent of their company-operated stores worldwide have reopened.</p><p>Good news here. That includes 96 percent of stores here in this country. 99 percent of stores are back in business over in China. As you know, that is a big market obviously for Starbucks. And then real quick Maria, I want to show you some of the stories that are trending on foxbusiness.com.</p><p>A new blood test can detect Alzheimer's disease with nearly 100 percent accuracy in 20 years before symptoms even begin, amazing. Netflix earning a record 160 prime time Emmy nominations the most ever for a single network and Dunkin teamed up with post consumer brands to create two new coffee flavored cereals.</p><p>So if you like to drink your coffee, you can now eat your coffee, Maria. A lot of news breaking in the newsroom but I'll send it back over to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much. Meanwhile Capitol Hill clashes, Attorney General Bill Barr delivering fiery testimony yesterday in front of the House Judiciary Committee. AG Barr going toe to toe with Democrats on a series of issues from Russia meddling to ongoing protests across the country. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Attorney General, the time is mine.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: You waited to talk to me like this. You didn't need to wait so long.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Attorney General, you did answer the questions.</p><p>BARR: Now you said under penalty of perjury. I'm going to answer the damn question. I asked another U.S. Attorney to look into the issue of unmasking because of the high number of unmasking and some that do not readily appear to have been in the line of normal business.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): I want to be clear. So there is another investigation on that issue specifically going on at the Justice Department right now?</p><p>BARR: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN: Can you give us that U.S. Attorney's name or is that something you're comfortable doing?</p><p>BARR: John Bash of Texas. Federal courts are under attack. Since when is it okay to try to burn down a federal court? The U.S. marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse of. That's what we're doing in Portland. We are at the courthouse, defending the courthouse. We're not looking for trouble.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Former Mayor of New York City, Personal Attorney for President Trump, Rudy Giuliani. Rudy it is always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here. What a state of affairs.</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Nice to see you, Maria. Well, I'm looking at that--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me how you see things? We had Barr yesterday. Yes, reaction?</p><p>GIULIANI: I see Attorney General Barr as one of our greatest Attorney Generals. Because he's being challenged in a way no Attorney General has ever been challenged and he hasn't backed off at all. The things he said yesterday in a normal America would be just okay, that's right, we have to defend a federal courthouse.</p><p>We can't let people loot. We can't let people steal from stores. We can't let people turn cities into war zones. The only people who seem to want that are the Democrats and it really is tragic because they want it in order to defeat Donald Trump. In other words, they want crime. I don't think they realize it.</p><p>They even want murder so that they can defeat him. Not one of them, not one of them spoke up for law and order. This isn't even a close question, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>GIULIANI: These cities - and these cities, the worst ones are all governed by Democrats. I can't imagine having governed New York City for eight years, and I took it over when I was in the worst shape possible, I can't imagine this happening in the 1990s. We were never even close to anything like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know.</p><p>GIULIANI: This is anarchy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to get back to New York because obviously NYPD is under attack. But let me just stay in Portland for a second. Because one thing that is just not even being acknowledged is the fact that you've got anarchists wearing gas masks going right up to the courthouse with a saw and the local police can't do anything.</p><p>They're told to step back and this is what the Democrats are calling peaceful protests. There are two agents right now who may not get their eye sight back. We are waiting to see what happens because the anarchists were shining lasers in their eyes.</p><p>Chad Wolf was with me on Sunday, he said we're waiting to see how they are. We hope that they get their eyesight back but they are now impaired. No recognition of the fact that what's happening in Portland is totally different than what's happening across the country in these cities. They're not going to send in the federal agents that they have in Portland to somewhere like Chicago because it's really about protecting the courthouse and the federal property.</p><p>GIULIANI: That's absolutely correct. And there are people who recognize what's going on? President Trump is the one who recognizes what's going on. Republicans recognize what's going on. And everybody else that isn't blinded with the sickness of hating Trump, President Trump so much that they don't care what happens to America.</p><p>I mean, you have to be blind not to - I'm sorry I used that because of the poor gentlemen that are suffering. I pray that that not happen. It broke my heart when I was Mayor--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly--</p><p>GIULIANI: --police officers with injury.</p><p>BARTIROMO: --we're all praying for them.</p><p>GIULIANI: But this is a war--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mayor de Blasio said we don't want anybody from the federal government coming to New York, the NYPD is under serious attack, Rudy, you know this. Violent protests in New York earlier this summer racking up a big bill for taxpayers there's that as well. This is costing a lot of money.</p><p>NYPD told the New York Post that nearly $1 million has been spent to repair more than 300 vandalized police vehicles. That's just the police vehicles, Rudy. In terms of what's going on in New York right now.</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, there have been close to what 1,000 police officers injured and the reality is the moron who is our Mayor doesn't know there are many, many federal agents in New York City right now. They called the drug enforcement administration, the FBI, alcohol, tobacco and firearms, the IRS.</p><p>I used to be in charge of them when I was United States Attorney more on. And they're enforcing federal laws. And I'm going to tell you one law that exists, it's the law against using drugs, illegal drugs, including for your knowledge, Mr. Mayor, marijuana.</p><p>I never prosecuted a marijuana case but the fact is that they have jurisdiction and one of my suggestions which I'll make openly is wipe out the drug dealers in the neighborhoods that have the most shootings and you will bring down those shootings by 50 percent. DEA can do that.</p><p>They should target two or three top areas for shootings and they should go in with federal agents and they should take out the people who are controlling those blocks like the little children that are shot, they get shot in cross fires with drug addicts. 70 percent of the shootings in New York--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>GIULIANI: --have to do with drugs and the idiot who is our Mayor release them from jail because he doesn't consider it a violent crime. If you don't realize drug dealing is a violent crime then you're too stupid to be Mayor or you're too malicious to be Mayor or you're a communist who wants to see the overthrow of our of way of life.</p><p>Which is what is at stake here, Maria. They are trying to fundamentally change the nature of our country and I'll be damned if I'm going to let them get away with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, no wonder the police are saying, look, I'm out of here. They're not getting the support from the Mayor or the Governor. Look what's happening in terms of Milwaukee and the Democratic National Convention?</p><p>Police are pulling out of the DNC the Milwaukee Police Chief announced that dozens of law enforcement agencies have backed out of security agreements for the Democratic National Convention. This convention happening next month some are citing recent orders by the Milwaukee fire and police commission to stop using tear gas and pepper spray.</p><p>So Rudy they're basically saying to the cops, yes, we want you to protect us but we're not going to give you the tools you need, you can't use pepper spray or you can't use tear gas but still protect us. They said we can't protect ourselves in that regard, we're going to pull out.</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, go read the Marxist manifesto of Black Lives Matter and you'll find that one of the things they want to do is break the connection between us and the police. As well as do away with nuclear families. They don't like fathers.</p><p>They're at war with our way of life. When I went to the Democratic Convention four years ago, I was the one that discovered, because the Philadelphia police all came up to me and told me that Hillary Clinton would not have uniformed police officers on the floor of the convention because she didn't want police around.</p><p>Now it's gone to the point where they're trying to put these police in jail. Some of these Democratic Mayors have gone so far that they're almost like criminals. They're on the side of the criminals. I think people don't realize it because--</p><p>BARTIROMO: You hit on something that I want to ask you about before you go.</p><p>GIULIANI: --depressed - they're like criminals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of these cities are being run by Democrat Mayors and Governors. So what is it? Is it the policies that are making them vulnerable to all of this crime? Connect the dots for us in terms of the Democrat leadership.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GIULIANI: Two Ps, policy and pandering. I used to say that when I became Mayor. This isn't a question of atmosphere it's a question of policy. You have the wrong policies, you have the wrong results. We had that for 30 years in New York on the Democratic Mayors.</p><p>Number two, in addition to having the wrong policies, which is letting criminals out of jail, not really enforcing the law correctly, giving criminals benefits they shouldn't get, letting 8,000 criminals out like the idiot in New York did.</p><p>They also pander, pan decks pander, pander, almost like they have no backbone. Black Lives Matter says put our sign up but don't bother to read that we want to do away with families with fathers. Don't bother to read we want to do away with all private education, all parochial schools, gone. Don't bother to read that. These idiots go yes, yes, yes. They have no backbone.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's an incredible moment, Rudy. Love getting your insights as always. Thank you so much, Rudy Giuliani. We'll see you soon. Rudy, thank you. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Watch out for secret cameras, Rite Aid deploying facial recognition systems at hundreds of its locations across the country. According to an alarming new investigation by Reuters the drugstore chain capturing customer faces for more than eight years, largely in lower income and nonwhite neighborhoods. And only recently did they stop this practice.</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge what a story. Obviously there are real privacy concerns here. We want you to tell us, is this legal?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, good morning, Maria. It's a novel area of the law. There are a lot of problems with it. I'll startle you at the outset. The software was made in China. So you know where this information is ultimately--</p><p>BARTIROMO: I knew it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: --ultimately going to be stored. So there are two ways to look at this. One is you don't have a right to privacy in public you willingly and knowingly expose your face. The other is you don't expect to be spied upon when you're in a store shopping.</p><p>By the way, this facial recognition software has a very high error rate and often misidentifies people. Stated differently, people were approached in these stores by store security who thought they were someone else who had already been thrown out of the store for attempting to shoplift.</p><p>The person approached was totally innocent, was not the other person. Now you have a false arrest case. So the whole thing is a mess. Apparently you're right it did go on for about eight years. The people who were actually harmed by it, those who were misidentified and suffered consequences because of the misidentification have a cause of action against the stores, against rite aid or whoever has been doing this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, I've been told that there are trillions of pictures of all of us in government portfolios that government has our pictures as well. Look, the horse is out of the wagon on this one. Facial recognition is being used and how is it any different than, for example, Apple capturing fingerprints or clear using biometrics? We're being identified in a lot of ways.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, when you give your finger print to Apple you're aware that you're doing it. You do it knowingly and voluntarily. When you walk outside the Fox building, you're picked up immediately by at least a half dozen, if you don't know where they are, they're easy to see, New York City cameras owned by the government.</p><p>We know that that stuff is out there. I disagree with this but the government has persuaded everybody that it's worth the loss of privacy in order to make it easier for them to find the bad guys. But when you go into a store and you don't know it's happening, when your privacy is secretly being violated, when you're being misidentified as someone whom you're not, that's a very serious issue. That will have economic consequences on the store.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a very important point, Judge. Thanks very much for making it. Great to see you sir. Thank you, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Stay with us. We'll be right back big hour coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back time for the Morning Buzz. First up, giving back billions McKenzie Scott formerly McKenzie Bezos, now the ex-wife of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos giving away nearly $1.7 billion to charity intending to donate the majority of her money. Dagen, wow, what numbers?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, CORRESPONDENT, FOX BUSINESS: I know. Let's think about how she wound up with all that money. First, this is a giant monopoly that is squeezing smaller businesses out of business. Number one and two, raises the issue of how's the new girlfriend spending the billions or fiance or whatever they are?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, but yes. Yes. Well, she says McKenzie's giving it away which is great. We'll take a look at what charities they are. How about this beer without the buzz Anheuser-Busch rolling out Budweiser zero with just 50 calories, no alcohol, its geared towards the health conscience and apparently tastes like an actual bear.</p><p>The alcohol free beverage endorsed by former NBA player Dwayne Wade who helped design the packaging. So what do you think? Would you drink nonalcoholic beer?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, Anheuser-Busch is betting that people buy Budweiser for the taste. But I think that the virtues of Budweiser are that it's cheap alcohol and trying to sell a beer without alcohol, that's a bold strategy. We'll see if that will work out.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Scott (ph), what about you? Are you in?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I'm in. I think it's one of those things where you're not going to notice the difference. You could give somebody NA beer; you give regular beer and Budweiser kind of tastes so bad anyway it is going to be all the same.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, you've got questions, we've got answers. Our new segment, \"Ask the Panel\", begins next month. Send in your video questions, we want to know what's on your mind. Send them to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:maria@foxbusiness.com\">maria@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll get them on the air. Much more ahead, next hour, right here. \"Mornings with Maria\" is live on Fox Business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, July 30th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now, just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big tech is in focus. FaceBook, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, and Apple all reporting earnings tonight after the closing bell. This after their CEOs were grilled on Capitol Hill yesterday about anti-conservative bias, business practices, privacy and China. Highlights from the fiery hearing coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stimulus stalemate now. Lawmakers far from an agreement on the next round of coronavirus aid. This as the extra unemployment benefits, $600 a week, are set to expire tomorrow. The coronavirus effect on the U.S. economy today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. We'll get the first read on the second quarter GDP. It's going to be a tough one. It's expected to show a record breaking contraction of 34.1 percent. Plus, initial jobless claims are expected to rise for a second week in a row. All coming out in an hour and a half.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve not even thinking about raising rates now. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell saying that the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetime, warning containing Covid is essential to protect our health, as well as the economy.</p><p>Stocks to watch today. UPS is surging after a big double beat this morning. The coronavirus leading to a rise in demand. The stock is up, as you see, about 11.5 percent. Qualcomm is also jumping after earnings, as well as reaching a long-term patent settlement with Huawei. That stock up this morning 11.5 percent.</p><p>Broader markets, meanwhile, are lower. Futures indicating a sell-off at the start of trading this morning. The Dow futures are down 264 points, the Nasdaq down 137, the S&amp;P 500 down 36.</p><p>Markets rallied yesterday, meanwhile, following the Federal Reserve's decision. At the close yesterday, the DowIndustrials were up 160, the Nasdaq was up 140.</p><p>Meanwhile, unrest in America penetrates with violence raging in major cities. Federal agents will start leaving Portland, but the administration says, not so fast.</p><p>And then this, the NBA tipping off today. Players taking the court in a bubble at Disney World with empty stands.</p><p>Fanduel CEO Matthew King is here at 8:40 a.m. Eastern on how the virus is impacting gambling as well as sports in general.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning are weaker. Take a look at European indices. Red across the board. FT 100 down 122, the CAC quarante down 80 and the DAX index lower by 374 points. That's because of economic data out of Germany today. The German economy shrinking a record 10.1 percent in the second quarter, due, of course, to the coronavirus shutdowns.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly lower, but really fractionally moving pretty much across the board.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, Dagen McDowell, Mark Tepper and Steve Forbes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, another round of talks between the White House and Congress on a new Covid- 19 stimulus bill set for today with no compromise in sight yet.</p><p>Republicans are proposing a second round of $1,200 checks for Americans making less than $75,000. Democrats want to extend that $600 weekly unemployment benefit, but Republicans are pushing to cut the amount to $200 a week. Just to be clear how this works, the state will replenish 50 percent of lost earnings. The Republicans want to add 20 percent to that, take it up of to 70 percent replacement of earnings. That number roughly is $200 a week.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejecting President Trump's support for a short- term bill if the two sides cannot reach an agreement by tomorrow when those enhanced jobless benefits expire.</p><p>And the U.S. reaching a grim milestone in the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. has now surpassed 150,000 deaths, now leading the world in death as well as in cases. Seven states reporting a record number of deaths in a single day, yesterday.</p><p>All members of the House of Representatives are now required to wear masks while on the floor after Texas Congressman Louis Gohmert tested positive for Covid-19. Attorney General Bill Barr was tested after being with Gohmert at Tuesday's House hearing. Barr tested negative.</p><p>And federal agents are expected to begin leaving Portland today as the city sees its 63rd straight night of unrest. The Trump administration, as well as Oregon leaders, reaching a deal yesterday to withdraw the agents after accusations of excessive force used against protesters. This as the White House announces the expansion of Operation LeGend, deploying agents to other cities, like Milwaukee, Cleveland and Detroit, to put an end to the violence and vandalism.</p><p>All right, time for the \"Word on Wall Street.\" Joining me right now, former publisher and editor of \"The Gartman Letter,\" Dennis Gartman is here, along with Capital Wealth Planning Advisory Board Member and Founder of Saut Strategy, Jeff Saut, and Strategic Wealth Partners President and CEO Mark Tepper.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>MIKE TEPPER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Likewise (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: First up, that showdown on Capitol Hill. We've been talking about it all morning. The CEOs of Google, FaceBook, Amazon, Apple grilled by lawmakers on their business practices.</p><p>Here's a bit of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): Why shouldn't Instagram now be broken off into a separate company?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I think with hindsight it probably looks like obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious.</p><p>REP. PARMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Would Amazon ever access and use third party seller data when making business decisions?</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON: We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business. But I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does Apple not treat all app developers equally?</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: Sir, we treat every developer the same. We have open and transparent rules.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you're saying that the more user data does not mean the more money that Google can collect?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: Congresswoman, most of the data today we collect is to help users and provide personalized experiences back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, all those four companies are due to report earnings tonight, all four from the tech giants. As you see, they're trading down this morning ahead of the numbers.</p><p>Mark, do you see Congress taking action any time soon on any of this?</p><p>TEPPER: Look, these things take years to play out. I would say that two companies that are most at risk would be FaceBook and Google. FaceBook, for censoring points of view and controlling the narrative and Google for having a search monopoly. But, you know, it's -- it's because it's the best. If you want to use Bing, feel free to do so.</p><p>You know, but the thing about these four big tech companies is they have carried investors' portfolios all year. And they've carried investors' portfolios for the last several years, but they seem to be stalling out right now from an investment standpoint. You know, they've actually underperformed the market since the beginning of July.</p><p>When I look at all four of these names, Apple in particular has seen its forward multiple nearly triple over the last 18 months with zero growth. So that's alarming and that's a position that we've been trimming. We own all four of these, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, look --</p><p>TEPPER: Amazon, in my opinion, is probably the best positioned. The knock on them right now is the cost of new employees, but we all know good employees are an investment, not a cost.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, Mark, you've also got big fees that these companies have faced because of settlements they have to do with Europe. The European regulators have been even tougher on companies like Google than the U.S. Are we going to see that kind of problem that they face, that they're going to have to pay up in terms of big charges from regulators like they did in Europe?</p><p>TEPPER: Yes, so, I mean, these -- those are big to people like us. But to them, you know, at the end of the day they're insignificant.</p><p>And, look, we love, from an investment standpoint, we love identifying companies that had a great long-term growth story that are surrounded by controversy. It provides a great opportunity to get in at a good price level. So that's why, you know, I wouldn't be shying away from these right now, even if there is that overhang.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I just want to say that after the hearings, Congressman Cicilline told \"Axios\" that a breakup lawsuit against FaceBook, quote/unquote, is an easy one.</p><p>State of the economy next. The first estimate of the GDP, the second quarter GDP coming out in the next hour. It's expected to show a record- breaking contraction, 34.1 percent in terms of this quarter performance. Initial jobless claims also coming out today. The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits possibly rising for a second week in a row. We are above 40 million on that count.</p><p>Jeff, what will be the impact of this economic data this morning, in your view?</p><p>JEFF SAUT, ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, CAPITAL WEALTH PLANNING: I don't think there will be much of an impact, Maria. I think the market is looking by that. Everybody knew the GDP number was going to be bad, the employment number is going to be bad. But I think the markets are forward-looking by six to nine months. And I think in six to nine months from now that the economy will be doing better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jeff, do you think we're going to have a 20 percent second half. That's one thing Larry Kudlow has said in the past, 20 percent second half. Is that the kind of bounce back you're expecting?</p><p>SAUT: I don't know if you're going to get 20 percent, but I think 12 months from now the S&amp;P will be at 4,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. And right now it's at 3,218. So you're looking at buying stocks, obviously, to participate in that.</p><p>Let me ask you about the gold rush, guys. Investors flocking to gold in all of this amid the pandemic.</p><p>But, Dennis, you say the trade is getting crowded at this point.</p><p>DENNIS GARTMAN, FORMER PUBLISHER AND EDITOR, \"THE GARTMAN LETTER\": Well, the trade is ridiculously crowded. As Yogi Berra once said about a restaurant in New York, nobody goes there any more, it's too crowded. And the boat or the restaurant of the gold market has become egregiously crowded. I couldn't get people to buy gold 2.5 years ago at $1,200, $1,300, $1,400, $1,500 an ounce. Now they're piling in at $1,800 and $1,900 an ounce.</p><p>So I had been very bullish of gold. And in a bull market, it's still a bull market. It will be higher six months from now. It will be higher a year from now than it is now. But in the next two weeks or three weeks, with the crowded -- the conditions that prevail, can it be $100 an ounce lower, yes, absolutely, I think it shall be. So it's just a little too crowded. Call it trader's intuition, but I'm out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So -- so a little too crowded to get in here at $1,969.</p><p>GARTMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, Dennis, broadly speaking, should an average investor have some gold in the portfolio?</p><p>GARTMAN: Oh, no question, 5 to 10 percent is probably what everybody should have at any one time. If you had -- if you've been up to 10 percent, probably should knock it down to 5 or 6 or 7 percent at this point. But, yes, everybody should own a bit of gold predicated upon concerns that the monetary authorities everywhere, whether it's the Fed, Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Japan are all vastly expansionary and shall continue to be. And that's what's driving gold prices higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you -- it sounds like you all think this market's going higher over the next year.</p><p>Jeff, are there areas you want to be invested in given that you do see the S&amp;P 500 up to 4,000 within a year?</p><p>SAUT: Well, technology is probably the number one sector. Right now I'm buying the two most out of favor sectors, I'm buying financials and energy because they're all unloved and they're -- and they're cheap and they have good forward earnings momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's hard to find cheap in this market, that's for sure.</p><p>Gentlemen, great to see you all. Dennis Gartman, Jeff Saut.</p><p>Mark Tepper, you're sticking around. You are with us all morning.</p><p>Good to have you here today. We will continue watching, gentlemen. Thank you.</p><p>Much more ahead this morning.</p><p>Coming up next, Florida Senator Rick Scott is here live to talk about the latest on the coronavirus package and then the stalled stimulus plan, where are we.</p><p>Plus, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz joining us on big tech's grilling on Capitol Hill. It was his committee yesterday. He'll give us the inside.</p><p>Then, next hour, former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders talking about the stalled stimulus talks and the conservative bias in social media.</p><p>Back in the game coming up. The NBA restarts today in a bubble. We are looking at the state of sports gambling, coming up with the CEO of Fanduel.</p><p>Back in a minute with all of that.</p><p>But, first, past due. Back rents swelling in America as lawmakers offer no eviction relief just yet.</p><p>Plus, you've got questions, we've got answers. Our new segment, \"Ask the Panel\" begins next week. Don't miss it. Send us a video question to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:maria@foxbusiness.com\">maria@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A devastating milestone to report. The United States has passed 150,000 Covid-19 deaths yesterday, now leading the world in death as well as the number of cases. Florida setting a new single day death record as well with 216 new Covid-19 deaths yesterday alone.</p><p>Joining me right now is Florida Senator and member of the Senate Armed Services Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committees, Rick Scott.</p><p>Senator, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): Good to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Condolences to you and to all of us, the United States seeing this incredible milestone.</p><p>How do you see it in Florida?</p><p>SCOTT: Your heart goes out to these families. I think we all now know somebody that has probably passed away -- that has passed away and it's just devastating these families. And so, you know, and every one of us has got to, you know, do more. We all have to wear masks. We all have to social distance. I think government needs to give us more information so we know where not to go. And so we -- there's -- we're -- we're not out of this yet. I'm very hopeful that there's a vaccine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCOTT: We've got to open this economy. Assume we don't get a vaccine for a period of time, get our economy open --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well --</p><p>SCOTT: And get back to normal but do it in a safe manner.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's right. And we are going to be living with this for some time. That's just a fact.</p><p>So White House officials and Congress meeting today on a new Covid-19 stimulus bill. Negotiations seem to be at a standstill right now, Senator. It comes at a critical time. We've got the enhanced jobless benefits set to expire tomorrow. What do you want to see in this new bill one it's finalized? What are you likely to vote for?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, first off, we've got to take care of the people that -- that have lost -- that lost their jobs. That's the most important. I grew up in a family -- I watch my parents not have a job. It's -- we've got to help those people.</p><p>I know we're going to do -- try to do something just on that today, just take care of the people that -- you know, the unemployment. So hopefully something positive will happen on that.</p><p>We've got to help our small businesses. And this has got to be a stimulus bill where we're focused on how do we get this economy going again. We -- we need to have -- we need to have tax cuts. We need to have liability protection for our small businesses. And we can't keep wasting money.</p><p>I mean, think about it, Maria, we have spent over $50,000 in just already in the bills that we've passed per unemployed. How much has that actually gotten to anybody that lost their job? We have money in there for the FBI building. We have money in the past for the Kennedy Center. Let's make sure this is how we get this economy going, help the people who have lost their jobs, help our small businesses open again.</p><p>And so I think -- I -- I think this is -- right now it's going to be tough to get something done because the Democrats just want to spend money. They -- they want us to bail out the bad budgets, the prior budgets of states that don't want to live within their means, like Illinois and New York and California and New Jersey. And I'm going to fight that. This is somebody's money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you make a good point because a lot of these cities and states were under strain way before Covid-19 because of their mismanagement of their own budgets.</p><p>So what about that, money to the cities and states? This is one of the sticking points, right? The Democrats want more money to the states and cities.</p><p>SCOTT: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How much?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, we -- think about it, we've already given them over $500 billion, $500 billion and given them access to loan -- loan amounts of $500 billion. And that's not enough. And we gave them money to deal with coronavirus relief. We gave them money to deal with Medicaid costs. Medicaid costs are down. We gave them money for their schools. We've given them unbelievable amounts of money already and they want more. And we know they haven't spent the money they have.</p><p>Now, they don't want to give us a lot of information, they just want us to give them more money to pay for their pension plans which they -- which they wouldn't fund, to pay for their budget deficits, which they keep just borrowing money.</p><p>You know, Maria, this idea that states have to live within their means, they don't, they just keep borrowing money.</p><p>I was the governor the first -- the first eight year Cuomo was governor. Guess what he did? Every year, borrow more money. Just borrow more money. He has all these liberal projects. I am not going to let Florida taxpayers pay for Andrew Cuomo's excesses. It's not right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so Andrew Cuomo's excesses being what? What do you -- explain to our audience what you mean.</p><p>SCOTT: So, first off, think -- just think about it real simply like this. When I left office a year and a half -- years ago as governor, before I became a senator, his budget was almost double mine and I had two to two and a half more people that live in Florida. And just by itself, think about it, I mean he spends -- you know, he spends -- he's got $3 billion for climate change bonds, all right? But every part of his budget, he's -- he wastes money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see. I see. All right. Well, that's obviously a sticking point.</p><p>But the president has allocated $105 billion for schools. Is that the right number, real quick?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, we -- I think what -- we're clearly looking at that. We've got to get our schools open. We've got to get our schools open. We've got to get our -- get our teachers comfortable to come back, our parents comfortable that their kids should come back and we've got to give people an option, either if you want to teach at home or if you want to go back to school, you ought to have that option. So we're looking at whether that's the right number or not, but we've got to help our schools.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Senator, great to talk with you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>We, of course, will be watching the developments, as are you. Rick Scott joining us there in Florida.</p><p>Coming up, TikTok on the chopping block. The new White House battle over the controversial app from China.</p><p>Then, claws are out. PETA going after the \"Tiger King\" now and it's making a buzz this morning.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Unrest in Portland. The governor of Oregon saying that federal officials guarding the federal courthouse will be leaving by today. But the Trump administration is insisting some agents remain until local authorities have a plan to restore law and order.</p><p>President Trump weighed in on this yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look at the anarchists in Portland. If they don't solve that problem locally very soon, we're going to send in the National Guard and get it solved very quickly, just like we did in Minneapolis and just like we will do in other places.</p><p>They want to solve their problem. They've got a very short time to do it. But they'll either solve their problem or we send in the National Guard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's unbelievable what's taking place.</p><p>Dagen, how do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think it's disgusting the messaging that you get from, say, the governor and even the mayor that the presence of federal officers are to blame for the violence. So it's not the anarchist, it's not the rioters, it's not the vandals, it's not the criminals who are committing actual crimes. The responsibility falls on federal -- the federal force that's been present. That's just an upside down world in the left wing loona-verse (ph) as I call it.</p><p>I do want to point out that some of these vandals and criminals are so stupid that they have their name tattooed across their back. There was one man who was just arrested and he had his tattoo -- he was arrested for torching the justice center in Portland and the Portland police bureau and he had his name tattooed across his back. That's how they apprehended him. So kudos to the idiocy that throws him behind bars.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And what you just said is exactly what's going on, they are trying to burn down federal buildings. That is why the federal agents are in Portland. We should not mix this with what's going on, for example, in Chicago where shootings were up year-to-date or in New York City where shootings and crime is also up.</p><p>Here they're using commercial grade fireworks and -- and the federal agents have a mission to protect these federal buildings.</p><p>Mark, a lot of people have been trying to mush all of this together. It's not the same. Operation LeGend is very different than what's happening in Portland.</p><p>TEPPER: It's different across the United States city by city. So I live in Cleveland. You know, obviously, there are -- so there's some -- some help coming our way as well. I was just downtown over the weekend. I -- it was kind of a ghost town. I didn't see much going on. But, hey, if there's a spike in violent crimes, obviously there's a lot of stuff you don't see.</p><p>Look, the way I look at this is it's really the mayor's responsibility to protect their cities. If they're not going to do it, somebody else has to step up to the plate. And how does the oath go? I'll protect the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. These seem to be domestic enemies to me. So I really don't see what the issue is here.</p><p>Look, if people want to see what it's like to live in a world without police, move to a third world country, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TEPPER: It's not fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well -- well --</p><p>TEPPER: As for me, I'm going to stay here knowing that 99.9 percent of police officers are good people doing their job the right way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. And when you look at what's happening in this separate effort, which is Operation LeGend, the Justice Department is going to send officers to three cities, 25 officers to Milwaukee, 25 to Cleveland, 40 to Detroit, already underway in Kansas City, Chicago and Albuquerque. And this is basically an operation of the FBI, the DEA, the ATF and it's a surge in officers to address violence and unrest, illicit narcotics, crime in places like Chicago.</p><p>Your brother-in-law is a police officer, is that right, and you're from Cleveland?</p><p>TEPPER: He is. Yes. And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark?</p><p>TEPPER: He -- he has seen -- yes, he's seen an escalation in issues where, you know, there's victims of crimes that are trying to bait police officers right now. So it's very, very difficult -- you know, obviously, I'm not a police officer, he is, but just hearing it secondhand, it's difficult for a lot of these police officers to do their job the right way. I mean it's not good to have a bunch of police officers protecting you that are afraid of protecting you the right way, you know?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, because they -- they don't have the tools. They've been - -</p><p>TEPPER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The tools have been taken from them, actually.</p><p>All right, we will keep watching this. This is a serious situation playing out across our country.</p><p>When we -- we'll take a break. When we come back, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz is here with us talking about his committee's grilling of big tech on Capitol Hill. He was in the room, among the questioners. We'll get into it.</p><p>And then we're looking at Cape Canaveral where NASA is launching its newest Mars rover any minute now. We are going to show it to you live.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Thursday to you. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, July 30th. A look at markets right here at 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Ahead of the second quarter GDP out this morning, we are expected to show record-breaking declines and an initial jobless claim which once again shows a spike. Futures are pointing to a selloff at the start of trading this morning. Dow Industrials down 232 as the GDP for the second quarter expected to be down 30 plus percent.</p><p>The Nasdaq down 116 points this morning, the S&amp;P 500 down 31.</p><p>Markets rallied yesterday following the Federal Reserve's decision. They basically said we've got all the tools and we're going to use all the tools to fight this. The DowIndustrials were up 160 points, the Nasdaq was up 140, and the S&amp;P was up 40 points yesterday after the Fed meeting.</p><p>UPS a stock to watch this morning. The stock is soaring on better than expected earnings. The shipping giant reporting strong demand due to the pandemic. The stock is up 10.75 percent right now.</p><p>Global markets, though, mostly lower. In Europe it is red across the board. We did get some economic data out of Germany. The German economy shrinking a record 10.1 percent in the second quarter due to the coronavirus shutdowns. The German DAX index is down 356 points right now. This right here, this is the low of the morning in Europe. The FT 100 down 110 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly lower, although here you've got fractional moves pretty much across the board overnight in Asia.</p><p>Well, the late Congressman John Lewis will be laid to rest today in Atlanta.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with more on that right now.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria.</p><p>President Obama will deliver the eulogy today at the service for the civil rights icon. Presidents Clinton and Presidents Bush also are going to attend the service. It's going to be held at the same church where Martin Luther King Junior once preached. Hundreds of mourners paid their final respects yesterday at the Georgia State Capitol. Lewis died at the age of 80 after battling pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Well, President Trump says the U.S. will pull nearly 12,000 troops from Germany as part of a multibillion dollar restructuring plan. Sixty hour hundred troops are going to come home and 5,600 are going to be moved to other NATO countries. The transfers are opposed by both Republicans and Democrats, but President Trump maintains that Berlin is not spending enough on defense. The president tweeted, Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for energy and we are supposed to protect Germany from Russia. What's that all about? Also, Germany is very delinquent in their 2 percent fee to NATO. We are, therefore, moving some troops out of Germany.</p><p>Well, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is planning to make recommendations about TikTok to the president this week. The controversial app is being investigated for a 2017 transaction that skyrocketed its growth. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has suggested the U.S. may either ban the app or limit users. There are concerns that Beijing based ByteDance could use TikTok to pass on American's information to China's government. TikTok's CEO Kevin Mayer slamming FaceBook, accusing the site of anti-competitive behavior. FaceBook has launched a similar app called Reels on Instagram overseas.</p><p>And finally here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.</p><p>This November, San Francisco residents will vote on a so-called overpaid executive tax that will target companies who pay their CEOs at least 100 times more than median workers.</p><p>Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen's Manhattan apartment back on the market. A bargain price, $13.7 million.</p><p>And a Virginia Chick-Fil-A has ended its Food for Coins promotion after an overwhelming response from the community.</p><p>And those are your headlines from the newsroom, Maria.</p><p>Back over to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>It was a heated back and forth yesterday on Capitol Hill. The CEOs of FaceBook, Amazon, Alphabet and Apple testified virtually, facing tough questions from the House Judiciary Anti-Trust Subcommittee about competition, privacy, China and anti-conservative bias.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Can you assure Americans today you won't tailor your features to help Joe Biden in the upcoming election.</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: We -- we won't do any work, you know, to politically tilt anything one way or the other. It's again our core values, honestly.</p><p>JORDAN: But -- but you did it in 2016.</p><p>Despite the fact you did it in '16, President Trump won. I just want to make sure you're not going to do it again in 2020.</p><p>I'll just cut to the chase, big tech's out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.</p><p>The power these companies have to impact what happens during an election, what people -- what American citizens get to see prior to their voting is pretty darn important.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): It is possible that at FaceBook your employees do have the power to disadvantage conservative viewpoints.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: Of course when you have tens of thousands of employees, people make mistakes. People have some of their own goals some of the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Florida Congressman, House Armed Services and Judiciary Committee member, as well as House Anti-Trust Subcommittee member, Matt Gaetz.</p><p>Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>Give me overall what struck you most about yesterday's hearing.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): The bipartisanship. Republicans and Democrats are working together to take on some of these America last technology companies. Whether it's Amazon stealing products, FaceBook spying on their users, or Google refusing to work with the U.S. military and then jumping overseas to advantage the targeting capabilities of Chinese fighter jets. I think it's right for us to ask not what America can do for our technology companies, but perhaps what our technology companies can do for America.</p><p>And I'm excited about the fact that Republicans and Democrats are actually working together on this issue because it will define the future, how users will interface with our major technology platforms.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess everybody agrees that they are more powerful today than they ever have been.</p><p>When the Telecommunications Act of 1996 first went into law, they gave these companies protections, technology companies protections that they are not going to get sued, that they are, quote/unquote, bulletin boards or platforms. Do you believe that is no longer true? And what will Congress do about it? Will we see these protections be taken away?</p><p>GAETZ: And, Maria, you're specifically talking about liability protections that digital platforms enjoy under the auspices that they are neutral, that they do not advantage one side or the other and that's they shouldn't get sued. Those particular protections have allowed these companies to grow very large, but we haven't always seen the neutrality.</p><p>What we learned from the hearing yesterday is that particularly with Google and FaceBook, the people that work at those companies have the ability to go and manipulate what you see and what you think because they want to control how you act. The fact that they made those concessions means that the Department of Justice needs be a lot more aggressive about mandating the transparency that would append to these liability protections. So we don't need more government, perhaps we need fewer of the special government accommodations that benefit these large platforms that then are unfair to the viewpoints that aren't reflected in the woke-topia (ph) of Silicon Valley.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, so what are the odds that that protection goes away then?</p><p>GAETZ: I think that the protection will go away if the anti-trust division at the Department of Justice engages in aggressive litigation to showcase the lack of neutrality on those platforms. I do not believe that Congress will change the law because far too much of Congress is bought off by big tech, whether it's through PAC donations or whether, frankly, a lot of big tech goes and hires up everybody's staff to go work for them and it's quite an incestuous process. So it won't be a consequence of any brave action from Congress. We largely lack that bravery. But if we have just a little bit of gumption over at the DOJ, I think we can really force the transparency that will animate the changes that will allow us to be able to use online platforms in a way that allows users to seek the information they want rather than being socially controlled by Silicon Valley big tech overlords.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. And some people do expect anti-trust lawsuits coming, like against Google and FaceBook.</p><p>GAETZ: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen, weigh in here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, indeed, Maria.</p><p>I just want to point out that the anti-trust probe into Google is the most advanced of the lot, according to reporting in \"The Journal.\" The Justice Department expected to file a suit this summer. Then you also have the Justice Department, the FTC and state attorneys general looking into various parts of these businesses.</p><p>But, Congressman, it was the lack of action by people in Washington over the years that allowed these companies to get as large as they did. In 2006, when there was a Republican in the White House, Google was allowed to buy YouTube. And that is part of its power base. In 2012 it was FaceBook was allowed to buy Instagram. So maybe you -- do you bust these companies up at this point or do you certainly take a more aggressive posture in limiting their growth through acquisition? In many cases they buy up these companies and just shut them down.</p><p>GAETZ: I don't know that busting up big tech is the sole remedy. I think if you force them to demonstrate why they believe that they should avail themselves to these liability protections, they will actually change their behavior.</p><p>But let me just be honest with you about how things have worked at the Department of Justice with Republicans and Democrats in the past. A lot of the people that are at DOJ end up going to work for big tech. And so what they want to do is create just enough virus in terms of anti-trust litigation so that they can then leave the Department of Justice, go work for big tech and sell the antidote. It's a pretty corrupt process that existed with Republicans and Democrats in the past.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>GAETZ: And I think Attorney General Barr and President Trump understand the importance of this, they're serious, and this round of anti-trust litigation will be far more effective.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I agree with you about Bill Barr.</p><p>Real quick, Congressman, let me ask you about China. You brought up China during yesterday's hearing, asking Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, about his dealings with the Chinese military. You said it a minute ago, they walked away from Project Maven (ph) because their employees were all up in arms that they didn't want Google to work with the U.S. government and yet they have an AI lab right there in Beijing. And we all know that when you're in Beijing, that means you're working for the Chinese military in terms of technology.</p><p>Your thoughts on the China threat?</p><p>GAETZ: Google has an AI center in China. They have a multi-million dollar collaboration through the Singua (ph) University where the Chinese military is plowing cash. And some of the top talent from Google has been cited in Chinese state media talking about China rattling the world with their power. And so I think that Google needs to be a lot more aggressive about ensuring that they're not advancing the interests of other countries at the expense of ours.</p><p>But the one good thing, Maria, is that Sundar Pichai took the pledge that he will not adopt the anti-police bigoted policies that his employees have asked for. They -- they got us out of the DOD deal, but they won't allow us to deprive police of basic digital services.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think this is a really important point that you brought up, Congressman. I hope you stay on it because Google and that AI center in Beijing seems to be quite dangerous.</p><p>Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. We'll keep watching. Thank you, sir.</p><p>GAETZ: Good morning. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Matt Gaetz joining us there.</p><p>Be sure to check out the congressman's new book, \"Firebrand: Dispatches From the Front Lines of the MAGA Revolution\" by Matt Gaetz. A great read. Check it out.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Online shopping is surging. One company benefiting big time from the e- commerce explosion during coronavirus is Shopify, easily beating expectations with its latest earnings and revenue for the online retail platform nearly doubling from a year earlier.</p><p>Joining me right now is the chief operating officer of Shopify, Harley Finkelstein.</p><p>And, Harvey, it's great -- Harley, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.</p><p>HARLEY FINKELSTEIN, COO, SHOPIFY: Thanks for having me back, Maria. Great to be on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So -- so, first, assess the situation for us, Harley. Tell me how good a quarter it was and what really struck you about this last three months.</p><p>FINKELSTEIN: Yes. Yes, I mean, Q2 for Shopify was great. Revenue was up 97 percent. GMV, meaning the sales on the platform was up almost 120 percent. But I think this is a story of independent retail and entrepreneurs and small businesses doing really well right now and during the pandemic. And I think what's happening is consumers are voting with their wallets that they want to support their small businesses and the entrepreneurs in their community and around the world.</p><p>And I think what we're seeing really out of this pandemic is a tale of two retail worlds. On one side you have the resistant retailers, those that are going out of business because they couldn't adapt fast enough. But there's an entire other side which is very exciting and I'm optimistic about, which is the resilient retailers, those that quickly pivoted their businesses, those restaurants that turned into wine shops, those brick and mortar stores that moved online very quickly. And most of them did that using Shopify. So it's been a really interesting time for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, if you don't have a delivery mechanism and you can't adapt easily to either delivery or park side -- you know, curbside pickup, you are at a serious disadvantage in this shutdown?</p><p>FINKELSTEIN: You are, which is why as soon as the pandemic hit, we threw out all of our plans for the year. We said that all your road maps need to be put on pause in terms of the folks that work at Shopify and we said we need to figure out a way to help entrepreneurs and small businesses not only survive the pandemic but also thrive.</p><p>So we got started quickly on doing things like gift cards so that service- based businesses can begin to collect money and get some cash flow. We added new curbside pickup and local delivery options for anyone that used Shopify point of sale in their brick and mortar store. And they did it. And then, again, the consumer decided that this is how they want to purchase.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FINKELSTEIN: We took e-commerce, remember, before the pandemic started, e- commerce was about 15 percent of total retail sales. Today, it's more than 30 percent. So we've had 10 years' worth of growth in e-commerce in the last three or four months and some of -- some of those businesses, those independent brands, have done really well. It's not going back to -- to a previous version. This is the new steady state.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and we spoke with Max Levchin last week about your deal with Affirm.</p><p>FINKELSTEIN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know you've been striking various deals.</p><p>How important was the Affirm deal for you? Real quick. I want to get into this Discovery new series, but tell me about the Affirm deal.</p><p>FINKELSTEIN: Yes. Me too. I mean, look, we believe that any way that we can make it easier for consumers to check out online quickly, effectively and affordably is a great way to do it. And the partnership between Affirm and Shopify is a great way to do, you know, to do installment payments.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>So, Harley, you've got this new series premiering on The Discovery Channel. It's called \"I Quit.\" What's the premise?</p><p>FINKELSTEIN: Well, first of all, we think a world with more entrepreneurs is a better world. I think you and I have discussed this on your show in the past, Maria, we both are big fans of small business.</p><p>But if you look at most of the content being created on television, for entrepreneurs, it really is around drama. It isn't necessarily an inspiring way to get more people to think about starting a business. And we felt that, right, honestly, Shopify is the entrepreneurship company. We want to create a show that inspires more people to become entrepreneurs. And so we're following five different companies -- five different groups of people that have side hustles but full-time jobs. They end up quitting their jobs and they end up full -- working full-time on their businesses and they do incredibly well. And we want to create an entire new generation of entrepreneurs through the show with Discovery.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. Love that side hustle. We'll be watching it on Discovery.</p><p>Harley, good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Time for the \"Morning Buzz.\"</p><p>First up, claws out. \"Tiger King\" star Jeff Lowe and PETA in a legal battle over a Halloween costume. Lowe objecting to PETA's tiger king getup. The animal's rights organization rejecting a cease and desist, calling Lowe's claims absurd. The costume costs about $160.</p><p>Mark, what do you say about this?</p><p>TEPPER: Well, unfortunately, they just foiled my Halloween costume idea for this year, so now I have to go back to the drawing board.</p><p>Look, I'm surprised it was PETA that came up with the tiger killer costume and not Carole Baskin, because we all know about that ongoing quarrel between Joe Exoitc and Carole Baskin.</p><p>As for the lawsuit, what do you expect? We live in a litigious society. It seems a bit frivolous to me, but, you know, that's part of the course anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess so.</p><p>All right, next up, Brooks backing out. Garth Brooks saying that he's withdrawing his name from Entertainer of the Year consideration at the CMSs. The seven-time winner of the country music honor says it's time for somebody else to hold that award.</p><p>Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Praise Garth not just for his music and his kindness, but for his self-awareness because we need more of that in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure do.</p><p>All right, and, finally, love and AI. Scientists using artificial intelligence to predict what makes a successful relationship. The new study says believing your partner is fully committed is key to romance. Appreciation and intimacy also rate high.</p><p>Steve, your reaction?</p><p>FORBES: You need scientists for that? I'm the father of five daughters. If you want to know about relationships, start reading novels by Jane Austen and take it from there. You don't need the scientist to get you into that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, good advice.</p><p>Still ahead, former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders is here on the stalled stimulus talks, the conservative bias on social media and the upcoming 2020 election, all right hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020073002cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GB-5X51-DXH2-6001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

So for some that have already heard this, sorry for repeating this, today is almost -- it is exactly my 25th year on the sell side as a tech analyst. And what better way to celebrate that by hosting Aneel Bhusri, back again. Truly exciting to have you back on. And I think we've -- I've known you for 20-plus years. I forget, mid-'90s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANEEL BHUSRI, CO-FOUNDER, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, WORKDAY, INC.: We've been friends for a long time. You continue to impress me with your wardrobe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Thank you. Thank you. And you're very consistent. You're very consistent.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Well, you want to go from a hoodie last year? Was it a hoodie last year or the year before?</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: We keep changing. We keep evolving.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: The hair stays the same.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: All right. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Congratulations, 25 years.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. And congratulations in all the successes you've had. Two great stories back to back. People stop and work. Every year, the story continues to evolve and takes on bigger and broader and bolder dimensions. And so thanks for all the value creation for shareholders. Everybody along the way. It's fantastic.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: I want to touch upon just 2 things, get them out of the way because these are topical and on people's minds. Your thoughts on the trade war. How does it pertain to Workday? And secondly, the whole topic of regulation. Maybe it's not pertinent to Workday, but you saw the stock market really get impacted in a pretty good way yesterday. Pertinent to the [finance]. But maybe what's on people's minds is does it have any percolation effect in software. Maybe it doesn't, maybe it does. Just wanted to get your thoughts on these 2.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Okay. Well, on the trade wars, which continue to expand to new countries, I can say that we're not exposed to China. We're not exposed to Mexico, either. But our customers are. And that's the one thing that we have to pay attention to. But we don't sell directly into China. We've always been careful because of their lack of data privacy rules and our set of core values that we have to be in countries where data privacy and security are paramount. And I know that for in China, we couldn't guarantee that to our customers. So at this point, we sell to Chinese multinationals, like a higher Lenovo, but no other real exposure.</p><p>But I happen to be on the Board of Intel, and they're in the middle of all this. And so for companies like Intel and others, will it impact what they spend on enterprise, software and cloud software? I don't know. We haven't seen it yet. We haven't seen it yet. But I don't know.</p><p>In terms of the regulation, I frankly, I won't say welcome it, but we do need better data privacy rules in the U.S. And I am always second after Marc Benioff to remind people that our business model is protecting customer data. There are other companies who have business models that sell customer data. And just don't put us all in the same bucket because that's not right. We've been great stewards of our customers' data since we started the company, as has Salesforce, as has ServiceNow, as has all the enterprise companies, where we build systems to protect the data.</p><p>We're one of the, not only early followers, we actually helped the EU with the GDPR rules. And so we'd be delighted to help with the rules here. So I'm not sure we don't qualify as big tech, but big tech that's consumer oriented. I don't think it's the worst thing to get some regulation. And they could have been ahead of the curve. And instead, they're going to get it -- get told what to do by Washington, which I think is probably not the right way. But I think -- I still think they have a chance to get ahead of the curve.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Thanks. Market perspective. I just wonder if it's going to cost fund flows to benefit the software sector. Although it did seem that way yesterday.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: No. We were down $12, no.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Certainly, not yesterday. I wanted just start off with digital transformation, which is something that you've been front and center very early. Your sort of company and a lot of other companies are starting to talk about it. As it relates to improving the employee experience, how does Workday -- because the mandate of Workday, the mission of Workday 5 years back was very different from what it is today. Or maybe it is not. But I just wanted to see how you would define digital transformation as far as the employee's concerned and how does Workday as a company describe its mission to empower the employee experience?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Well, I think to your point, it has evolved over time. But one of the founding principles was definitely to create a consumer Internet style user experience for employees to engage employees. When we started out, it was much more focused on core HR services. It's now expanded to recruiting, learning, performance, a whole host of other expenses. Obviously, financial management. And that focus on employee engagement and transparency, getting them the information to make better decisions has always been core to what we've been about. It's just that the areas we're doing it have expanded to a much broader footprint. But it's very simple. The most powerful systems don't necessarily have the most functionality. Although I think we're very good on that dimension. They're the ones that people like to use. And you don't wake up and look at a training manual for Amazon or eBay and you shouldn't have to look at a training manual for Workday. And part of this transformation is making systems very accessible.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Besides Bank of America, are there other customers that you could point out to and say these guys have done a fantastic job implementing the whole employee engagement cycle with Workday products?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Well, we've got 2,700 customers, about 70% are live. So there's lots of good stories out there. Coca-Cola's a great story. Amazon is going through deployment. Walmart is going through deployment. One of most fascinating ones to me is Walmart. We are live with Sam's Club, and they've got, without getting into the details, they've got several million employees and they're using Workday as a platform for not just an HR system, but for engagement because they don't have all the e-mail addresses. Turnover is high and they're trying to change the culture. Doug McMillon is one of the most impressive CEOs I've come across in a long time. And they're really using it to modernize the way that they deal with their people. So it's a very cool project.</p><p>All the big tech companies in the Valley, Google, Facebook, Adobe, Salesforce, they all use Workday, and I think they do it in a nice way. Oracle doesn't use Workday, but that's about it. I think they're the only one.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: You've got to work hard on that one. I know you and I talked about the misperception that the TAM, total available market, for HCM is defined by the old lens. And you've always believed it or you've grown to increasingly believe that the TAM for HCM is a lot larger than people think. Just drill us with that notion back again, why do you believe that HCM TAM is a lot larger than people think?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: We're all a function of our past lives in history. And historically, HCM was an administrative system around HR, payroll and benefits. But what's gotten sucked into the HCM platform includes performance management, now recruiting, learning, and each of these are huge categories. Now there's health and wellness as an emerging category. Broader integration into the benefits platform is an emerging category.</p><p>When I sit down with CEOs 20 years ago, they didn't talk about HR. Today, they all want to talk about talent and their people and how did they recruit the best, how they retain the best, what's best-in-class from compensation perspective, from rewards perspective. So it's definitely just -- the category has just gotten a lot bigger. And one day, we're looking at it and say all the data is around HR payroll benefits, but the category's a lot bigger than that because we're selling into a lot more areas. So it's always been a 2:1 difference between Financials and HR. And I think, actually, HR is now 1:1. I think the market size for HR is...</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: 2:1 meaning financials.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Was twice as big, and I think it's actually 1:1. I mean we're still early in the cloud journey. And we were pretty successful at PeopleSoft, but we peaked and -- at a much smaller revenue number that was a license base revenue number than we are today and I still feel like we're still in the early days of HR [product].</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: The way rapidly compared to -- even the midpoint of the PeopleSoft cycle just kind of grew through and you didn't see back then. Last year when you were here, you talked about a long-term plan to be a $10 billion revenue company. There's also the view that you could go from wherever you were to 5, for the most part, organically. Then after that, you would have to make some acquisitions. Help us understand what are your refined thoughts on that long-term journey for Workday to be a $10 billion revenue company.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Robynne, can I talk about this? Our CFO is in the audience. It's our internal goal -- we haven't really talked about it publicly. It's our internal goal that somehow became external. When I look at the categories that we're in, HR, financials, planning, analytics, there's no question that there's enough there to get us to a $10 billion revenue run rate. The question is how long does it take?</p><p>And do I think we could use a fifth pillar? Possibly. It could be Workday Cloud Platform as our fifth pillar. It could be a new area that we decide we need to acquire into. There are not that many areas that are that -- that are open that fit the cross industry model that we have. I feel very confident that we've got enough products and breadth of offerings to get to 5 and then 10. Might we do something inorganic to accelerate that? I mean if we find something like Adaptive, we would do that again. Maybe that was -- acquisitions are hard, large acquisitions in particular are very hard. That one has worked out really well.</p><p>But the CEO is one of my best friends, completely complementary technology, very similar corporate cultures. Space was hot. Cloud. I mean there's a lot of things that -- that came through a very tight aperture for what makes a good acquisition.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Maybe since you mentioned Adaptive, I'm just curious. This is the new start of the fiscal year. You've had Adaptive for 2 quarters, start period of last year. As you post this new fiscal year, what are the things that Workday could be doing with Adaptive that you could not quite do last year? Go to market, product, customer reach?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: We just continue to refine the go-to-market piece. I would say that the first thing we decided to do was really just not get in the way of their business momentum and they're best at bringing -- selling into their core markets, which is probably more SMB and medium enterprise than our core market. And the leverage has been from, they had 6 or 7 enterprise sales reps. As you know, we have hundreds for large enterprise. It's been to put the product into the hands of our large enterprise sales representatives to either sell it as an add-on to Workday, HR and Financials or as part of a larger deal. And that has worked, I think, even better than we had hoped. So that's where -- I was talking about synergies and an acquisition scenario. And the synergy came from leveraging Workday's customer base and sales channel to the high end of the market where Adaptive really wasn't playing and it has worked out the way we thought.</p><p>So going into this year, we're really not going to change it that much. They're going to continue to sell into their market with their -- the Adaptive standalone team. We're trying to really let them run as a standalone sales organization.</p><p>We'll continue to drive it up market. But over time, you can see it -- you can already see it going from financial planning, which is their strength, to workforce planning into a whole host of other planning categories. And it's a huge market. People ask me all the time about Anaplan. The market's definitely big enough for both of us. It's just Anaplan and Adaptive and the cloud planning space. So we tend to be more focused on financial planning and now workforce planning and they tend to be more focused on sales and operational planning. So the fact they don't butt heads that often. But it's been great so far.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Yes. Excellent. I was surprised to see that you had, what, 50 deals, platform deals that included Adaptive. And how broadly trained is the Workday sales force selling Adaptive? I know that you got the specialist that came from Adaptive.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Yes. If you remember, we had our own planning product that was probably 2 or 3 years behind Adaptive. So they were -- they sold a lot of it, which tells me that they're really good at selling a product that wasn't quite ready for prime time. And then once we figured out it wasn't ready for prime time, we bought Adaptive. So sales force was really well trained on the planning space, especially the financial -- the financials specialists. Planning is just a core part of any accounting solution, and they really know how to sell it.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Is there a potential upsell to that installed base that bought the Workday core planning product? Or do you get that for free since you already made the commitment and now you've got Adaptive?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: So for all the Workday Planning folks, they are all transitioning to Adaptive. We have basically sun setted the Workday planning product, and we're doing it on our -- they don't spend anything. They're already subscribed to the Workday Planning product.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Yes. Yes. So the notion that Adaptive was mid-market-ish and a plan was high end, the scalability is different. Where are we in that plug in that scalability gap that exists or used to exist between...</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: I think the scalability gap was much more a sales and marketing issue than a product issue. There were definitely areas for Adaptive that they needed to invest in. But when I look at our base -- so could they do financial planning for Walmart at this point with 1 million SKUs? Probably not. We're not selling financials to Walmart at this point. So it's not really an issue. When I look at our core markets for Financials, there's no company we look at to say they couldn't use Adaptive. Adaptive scales to very large companies. And frankly, I think it was more of an issue of investments in sales and marketing that they only had 7 enterprise sales reps.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Seven?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Seven. Yes. And most of the market, the motion they had was geared towards the SMB and medium enterprise. And so we're taking these into -- this last quarter, we sold to Airbus. We sold to AstraZeneca, H&amp;R Block. These are large Fortune 500 companies. And we went through their performance criterion. We have no concerns at all that it won't scale for them.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Are we likely going to see -- was there a question there? I'm sorry. If there is a question, just raise your hand and we'll get to you. Can you point to any nice go-lives on the planning side, a big Fortune 500 customer?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Well, Workday went live in less than, well, how long was that? 2 months? 2 months. So that was our guess. And now dozens. I couldn't...</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: You're a Fortune 500 company, right?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: No, pretty close. Pretty close.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Maybe next year. Maybe next quarter [for run rate].</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: That's what I'm closest with. No, go-lives in the Adaptive world are different than they are for ERP and for HR. It's a month to 2 months, right? So these are fast go-lives. It's not as complex as a business process transformation. It's really getting the data in and getting the financial processes that you want in place. So they're at the same place we are. 2/3 of their customers are live and they're selling new customers pretty regularly.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Would you say that there's so much awareness of planning that there's pent up demand? Or is it more of Workday bringing some marketing products there and convincing customers? Is it something you got to do?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: I'd say it's a bit of both. There's no question that planning is a hot category unto itself. And still even with the legacy planning systems that were out there, there's lots of companies we come across there using Excel to do their planning. And they need a better tool. They need a more secure tool. They need one source of truth. And the cloud has made planning just a lot more accessible to lots of companies than they might have been in the legacy world.</p><p>So I think we definitely market and sell it. But there are people on the receiving end who know exactly what they want, and they're in the FP&amp;A group or in the workforce planning group and they're looking for tools like Adaptive. So we're not in the create awareness as much as making sure people realize we're in the space.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: I remember covering Hyperion back in the day and a few other planning companies, Cognos acquired a planning company. Informatica acquired -- not Informatica, but BusinessObjects were quite a planning company as well. There's a big installed base. I mean are you seeing replacements of old legacy?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Absolutely. Yes.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Is that a big base or not big enough...</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Yes. In the Fortune 500 market or Fortune 2000 market, almost every company we come across has a legacy of planning. When you get below that, they might be on Excel. When you get to universities, you get to state local government, they might be on Excel. But for the Fortune 2000, they are largely on a legacy planning platform. And in the same way they're replacing human resources or accounting and moving to the cloud, planning is next. And frankly, I've said this before, knowing what I know now, I would have had Workday go into planning before we build core accounting. They're both now in the right place at the right time. But we were definitely swimming upstream with core accounting for many years where the planning market was already happening.</p><p>It's a really nice way to wedge into a customer opportunity without having to deal with any of the transaction systems. And if you do a good job on planning, it should lead to other opportunities.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Got it. Got it. I know that you've said that getting and implementing planning puts you in a better position to acquire the financials inside of the business. Now with Adaptive under Workday, is that thesis proving to be [a good one]?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Absolutely. Yes. So we have a pretty sizable HR base, 2,700 customers. 1/4 of those run Financials. So 3/4 are not running our Financials. We get planning in the door. And now they have HR and planning. When they do come to market for core financials in the cloud and 2 out of the 3 things are already run by Workday, I think it puts us in a really good position, especially because the planning piece has now gotten us into the office of the CFO, which HR doesn't. Planning definitely does. And again, if we do a good job for the CFO and we're so focused on customer success, I would hope that, that would bode well for core accounting. So far, it's only a couple of quarters, but the data is pretty positive.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Got it. Got it. To replace planning, legacy planning systems is one thing because that market is comprised of small companies that didn't quite hit the scale. But replacing Financials is a completely different ballgame. So when you look at -- we listened to 2 CFOs at your user conference, fascinating go-live examples, Fortune 100 companies. I'm curious, what do they replace while going live on Workday Financials? I was just stunned that there are 100 countries going live on Workday Financials. What did they replace?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Well, so our typical replacements are the same as they are in HR. It's PeopleSoft, SAP and Oracle. And it's usually because there's a business need. It might be a new set of requirements that they need to deal with. It might be mergers and acquisitions. It might be 606. It might be a whole host of things. And at the same point, they're facing a painful upgrade of the legacy system. That point they look outside. 5 years ago, honestly, for a lot of companies, we just did not have the functional footprint to turn off a legacy system. Companies aren't going to choose Workday and still run a legacy system. It has to be able to turn off the legacy system.</p><p>And now I feel very confident that for a typical Fortune 500 company, global, that was a big investment in our part, we can turn it off. And what the customer gets in return is a modern accounting system that deals with all of today's accounting regulations, a system that was built more to be a business partner than just an accounting hub. A system that stays current with all the regulatory and technology changes over time; way, way better analytics, embedded analytics, now integrated planning.</p><p>And so the promise of a new financial system is there for the CFO. I would say, historically, they don't like to change systems unless they have to. But now they're reaching end of life on so many of their legacy systems that it's a good time for us now.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: My colleague, John King, yes, he's -- my friend and colleague, John King, covers European technology companies. And he has a question for you. John?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Do you cover SAP?</p><p>JOHN PETER KING, RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I do. (inaudible) that may or may not be related to the question. But just in terms of the verticals you currently address with Financials, will that be the same in 10 years' time, 5 years' time? Is there (inaudible) in the space [that you've seen]?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: In 5 years' time, I think it'll stay pretty consistent. And the way to look at us from a financials perspective is our Financials work everywhere that's not manufacturing a retail. And I think over time, we'll get to retail. But manufacturing involves a supply chain and raw materials, and that is not really our goal at this point. And that is -- I think that is still the strength of SAP in particular. If in 5 years' time, that market still has not moved to the cloud, I don't think that market is ready to move to cloud right now. That could be the change between that 5- and 10-year time that we broaden out to be a full scale ERP company. But right now, we're looking at ERP for services companies, not product companies.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: More questions, John? Anything else in your mind? Okay. I want to get into a more mundane topic and get that out of the way.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Other than your outfit?</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Yes.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Does the shirt actually match the jacket?</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: I'm color blind. So...</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Obviously.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: But I tried. It's so dark when I wake up. So anyway, I don't know what I'm doing.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Does it match? Is it okay?</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: I don't know. I don't know. Black and brown. The really deep question that I have for you is, is Salesforce going to print an okay quarter?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: I sure hope so.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: The whole world is waiting because you guys put up an unbelievable quarter. That was just way beyond the wildest expectation. So there were some interpretations that maybe Workday communicated a shape for the rest of the year that was more back-end loaded. Maybe that was a wrong interpretation. I just wanted to give you the chance to clarify your thoughts again on how the year is likely to shape up. Is it just because you got -- as I look at 2016, you had some massive deals in the -- towards the end. So it's just the renewal cycle that...</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: I think every year, as we get bigger, our business becomes more seasonal and that's all. And really, what we're just trying to make sure is that all of the analysts are aligning their models with how we see the business unfolding. And it really hasn't changed for the last 6 months. I just think we just want to make sure everybody sees it the way that we're seeing it. We just want to be very transparent on it. But the pipeline is very healthy. I'd say, with Financials, Financials becoming a bigger part of our business. That is definitely more in the Fortune 500 segment, more of a Q4 -- Q3, Q4 business, and that's really all there is. Not -- another big question's about the macro slowdown. We might all see a macro slowdown from these trade discussions. We haven't seen -- we're not seeing one right now.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: That's very good to know. Very good to know. I joke to clients that in the last 10 years, we've had 10 recessions in software because certainly, a stock market have seen average correction peaking 20%, 25%, none of which is accompanied by estimate revision. Something I learned from my boss and he said, with this estimate revision downward, then you know the cycle is starting to go south. But we've not seen estimate revisions go the other way.</p><p>So we've had 10 recessions. These are all great buying opportunities.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: No. I just think we're in a really interesting time, technology-wise. When I think about cloud and I think about it compared to mainframe and client server, all those technologies kind of petered out because something better came along. And the cloud is the first architecture where it absorbs the next generation, right? So if we're back in the client server days, the machine learning popped up, we have to start from scratch and rewrite everything. In the cloud, the way the architectures work, if you're a truly native cloud like us and Salesforce and ServiceNow, Amazon, Google, truly native cloud, you could have just absorbed machine learning into your foundation.</p><p>It's a lot of work. But you don't have to start from scratch and it's not going to replace legacy systems. So it gives the cloud platform a lot longer runway than I think people are used to from past technology cycles where they're worrying about what's next.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Very good point. Yes.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: There's no question that machine learning is what's next. And in the old technology, it would have been the disruption that brought in a lot of new entrants. But in this case, all of the native cloud providers are just embracing it and building it into their foundation. So I still see room for startup to do it different, and we're doing it.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Talk about machine learning. There's a brief mention of it on the earnings conference call. How does it play? The next 4 to 5 years, I mean that we might have the data. You're going to be in a very, very good position. How does Workday look at machine learning and the opportunities that are presented to the company?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: So I'm a big fan of this book called Prediction Machines. If you haven't read it and you want to get into the economics of machine learning, it's not about the technology, it's about the economics. It's a great read. It's written by 3 professors from the University of Toronto, which is one of the really early pioneers in machine learning and artificial intelligence. And the basic premise of the book and the way Workday looks at it is machines are really good at making predictions. Humans are not -- machines can absorb massive amounts of data and predict the weather. And now on your phone, it'll tell you it's going to rain at 7:18 a.m., and then it starts raining at 7:18 a.m. It's because the predictive capability with machines are so powerful. Humans have judgment, which machines don't have. And I just don't see machines having judgment any time soon.</p><p>So think about all the areas where you like your prediction and then a human take advantage of that prediction and make a better decision. My top salesperson is at risk of leaving. Machine tells you that, now you can decide what you want to do with that. You can automate things like audits where a lot of the audit stuff is routine. And you need a senior auditor to look at the exceptions while machine learning can do the basic audit and just flag the ones that require judgment to the senior auditors. Clear planning recommends your next job that you should take based on the thousands of people that have come before you and looking at their career paths...</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: What's the next job that I should take?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: What's that? Fashion designer. Well, actually, if you don't know, he's also a great singer. And that's all serious. If you are Facebook friends with him, he does an incredible impression of Freddie Mercury. True. It's really eerie. You've got 3 of the 4 octaves. Is that right?</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Yes. 3 out of the 4 octaves that he has. Yes. But my latest is opera. I've moved on to opera.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: So anyways, so coming back. So machine learning to me is going to be a core technology that in 5 years, if your system isn't run by -- we talked about cloud first and mobile first. I think it'll be machine learning first where the systems can make a prediction. Again, the native cloud providers who have all the data in one place have a huge, huge advantage to training the algorithms to get better and better over time. But in 5 years, your HR and finance system is going to predict what might happen and then you're going to make a decision what to do as opposed to having a whole bunch of business analysts trying to figure out -- trying to find that needle in the haystack from the data -- the machine's going to do that for you.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: All right. This is something that we discussed last year and the year prior. It's not something that I really was prepared to ask you. But just curious, we've had change in leadership at Google public cloud; former adversary, now running the show on that front. What is your assessment of Google now under new leadership?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Oh, I didn't know about Oracle. I still don't know. By all accounts, he's a very talented executive. And I look forward to meeting him. Google is a good partner and a customer. So I suspect that we'll get a chance to meet. I didn't have any interest in meeting him when he was at Oracle. So he didn't have any interest in meeting me. So I don't -- I think that Microsoft and Amazon are really well positioned for the enterprise cloud. I don't know as much about the consumer cloud, but for the enterprise cloud, they're really well positioned. And Google has fabulous technology and they just have to figure out how to bring it to the enterprise. And Thomas has the enterprise chops to do it. So we'll see.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Any thoughts as it pertains to -- I know you worked with Microsoft, you worked with more so with Amazon Web Services. Between the 2, how do you see them in the public cloud? I know they have their own revenues and sweet spots. Is there any change in the way the wind is blowing with respect to the public cloud between these 2? Or their positions has secure relatively changes that you see there?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: So we work at this point exclusively with Amazon and the AWS platform. And I would just say it is a phenomenal technology platform. And contrary to what people talk about, well, we don't compete with Amazon. As a customer, they are a wonderful company to work with. Any things we bring up, any feature requests we have, we get a direct line into Andy Jassy and they build it out into the platform. It's an amazing platform. I don't know as much about Microsoft. But what -- I know about the Azure platform is that when I sit down with the CIO of a company and they're thinking about their movement into the cloud, they're both kind of settling on AWS and Microsoft as the 2. Very few companies are just going all-in on one cloud platform. Nobody wants to be just completely dependent on one. So they tend to go to 2. And if I were to -- you guys don't tweet in here, do you?</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: We're not allowed.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: I think technology-wise, the best platform is AWS. In terms of enterprise, go-to-market, Microsoft is superb. They know how to go-to-market enterprise. And so the race is AWS becoming more enterprise savvy and Microsoft trying to catch up on the technology side. When you look at things like voice, machine learning, big data, the AWS platform is just phenomenal. It's just a phenomenal platform. There's almost nothing you can't do.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: That's really good to know. Really good to know. RPA came up on the conference call. And you said like you're still investigating the technology. Wondering if you have any updated thoughts there.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: People have been saying that it cuts deployment times by half. That was aspirational coming from the startup vendors. There's no proof points to that. So we're partnering and investing in those companies. And we're going to say, okay, well, show us. And if they can show us how they reduce deployment times and how they can do some of this process automation, great. I'm not sure we need to be in this space, but we definitely need to be close to it. And so we've made a couple of investments. We're obviously a sizable investor in automation anywhere. We work with them closely. But we -- I just want to see more proof that it's actually paying the dividends that everybody is -- that all the vendors are talking about.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Yes. Yes. Fair enough. That's fair enough. I wanted also get your thoughts on benefits market. I know you mentioned that, that could be an area that could be more opportunistic for you, for Workday. Any thoughts there, benefits provider and automating that whole supply chain?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Yes. So right now, we're really a platform for benefits enrollment. We could definitely go further. We integrate into all the carriers. We call it the benefits exchange. We could definitely get into more of a model where that looks more like a BPO. Who knows if we go there. I'm not sure -- I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon. But almost every one of the HR-related services that we have our customers say, not just run the technology, can you actually run the full functional area for us. And to date, we partnered at a minimum. I think you'll just see more partnerships for us in that area. So I think like a PEO provider, like trying that great company. All those kinds of companies have an underlying backbone of technology and they're historically all PeopleSoft. And as those systems age out, I would hope that we could access some of the market through partnership or maybe more.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: We heard from Microsoft earlier today about their vision and ambition for the workflow automation market. ServiceNow has been talking about it for quite some time. What is in that market? You're one of the most experienced entrepreneurs in software and investor as well. What is this market that everybody is excited about? And what does Workday think about this?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: I think it's a -- it's still unclear to me what exactly it is. Historically, standalone workflow companies do not turn into big companies. ServiceNow is different because they automate IT. They automate help desk and they're moving into areas like workflow. All of the vendors, Salesforce, Workday, we all have our own workflow platforms. I think as we roll out Workday Cloud, you'll see customers using us to extend workflows. But I don't see it as a repeatable standalone market. It's just an extension of what vendors are doing. And I think that's probably the way Microsoft sees it, too. The bigger thing we see out of Microsoft is their focus on teams.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: And tell us about that, I mean I'm hearing more and more about teams.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Well, so the product is gaining steam. And it's not necessarily showing up in Silicon Valley. Most of the tech companies still use Slack. But you go outside of Silicon Valley and you see a lot of deployments to teams. So we're working hard with Microsoft to...</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Are you deploying...</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Well, we're not deploying yet. We might down the road. But we're working hard with Microsoft to tie our systems together so teams and our systems are seamlessly connected. And what we've done prototype-wise is really, really cool, and I want to [turn it to...]</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: [Doing that. I'm doing that] all over the place. I'm doing it. Yes. It's good to see.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Microsoft's in 17 different categories, right? I mean they're in all the different categories. I can just tell you this one is important to them.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Satya spent a lot of time on the conference.</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Yes. And it's a product that was rough around the edges to say the least 2 years ago. And today, it's a really cool product.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: It's good to know. Final chance, John, anybody else with a question? Just raise your hand. If there aren't any -- John, yes, please go ahead.</p><p>JOHN PETER KING: Yes. Maybe just tell us, what's the big R&amp;D focus right now for the business? What's going to make a difference to the TAM over the next couple of years that you're building out?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: We continue to invest in our existing suite of products, HR, Financials, Planning. But I would say the 2 big areas are analytics and tied to analytics is a lot of the machine learning investment. And we are not building machine learning as a feature for a few applications. We're building it really into the foundational platform. That's a big investment. And then the Workday Cloud Platform, opening up the platform to our customers to extend Workday apps down the road to ISVs, and that's probably one of the bigger areas of investment.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Unless you have any closing thoughts, why don't we wrap it up a minute early?</p><p>ANEEL BHUSRI: Thank you. 25 years, congratulations.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Thank you.

Since then, findings by Pew Research Center show that <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">93 percent</emphasis>\u00a0of adults believe it is important they can control who can get information about them, 90 percent believe it is important they have control over what information is collected about them and <emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">93 percent</emphasis>\u00a0have taken steps to remove or mask their digital footprints. But despite these numbers, 59 percent still feel like it is impossible to remain anonymous online and 68 percent believes current laws do not do enough to protect their privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More recently, the abusive behavior of Big Tech companies and large corporations, in general, have only led to an even deeper state of distrust. This is especially true among millennials, who research has shown to hold a large amount of distrust in the traditional pillars of our world. But despite these facts, businesses have decided to carry on as usual, without consideration for the long-term impact this may have on their brand. In a marketplace of trust, this will not be sustainable. But how do we change this? The answer is simple: Optimize for trust.</p><p>For the longest time we\u2019ve pushed businesses to focus on impressions, unique visits, lowering bounce rates and other forms of engagement in order to quantify success. This has become a standard in the new attention economy where data is king and has become the currency of the new economy. But if we really take time to think about it, this is exactly the problem. Focusing exclusively on getting the population glued to the screen so we can mine their data is one of the largest threats to the security of businesses\u2014especially at this point in history where consumers are losing trust for those mining their data faster than ever.</p><p>Changing the public\u2019s perception will mean ensuring clients are checking the boxes on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and future regulations. The changes consumers want to see go beyond surface-level tactics and implementation. It will require making a change from the core of the company, from the brand level. And in order to help catalyze these changes, it\u2019s time we leverage our role as digital consultants to push businesses forward. It\u2019s time we figure out creative ways to not only measure success\u00a0but also reimagine what it means to be successful in general.</p><p>An example of what this might look like is what Couchsurfing does. Instead of focusing solely on engagement or other common metrics, they use an equation that looks more like this:</p><p>(Number of Days Spent Together x Number of Hours in a Day) \u2013 (Time Spent on Site) = Good Hours spent with Couchsurfing</p><p>Obviously, there are some potential flaws to their system because time spent together doesn\u2019t necessarily mean quality time. But they recognize this, and in order to ensure quality beyond traditional quantitative metrics, they also ask about how the experience was through long-form questionnaires. This combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis allows their business to pursue its mission without focusing on getting people to drain their life away glued to the screen. In fact, as you can see in their equation, time on site \u2014 or screen-based engagement \u2014 is actually considered negative to their business model because it\u2019s also been proven to be damaging to society.</p><p>Similar actions have been taken by companies like Netflix who use their platform data to monitor binging and reach out to those who have been consuming content beyond healthy levels. This may not be best for Netflix\u2019s bottom line, but it\u2019s about the long-term relationship with customers, not the next quarter. By refocusing their mission to create a positive impact on society, these companies are actively working to gain consumer trust by creating a business model that not only drives revenue but also creates positive social impact and sustainable business practices.</p><p>For retailers, this may mean discovering ways to optimize the number of people who refer their friends after making a purchase. For travel businesses, this may mean focusing on how to optimize the number of the travel destinations, restaurants and experiences that get recommended and are both visited and enjoyed by the consumer. For educational programs, this might mean optimizing the number of students who graduate feeling confident in their skills and have become critical thinkers, not just test takers who get a certificate. These are abstract and not easy to quantitatively measure, but not everything that\u2019s good is.</p><p>The idea of gaining trust is one of the biggest focuses of Tristan Harris and his new foundation, the Center for Humane Technology. It is similar to the story expressed by Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia in his TED Talk, \u201cHow Airbnb Designs for Trust,\u201d\u00a0and again by Rachel Botsman in her TED Talk, \u201cThe Currency of the New Economy is Trust.\u201d The focus of all of these experts is to point out that while KPIs and other success metrics may give us a better objective understanding of what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s not easy to objectively define success. But only by exploring the limitations of these quantitative analyses can we begin to understand the real issues in a way that allows us to creatively pursue meaningful business models.</p><p>Working with companies to creatively figure out how they can optimize for trust will be one of the biggest challenges of this modern era we live in. Solving these issues won\u2019t be easy and solutions won\u2019t happen overnight, but discovering ways to win back the trust of consumers across the globe is where the real opportunity for innovation exists. It will no doubt become the key to keeping the doors open, and the agencies that are capable of creatively persuading their clients to strategically optimize for trust will be the ones that come out on top.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-941168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SBS-DP31-JC8H-T34C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"984\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 17, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Online</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DNVT</classCode><className>ABUSE &amp; NEGLECT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM5X</classCode><className>EU DATA PROTECTION REGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001207</classCode><className>NEW ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D4VG</classCode><className>DATA SECURITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM5X</classCode><className>EU DATA PROTECTION REGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

This is Worklife from BBC News with Sally Bundock and Karin Giannone. Facebook gives a thumbs-down to calls for a worldwide ban on paid political advertising. Live from London, that's our top story on Thursday 31st October, Halloween. </p><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg says private companies should not \"censor politicians or the news\". This after Twitter said it would stop accepting political advertising globally. Also in the programme: gearing up for a 50-50 merger: FiatChrysler and the French owner of Peugeot confirm a tie-up, as carmakers grapple with the shift to electric. And the veteran wine collector who bricked up his swimming pool to convert it to a wine cellar. We'll get his top vintage tips. On Halloween, what better to do with your pumpkin carving cut-offs than turn them into beer? We'll get the Inside Track on brewing up a business from food waste. Today we want to know where you stand on Mark Zuckerberg versus Jack Dorsey? Do you think political ads should be banned from platforms such as Facebook and Twitter? Let us know - just use the hashtag _BBCWorklife. Good to have you with us. We begin with the rejection by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg of calls to follow Twitter and introduce a worldwide ban on paid for political advertising. He said it wasn't right for private companies to \"censor politicians or the news\". The move came as the social media giant delivered its latest results. Facebook made revenues of more than $17.5 billion between July and September - up 28% on the same period last year. $6 billion of that was profit. The company says more than 2.8 billion people use at least one of its services - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger - every month. Well over 2 billion use one every day. Those figures are just extraordinary. With us now is Raoul Lumb, a solicitor expert in technology at legal firm Simons Muirhead &amp; Burton. Over 1.5 billion people logging on to Facebook each day. Is there any sign that people are being put off by privacy concerns? Very little. A lot of noise, lot of action from the general public it is it is fair to say. The pressure, we see it growing for social media companies to keep regulating. Do users care or is it the politicians on Capitol Hill? It will be interesting to see the idea of regulating and breaking up tech companies has featured largely in the Democratic primary in the US, which is the first time it's got any real traction with the general public. It is interesting because today or overnight, Jack Dorsey, releasing his tweet, making his big moment, the boss of Twitter to say we will not have political ads on our platform. Just before Facebook's results were out, timing is everything. Give us your take on the Facebook stance on this. Is it brave or is it to me it was one hand you might say it is a bold thing to do cut political speech, fake news, hate speech, manipulation of elections and that kind of thing, on the other hand you could say that it is a remarkable step from Twitter, the company that called itself the free Speech wing of the Free Speech party once upon a time. If it is not the companies themselves that say that they will ban political advertising like Twitter has just done? The obvious step regulators can do is to put proactive pressure on tech companies to look at the material on their platforms and do something about it before someone complains. That will require major change in the EU or in America, in both jurisdictions there is law that says regulators can't do that, but it is the only real major weapon left. From a Facebook perspective it has paid a $5 billion fine for breach of security in the US to US authorities. More fines of this nature could come its way, if it doesn't get a grip on some of the information on this platform. It could and it didn't. All of the fines you are seeing of these big tech regulators are for breach of competition law or user privacy. What there isn't yet in the states</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-46d15c1d568c48df851b9f34425156f1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD2-BC01-JBH6-C20G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Victoria Fritz and David Heath a spent force not us to hash is in decline but in a world of digital payments who gets left behind live from London that's our top story today is Friday the 24th of January the elderly the disabled and the less well-off they're just some of the groups likely to be left behind from the cashless society also in the programme China's deadly virus outbreak spreads and mine start to focus on what this might mean for the wealth Back biggest economy and staying safe online dating app Tinder brings a whole new range of measures to keep its 5 million users safe also today getting shirty would you buy shirts specifically because it was meant to be worn untucked we will speak to one company thinks he's got a casual fashion but much so enough but also today we want to know can you cope without cash how do you feel about society game cash less to let us know hashtag BBC work-life Hello and a very warm welcome to work life we start with cash the Queen famously never carried Nina it seems a growing number of people around the world today researchers here in the UK warning that the rise of digital payments could mean vulnerable groups such as the elderly the less tech savvy and just well of less well-off spaces could get left behind they say that a few tech firms could end up with far too much power over the economy Let's take a look at some numbers by 2018 just 28% of payments in the UK bring cash and that number is set to fall to 9% in just 8 years time However across the rest of Europe the so little bit different cash still dominates for now in the countries that use the euro over 78% of transactions done with cash but that share is falling it has to be for the smaller payments while Tom move away from cash is now a major issue for the people who run the world's money the bank for international settlements which is in Switzerland It's the sort of United Nations the central bank said this week it is looking into launching 8 digital currency as on to chew on Rachel state for his economic analyst at the Institute for public policy research thinktank and joins me now Rachel thanks for joining us Like that cashless its runaway train at the moment is it is changing so fast so big for corrupt that forecast of 9% of cashews by the end of the decade it would be even that much Yes you can see and the shift away from cash is better than this in the it is inevitable we are calling for is action to shape how the transition happens and how to make sure it works people who are still light and patchy across the UK answer by international standards the transition in the UK on this faster and a lot of countries in particular other European Nations are ferried and the prospect of fully cashless UK air is on the immediate horizon and the RNC you really really quite substantial shift of the next 10 years the really important the government and regulators and I'm getting ahead and you're thinking about how to make sure this can be shaped at me everyone including basically what would you say is government need to put the brakes on the speed of change Yeah we need to see that particular action from regulating is that the shift away from cash is handing a lot of economic power at the big tech companies who seemed people like Facebook and Amazon moving into their personal banking markets I was your officer things like Eamonn express loans even digital currencies and and those but potentially quite exciting innovations and it is really important I need to be taking to make sure that that the gains of the shift away from passion particularly financial gains these companies are recycled into the communities will affect does it concern you when you hear of firm as the UN as central banks if you like saying actually might issue digital currency ourselves it is quite a different question his centre-backs looking at the digital currency issue some been wasn't like the bank of England issuing a currency so instead of paper money can hold its currency with the central bank and that is quite different prospect Watson like Facebook is posing and important questions that regulators and central banks picture

This is Worklife, from BBC News, with Sally Bundock and Karin Giannone. Your data rights - versus the tech giants. A major privacy case reaches a key stage in Europe's top court. Live from London, that's our top story on Thursday, 19th of December. </p><p>Campaigners want tougher rules on the transfer of personal data from Europe to the tech titans. Outside of the European Union. We will talk you through what is at stake. Also in the programme... Swine fever sweeps into Indonesia. Our Asia business hub will bring us news of this latest blow for the region's pork industry. And... Carbon-neutral beef. Balancing the desire for meat with environmental concerns. We will take you to Brazil, where some farmers have a very innovative idea. Cancer can be one of the biggest challenges you or a loved one can face, but can an app really help? We'll meet one man who says the answer is yes. And are bosses going too far in the quest for productivity? It's being reported that some companies are installing loos which tilt after five minutes, in order to become uncomfortable, to prompt us to get back to work. A step too far, or do we need encouragement to be more productive at work? Let us know. Just use the hashtag BBCWorklife. Yes, we try and flush out the real issues from those that are not! In terms of Worklife stories. And we start in the tiny state of Luxembourg today. A legal battle between privacy campaigners and tech giants, including Facebook, reaches a critical moment today. The European Court of Justice is going to get official advice from one of its top lawyers, and it could affect how the personal data of hundreds of millions of people in Europe is handled. So that is you and me, basically. It's all about the rules allowing companies to send people's data out of the European Union - primarily, to the US, where most tech giants are based. The case is driven by Austrian activist Max Schrems, behind me here, who first took on Facebook over privacy as a young law student, eight years ago. In 2015, he successfully challenged the EU's old system of safeguarding its citizens' data when it was transferred to the US, arguing it wasn't good enough. Well, if the court agrees that the EU's latest system isn't up to scratch, then thousands of companies - from tech firms to banks to carmakers and charities - would have to stop exporting EU citizens' data. Under new General Data Protection Regulations - GDPR - they could be fined up to 4% of global revenue if they don't. Well, Professor Suzanne Rab, of Serle Court, is a barrister who specialises in EU Law, and she joins me now. Welcome. Tell is in your view has significant this cases. This case is significant. It is an issue which goes beyond the particular dispute and relates to the mechanisms that businesses in the EU used to transfer data outside of the European Union. So potentially, very wide ramifications. What do you think the Attorney General will advise today? There is a lot to cover, 11 questions have been raised. I suspect it won't be a complete bill of health. And some issues will be highlighted with the existing mechanisms. Just how far that goes remains to be seen. What could the practical implications, the changes that could come about as a result of this, be? Well, the mechanisms that are under dispute here are standard contractual clauses. So contract terms that allow EU data controllers to send data outside into the EU. The question is, are those adequate? If they are found to be deficient, controllers in the EU will have to use alternative measures and that may be challenging, given the existing framework. Alternative measures, that sort of speak for more work on the part of big tech in the US to make sure they are handling our data correctly, or facing huge fines in Europe, what will that mean for the relationship between the EU and the US? Well, a lot focuses on the safeguards in the destination country. And whether that provides an adequate level of</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-7fdac91a0d6a47fc919449edd8cca41d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSG-X991-JBH6-C0W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Settlements in Switzerland - a sort of United Nations for central banks - said this week it's looking into launching a digital currency. Rachel Statham is Economic Analyst at the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank and she joins me now. like cashless is a runaway train and Thank you for joining us. </p><p>It feels it is changing so fast. We had that forecast 9% of cash used by the end of the decade but will it be even that much? Yes, we can see the shift away from cash is definitely something that is inevitable but what we are calling for is action to shape how the transition happens and make sure it works for the blues don't rely on cash across the UK put by international standards, the UK transition is faster than other countries, particularly other European nations. Although the prospect of a fully cashless UK is not on the horizon immediately, we will see quite a substantial shift in the next ten years so it's important that government, regulators and financial service providers are getting ahead and thinking about how to make sure the transition can be shaped to make sure everyone is included. What you're saying is government needs to put the brakes on the speed of change? We need to see action from the regulator is particularly so the shift is not handing a lot of economic power to big tech companies put it we have seen people like Facebook and Amazon moving into personal banking markets with new offers of things like wallets, personal loans and even digital currencies. Those are potentially quite exciting innovations but it's important that action is taken to make sure that the shift away from cash, but Italy financial gain is going to these companies, are recycled into communities affected but does it concern you when you hear of the UN of Central Banks, if you like, saying we might issue a digital currency? It's a different question if central banks look at that issue, if that was the Bank of England issuing digital currency so instead of the paper money you could hold digital currency with the central bank, that a different prospect to what someone like Facebook is proposing to put it there have been important questions that regular it is an central banks are put to their plans and they are developing their own plans as well. That could see a radical shift in terms of how we manage money and also how the banking sector in the UK works, retail banking and what it offers. It is interesting that people who might get left behind by this, the less well off, people with less access to tech, the disabled who might not be able to hold bank cards, interesting we heard from New York this week and lawmakers saying that stores have got to accept cash. There is a big section of society that, for whatever reason, still operates in cash and feels much safer with it put we have heard from our research and people we have been speaking with across the country about the issue that it is people on tight budgets in particular were most likely to rely on it, taking it out at the beginning of the week and that is their budget. We have heard things like overdraft charges and unseen fees are real barriers for moving into digital payments and we have called for the development of more inclusive financial technology so people with the full range of disabilities are able to access digital payments and take part in the digital economy in the way that people are locked out at the moment. Do you have cash on you? I don't. I have a little bit but not much. It has changed so quickly. Thank you very much.

Many of you have been in touch about this. Facebook, Twitter and what they are up to. We will look at your comments later. FiatChrysler and Peugeot owner PSA said on Thursday they would joinforces through a 50-50 share swap to create the world's fourth-largest automaker. Manufacturers are grappling with a global downturn in demand, and investing in the switch to electric and autonomous vehicles. The chairman of MCA will chair the combined group whilst the Peugeot chief exec will be the new chief executive. This story confirmed in the last hour. We will have more detail on that on our business page and analysis on what that means for the global car industry. Let's take a look at some of the other stories making the news. Apple says profits fell 3% in the past quarter to $13.7 billion. It has been hit by a steep fall in revenue from iPhones - which still make up half its sales. Apple is trying to refocus on wearable technology - such as AirPod earphones and watches - as well as services like Apple Pay and the forthcoming streaming service Apple TV Plus. If you are downing a triple cappuccino or a skinny latte... Starbucks says global sales were up 7% in the past quarter, boosted by digital ordering and delivery in China as well as new stores in the US, and demand for new cold drinks including iced tea and coffee. They have seen an increase in demand for those. It has been trying to revitalise its businesss in the face of competition from independent coffee shops and start-up rivals. US authorities say they have struck a deal with financier Jho Low to recover $700 million in assets tied to the multi-billion dollar 1MDB corruption scandal. Mr Low is a central figure in the global scandal which saw billions of dollars go missing from the Malaysian state fund. The fund was designed to boost Malaysia's economy through strategic investments. Something we have covered extensively on BBC News is the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. They may have helped push the city into recession. The latest GDP figures show that the economy has Our Asia Business Correspondent Karishma Vaswani is in Singapore. What effect is it having? These numbers were widely signalled by the administration in Hong Kong. Earlier in the week we heard from Carrie Lam who pointed out the data would be pretty gloomy. That's what we've seen and the figures that have come out in the last few minutes. The Hong Kong economy is highly dependent on China. But after five months of political protest that you were talking about, that has led to things like retailer shutting shops, hoteliers facing low occupancy rates, and tourists, many of them from the mainland, shunning Hong Kong. Also images of increasingly violent clashes on some occasions between protesters and police have also led to a drop in visitor numbers, which are expected to plunge nearly 50% in October compared to last year. All of that along with the slower trade volumes because of the US- China trade war is really putting Hong Kong under increasing pressure. An interesting story, it has been widely signalled that that is the situation in Hong Kong at the moment. It did nothing in terms of the markets in Hong Kong. You can see them up by almost 1% at the end of the trading session earlier today. From the point of view of Asian trade the markets were focused on the US Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates. That gave -- gave global markets a boost. American markets closing at record highs the night before. Let's look at Europe now. The PSA group shares are down in Paris, down some 9% behind me here, on the CAC. From the news that FiatChrysler and Peugot will be teaming up.

Time now for our daily look at some of the newspaper and website stories which have caught our eye. Joining me is Matthew Howett, founder and principal analyst at Assembly Research. </p><p>That start with Tesla. Their stock was apparently undervalued and jumped by 20%. This is based on the fact that battery supplier Panasonic has turned a profit for the first time. We know there were concerns about the battery technology when it comes to electric vehicles and that has been a big part of driving the share price. You can't keep this company down. When you think of the last few years, hedge funds gunning for it, it keeps coming back. It does nothing really divides opinion like Elon Musk. There are a particular group of analysts that seem very bullish about Tesla and I think that has driven the share price performance. We need to watch it over a longer period. Something else helping them is the move to cut carbon emissions. That ties in with the story in The Guardian as well, the Greta Thunberg effect which is inspiring a whole new generation of online activists. That's right. Linked to the previous item with Ofcom, we've seen a lot of teenagers getting involved in political campaigns, driven by the fact that they have a belief in a particular cause and we called this the greater effect when it comes to Ofcom's piece. There is the summit taking place in Britain, that story also in The Guardian, run clinic change. This is also linked to the fact the government is looking to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles five years ahead of schedule -- on climate change. That is a big ambition. It's only five years and the technology is advancing all the time. The other thing is the carbon neutral by 2040, how many other countries are signed up to that? I think very few at this point. A lot of it will come in this summit that the UK Government is organising shortly. But it is dividing opinion. Claire O'Neill who was previously tasked with running this campaign is now having a bit of a public fight with the government. She is no longer in paste and she saying Boris doesn't know what he's doing. CMA, competition managers association in the UK, quite interesting. This is a Financial Times story. Win the Competition and Markets Authority looks epic tech and the dominant sunrise of companies, particularly the big companies in particular and they are saying in the light of Brexit the UK will have the ability to police things itself. We know that they like to make a name for themselves. Brussels has been very big with fighting these companies in the UK once part of that for itself and I think we can expect to see a lot more activity from them and arguably until we get a global approach to regulating the big tech companies, we are going to see... Politically awkward for the UK Government. Yes. They are engaged in trade talks with the US, the introduction of the digital tax will upset them particularly as part of that negotiation. We really need to get the international approach but that so far hasn't worked out. Thank you. Still to come - books for schools that aim to break the stigma and raise awareness of autism and special educational needs through education. You're with Worklife from BBC News. Poverty rates halve when people move into work - but finding a job is not enough. Research by the Resolution Foundation show even sustained employment is not enough to keep people out of poverty. The report highlights the crucial need a wider benefits system. Laura Gardiner is research director at the Resolution Foundation and joins us now from Westminster. What is the impact of having a job on people living below the poverty line? We looked into this because while the poverty rate hasn't shifted hugely over the past decade, the composition of it has. We now have seven in ten working age adults in poverty in a household where someone works. Poverty has shifted towards working households and that has led some to downplay the importance of working escaping poverty. We looked at households over time and found it's not true.

Joining us is writer and journalist, Marisa Bate. giving a new role of policing online A piece in the Guardian about Ofcom platforms. </p><p>The government will announce draft legislation suggesting Ofcom could have powers and responsibilities over the behaviour of these tech giants. The likes of Twitter and Facebook. And Instagram. We know that there are countless problems with harmful material online. The question is what sanctions will Ofcom have and what will they do? They are talking about a breach of duty of care, what is that, in this wild West of online platforms? We don't have that information yet but it is a huge spectrum. This morning the chief executive said they -- there would have to be criminal sanctions for serious cases of websites sharing child abuse. We know things like 14-year-old Molly Russell committed suicide which her parents believe was aggravated by things you saw on Instagram, so there's a spectrum of issues but we don't know how they will tackle it but we know that it needs to be tackled, so having a body in place where this is their responsibility to try and prevent this, because the tech companies themselves do not do enough. Detractors say that it could be leading to censorship and the government blocking websites they don't deem acceptable, is that fair? There's the question of free speech online which will always be a lively and complicated one, but at this stage, the damage especially to young people, that, there has to be some sort of sanctions in place, some sort of body protecting young people. Moving on to a story that has got to him quite exercise this morning. Young men embrace gender equality but still do not vacuum. This doesn't fit with anything I know about modern life at all. Talk us through this story. According to the data from Gallup, opposite sex couples, they split the house work in the same way that older couples do, and researchers are surprised because whilst attitudes around gender have evolved in other areas such as support for women working and in public office, there seems to be the stubborn idea around gender roles and household. It is significant, one hour a day of more housework and one hour a day of more childcare. It is quite dramatic to shift. It is a lot. You have to think in the UK, as we have an ageing population, that burden of care would just full on child care but for elderly parents. It does replicate what happens in my house, but in your house, you do it all? What I thought was interesting was... Intensive parenting is interesting. Both parties now working, often, people still spend as much time with their children as they were in the 1970s when there were more stay mums which shows you how much longer the day is, and what you've got to fit into it and why not so much is done in household chores. They asked the question why is this the case, is it because men don't want to do it? They pose the question, and I repeat it, as well! There doesn't seem to be any hard and fast rules why this is happening. One researcher suggested that whilst men like the extra income, they don't like doing the chores so whilst there is support for women to work... I live with my boyfriend and I have to say that he does the majority of chores! But this is something that I hear from my friends. We have asked viewers to reach out on Twitter and tell us their experience. We will read some of them later. Still to come: tech for female wellness - femtech, is going to be we'll talk to the woman who thinks the next big thing. You're with Worklife from BBC News.

But H-4 visas didn't allow a person to work in the U.S. - until 2015, when the Obama administration enacted a rule that opened the way for people with spousal visas to obtain permits known as employment authorization documents (EAD).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It was such an emotional moment for me,\" Bishen said of the day she heard about the new rule. \"It gave me my life back,\" said the Bellevue resident, who is now a communications specialist on the Eastside.</p><p>The relief of H-4 visa holders hasn't lasted long, however. Bishen and spouses who received the work authorizations are now in limbo since the Trump administration indicated it plans to end the program this year. If that happens before they can get new work permits, spouses of H-1B holders in the Seattle area will have to decide whether to stop working in the United States or leave the country.</p><p>Microsoft and Amazon are routinely listed among the top applicants for H-1B visas, each applying for thousands of the permits each year. The high-tech visa program allows about 85,000 people each year to enter the country after company sponsors prove their high-end skills cannot be found elsewhere.</p><p>Spousal visas allow H-1B visa holders to bring their partners with them to the U.S., women and men who are usually also highly educated. Because of the Puget Sound region's high concentration of tech companies, a large portion of those spouses end up here.</p><p>Some of them thought they might be able to get their own H-1Bs, but those are in high-demand and hard to obtain. Some assumed they could get permanent residence status, or green cards, once they arrived in the country. But obtaining that status can take years.</p><p>Green cards are capped each year, and no single country can receive more than 7 percent of the total. That makes it faster to get the permits for people from some countries - say, Norway, because there are fewer applicants.</p><p>Meanwhile, applicants from India, China or the Philippines, which generate many more green-card requests, can wait decades.</p><p>That meant that many H-4 spouses, usually women, who were used to holding corporate jobs couldn't work in the U.S. if they joined their partners here.</p><p>For Bishen, her first three years in the U.S. without a job were marked with depression and a loss of independence. She had to use her husband's credit card for everything, even to buy him a gift. She volunteered with nonprofits, but felt useless in a society that puts a strong importance on people's professions.</p><p>\"It hurt me on many emotional levels,\" she said. \"I didn't want to become a shadow of my husband.\"</p><p>That changed with the implementation of the Obama-era rule that sped up the work-permit process for spouses with H-4 visas. Once they applied for a green card with approved employer support, they could obtain an employment-authorization document, allowing them to work while waiting for a green card, which could take more than 10 years.</p><p>\"These families are Americans-in-waiting,\" said Doug Rand, co-founder of Seattle immigration-technology startupBoundless, explaining the rationale for the program. Rand was the assistant director for entrepreneurship in the Obama administration and helped implement the 2015 rule.</p><p>Since it took effect, about 104,750 H-4 spouses have been approved for work authorizations, according to the latest data through June 2017 from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p><p>So far, a notice in a federal agenda is the only information about the federal government's plans to change the rule.</p><p>\"DHS is proposing to remove from its regulations certain H-4 spouses of H-1B non-immigrants as a class of aliens eligible for employment authorization,\" it read. The agency has indicated it could propose details of the rule this month.</p><p>For now, it's unclear if people with current permits could keep working, or what form the new rule would take. A public-comment period would open before the new rule could take effect.</p><p>Representatives from the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The standing 2015 rule is the subject of a continuing lawsuit filed by a group that contends the Obama administration did not have the authority to enact the rule - that it should be up to Congress.</p><p>Attorney John Miano, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies who is representing the group, contends that spousal recipients of work permits should be counted against the country's H-1B quota, not given a separate allocation.</p><p>The upcoming rule from the Trump administration could help avoid \"an Obama-created train wreck,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is the first administration I can remember that's actually said it wants to do anything to protect American workers,\" Miano added.</p><p>The proposed rule change jibes with 2017's \"Buy American, Hire American\" act, which set out the Trump administration's desire to reform the H-1B visa program and focus on hiring workers who are U.S. citizens.</p><p>Not much has come of H-1B reforms, apart from whispers and speculation about the administration cracking down. A bill winding its way through the Senate would actually increase the quota of H-1B visas and guarantee some spousal work permits.</p><p>Unlike H-1B visas, the employment-authorization documents that H-4 spouses can obtain are not tied to a specific employer.</p><p>To Priya Chandrasekaran, that means spouses have largely been on their own in their efforts to protect the program. She runs the Washington chapter of an advocacy group, Save H4-EAD, that is lobbying lawmakers to keep the work-permit program in place.</p><p>\"I'm super paranoid that I'll be asked to stay home and not work,\" said Chandrasekaran, who holds one of the H-4 work authorizations and is an accountant in Lynn\u00adwood. \"I'm worried about the financial stability of our family.\"</p><p>The wives and husbands do have some institutional backing, however, from their spouses' employers. Amazon and Microsoft both said they support the continuation of the spousal work program and are in contact with members of Congress.</p><p>\"We've urged the administration to retain H-4 spousal work authorization, given its importance to our employees and their spouses who are stuck in a decades-long green-card backlog,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement.</p><p>But there's no guarantee the backing from Big Tech will help, and the uncertainty of their employment status is adding to the anxiety of H-4 spouses.</p><p>Devayani Charde is weighing whether she will have to move to Canada in a few months. She'd prefer not to - it would mean once again going through a lengthy process of getting licensed for her job.</p><p>The 32-year-old was a licensed physical therapist in India before she immigrated to the U.S. in 2013 to join her husband, who has an H-1B visa. She spent two years taking equivalency courses in the U.S. to become licensed as a doctor of physical therapy. And after getting a work authorization, she got a job as a physical therapist in Seattle.</p><p>She doesn't want to stop working - especially after the investment she made in getting her U.S. license - and also doesn't want to live away from her husband.</p><p>\"It's like my own identity,\" she said, explaining the importance of having a job. \"When you're in this society or meet people, you are known for what you are and what you do. I felt like it was saying 'you're going to lose your identity,' \" she said, referring to the threat of losing her work permit.</p><p>Spouses of H-1B recipients are often as highly skilled and qualified as their high-tech partners, said Amy Bhatt, an associate professor of gender and women's studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Bhatt, who earned a doctorate in feminist studies from the University of Washington, wrote a book about wives from India living in the Puget Sound region.</p><p>Before the 2015 work authorizations for H-4 spouses, many of the women she spoke with spent their time volunteering with startups to keep their skills sharp.</p><p>\"We ended up with all these women in the economy but not necessarily being recognized as part of the economy,\" she said.</p><p>There was a strong push from tech companies for the 2015 rule, she said, because they wanted to keep their H-1B workers and attract more. Domestic-violence victim advocacy organizations also pushed for the rule, arguing that not allowing women to work made them more financially and emotionally dependent on their husbands.</p><p>It comes down to a feeling of self-worth, Bishen, the Bellevue resident, said. The women are legal immigrants, she pointed out, and want to contribute to society.</p><p>\"I cannot even think about going back to those dark times\" before 2015, she said. \"There's much at stake.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-4a38c42c138511e8b9ecc42283540127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RNW-3MX1-JBKM-D2J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 18, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001299</classCode><className>PASSPORTS &amp; VISAS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097YR</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT VISAS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001030</classCode><className>LICENSES &amp; PERMITS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000750</classCode><className>FOREIGN LABOR</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001613</classCode><className>SPONSORSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX518</classCode><className>SEATTLE, WA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GX351</classCode><className>CARDIFF, WALES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC310</classCode><className>PHILIPPINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Bishen and mates who got the work approvals are presently in limbo since the Trump organization showed it intends to end the program this year. In the event that that occurs before they can get new work grants, life partners of H-1B holders in the Seattle region should choose whether to quit working in the United States or leave the nation.<br/> However, this relief of H-4 visa-holders has not lasted long, who received the work permits are now in limbo since the Trump rule signified that it intends to end the program this year. In any case, this happens before they can get new work permits, the spouses of H1-B visa holders around Seattle should choose whether to quit working in the US or leave the country.<br/> Waiting for lines<br/> The high-tech visa program permits around 85,000 persons every year to enter the country after sponsors of the company's establish their high-end skills cannot be discovered somewhere else. Further, the spousal visas permit the H1-B visa holders to convey their partners with them to the US who are also well skilled. Some of them figured they might be able to get their own H1Bs, which are highly popular and difficult to acquire. And, some believed that they could get status of permanent residence, or green cards, once they enter the country, but acquiring that status can take a number of years.<br/> Green cards are topped every year and no single country can get more than 7% of the total. That makes it speedier to get the permits for the people from a few countries - like, Norway, on the grounds that there are fewer candidates. In the meantime, applicants from India, China or the Philippines, which produce numerous more green-card demands, can hold up decades.<br/> That implied that numerous H-4 life spouses, typically women, who were accustomed to holding corporate jobs couldn't work in the U.S. if they joined their partners here.<br/> During Obama rule, the process of granting work-permits for spouses with H4 visas accelerated. When they applied for a green card with support affirmed employee, they could get an employment-authorization document, enabling them to work while waiting for a green card, which could take over 10 years.<br/> \"These families are Americans-in-waiting,\" said Doug Rand, co-founder of Boundless, clarifying the justification for the program. He was the assistant director for entrepreneurship in Obama rule and helped to implement the 2015 rule.<br/> According to the latest data for US Citizenship and Immigration Services, about 104,750 H-4 spouses have been approved for work permits since the implementation of the rule.<br/> Uncertain notice<br/> Until now, a notice in a federal agenda is the main information about the plans of the federal government to modify the existing rule.<br/> While indicating it could propose details of the rules in this month, it read, \"DHS is proposing to remove from its regulations certain H-4 spouses of H-1B non-immigrants as a class of aliens eligible for employment authorization.\"<br/> At present, it is uncertain if people with current permits could continue working, or what frame the rule take and a public comment would phase would open before the new rule's implementation.<br/> The standing 2015 rule is the subject of a proceeding with a claim filed by a group that battles the Obama administration did not have the power to empower the rule - which it ought to be dependent upon Congress.<br/> Attorney John Miano, from the Center for Immigration Studies who represented the group, argues that spousal beneficiary of work permits ought to be meant something in opposition to country's H-1B share, not given a different allocation.<br/> He said, \"This is the first administration I can remember that's actually said it wants to do anything to protect American workers.\"<br/> The proposed rule change deviates from 2017's \"Purchase American, Hire American\" act, which set out the Trump administration's want to change the H-1B visa program and spotlight on employing specialists who are U.S. nationals.<br/> Securing the program<br/> As compared to H-1B visas, the employment authorization documents that H-4 spouses can get are not fixing to a particular employer.<br/> Priya Chandrasekaran, who runs one of the H4 work organizations and an accountant in Lymnwood, said \"I'm super paranoid that I'll be asked to stay home and not work. I'm worried about the financial stability of our family.\"<br/> The spouses do have some institutional sponsorship, be that as it may, from their spouse's employers. Both Amazon and Microsoft said they support the extension of the spousal work program and are in contact with Congress members.<br/> In s statement, Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, said, \"We've urged the administration to retain H-4 spousal work authorization, given its importance to our employees and their spouses who are stuck in a decades-long green-card backlog.\"<br/> In the shadow<br/> However, there is no assurance the support from Big Tech will help, and the vulnerability of their employment status is adding to the uneasiness of spouses of H-4.<br/> Often, the spouses of H1-B recipients are very talented and qualified as high-tech partners, before the 2015 work permits for H-4 spouses, a significant number of the women have invested their time volunteering with new businesses to keep their abilities sharp.<br/> Further, there was a solid push from tech companies for the 2015 rule, on the grounds that they needed to keep their H-1B workers and attracts more.<br/> Ultimately, it comes down to sentiment self-esteem as the women are lawful immigrants and would like to contribute more to society.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10389509</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RP3-DD91-JBYT-H2CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1026\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Issuance of Visas</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mzg4RUQxNkU4QUZBNEJGNEE1NkFBMDk1QzEzMTE0QzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM5NTNBQjk2MUM3NDBCQ0E1NEU3MDI4QkY4NEVBNzA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>Registration &amp;

In five years, it will be estimated three times as much,\" she said. \"Today, we have 5.7 million jobs, in five years, these will - estimated - be about 11 million jobs.\"</p><p>There are also fears Europe is lagging behind other parts of the world.</p><p>Data recently published by the World Intellectual Property Organisation showed that Chinese and US firms account for about 85% of AI-related patents globally.</p><p>What's in the strategy?</p><p>The EU says it wants to develop a \"framework for trustworthy artificial intelligence\", focusing on three key objectives:</p><p>Technology that works for people; A fair and competitive economy; and An open, democratic and sustainable society. Practically, authorities should be able to test and certify the data used by the algorithms that power artificial intelligence in the same way they check cosmetics, cars and toys, the bloc said.</p><p>The focus for such preliminary certification is on high-risk systems rather than on all AI \"in order to avoid unnecessary burden for companies to innovate\", the strategy said.</p><p>Examples of high-risk sectors include medical equipment, automated driving, or decisions on social security payments.</p><p>The EU also wants to use unbiased data to train high-risk artificial intelligence systems so they can avoid discrimination.</p><p>EU leaders said they wanted to open a debate on when to allow facial recognition in remote identification systems, which are used to scan crowds to check people's faces to those on a database.</p><p>It's considered the \"most intrusive form\" of the technology and is prohibited in the EU except in special cases.</p><p>The EU strategy includes an ambitious investment plan of 20 billion per year over the next decade, against 3.2 billion in 2016.</p><p>How much support do the proposals have?</p><p>Initial reactions to the proposals in Europe were overall positive.</p><p>Interviewed on Euronews Now, MEP Eva Maydell, of the European People's Part,y hailed the strategy as \"future-oriented\".</p><p>She said it would pave the way for European companies to be more competitive.</p><p>Andrea Renda, head of regulatory policy at CEPS, a think-tank, told Euronews that he was \"very enthusiastic\" about the EU's new proposals and their ambition.</p><p>\"Part of this package is to ensure that Europe is fit for the digital age, and part of it is that the digital age becomes fit for Europe,\" the expert said.</p><p>This includes ensuring the development of AI technology becomes aligned with fundamental rights and European values, he added.</p><p>Digital Europe, a trade association representing the digital industry, welcomed the new strategy in a statement.</p><p>\"Rather than rush to regulate emerging technologies, we are pleased to see a commitment to work with industry and civil society and enhance the EU's robust legal framework where there are gaps. It will be important to keep new regulation focused and limited to truly high-risk cases,\" said Digital Europe Director General Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl.</p><p>What do critics say?</p><p>Some actors in the industry are worried that it will be difficult to define the nature and scope of high-risk cases. They also fear that the kind of preliminary certification envisioned by the EU will make the process more complex and bureaucratic.</p><p>The new regulations will have far-reaching implications for US tech giants such as Facebook, Google or Apple.</p><p>\"American companies, large cloud operators, will probably see their potential future market share shrink a little bit as a result of these proposals,\" Renda noted.</p><p>On Monday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met top European Union officials as the company warned that potential regulation risked stifling innovation.</p><p>However, In an op-ed published in the Financial Times, Zuckerberg said big tech companies such as Facebook need closer government supervision.</p><p>\"I believe good regulation may hurt Facebook's business in the near term but it will be better for everyone, including us, over the long term,'' he wrote. He said new rules should be clear and balanced and it shouldn't be left up to individual companies to set their own standards.</p><p>On the consumers' side, critics say the strategy could go even further to protect rights and privacy.</p><p>Too much data is currently concentrated in the hands of a few industry players who use it exclusively for their benefit, said Monique Goyens, Director General of The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC)</p><p>It is good that the EU wants to legislate how data can be used better but when it comes to personal data, it must always be the consumer to decide whether their data is collected and how it is shared.</p><p>How do EU policies compare to other global players?</p><p>The EU has become a major global player in tech regulation. It has already pioneered strict data privacy rules and issued multibillion-dollar antitrust fines against the likes of Google.</p><p>Some of the bloc's new proposals, such as preliminary certification for high-risk AI, are completely novel.</p><p>\"It is the first time at the global level that a policy-maker comes up with such a comprehensive framework for constraining and steering the development of AI technology,\" Renda said, adding that the policy could become a \"reference for policy-makers all over the world.\"</p><p>The EU focus on regulations comes in sharp contrast with the US approach, which is based on flexible guidelines rather than binding rules.</p><p>Another major challenge for the bloc is regulatory fragmentation - tech companies trying to access the EU market face a myriad of different national regulations, unlike the US or Chinese markets. Digital actors hope the bloc's new strategy will offer an opportunity to tackle the issue.</p><p>What's next?</p><p>The EU strategy is open for public consultations until May 19 and will be fine-tuned based on feedback. An impact assessment will also be conducted.</p><p>\"The Commission has not rushed its own thinking for a legislative proposal within the first 100 days,\" Renda told Euronews.</p><p>\"This White Paper enables us to have a period of reflection, to continue discussing where we want to go in the next five, 10, 15 yeas,\" Maydell said.</p><p>Further regulations will be introduced later this year, the Commission said, including \"a Digital Services Act to establish clear rules for all businesses to access the Single Market, to strengthen the responsibility of online platforms and to protect fundamental rights.\"</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y80-PK21-JB5P-J366-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1237\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A2A8</classCode><className>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DI8F</classCode><className>INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000184</classCode><className>BIOMETRICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

In five years, it will be estimated three times as much,\" she said. \"Today, we have 5.7 million jobs, in five years, these will - estimated - be about 11 million jobs.\"</p><p>There are also fears Europe is lagging behind other parts of the world.</p><p>Data recently published by the World Intellectual Property Organisation showed that Chinese and US firms account for about 85% of AI-related patents globally.</p><p>What's in the strategy?</p><p>The EU says it wants to develop a \"framework for trustworthy artificial intelligence\", focusing on three key objectives:</p><p>Technology that works for people;</p><p>A fair and competitive economy; and</p><p>An open, democratic and sustainable society. Practically, authorities should be able to test and certify the data used by the algorithms that power artificial intelligence in the same way they check cosmetics, cars and toys, the bloc said.</p><p>The focus for such preliminary certification is on high-risk systems rather than on all AI \"in order to avoid unnecessary burden for companies to innovate\", the strategy said.</p><p>Examples of high-risk sectors include medical equipment, automated driving, or decisions on social security payments.</p><p>The EU also wants to use unbiased data to train high-risk artificial intelligence systems so they can avoid discrimination.</p><p>EU leaders said they wanted to open a debate on when to allow facial recognition in remote identification systems, which are used to scan crowds to check people's faces to those on a database.</p><p>It's considered the \"most intrusive form\" of the technology and is prohibited in the EU except in special cases.</p><p>The EU strategy includes an ambitious investment plan of 20 billion per year over the next decade, against 3.2 billion in 2016.</p><p>How much support do the proposals have?</p><p>Initial reactions to the proposals in Europe were overall positive.</p><p>Interviewed on Euronews Now, MEP Eva Maydell, of the European People's Part,y hailed the strategy as \"future-oriented\".</p><p>She said it would pave the way for European companies to be more competitive.</p><p>Andrea Renda, head of regulatory policy at CEPS, a think-tank, told Euronews that he was \"very enthusiastic\" about the EU's new proposals and their ambition.</p><p>\"Part of this package is to ensure that Europe is fit for the digital age, and part of it is that the digital age becomes fit for Europe,\" the expert said.</p><p>This includes ensuring the development of AI technology becomes aligned with fundamental rights and European values, he added.</p><p>Digital Europe, a trade association representing the digital industry, welcomed the new strategy in a statement.</p><p>\"Rather than rush to regulate emerging technologies, we are pleased to see a commitment to work with industry and civil society and enhance the EU's robust legal framework where there are gaps. It will be important to keep new regulation focused and limited to truly high-risk cases,\" said Digital Europe Director General Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl.</p><p>What do critics say?</p><p>Some actors in the industry are worried that it will be difficult to define the nature and scope of high-risk cases. They also fear that the kind of preliminary certification envisioned by the EU will make the process more complex and bureaucratic.</p><p>The new regulations will have far-reaching implications for US tech giants such as Facebook, Google or Apple.</p><p>\"American companies, large cloud operators, will probably see their potential future market share shrink a little bit as a result of these proposals,\" Renda noted.</p><p>On Monday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met top European Union officials as the company warned that potential regulation risked stifling innovation.</p><p>However, In an op-ed published in the Financial Times, Zuckerberg said big tech companies such as Facebook need closer government supervision.</p><p>\"I believe good regulation may hurt Facebook's business in the near term but it will be better for everyone, including us, over the long term,'' he wrote. He said new rules should be clear and balanced and it shouldn't be left up to individual companies to set their own standards.</p><p>On the consumers' side, critics say the strategy could go even further to protect rights and privacy.</p><p>Too much data is currently concentrated in the hands of a few industry players who use it exclusively for their benefit, said Monique Goyens, Director General of The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC)</p><p>It is good that the EU wants to legislate how data can be used better but when it comes to personal data, it must always be the consumer to decide whether their data is collected and how it is shared.</p><p>How do EU policies compare to other global players?</p><p>The EU has become a major global player in tech regulation. It has already pioneered strict data privacy rules and issued multibillion-dollar antitrust fines against the likes of Google.</p><p>Some of the bloc's new proposals, such as preliminary certification for high-risk AI, are completely novel.</p><p>\"It is the first time at the global level that a policy-maker comes up with such a comprehensive framework for constraining and steering the development of AI technology,\" Renda said, adding that the policy could become a \"reference for policy-makers all over the world.\"</p><p>The EU focus on regulations comes in sharp contrast with the US approach, which is based on flexible guidelines rather than binding rules.</p><p>Another major challenge for the bloc is regulatory fragmentation - tech companies trying to access the EU market face a myriad of different national regulations, unlike the US or Chinese markets. Digital actors hope the bloc's new strategy will offer an opportunity to tackle the issue.</p><p>What's next?</p><p>The EU strategy is open for public consultations until May 19 and will be fine-tuned based on feedback. An impact assessment will also be conducted.</p><p>\"The Commission has not rushed its own thinking for a legislative proposal within the first 100 days,\" Renda told Euronews.</p><p>\"This White Paper enables us to have a period of reflection, to continue discussing where we want to go in the next five, 10, 15 yeas,\" Maydell said.</p><p>Further regulations will be introduced later this year, the Commission said, including \"a Digital Services Act to establish clear rules for all businesses to access the Single Market, to strengthen the responsibility of online platforms and to protect fundamental rights.\"</p><p>Source: Euronews </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

A firm that had been on the radar of data and digital campaigning researchers and professionals since 2016 was thrust into public view with the revelation that the company, which had supported Donald Trump's presidential campaign in psychometrically analysing voters based on their digital footprints, had improperly accessed the personal data of millions of Facebook users. Furthermore, an undercover investigation exposed the highly dubious strategies being touted by its top brass, including CEO Alexander Nix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But has data-driven electioneering fundamentally changed since the scandal broke? Or is it still business as usual?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital Strategies</p><p>Digital campaigning and data operations have shown little sign of falling out of favour with political parties. If anything, the digital arms race between campaigns for who can accumulate the most data on voters, analyse it successfully and turn it around to target voters online has ramped up. In the United States, continual attempts by the Democratic and Republican parties to out-do each other in the data arena have led to efforts to increase the accessibility of the respective party's data between campaigns and outside support groups, such as super PACs.</p><p>Wired has reported on how the Democratic National Committee, for example, recently raised $5 million (4.5 million) to replace their struggling Vertica data repository with the new Data Warehouse, a Google BigQuery-based data exchange, to rival the Republican's Data Trust system. On the Republican side, Brad Parscale, who made a name for himself by leading Trump's campaign, is heading Trump's 2020 re-election effort. Forbes.com recently reported that Parscale intends to use similar digital tactics in 2020 and has already spent $3.5 million (3.1 million) on Facebook ads for the campaign, even with the election more than a year away.</p><p>While it's easy to attribute developments across the Atlantic to a form of American exceptionalism, European political parties are, in their own ways, making efforts to give data an increasingly prominent role in their campaigns. In the run-up to the 2019 European Parliament elections, the ALDE Group of liberal centrists has been working with the internationally active campaigning and canvassing technology vendor, Ecanvasser to better track and respond to voter sentiments and interlink party data with other database systems, such as NationBuilder.</p><p>While European parties will need to comply with the EU's GDPR regulations when handling voter data, it is clear that data-driven campaigning is becoming a feature of European political parties and that digital campaigning goes far beyond the targeted social media advertising that tends to dominate the headlines.</p><p>Platforms</p><p>Over the past 12 months, it has been hard to avoid the mea culpas echoing from the big tech and social media platforms when it comes to their influence on elections and digital campaigning. Platform bosses have been on (what a cynic might characterise as a begrudging) global apology tour - spearheaded by Mark apologist-in-chief Zuckerberg - to address how their systems have failed to adequately address spiralling mis- and disinformation and propaganda being uploaded by national, state-sponsored and automated actors during elections. They have also been pressured to explain their failures to secure user data and the extent to which that data has been leveraged by developers and marketers.</p><p>In line with their public attempts to get back onto the straight and narrow, Facebook and Twitter have, after considerable public pressure, implemented versions of ad transparency reports and databases. These are meant to shine a light on which organisations are running election and issue-based ads, how much they spend and what the reach of said ads are among platform users. Google has also launched transparency reports for political ads on their services, but at the time of writing, they only cover the United States and India despite their announcement in late 2018 that they would include an EU-specific election ads transparency report for the 2019 EU Parliament election.</p><p>However well-intentioned these moves by big platforms are, significant issues still remain. For example, while political advertisers on Facebook must verify their identity with the platform, ads can still appear to voters as coming from an organisation and its pages. So, while Facebook knows which verified users are running which pages, voters viewing the ads only see the organisation name and thus meaningful transparency is lost in the process. We've already seen this tactic at play during the never-ending Brexit saga. On Facebook, a number of what appear to be independent and grassroots no deal Brexit campaign organisations have been pushing pro-Leave advertisements. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office is now investigating the alleged connections between these groups and Sir Lynton Crosby (a veteran political strategist for the Conservative Party and former adviser to Boris Johnson) and his lobbying company CTF Partners.</p><p>Not only are political operatives still managing to game the system, the platforms are also failing to recognise that the lines between campaign seasons and off-seasons are rapidly fading. Rather than launching these transparency tools in the run-up and during campaigns, it would be wiser to maintain them indefinitely in order to be in-step with the perpetual digital campaigning that we are seeing in politics today. In certain instances, big platforms have seemingly given up on transparency or reforming their systems altogether, such as when Google decided it could not comply with Canada's new regulations on digital political advertising and thus banned all political ads on its platform in advance of elections in Canada.</p><p>What has happened to Cambridge Analytica?</p><p>But what ever happened to the political data firm whose dubious practices made headlines one year ago? While Cambridge Analytica itself went into administration in the fallout of the scandal, many of its key players are still active in the field of personal data and political persuasion. The firm Emerdata remains a shadowy successor to Cambridge Analytica, having been set up by senior figures such as former CEO Alexander Nix and Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer.</p><p>Meanwhile, as The Daily Beast reported, there have been complaints by the legal team of David Carroll, a New York-based professor who is in litigation against the remnants of Cambridge Analytica, that administrators Crowe UK LLP are attempting to liquidate Cambridge Analytica before a full investigation has taken place - and that their fees are being paid by Emerdata. Meanwhile, Nix is doing the opposite of an apology tour and is instead heading to Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity as a featured speaker, where he has been invited to take part on a panel moderated by the Financial Times' US managing editor to explore issues of personal data and political agendas. While this news has been without controversy even within the advertising industry, it shows that Cambridge Analytica remains topical - even from beyond the grave.</p><p>Beyond Facebook and Cambridge Analytica</p><p>Ultimately, we can see that one year after what was arguably the biggest citizen data scandal since the Snowden revelations, there is still plenty to do on the issue of how personal data is influencing political campaigns. It is important to go beyond the narrative of a social media platform and a rogue data company and see that both are just the tip of the iceberg of a complex, global political data industry consisting of data brokers, platforms, digital strategists, party operatives and a full host of digital marketing tools and techniques.</p><p>Tactical Tech has spent the past two years investigating this industry, its main actors, where they are active and how they use voters' data to analyse, segment and target voters in order to influence how we vote.

A firm that had been on the radar of data and digital campaigning researchers and professionals since 2016 was thrust into public view with the revelation that the company, which had supported Donald Trump's presidential campaign in psychometrically analysing voters based on their digital footprints, had improperly accessed the personal data of millions of Facebook users. Furthermore, an undercover investigation exposed the highly dubious strategies being touted by its top brass, including CEO Alexander Nix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But has data-driven electioneering fundamentally changed since the scandal broke? Or is it still business as usual?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital Strategies</p><p>Digital campaigning and data operations have shown little sign of falling out of favour with political parties. If anything, the digital arms race between campaigns for who can accumulate the most data on voters, analyse it successfully and turn it around to target voters online has ramped up. In the United States, continual attempts by the Democratic and Republican parties to out-do each other in the data arena have led to efforts to increase the accessibility of the respective party's data between campaigns and outside support groups, such as super PACs.</p><p>Wired has reported on how the Democratic National Committee, for example, recently raised $5 million (4.5 million) to replace their struggling Vertica data repository with the new Data Warehouse, a Google BigQuery-based data exchange, to rival the Republican's Data Trust system. On the Republican side, Brad Parscale, who made a name for himself by leading Trump's campaign, is heading Trump's 2020 re-election effort. Forbes.com recently reported that Parscale intends to use similar digital tactics in 2020 and has already spent $3.5 million (3.1 million) on Facebook ads for the campaign, even with the election more than a year away.</p><p>While it's easy to attribute developments across the Atlantic to a form of American exceptionalism, European political parties are, in their own ways, making efforts to give data an increasingly prominent role in their campaigns. In the run-up to the 2019 European Parliament elections, the ALDE Group of liberal centrists has been working with the internationally active campaigning and canvassing technology vendor, Ecanvasser to better track and respond to voter sentiments and interlink party data with other database systems, such as NationBuilder.</p><p>While European parties will need to comply with the EU's GDPR regulations when handling voter data, it is clear that data-driven campaigning is becoming a feature of European political parties and that digital campaigning goes far beyond the targeted social media advertising that tends to dominate the headlines.</p><p>Platforms</p><p>Over the past 12 months, it has been hard to avoid the mea culpas echoing from the big tech and social media platforms when it comes to their influence on elections and digital campaigning. Platform bosses have been on (what a cynic might characterise as a begrudging) global apology tour - spearheaded by Mark apologist-in-chief Zuckerberg - to address how their systems have failed to adequately address spiralling mis- and disinformation and propaganda being uploaded by national, state-sponsored and automated actors during elections.

The workings behind Sycamore are what make it such a breakthrough, since it uses an algorithm that would take 10,000 years to give a similar output on a classical computer but only 200 seconds on Google's processor.</p><p>We should all be very concerned that an industry with a questionable track record on data protection, privacy and political neutrality now has access to the world's most powerful computer.</p><p>There is still time for our governments to play catch up and protect consumers. Although Google's Sycamore is advanced, it is still not capable of fulfilling every data scientist's deepest desires.</p><p>Jamal Ahmed</p><p>Founder of Kazient Privacy Experts</p><p>The charge sheet against Facebook, rather than Google, is the longest - and is still growing. There have been long-standing concerns about the amount of data Facebook is harvesting from its users and what it would (or could) be used for. However, these issues are systemic and industry-wide, and in my opinion, the scandals involving Facebook in recent months and years could just as easily have affected Google, or perhaps even Microsoft.</p><p>These issues came to a head around the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where Facebook was implicated in allowing a Russian-linked firm to harvest a huge amount of personal data, including political preferences, and allowing that knowledge to be used to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election. Now that the processing power available to manipulate and use large amounts of data has increased, the stakes are raised in what big data can be used for.</p><p>The industry, however, doesn't seem to accept these dangers. The implicit aim of tech companies is to acquire more users, more data, and ultimately more advertisers. The symbiotic relationship between these three factors underpins most tech companies' business models, including the current wave of startups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.</p><p>This will not change. But what must change is the regulation around data security and its implementation and enforcement. Regulation is, by and large, already present: in almost every developed country, it is illegal for someone to hold data without a range of rigorous checks and balances on how it is sourced, held and transferred between parties.</p><p>A range of international treaties, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the EU-US Privacy Shield mean that data can only achieve freedom of movement by fulfilling strict criteria.</p><p>The largest data owners like Facebook and Google tend to follow these rules closely, meaning that the main concern is not control of data, but the data's actual power. Big data can already predict an individual's consumer habits and personal desires to a somewhat eerie extent. As processing power grows exponentially, will we have Facebook ads that can penetrate deeper and deeper into our lives and consciousness? What will be the effect on our mental health? Our family relationships? And at the macro level, our economies?</p><p>None of these deeper questions appear to be being asked by either the industry or the regulators. Inevitably, they will become relevant as processing power increases; it is a matter of when, not if.</p><p>There is still time for our governments to play catch up and protect consumers. Although Google's Sycamore is advanced, it is still not capable of fulfilling every data scientist's deepest desires. The Sycamore chip is a 54-qubit processor. That is relatively limited, and is one of the many reasons that the discovery is not practically useful. Researchers want a 100-qubit - or even 200-qubit - system before they are really able to put it to the test and see whether the dreams of quantum computing are realised.</p><p>Rather than just controlling data transfer, it is time for a wider conversation about data usage. Which uses of data - regardless of who owns it and how it has been sourced - are ethical and safe? And which are unethical and dangerous?</p><p>As lawmakers like US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seem to enjoy grilling tech executives like Mark Zuckerberg on the minutiae of data usage, I hope we do not lose sight of the bigger picture. The stakes are too high, and the processing power is now too big, for us to be complacent.</p><p>Jamal Ahmed is the founder of Kazient Privacy Experts Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCN-P341-DXMS-8154-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 29, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But for many people, both within and outside the U.S., the concentration of power in these companies has meant considerable harm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's nearly impossible to avoid using one of these companies' products when online. Facebook and Google in particular have become gateways for accessing and disseminating information. Each month, almost 3 billion people use Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram (which it acquired in recent years). More than 90 percent of Facebook's users are outside the United States. More than 90 percent of the world uses Google Search, and Google's Android software backs at least three of every four of the world's smartphones.</p><p>That concentration of power exacerbates the harm that's done when these companies fail to protect privacy or regulate content responsibly and in line with human rights.</p><p>The source of many of human rights concerns associated with Facebook and Google's services is their surveillance-based business model. This model allowed email, social media, search, video, or other services to grow into huge, dominant networks because billions of users could sign up without paying any fees.</p><p>Instead, these platforms monetized our data, by turning it into ad revenue. Their algorithms are engineered to maximize user engagement- clicks, likes, and shares - which leads to more engagement with their products, generates more data, and leads to more advertising revenue. Studies have shown divisive and sensationalist content are more likely to drive engagement.</p><p>This is especially problematic because these companies have rushed to capture markets without fully understanding the societies and political environments in which they operate. Facebook targeted countries in the Global South with low internet penetration rates to promote a Facebook-centric version of the internet through an app called Free Basics as well as other initiatives. It entered into partnerships with telecom companies to provide free access to Facebook and a limited number of approved websites, along with its aggressive strategy of buying up competitors like WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>This strategy has had devastating consequences, especially when it was effective in dominating information ecosystems.</p><p>Myanmar is arguably the most infamous case, where Facebook was used by hardline ultranationalists to spread hate speech and promote ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. In the Philippines, where Facebook usage more than tripled in the first five years after Free Basics was introduced and where nearly every internet user is on Facebook, election related misinformation has spread rampantly on the platform. While Free Basics quietly retreated from Myanmar, the fact that many people in Myanmar think Facebook is the internet has lasting implications for the receipt and dissemination of information, especially when the government uses it as a formal channel of communication with the public.</p><p>Free Basics, which was once available in over 60 countries, has faced extensive criticism over the years, including from a group of more than 60 human rights and digital rights organizations from around the world. The initiative has been characterized as unfairly benefiting Facebook by harvesting all of these users' data for the company while providing them only with poor internet for poor people. The phenomenon of U.S. companies targeting populations around the world to harvest and monetize data has come to be known as digital colonialism. The program has shut down in a number of countries, but not before people were hooked on Facebook and came to equate it with the internet.</p><p>Another worrisome trend is major tech companies coordinating to remove content that they define as terrorist or extremist. While it's understandable that Facebook, Google, and other tech companies want to work together to counter such content, evidence suggests they are over-censoring - and in fact often removing anti-terrorism counterspeech, satire, and journalistic material, with grave implications for rights including free speech and accountability. Online documentation of attacks on civilians and other grave human rights abuses in Syria and Yemen, for example, is rapidly disappearing, often making this information inaccessible to researchers and criminal investigators and impeding efforts to serve justice on those responsible.</p><p>The companies have started to address some of these concerns by adding local language content moderators, carrying out human rights impact assessments, partnering with fact-checkers, and publishing transparency reports. These are important steps but have had uneven impact - partly because the resources invested aren't commensurate with Facebook's global user base, and local Facebook staff and partners may sometimes be perceived as partisan or having ties to government. And most importantly, they don't address the core issue of Facebook's business model.</p><p>Addressing the monopolistic aspects of platforms isn't a panacea for human rights problems, but it may make it easier to hold platforms accountable or create conditions for alternative models to emerge. A key step would be to enable data portability and interoperability, which would give people more control over their data and allow them to communicate between social media platforms, as they do between telephone networks and email providers. This could enable competition and empower users to have real choices in where they find information and how they connect with people online.</p><p>Congress also needs to adopt a strong federal data protection law that meaningfully regulates the collection, analysis, and sharing of personal data by companies with security and intelligence agencies, advertisers that engage in discriminatory profiling, or others who may violate rights. It should also consider requiring human rights impact assessments that assess all aspects of companies' operations, including their underlying business model, and require human rights due diligence for their operations globally, and especially before entering new jurisdictions.</p><p>The rest of the world is not waiting for the U.S. to regulate big tech. But lawmakers here should carefully consider how their steps to regulate big tech - or not - will impact billions of people around the world. These companies have vast reach, and their human rights impact is global. A response to their dominance should be too.</p><p>Source: Human Rights Watch</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-NJT1-JB5P-J08C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The program has shut down in a number of countries, but not before people were hooked on Facebook and came to equate it with the internet.</p><p>Another worrisome trend is major tech companies coordinating to remove content that they define as terrorist or extremist. While it's understandable that Facebook, Google, and other tech companies want to work together to counter such content, evidence suggests they are over-censoring - and in fact often removing anti-terrorism counterspeech, satire, and journalistic material, with grave implications for rights including free speech and accountability. Online documentation of attacks on civilians and other grave human rights abuses in Syria and Yemen, for example, is rapidly disappearing, often making this information inaccessible to researchers and criminal investigators and impeding efforts to serve justice on those responsible.</p><p>The companies have started to address some of these concerns by adding local language content moderators, carrying out human rights impact assessments, partnering with fact-checkers, and publishing transparency reports. These are important steps but have had uneven impact - partly because the resources invested aren't commensurate with Facebook's global user base, and local Facebook staff and partners may sometimes be perceived as partisan or having ties to government. And most importantly, they don't address the core issue of Facebook's business model.</p><p>Addressing the monopolistic aspects of platforms isn't a panacea for human rights problems, but it may make it easier to hold platforms accountable or create conditions for alternative models to emerge. A key step would be to enable data portability and interoperability, which would give people more control over their data and allow them to communicate between social media platforms, as they do between telephone networks and email providers. This could enable competition and empower users to have real choices in where they find information and how they connect with people online.</p><p>Congress also needs to adopt a strong federal data protection law that meaningfully regulates the collection, analysis, and sharing of personal data by companies with security and intelligence agencies, advertisers that engage in discriminatory profiling, or others who may violate rights. It should also consider requiring human rights impact assessments that assess all aspects of companies' operations, including their underlying business model, and require human rights due diligence for their operations globally, and especially before entering new jurisdictions.</p><p>The rest of the world is not waiting for the U.S. to regulate big tech. But lawmakers here should carefully consider how their steps to regulate big tech - or not - will impact billions of people around the world. These companies have vast reach, and their human rights impact is global. A response to their dominance should be too.</p><p>Source: Human Rights Watch</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2440942143</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T6-14W1-DY0W-40WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

to the show to find out the headlights is 3 20 6 and David that private be remembered as a musician and a great artist but he was a set up the business has to take a look at his legacy the the everybody America's worst welcome to the programme what go on son I've got about that but only 8 minutes that nothing right you give me a minute of it Yes a very quick snapshot a study Is the world of business and money we will start with the auto industry because one of the 1st car of end of the year is the Detroit auto show the at the press day kicks off today the US car industry just finished a record here 2015 sales of 17 and a half million and the courts so what you do to keep that momentum going well we know things like general Motors he has just unveiled at its abuse week in vision It's a vehicle made in China media of course cheaper Labour course but not everyone likes of the American auto unions have called a slap in the face to U.S. taxpayers who remember that the bailed out during the financial crisis Meanwhile with got marks leg and chief matters moolah who is on his 1st official trip to the United States he said he apologised will apologise to the company's emissions fiddling and later meet with the DPA the environmental protection agency back in Detroit there are reports of box where it will launch an electric battery powered SUV all been really to try and regain some lost ground following the scandal have been promising all day here she is Michelle she is live for us at the motor show and she in front of the box racket that Michelle great to see you and I'd just thought the in the last couple of hours Thinkbox Wigan came up with its sales in the US and Ashley sales were up last year even for the month of December apparently they were high which suggests the scan the scan doesn't seem to have dented the sales while Michael Vaughan whose chief executive of be doubly America's was just sat on stage you just missed him that is not a short while ago about the fact that they were very pleased that they have been able to sort of stem and hold on to the sales gains they saw last year in the face of the scandal that said both Michael Vaughan and VW executive Herbert decent spent a lot of time apologising Michael Vaughan say we want to make it right in the American way referring to the emissions And had the days of dating those here telling them and then in fact progress had been made with regulators that he was optimistic a deal or remedy could soon be agreed upon with regulators may recall that they've already agreed on athletes with European regulators they also would want to sell off big green credentials the cause of all the crap I need a line that mob there Aaron is that he won' t t e concept car electric all part of VW's attempts to try and sell off I really really can be environmentally friendly innovative and a car company that people can trust ok deeds those two rapid challenges that their basic pay you know it's a funny old world is that cos last week we had the consumer electronics show in las Vegas which is of course the big tech show of Thomas becoming a cash loan given the be a big carmakers they're talking about the driverless vehicles how much of a the more that the way you were balloon Detroit's not going to be let out back on the safety of the be affected just travelled back from Las Vegas at the car execs were of course they're promoting the edge my lesson will be automation exists to make up at all not be over us for a short while ago and he was telling me that they had recently just their test driven a bunch of driver list of I guess is not really a test drive in the traditional sense that they had taken on Drogba's path into snowy conditions what did he do one the financially viable as other places it in I'm a in terms of the vehicle in production the Detroit is actually the latest Zaidi's each class vehicle and baby testing now the Nevada desert there obviously someone differ weather conditions thirds of those that borders trying again Michelle have delivered their and you had plenty more throughout the rest of they actually like the rest of the week that you know you might think into to was seized by otherwise that the tenor of rule by the on let's talk about this is as you said we've been hearing the musical legend
