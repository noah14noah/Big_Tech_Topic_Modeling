They're getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won't. The history of U.S. business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. </p><p>In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives \u2014 when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms \u2014 Americans turned to their government for a fix.In the last half-century, lawmakers and regulators set up a regime to improve the safety of automobiles and other manufactured goods, to break up a telephone monopoly that controlled much of the nation's communications and to loosen the fatal grip that tobacco companies held over U.S. society. We are now at another great turning point in the global economy. A handful of technology companies, the Frightful Five \u2014 Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon, the largest U.S. corporations by stock-market value \u2014 control the technological platforms that will dominate life for the foreseeable future. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind. Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public-policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants' power through government \u2014 and, if so, how. There are growing efforts in Washington, D.C., to do something about big tech. The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last year's presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five \u2014 Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Stephen Bannon wing of the right. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech. But there is little to suggest we'll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants' vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout. 'Individuals, lawmakers, we're all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,' said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable \u2014 so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.Part of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we've ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They're being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.They're creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence \u2014 a technological achievement that may come with as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons. And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power. Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets \u2014 Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example. Apple's iPhone is the world's most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States are not iPhones.Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines. But only in the last year did Amazon's annual revenue surpass that of Costco. It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has a single-digit share of American retail and is still a minor satellite compared to WalMart's sun. Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five's power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.'We've all become a bit cyborg,' writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in 'World Without Mind,' one of several new books examining the giants. 'What we need to always remember is that we're not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.' The complicated nature of the Five's power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them. In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published an article in The Yale Law Journal arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power. Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazon's growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy. Open Markets has offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook. Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it's politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn't need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement. That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn't done much in office to carry that out. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review. Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.'We are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive,' said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government's antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company's culture \u2014 which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook. A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today's tech giants. But that's a big if. 'The big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?' Reback said. 'Had we been more diligent, we wouldn't have nearly the problems we have today.'

Son l\u00e9ger accent signale son pays d'origine : l'Irlande, si\u00e8ge europ\u00e9en de nombreux g\u00e9ants de la tech, de Google \u00e0 Twitter en passant par Facebook et Apple. Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour cette raison, Helen DIXON, la patronne de la Data Protection Commission (DPC), la CNIL irlandaise, est sur le papier, l'une des femmes les plus puissantes de la tech. Cinq ans apr\u00e8s sa nomination, la commissaire s'appr\u00eate \u00e0 vivre un test grandeur nature de son pouvoir de r\u00e9gulation. Dans \"quelques mois\", Helen DIXON va en effet, assure-t-elle, rendre son verdict sur deux enqu\u00eates, l'une ciblant WhatsApp (la messagerie chiffr\u00e9e de Facebook) et l'autre Twitter. Le r\u00e9cent r\u00e8glement europ\u00e9en sur la protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles (RGPD) l'autorise \u00e0 sanctionner chacune de ces entreprises d'une amende \u00e9gale \u00e0 4 % de leur chiffre d'affaires mondial respectif. </p><p><br/>(...) Ces deux dossiers, sur les 21 enqu\u00eates lanc\u00e9es contre des g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique depuis l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur en mai 2018 du RGPD, sont arriv\u00e9s sur son bureau apr\u00e8s un long examen par ses \u00e9quipes. Partout en Europe, les diff\u00e9rentes CNIL, ainsi que les Gafa, attendent ce verdict avec impatience. Car il pourrait en dire long sur la capacit\u00e9 et la volont\u00e9 de la commissaire irlandaise \u00e0 r\u00e9guler les \"big tech\" dans un pays qui, au contraire, a tout fait pour les attirer... La position d'Helen Dixon n'est pas ais\u00e9e. (...) En coulisse, les pressions viennent de toutes parts. Au niveau politique, les r\u00e9dacteurs du RGPD attendent une autre sanction pour l'exemple, apr\u00e8s l'amende record de 50 millions d'euros inflig\u00e9s \u00e0 Google par la France en janvier dernier. <br/><br/>(...) La plupart des observateurs saluent le volontarisme d'Helen DIXON et de la DPC mais notent que leur culture anglo-saxonne les pousse davantage vers le compromis que la confrontation. (...) a CNIL irlandaise a tout fait pour asseoir son pouvoir et obtenir davantage de moyens. Helen Dixon vient de recruter une trentaine de sp\u00e9cialistes en plus des 139 collaborateurs existants et de s\u00e9curiser 2 millions d'euros en plus pour 2020, portant son budget total pour 2020 \u00e0 16,9 millions d'euros. (...) Helen DIXON esp\u00e8re conclure 19 autres enqu\u00eates en cours avant la fin d'ann\u00e9e 2020.\" <br/><br/>Rapha\u00ebl BALENIERI - lesechos.fr du 29 novembre 2019 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGPQU-QU20191202a009</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGPQU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XN2-J9H1-DXKN-V39R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402542</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Presse (SGP) Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>La Correspondance de la Publicit\u00e9</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"05055\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>lundi 2 d\u00e9cembre 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Lettre d'information</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

After ordering the shutdown of China's consulate in Houston and claiming two Chinese hackers targeted US companies working on the virus and stealing information, we are yet to see the Chinese response.</p><p>US-China relations have been worsening since the beginning of the year on several fronts including the handling of the coronavirus, cutting Huawei's operation in the US and abroad, revoking Hong Kong's special status after China imposed a new national security law on the city, and several other issues.</p><p>However, the closure of a consulate is unprecedented and could take the cold war onto a new level.</p><p>The market reaction to the latest developments has been muted. US stocks ended Wednesday's session near their multi-month highs, the Dollar continued its downward trajectory against its major peers and the damage was limited to Chinese equities and the Yuan to some extent \u2013 which is trading back above seven against the Dollar.</p><p>Hopes for another round of US stimulus and better-than-expected earnings from the big tech firms is keeping the rally alive, despite valuations becoming extremely overstretched. But if worsening US-China trade relations lead to re-imposing trade tariffs, then it's likely to mark the short-term top in equities.</p><p>Better-than-expected earnings from Tesla and Microsoft are not the true reason why stocks are at current levels. It is because monetary and fiscal intervention have left few options for investors to park their money.</p><p>Consider that high investment grade bond yields dipped below 2% for the first time ever on Wednesday and that US 10-year Treasuries are yielding 0.6%, which when deducting inflation, will leave investors with a negative return of 0.9%. That is a huge disruption to how markets function in normal times, but policymakers on the fiscal and monetary side are obliged to take these steps to prevent the economy from collapsing, even though they know their measures are creating bubbles in several asset classes.</p><p>Gold continues to be a safer bet than chasing overvalued stocks. With yields expected to remain low for a long time, inflation projections likely to head higher in the months to come and geopolitical tensions on the rise, some great ingredients are present for the precious metal to continue attracting inflows.</p><p>Only $50 away from the all time high, it is only a matter of time for the yellow metal to see a new record.</p><p>For information, disclaimer and risk warning note visit: FXTM</p><p>FXTM Brand: ForexTime Limited is regulated by CySEC and licensed by the SA FSCA.

Let's get started. I'm sure there'll be some stragglers. But thank you all, and welcome to you all and thanks for coming here today. It was relatively short notice. I think -- yes, Christian will present first. And then James will go after him and then we'll open it up to Q&amp;A. We set 3 hours. I'm hoping that it doesn't last that long, but we're willing to take all the questions that you have.</p><p>First of all, we'll do questions from you in the room and then we'll also open it up to the phone lines as well. To really kill the buzz, I'm just going to have to read out the forward-looking statement. So just before we get started, I'd like to remind you that the presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which may not develop as we currently expect. I, therefore, ask you to take notice of the precautionary warning at the end of our materials.</p><p>With that, let me hand over to Christian.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, DEUTSCHE BANK AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT: Thanks, James, and hello, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for coming today, and thank you for joining us on a very important day for Deutsche Bank. Yesterday, as you know, we announced the most radical transformation in our bank from decades. We are actually doing nothing short of reinventing Deutsche Bank. Today's presentation will be followed by an Investor Day in the fourth quarter, where our new leadership team will present their respective in-depth strategies to you in person.</p><p>Let's get started and take a look at the challenges we have to address. This transformation were built on the progress we made over the past year. We successfully stabilized our bank and started to reducing costs and focusing our business. But when we are taking an honest look into the mirror, we all know we are not yet there where we need to be. As our share price development in the past 18 months demonstrates there are fundamental questions about our ability to compete successfully in our current setup. I think no one is more disappointed than I about our share price. It is our responsibility and, yes, it is our duty to demonstrate Deutsche Bank's real value and to make Deutsche Bank's core strengths visible again.</p><p>To achieve this, we need to do more, and we are fully aware of the challenges we have to address. First of all, we are simply not profitable enough. In 2018, we made our first profit in 4 years, but we all agree that our RoTE of 0.5% on group level is simply unacceptably low. In particular, parts of our investment banking business have been a drag on our results for years now. So that's where we have to start.</p><p>Our second challenge has also been with us for quite some time; our costs are still too high. We made progress last year when we sustainably decreased our cost base for the first time, but we now have to continue and even reinforce this discipline across the bank.</p><p>Discipline is also key to overcome the poor culture of capital allocation. Too many resources went to businesses where we don't compete to win. And actually, leading to underinvestment in areas where we would have far more potential. Simply put, we kept too many options open.</p><p>Focusing our business will also help to address our leverage ratio. We have to ensure that any doubts about the strengths of our balance sheet, including the leverage ratio are put to rest for good. But above all, we need to listen to our clients and build a bank, which really reflects their needs and what they expect from us. We don't just have to talk about being client-centric, we simply have to live it. And this leads to the fundamental question of who this bank wants to be? What is our north star when reshaping Deutsche Bank? What is actually our mission?</p><p>For me personally, it is about rediscovering what our bank has stood for in the better part of its 150-year history. It is about reinvigorating our traditional values, and it is about focusing on the areas where we are simply at our best. And our mission has 4 dimensions. We are the leading German bank with a global network. We are aligned with the strengths of our whole market economy, the strongest one in Europe. No German bank is as global as we are, and no global bank is as German as we are.</p><p>German, European and multinational companies are at the heart of what we do, and many of the financial solutions they need most are those which we actually do best: cash management, trade finance, foreign exchange, financing, strategic advisory and investment advice. These are the real strengths of our bank. And with this offering, we are at the center of what our corporate, institutional and our private clients actually expect from us and what they need. However, our client needs are changing dramatically reflecting the unprecedented digital revolution, and also, the increasing uncertainties we experience in today's world. We will align our bank closely to their changing needs. That means we have to make a further step change in embracing technology, but there is much more to that.</p><p>While platform and technology solutions will dominate standard services, it will be equally important that we remain the trusted adviser and the risk manager for our clients. This is what defines our mission going forward. To live this mission, we can build on the solid foundations that we have laid out, including a robust balance sheet and effective controls safeguarding our integrity, but we have to be more focused in what we are doing.</p><p>First and foremost, we will only operate where our clients want us to be, as that is where we also have the greatest potential to grow profitably. What is equally important, it is not only about short-term wins, which may turn out to be a burden in the long term, we are committed to creating sustainable value.</p><p>And third, going forward, we will only operate where we are competitive. We try to compete in nearly every area of the banking market at the same time. We simply spread ourselves too thin. We too often try to generate revenues wherever they happen to pop-up. That was technical behavior, not growth driven by strategy or even purpose. That in turn has exactly created the culture of poor capital allocation I was talking about before. Going forward, we need to focus our bank on where we are most competitive. To put it simply, you maximize your returns where you are one of the market leaders. These will be our guiding principles going forward, and we have to provide our strong businesses the oxygen they need to prosper, while clearly withdrawing it from others.</p><p>To this end, we have taken decisive action. First, we need to do more than merely trim the perimeter, like we did in the past. That is why we are going to exit our Equities business, including Prime Finance, Cash Equities Trading and Equity Derivatives, while retaining a focused equity capital markets operation around selected core industries.</p><p>As demonstrated by the preliminary agreement which we signed with BNP Paribas yesterday, we actually received a lot of unsolicited interest to purchase those businesses. This clearly confirms our view that these are good assets, but they simply don't fit our strategy. We will also resize our Rates business and accelerate the wind-down of our nonstrategic assets. As a result, we plan to cut RWA allocated to these activities by almost 40%.</p><p>Second, we are going to move corporate banking back to the center of this company. This will be done by merging our corporate banking activities into one and use fourth division. This is the business Deutsche Bank was founded for. However, we have to admit we lost our compass in the last 2 decades when it comes to that business. Now we will make it -- the business stronger than ever before. This division, along with the Private Bank and Asset Management, will actually benefit from a reallocation of our capital and additional investments. We are fully committed to growing this business in a profitable way.</p><p>Third, we will cut our costs further. The exit of these businesses, the new setup of our infrastructure as well as our investment into IT will make it possible to substantially reduce both our noncompensation costs and our workforce. This means that we will reduce adjusted costs far beyond the exited businesses. As a result, we intend to reduce overall adjusted costs by EUR 6 billion to EUR 17 billion in 2022 -- to be precise by 2022. The number of full-time equivalent employees is set to fall by 18,000 to 74,000 over the same period.</p><p>Fourth, we will continue to invest into our technology platforms. To that end, we plan to spend EUR 13 billion in this space by 2022. This will enable our infrastructure to become simply more efficient. And this will also facilitate growth as we enhance the innovation power in all our businesses. As important, as the investment amount are the people who actually do this. And that is why I'm particularly excited that Bernd Leukert is joining us from SAP to spearhead exactly this mission.</p><p>And fifth, we are going to manage our capital in a much more disciplined way. To that end, we are creating a capital release unit to manage down approximately EUR 75 billion in RWAs and close to EUR 300 billion in leveraged exposure. Winding down these assets will substantially improve our leverage ratio and free up resources to allow for shareholder returns. These decisions will make our bank more competitive, more resilient and simpler to understand, but also simpler to operate. Our bank will be comprised of 4 strong and profitable business units deeply interlinked with each other.</p><p>Our Corporate Bank, as I said, will be at the center of Deutsche Bank. The Corporate Bank will be built around our transaction bank and it will be strengthened by our commercial clients unit, which actually houses our MidOcean clients that will move over from the current Private &amp; Commercial Bank, including Postbank. This new and unified Corporate Bank will service more than 1 million clients, holding over EUR 200 billion of deposits and generating more than EUR 5 billion in annual revenues right from the outset.</p><p>All our businesses will now work in close cooperation with the Corporate Bank in order to realize the tremendous potential we have. For example, more than 2/3 of our corporate banking clients already use our investment banking services. On the other hand, only a fraction of our Wealth Management clients have a corporate banking relationship with us. So clearly, we have a tremendous foundation to build on, but there remains further potential for us to capture.</p><p>Let me now dive deeper into how we plan actually to develop our new division, the Corporate Bank. This is a very exciting business active in a growing and attractive market. And again, we have a great competitive position. Let me provide you with some numbers. All DAX 30 companies are clients of our transaction bank and use our anchor cash products like payments, clearing as well as liquidity management. The first half of 2019 alone, we facilitated payments worth more than EUR 100 trillion. We have a top 5 market position in each of global transaction bank, financing and FX. We provide the products our clients require most and foremost in their day-to-day banking business. We help to manage liquidity and payments. We mitigate foreign exchange and interest rate risks and we provide clients access to working capital and also strategic financing. Simply put, we are relevant and our clients need us. Last year, this business generated attractive margins with a 9% RoTE, and the great news is we have substantial room to further improve this, not by doing rocket science, no, by simply reaping low-hanging fruit. And let me tell you how we are going to do that.</p><p>We need to address client needs much more thoroughly than we have done it in the past. Going forward, we need to deliver seamless, highly efficient and fully integrated solutions to our clients. This is something we have begun to address with the decision to merge all of our corporate banking activities now under 1 umbrella. Now we will be able to fully align our products, our standards, our competencies and our platform without internal structural barriers. The further changes that we will truly put our client needs at the forefront. And to that end, we will shift from a product and sales mindset to a client-coverage mindset. Why haven't we done this in the past? Because we haven't been set up in this way. Most cooperates don't think in banking products. They want a holistic solution for their financial requirements, in particular, when we talk about their day-to-day business. And we are turning our current coverage model upside down. In this division, we are the bank for the treasurers. So the relationship managers who are in touch with them must be our strongest people. This alignment will be completed before the end of the year. And this is the real game changer how we internally operate.</p><p>Finally, in order to deliver our clients solutions wherever they need them, we also need to bolster our footprint in all regions and further develop our digital platforms. This means our first incremental euro or dollar investment will be spent in the Corporate Bank. Europe will always be our home market, and we aim to continue increasing our market share. In Asia, we will continue our growth story. And as the overall revenue pool is now bigger than in Europe and is growing at a much faster rate, it's the clear growth region for Deutsche Bank.</p><p>In the Americas, we will invest selectively with the aim to capture additional growth with the big tech companies and to complement our global platform. What the people in the business are most excited about is the fact that we are an early mover and becoming the financial backbone for many of the world's leading online marketplaces as well as some of the most promising startups.</p><p>As such, we have become an integral player in enabling online marketplaces to manage their explosive growth. Among these marketplaces, 85 of 145 companies in scope for aggregate payments are our clients. We are processing payments for them. We manage their currencies. We do lending. We are their partner of choice. As a result, this part of the business has grown from EUR 0 to EUR 0.25 billion in revenues in only a few years. Stay tuned, this will be a very exciting space for Deutsche Bank.</p><p>As you can see, we have a tremendous business here. It now has its freedom. It has a great management team and it will get the resources to grow. And unlike the past, we will make sure that we won't lose cost discipline for the sake of growth. We intend to deliver cost decreases of around 2% annually also in that business. Our Corporate Bank is resilient. It is competitive and profitable the type of business alike. And I hope you can see it and you can feel it, it is exciting.</p><p>By executing our strategy, we aim to grow the Corporate Bank to a roughly EUR 6 billion business with EUR 2 billion in pretax earnings by 2022. That's absolutely achievable, assuming an annual growth rate of approximately 3%. A conservative assumption given that transaction banking has seen significantly higher growth rates across the industry recently. And let me put this into a context, if you were put a conservative valuation multiple on this, the corporate bank alone would be worth more than the entire bank today. That shows the value inherent in our bank. And that was previously hidden, but will now become transparent to all.</p><p>Our investment bank will shrink in size, but gain in competitiveness and resilience. Our investment bank is and will remain core to what we do and it will become a much better business. We have great investment banking businesses that is crucial for our corporate and wealth management clients and also for other business. Actually, where we are an important partner for our institutional clients and where we earn excellent returns on the capital we have employed. In our reshaped investment bank, we are top 5 in about 75% of our core businesses. We will continue to be a leader in the debt financing markets across investment grade, leverage finance, asset-backed securities and commercial real estate.</p><p>We will continue to have one of the top FX businesses in the world and continue to be a trusted adviser to our corporate and financial sponsors' clients. And although we are exiting Equity Sales &amp; Trading, we will play and continue to play a role supporting our clients in primary equity capital markets activities like IPOs. It is our view that secondary flows in this business are becoming increasingly less linked to primary activity. So our objectives in the investment bank are clear. We want to invest to stabilize our business and focus where we have a real competitive advantage. We want to be a leading financing advisory and solution provider to our clients, and we want to build on the success of our digital platforms. This is the future of our business.</p><p>We will concentrate our resources where we have competitive products and solution for our target clients on areas where we can achieve acceptable returns. We will cover this in much more detail during our Investor Day later this year. The days of spectacular ambition in these divisions are behind us, but the years of a fiercely competitive, well-respected and a sustainably profitable investment bank are coming. By 2022, our target is to have an investment bank with revenues of around EUR 7.5 billion and a pretax result of close to EUR 2 billion. Going forward, we expect to deliver cost decreases of 4% annually.</p><p>Let me now move to our private bank. We have made good headway with the business in recent years, making solid progress with the integration of Postbank and creating a market leader with approximately 20 million clients in our home market, the biggest economy in Europe. We have become a digital leader with 11 million clients onto our digital retail platform, and these clients are very active and loyal. We have more than 100 million digital client interactions per month. As these numbers demonstrate, we have the necessary scale to strengthen our position as the leading private client platform in Germany, servicing all customers from retail to ultrahigh net worths. This includes our global wealth management, which is the market leader in Germany and has more than EUR 200 billion of assets under management globally. But we know we have to do more. We have to move faster, especially in the retail business, which is developing at incredible speed. We want to be at the forefront of these developments, and we are committed to become significantly more profitable. This is not something we are launching today, we are actually already well underway. We have seen growth both in lending and investment products in the first quarter of 2019, and we are determined to keep up exactly this momentum.</p><p>While we want to grow client volumes, we are also reviewing our pricing structures and will adapt them to the ongoing low interest rate environment. While these measures will help grow our revenues, we continue to work on our costs, expecting the first EUR 200 million of synergies from the integration of Postbank and Deutsche Bank in Germany this year, and this is only the beginning. It remains our strategic priority to realize the full synergy potential we have previously communicated, and we won't stop here. We are aiming to realize additional efficiencies by 2022. James will lead through this when he talks about the details of the plan. But it's not only about costs, it's also about sustained growth. We will further strengthen our Wealth Management franchise by building on its strong German and European business and particular areas of growth and investments will be the Americas and our Emerging Markets region, which includes Asia Pacific and the Middle East. And of course, we will go all-in on digital. Expect us to continue to set the pace in Germany, building on our digital client base. By 2022, we are aiming for our private bank to have close to EUR 10 billion in revenues, delivering well in excess of EUR 2 billion in pretax profit.</p><p>With that, let's move to our fourth division, Asset Management. With more than EUR 700 billion of assets under management, DWS is the market leader in Germany and one of the leading management franchises in Europe. We have already made significant changes to DWS over the last few months. We have overhauled the senior executive team and consolidated the digital platform business. And these actions have already begun to pay off with the business returning to net inflows in the first quarter of this year. The Asset Management business will continue to pursue its objective of becoming one of the top 10 asset managers globally. The management team will capitalize on the positive momentum we saw in the first quarter and build on the net new inflow.</p><p>In this context, we expect to benefit from existing and new strategic partnerships, an approach which has already been bearing fruits. The Asset Management business will strengthen key strategic partnerships and deepen growth efforts in particularly in Asia. And it isn't only about retail investors, DWS aims to outperform the industry in the institutional business this year. We will also targeting significant cost efficiencies and are on track to deliver on the EUR 150 million of annual savings by 2020.</p><p>In short, we have a great business and a highly attractive market. Our new leadership team has reenergized the franchise, and we are focused on building on the positive momentum we have created. By 2022, we expect Asset Management to be a business with around EUR 2.5 billion in revenues with a pretax result of more than EUR 700 million. As you can see, this new Deutsche Bank will be built on 4 distinct resilient and competitive businesses, each with their own clear strategy and dedicated management team centered around distinct client segments.</p><p>Our business has a focused growth plan with efficient capital allocation, and we are targeting increases in both revenues and RoTE across-the-board. And we are not reaching for the stars here. Our aspirations are based on the assumptions of core revenues growing by just 2% per year. I'm sure you have seen much higher numbers in former strategy presentations. We are being more conservative this time, and we are fully confident that we can achieve this. By 2022, we believe the bank can generate close to EUR 25 billion in revenues and more than EUR 6 billion in pretax profit.</p><p>Now you know where we are heading to, but how do we get there? In this regard, we have created a four-pronged approach that has been built bottom up over the last 5 months. The 4 levers will be delivered in parallel and are entirely synchronized. First of all, we will exit loss-making business and expand our higher return in growth business. This leads to our second priority. We will restructure the bank, in particular, our infrastructure functions to reduce our costs further. Third, to implement this, we need a new leadership team and a new leadership culture. And finally, we are going to be much more disciplined in the way we allocate capital and free up resources, both for investments and for distribution to shareholders going forward.</p><p>Let's go through these levers one by one. Our approach of refocusing the bank manifests in 3 ways. As I said, first, by exiting businesses in which we are simply not competitive. This is one example why this is different from the past. We are creating a bank that competes to win. If we can't compete with the best, we won't be in the game. The business we are exiting, we are underperforming or even loss-making in the past and a drag on our pretax profit of EUR 1.1 billion in 2018 alone. Second, as a result, we will be able to allocate more capital to our growing business. This is a radical step change for the bank. Our businesses will be pursuing growth strategies going forward. This will energize our people and materially increase our competitiveness.</p><p>Having said this, we will be disciplined in our capital allocation. Capital will be allocated to those business and regions where we do have a competitive advantage. Revenue growth alone is not enough. It is all about profitable growth. No ifs, no buts.</p><p>As we are exiting business, we will also focus the investments in our IT. Despite our more focused perimeter, we will continue to invest in innovation and development. This will ensure that we continue to set standards, in particular, in digital solutions. More on that later.</p><p>By refocusing our activities, Deutsche Bank will inherently become more resilient. The share of relatively stable, reliable revenues will increase further as we will be much less dependent on volatile Sales &amp; Trading revenues. In our new setup, we expect the investment bank to contribute 30% to the core revenues. And just as important, about 75% of our remaining investment banking revenues already hold a top 5 market position. In short, we intend our revenue and earnings quality to substantially improve, making us more competitive and a resilient bank with lower capital costs. This makes it crystal clear to our employees, our clients and our public shareholders alike, Deutsche Bank is set up to win in every business we choose to compete in. And these changes give us and our regulators the confidence to lower our target core Tier 1 ratio to at least 12.5%.</p><p>Our transformation will build and materially accelerate our restructuring and cost-reduction program. As I said, we are committed to reducing our adjusted costs by 1/4 or EUR 6 billion to EUR 17 billion in 2022. Our aim is to reduce Deutsche Bank's cost income ratio from 93% in 2018 to 70% in 2022. This new target is for me as nonnegotiable as the EUR 23 billion cost number that we set and achieved last year. Why I'm so confident? Because we have planned this in detail and all businesses were part of the planning throughout a structured process over the past few months. James will lead you through the details of this plan later on.</p><p>While reducing costs, it is absolutely vital that we continue to improve our control systems. We have made already good progress as was demonstrated by our result in the Federal Reserve's 2019 CCAR process. Now we need to continue to invest. We need to embrace technology to ensure that our systems and processes are reliable, lean and future-proofed. And that is why we are committing to allocate EUR 4 billion of our investments to further improve our control environment by 2022, making it both more effective and efficient. This restructuring will be a real game-changer for Deutsche Bank. It will swiftly and significantly rightsize our cost base and make our business scalable for the platform here on.</p><p>To create this new bank, it needs a new leadership structure and a new leadership culture. This culture must be team-oriented, entrepreneurial, accountable and committed, and the leadership team must represent one bank. I'm also deeply convinced that we have to connect the Management Board much closer to the rest of the bank. This is why we will introduce a new leadership structure, which will free up management capacity for our business and clients on the one hand and ensure a maximum of efficiency control and connectivity on the other. Therefore, we have decided to reshape our Management Board. It will only include the central and regional functions going forward. Among these central functions, there is a newly created role of a dedicated management board member for technology, data and innovation. This underpins the importance of efficiency and innovation for our bank and Bernd Leukert will bring a new skill set to this management team. Whereas the business units will be represented in the newly created global management committee. Around that, there is a third circle, the senior leadership team. It comprises the top 30 managers of the bank, including the vital infrastructure functions.</p><p>Our fourth priority is freeing up and returning capital to our shareholders. By establishing our new capital release unit, which will hold about 1/5 of our leverage exposure, we will ensure that we exit nonstrategic positions and assets as well as businesses. These are quality assets and partially of short duration. That's why the wind down should be rather quick. We expect our 50% of the reductions in credit and market risk RWA to occur in 2019, with more than 70% to be done by the end of 2020.</p><p>While the restructuring at the CRU wind down, it will be funded without asking shareholders for capital. We will waive dividends for 2019 and 2020, but we intend to pay the 81 coupons, but we will compensate shareholders afterwards. The planned balance sheet reductions are expected to generate EUR 5 billion of excess capital, which we plan to return through dividends and share buybacks starting in 2022. Our strategy and the planned deleveraging will substantially improve our leverage ratio. We believe that the bank can now comfortably run with a fully loaded leverage ratio of 4.5% by the end of 2020 rising to around 5% in 2022.</p><p>As I said, our new core Tier 1 ratio of at least 12.5% takes into account the significant adjustments in our business model towards a much more balanced and stable bank as well as our improvements in our control environment over the past few years. Our plan has been discussed in detail with our home regulators who supports the direction and transformation of Deutsche Bank as well as the targets laid out as part of our multi-year process. We are, of course, committed to working closely with our supervisors around the world as we have done consistently in the past. We will also deploy our capital in a very different manner. The main reason for our low price-to-book ratio is that we have not been disciplined enough in using our base of tangible equity of EUR 50 billion. How will we change this? If the value of a company is at 1/3 of its book value, there's a very easy way to increase shareholder return, giving back capital. We plan to liberate EUR 5 billion of capital for distribution to shareholders starting in 2022.</p><p>And finally, our new business mix should reduce volatility and earnings -- of earnings and our funding needs. In the future, around 85% to 90% of our funding will come from stable sources, materially lowering our need to go-to-market for funding.</p><p>This was the summary of what we plan to do. Let me now hand over to James for further details.</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE, CFO &amp; MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, DEUTSCHE BANK AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT: Thank you. Christian has just articulated how we're thinking differently about the bank. I'm going to go through our planning assumptions and the financial path behind these commitments. We will focus on 3 key areas as shown on Slide 20.</p><p>First is to improve efficiency. With the more focused business perimeter, we're better positioned to attack costs and drive significant efficiency improvements. We aim to reduce adjusted costs by around EUR 6 billion to EUR 17 billion in 2022. That's a big reduction. However, with business exits and reductions for measures we've already announced, the additional improvements are achievable. Even with realistic revenue growth assumptions, that would put us at a cost-to-income ratio of 70% in 2022. And this will provide sufficient margin for us to manage and invest in our businesses. We will be disciplined and focused on our execution as we've demonstrated in the past several quarters.</p><p>Second, we will further optimize our balance sheet. As Christian has said, the capital release unit will wind down around EUR 280 billion of leverage exposure, principally in low-yielding assets. We're developing a detailed portfolio-by-portfolio plan, and we're confident that we can do this in a capital-efficient manner. The outcome will be greater balance sheet efficiency and significantly reduced funding requirements.</p><p>Third, executing on our planned cost reductions and balance sheet optimization will enable us to grow our return on tangible equity. Under our new definition, which is after the payment of 81 coupons, we believe that the group can generate an 8% return on tangible equity in 2022. This return level in our view approaches the cost of capital for our new business mix and is realistic given the interest rate environment we're facing. Importantly, getting to these returns depends on factors, which are largely in our control and require very little in the way of growth or its external support.</p><p>Let's now look at how we get there. Christian has explained how we will center around 4 core businesses plus a separately created Capital Release Unit, or CRU. We will report under this new structure starting in the third quarter and we'll provide you with restated results before then.</p><p>Our core bank reflects our strategic vision and will comprise the new corporate bank, the refocused investment bank, the private bank and asset management as well as our corporate and other segment.</p><p>Slide 21 provides you with our pro forma 2018 financials and shows the drag from low yielding and no longer strategic assets. Activities that are being moved to the CRU accounted for around 10% of group revenues in 2018 but consumed over 20% of our balance sheet. The CRU was loss-making with a negative 6% return on equity. The core bank achieved a pro forma 1.7% return on tangible equity and operated with an 87% cost-to-income ratio. This shows the work ahead of us as well as the opportunity.</p><p>Let's go through the levers that will drive how we will improve returns in more details starting with revenues on Slide 22. As we transform our bank, we are taking what we believe is a realistic approach to forecasting our revenues. Our core bank generated revenues of EUR 22.8 billion in 2018, and we expect to grow from this level by around EUR 2 billion over the next 4 years, a little less than 10% in aggregate. Around half of this growth will come from lower funding requirements and a modest improvement in the interest rate environment we expect over this period. The funding improvements are modeled and almost entirely in our control given our smaller and less market-dependent balance sheet. We've reset our interest rate assumptions to reflect market expectations. But amongst other things, European short-term rates improved to only 0% during 2021.</p><p>In the core bank, we forecast revenue growth of approximately 2% per year with no business growth forecast for our investment bank. These growth rates are broadly consistent with or lower than the nominal GDP growth where we operate. We believe that this is appropriately conservative as a set of planning assumptions that we will look to outperform.</p><p>Let's now turn to costs on Slide 23. We must maintain our recent momentum of driving cost discipline within the organization. Based on detailed bottom-up planning, we expect to be able to reduce our adjusted costs by a little less than EUR 6 billion over the next 4 years. These reductions can be broken down into 3 buckets. First, we're on track to deliver the previously announced EUR 1 billion of cost reductions in 2019. And we commit to an incremental EUR 300 million reduction resulting from our business exits. We expect to incur EUR 600 million of one-off software and real estate impairments in 2019 related to our strategic decisions.</p><p>Second, adjusted costs within our exited businesses will be EUR 3.3 billion, excluding previous announced -- previously announced reductions. As a result, we expect the pro forma adjusted cost base in our 2019 core bank to be around EUR 18.8 billion. The private bank should generate around EUR 1.4 billion of cost reductions in addition to the EUR 200 million that we will realize this year. I'll give more detail on these substantial reductions shortly.</p><p>And third, we have ongoing cost management actions to achieve the remaining relatively modest reductions. These declines will be mostly within our infrastructure where we can streamline, reduce complexity and remove duplicate functions. This is not about a radical program, it's about instilling the discipline, transparency and culture to attack expenses on a daily basis. Additionally, we'll adjust our real estate footprint to the lower workforce size and perimeter. We're confident that by 2022, we will have removed EUR 2.6 billion of the costs within the Capital Release Unit. This will leave a further EUR 1 billion that we need to reduce. We will work tirelessly to cut these residual costs, but we believe that it is right to be conservative in our planning at this stage.</p><p>Let me focus for a moment on the cost reductions in the private bank. Slide 24 gives some details around the incremental EUR 1.4 billion of cost reductions in our private bank between 2019 and 2022. Around 40% of the savings should come from our German operations, including the merger-related synergies, of which EUR 200 million will have occurred in 2019. We've recently reached agreements with the workers' representatives for the head office integration. A further EUR 200 million of cost reductions come from lower-than-previously announced investment spend related to this investment program. We also expect to reduce costs in our international operations, driven in part by lower investment spend in our platforms, mostly in Italy and Spain. Finally, the private bank will also benefit from a series of infrastructure rationalization measures, including lower real estate costs.</p><p>To execute on our plans, we will take substantial upfront costs in 2019, as you can see on Slide 25. In the second quarter, specifically, we expect our restructuring to have a total pretax impact of EUR 900 million with an additional EUR 2 billion in deferred tax asset valuation adjustment. These charges will impact our Common Equity Tier 1 capital by approximately EUR 200 million with a EUR 2 billion reduction in our tangible book value.</p><p>For 2019 as a whole, we expect total charges against net income of EUR 5.1 billion with a EUR 2 billion impact on CET1 capital and EUR 3.6 billion on tangible book value. In aggregate between 2019 and 2022, we expect restructuring and severance charges of EUR 2.3 billion. Including the EUR 600 million already on the balance sheet at the end of last year, we will have EUR 2.9 billion of restructuring and severance provisions. These provisions will be principally used to fund EUR 2.6 billion of annual compensation and benefits spending -- savings. The additional EUR 3.2 billion of cost savings only incur very modest restructuring charges. So the 2 important numbers for you to be mindful of are the EUR 2.9 billion of restructuring provisions to pay for the EUR 2.6 billion of compensation and benefits savings.</p><p>Our plans are fully costed based on our prior experience and reflect the significant proportion of reductions related to our front office locations, in particular, in London and New York.</p><p>As Christian said, it is critical for us at that we do not lose the momentum we have built in our IT investment spending which has been running at a little less than EUR 4 billion a year. This spend has enabled us to serve clients better, become safer, more efficient and better controlled. And despite the smaller footprint, our investment plans in 2019 are broadly unchanged as we reallocate resources to our core businesses. We do still expect IT spend to peak in 2019 and then decline somewhat reflecting our smaller footprint and benefits from previous investments.</p><p>We will also benefit from savings made in internalizing the 5,000 external IT contractors that we have, principally within our corporate and investment bank. These programs, which began in 2018, will generate about EUR 300 million of net savings by 2022. We will continue to invest, but our delivery will improve.</p><p>Now let's turn to our second area of focus, optimizing our balance sheet. I'll start with the Capital Release Unit on Slide 27. At the end of 2018, the portfolios comprising the CRU had approximately EUR 74 billion of risk-weighted assets, including EUR 36 billion of operational risk RWAs and EUR 288 billion of leverage exposure. Of this leverage exposure, more than half comes from the equities business and approximately 30% is related to legacy fixed income positions, mainly low return derivative inventory. Given the nature of these assets, they have a different runoff profile and costs to exit than our own historical and peer comparisons. The assets in CRU are typically held at fair value with significant natural runoff. We will also transfer our former nonstrategic portfolio into the CRU.</p><p>As we have previously disclosed, this accounted for EUR 7 billion in RWA and EUR 25 billion in leverage exposure at the end of 2018. We expect to achieve most of the rundown in the CRU within the next 18 months. Within the first 12 months, we expect that a material portion of the exposure in the CRU will run off naturally, driven principally by the Prime Finance balances. You will have seen that we entered into a preliminary agreement with BNP Paribas to transfer our Prime Finance balances, electronic technology and staff to BNP Paribas.</p><p>We believe that this is commercially the right decision for our clients, our employees and our ongoing institutional franchise. However, as we work to finalize a transaction, it may lead to a slightly slower pace of RWA and leverage exposure reductions for year-end 2019 depending on the closing time line. And for the remainder of the assets, we will take opportunities to accelerate the wind-down where it's economically rational. We've made assumptions around wind-down costs, which are included in our forecasts, and we believe are conservative relative to previous experience and the nature of these assets. But as you can understand, we are not going to publicly disclose this number. The credit and market risk RWAs within the CRU should also reduce relatively quickly. The impact on operational risk RWA from the exit of the equities business is comparatively modest due to its low-loss history. We are working with our regulators to reduce this operational risk RWA, reflecting our smaller footprint and the resulting lower loss history. At this stage, we do not factor in material declines in our operational risk RWA, but reductions would provide additional upside to our current deleveraging estimates.</p><p>Now let me turn to capital on Slide 29. As Christian said earlier, we aim to be careful stewards of our shareholders capital. We will fund our transformation within our existing capital resources. We believe the balance sheet and RWA reductions we achieve in the CRU will further support our solid capital position and funding metrics. Reflecting the lower risk nature of our businesses going forward and having consulted with the ECB and other regulators, we feel comfortable slightly lowering our CET1 ratio from 13% to at least 12.5%. This adjustment reflects anticipated reductions in our regulatory floors and maintains appropriate headroom above our likely minimum requirements. We've also made the painful but necessary decision to recommend to shareholders that we do not pay common equity dividends with respect to 2019 and 2020.</p><p>The capital soundness of the bank is, of course, paramount to us. Our plans are conservative, and we will manage our existing resources to keep our CET1 ratio at least 12.5% at all times. For the end of 2019, we expect our CET1 ratio to be around 13% with the reduction in risk-weighted assets broadly offsetting the negative impact of regulatory capital headwinds, which we have discussed in our earnings calls. We expect our CET1 capital ratio to trough in 2020, reflecting regulatory inflation, specifically around the new securitization framework and the potential impact to low default portfolios from the targeted review of internal models. From 2020 onwards, we expect to increase capital as net income generation should more than offset investment growth and the impact of regulatory headwinds.</p><p>In total, we now expect the incremental inflation from regulatory items to be around EUR 25 billion between now and 2022. This inflation will be predominantly driven by changes in the securitization framework, default definition and targeted review of internal models. The forecast does not include any further impacts of Basel IV, and we do not expect these changes to be included in European regulations until after 2022 and the impacts are still subject to considerable uncertainty.</p><p>Our planned exits, specifically from equities, have a relatively modest impact on relative -- with future regulatory inflation. But with a more focused business, we're able to reallocate resources into improving specific models, which will help reduce future inflation. As a result, from 2021, we expect to have excess capital. We will look to return this capital to shareholders through a combination of ordinary dividends and share buybacks subject to regulatory and shareholder improvements -- approvals.</p><p>We will target a fully loaded leverage ratio above 4.5% by the end of 2020 when our deleveraging will be materially complete. As we build capital from 2021 onwards, we expect our leverage ratio to continue to improve and reach around 5% in 2022 as we maintain a discipline around balance sheet deployment. We believe that this level is sufficient for our stakeholders generally to see that leverage is a manageable constraint for our businesses. Our smaller and simpler balance sheet will also allow us to make significant improvements in our funding profile.</p><p>Long term, we expect to run with a funded balance sheet of around EUR 820 billion from 2018 levels. Around 85% to 90% of our balance sheet will be funded by stable sources, namely equity, debt, then deposits compared to around 75% today.</p><p>Market funding was already a relatively small part of our overall funding profile, but with around 70% of our funded balance sheet funded by deposits, we will have less need for short-term wholesale funding or even benchmark debt issuances. Given the balance sheet reductions, we have limited requirements to issue further debt for the remainder of 2019.</p><p>Along with a conservative balance sheet, we're committed to keeping our strong liquidity and funding as shown on Slide 32. We will continue to run with a liquidity coverage ratio of over 130%, which is at the higher end of our peer group for the next 18 months. Our net stable funding ratio or NSFR of 117% in the first quarter of 2019 was already well above the 100% requirement. As a natural consequence of the shift in our core business mix towards more stable and lower risk businesses, our NSFR is expected to increase further. And despite lower issuance requirements, our MREL will remain at healthy levels.</p><p>So in conclusion, this restructuring makes our balance sheet smaller and also materially reduces our exposure to uncertainties in the market. Beyond a smaller group balance sheet, we're also focused on reallocating resources within our core businesses as shown on Slide 33.</p><p>By 2022, we expect group risk-weighted assets, excluding operational risk and regulatory inflation to decline around 10% to a little over EUR 230 billion. On this basis, by 2022 and reflecting the lower return profile, we expect around 40% of our assets to be allocated to our investment bank and CRU down from around 50% in 2018. You can see on this slide that the balance of credit and market risk RWAs will be taken up by our private and corporate businesses as we shift the business mix of the bank. The combination of lower costs, realistic assumptions on revenues and reduced drag from low-yielding assets should lead to a material improvement in the return on tangible equity within our 4 core businesses.</p><p>Looking at the specific businesses in turn, for the private bank, we expect the return on tangible equity to improve to about 12% by 2022, driven principally by the cost reductions I outlined earlier. For the corporate bank, we believe that we can grow the RoTE to above 15%, driven mostly by modest revenue growth and cost assumptions. For the investment bank, the combination of improvements in revenues, in our funding, costs and cost reductions should conservatively allow us to increase our RoTE to over 6%. While this is still below our cost of capital, it does provide a base for further upside should market conditions ameliorate. We would further expect improvements over time as our capital allocation discipline bears fruit.</p><p>Asset management will remain a high-return business, reflecting the fiduciary nature of that business model. In 2022, we believe further positive contribution from the core bank will more than offset the drag from the Capital Release Unit leading to a group RoTE of 8%.</p><p>For 2019, our primary focus will be on reducing assets in the Capital Release Unit and continuing our ongoing cost discipline. On a comparable basis to our previous guidance, we now expect adjusted costs to decline by EUR 1.3 billion in 2019 to EUR 21.5 billion. This reflects full execution on our EUR 1 billion cost-reduction program plus further reductions from the changes announced today.</p><p>For 2020, we expect a further EUR 2 billion decline to EUR 19.5 billion, reflecting the sustained reductions in the Capital Release Unit and further benefits from the private bank integration. These cost reductions should enable us to be profitable in 2020, while absorbing the announced restructuring charges. We expect to end 2019 with a CET1 ratio of around 13%, and we will manage our existing resources to ensure that our CET1 ratio remains above at least 12.5% threshold that we have set. We expect our fully loaded leverage ratio to remain at 4% by year-end 2019 as the impacts of deleveraging are offset by lower capital. We expect this ratio to rise to 4.5% by the end of 2020 on the back of further progress in rundown in CRU leverage exposures I just mentioned. Longer term, we would aim for a leverage ratio of around 5% by 2022.</p><p>These short-term financial objectives are set as guideposts as we execute towards our long-term targets. Our principal target is to generate an 8% return on tangible equity at group level by 2022. To reach these -- this target and in conjunction with our capital reallocation and return approach, we are now targeting a cost income ratio for the group of 70% in 2022 with adjusted costs of EUR 17 billion at current exchange rates. As we have developed the financial plan which supports this strategy, we've been conservative and focused on what we can control. Revenue assumptions are relatively modest. Cost reductions, reflecting the business exits and existing measures, are fully costed within our hands and absolutely achievable. Balance sheet reductions to leverage and risk-weighted assets are substantial and are clearly broken out by area. We've been conservative in modeling the perimeter changes on operational risk RWA, and we've included conservative assumptions about the impact of regulatory inflation in the coming years.</p><p>Given our business mix, our plans are less exposed to unpredictable financial market conditions. We've detailed targets for both the near term and the midterm.</p><p>With that, let me hand back over to Christian.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Thank you, James. You can see that we are transforming this bank in a fundamental manner. We want to create a new and better Deutsche Bank. This bank is not just built on the structural changes we are going to make, it also requires a new and a different mindset. You will experience a bank that is more than client oriented, we want to become client-obsessed, a bank with employees who know they have a tremendous career opportunity and who are invested in this bank and who act and think like entrepreneurs, a leadership team that understands itself as stewards of your capital. This will also be a bank that embraces technology, a bank that invests in innovation, a bank where agility is more than a buzzword. And we will be a bank that thinks sustainably and a bank that is open to partnerships with mutual benefits. This bank will be led by responsible, accountable leadership team that actually works like a team and not like a collection of individuals.</p><p>All of these focus areas we lay out a detailed plan on our Investor Day in the first quarter. But there is one last thing we need to talk about prior to us taking your questions. Some may say that you have had this before or at least parts of it. It is different this time. We are different. We are not coming to you to share the burden. We are going to manage this transformation organically. We will not ask for additional capital. We are not denying or turning a blind eye to our weaknesses. We are tackling them head-on. We are resolute about this transformation that is why we are not trimming, we are shutting down businesses altogether. We are listening to you and your acting and what we hear.</p><p>Just one example, we are addressing the issue of leverage. We are presenting tangible and conservative plans to get to a compelling destination. We are not accountable just in 5 years' time, we are accountable every day due to short-term targets, like we did in 2018 when we also delivered. And we are relentless execution mode. I am, my team is. To us, action speak louder than words. It is my personal purpose to reconnect this bank with what it used to be and what it is supposed to be. A bank that knows who it is, who it serves, how it wins and why its people are excited to be working for it. And we have delivered on our transformation strategy where 2022 Deutsche Bank will be a growing bank with EUR 25 billion in revenues, an efficient bank with a cost income ratio of 70% and adjusted cost of EUR 17 billion, a profitable bank with a pretax profit of at least EUR 6 billion, a shareholder-oriented bank with EUR 5 billion in shareholder returns and a substantially increased price-to-book ratio and a resilient bank with winning and stable businesses, well capitalized and running with a prudent leverage ratio of around 5%. This will be a bank everybody can be proud of. This is what we will deliver. This energizes me, and this energizes our leadership team. This will energize all of our employees and also clients.</p><p>In the last 15 months, we have begun to reearn your trust in a no-nonsense way by simply delivering on what we promise. And I'm personally putting my money where my mouth is. I want to lead by example. I've decided to invest a substantial amount of my fixed salary over the next years, details will be announced with the Q2 numbers. I want to have a personal stake in this company. I'm excited about the journey ahead, and I'm confident about our success.</p><p>Thank you. And we are now ready to take your first question.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Okay. Let's just wait a second for the microphones. So I can see Andy there. So why don't we go first to Andy. Why don't you introduce yourself?</p><p>ANDREW STIMPSON, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. This is Andy from Merrill Lynch here or BofA Securities as well that will soon be called, sorry. I think you are right. You've built out that track record on the cost, so I think, my question's here on the revenue growth. And in that regard, Slide 7 and 9, both of those slides show that you want to commit more balance sheet to the corporate and private bank. But we also see on the capital slides that you are expecting hefty risk-weighted asset inflation, the op risk-weighted assets end up being stranded in the noncore and obviously, you want to return some capital to shareholders by 2022. So just want to understand better where that growth capital is coming from, please?</p><p>And then my second question and again apologies for asking this one, but if we just dare to imagine that something goes wrong for a second, and by -- if I look at the slide on capital where we've got a CET1 of 12.7% by 2020, what if it looks like you're falling below the 12.5%, say it is something that we haven't thought of yet, what's your pecking order for fixing that problem? Is it to come and raise capital? Or is it go and cut credit trading risk-weighted assets? Or is it to slow growth in the corporate bank? Anything like that would be very interested.</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Sure, Andy. I'll start with the first one, and I think Christian will take and maybe I'll add to the second. So first of all, the CRU, of course, partially funds the growth in the core businesses. As the deleveraging takes place there, there's some more resources, oxygen as Christian calls this, is freed up to invest in the core businesses. One of the underpinnings of our confidence in the growth trajectory in those core businesses is a course that we've been seeing growth and the drivers, including among other things, loan growth in the private bank. There is some element in addition that we think those businesses can self-fund their growth, again, by pushing more discipline in capital allocation, pushing out assets that don't hurdle within those businesses and hence we speak to more discipline around that.</p><p>I think the third thing to add is, you've heard us talk recently about more emphasis, if you like, on AUM-driven growth in the private bank. That's, obviously, off-balance sheet and revenue growth from fees and some degree of repricing. And so we don't want to see the growth in revenues in those businesses as being entirely dependent on balance sheet capacity. We're also going to be obviously pushing on fee and commission growth in those businesses in the business mix that they pursue.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: On your question with regard to the capital ratio in 2020, first of all, I think we have seen a track record in Deutsche Bank that we have missed our capital ratio targets over the past years. I think the way we have always forecasted, monitored and also took action when we thought we need to do more in order to be well above our guidance, the guidance well above 13%, we always met that. I think that speaks for our internal management. That's number 1. Number 2, this plan is in a way different than the previous ones because we have gone through such a detailed bottom-up plan that I really believe and also was the conservative assumptions that actually the 12.7% is shown, but that this is already a conservative assumption and, b, we, obviously, have, like in the past, we have countermeasures in place, which we can use.</p><p>Also, we will do and we will act everyday also on the operational risk RWA to bring it further down. Also there you haven't seen a really steep rundown over the next years because obviously we need to also discuss that with the regulators. There are certain regulatory requirements, but rest assured that Stuart and his team is working everyday on potential moves to further reduce this. I think this is a very conservative numbers, next to the countermeasures we have. In this regard, we are absolutely confident that with the 12.5% and then with this conservative center of 12.7%, we are fine.</p><p>Last, but not least and not that I want to rediscuss the 12.5% not at all, that's the target we have, the at least target, the minimum target, but honestly with that business setup, with the stable earnings we have in this business, if you compare that guidance with some other European banks, I think we are still conservative.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Nicholas, here.</p><p>NICHOLAS HERMAN, ASSISTANT VP AND ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hello, can you hear me? I'll try it again. Yes, it's Nicholas Herman from Citigroup. Two questions, please. Firstly, just on -- following up on the capital point, I take your point that in 2020, the 12.7% is a conservative number and that you have countermeasures, but thereafter capital -- and thereafter capital will build, but it will build slowly at least initially. What makes you confident that you will have enough capital both to return additional capital to shareholders, but also to absorb regulatory inflation, particularly through the finalization of the Basel III rules? And if you could provide an estimate on that, that will be very, very helpful.</p><p>Second question is, thank you for the detailed breakdown of how you expect the numbers by division to go. In particular, you'll be cutting costs by 4% per annum, and you'd still also deliver revenue growth on a net basis of 2% to 2.5% per annum. Curious there if you could also please provide what assumptions you've made for revenue attrition across the group, please?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Sure. I'll start on both, and hopefully, capture your questions. So first of all, when we talk about liberating resources in order to enable a capital return starting in 2022, of course, we've taken into account an estimate of regulatory inflation that we expect from Basel III final framework and in particular, FRTB, which we assume would be introduced in 2023. So the first step is, next year, we see some pretty significant regulatory inflation as I mentioned about EUR 25 billion coming from securitization framework, delinquency definitions and TRIM. Then in our planning, we assume there's something of a hiatus in '21 and '22, and then we get the FRTB impacts in 2023.</p><p>As you can imagine, one of the things that we were looking at as we thought about this strategy was essentially at least partially, future proofing, our business model for FRTB and after that Basel III. While I don't think this goes all the way there, this obviously had a significant impact in the regulatory inflation we see. At this point, while there's still uncertainty, our estimate would be that another EUR 25 billion is absorbed in 2023, and again, the capital return glide path that we're assuming takes into account that additional regulatory inflation. So I hope that answers your question about RWA inflation. As I say, we're continuing to work to mitigate these things with model approval, data improvements and additional adjustments in our businesses.</p><p>On the revenue side, well, I guess 2 things. You asked about expenses and then revenues. On the expense side, one point to note is a significant portion, like 1/3, of the expense reductions on this trajectory is assumed to take place in the infrastructure areas, so support capabilities for the businesses. Like we've talked about in the past, we want to impact the front office, if you like, revenue generating in the core businesses as little as possible so as to preserve our revenue-generating capacity. We do, to your question, assume some amount of franchise impact, if you like, in areas that are adjacent to those that we're exiting or significantly reducing, and we'd assume that takes place in the early year or 2 during this restructuring and that growth in other words, over the 4-year period, offsets that negative franchise impact what we would expect to see, and as you've seen in our numbers, principally in the investment bank.</p><p>NICHOLAS HERMAN: On the Basel IV impact -- Basel III impact [through 2027] as well, while it's then just...</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: It's too early. As you've seen in some research I think it's been good that's come out recently, the number of uncertainties starting with timing, going on to multipliers for op risk, going to CVA treatment, whether they are exceptions for commercial exposures and all of that, there's too much uncertainty for us to speculate at this point what the impact on -- in '25 or '26 would be. Again, we think we're taking actions that somewhat future proof our model because the reality is the floor abates based on the relationship between your weighted and unweighted risk balance sheet. And so this is moving in the direction of a higher risk weighting of the IFRS balance sheet, if you like. And so we see an improvement coming from these actions, but I think, it's too early to talk about '25, '26, '27.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Yes. I'll just make one additional point on your revenue question because that is close to my heart. We shouldn't forget that actually 3 out of 4 businesses have already shown over the last 6 months the momentum to increase revenues, be it on the lending side, assets under management that was in the private bank, that was in the Asset Management and in the G2B business. Those 3 businesses are actually further now benefiting from that. There is no restructuring in those business. We want to grow these business. We have the oxygen to do this. In the investment bank, obviously we have exactly what that James is saying, we are modeling in potential negative kind of attrition revenues if you close the equities business, that this have a impact on certain other business, which is modeled in, therefore, you don't see just for investment bank actually revenue increase.</p><p>But don't forget that 75% of the remaining revenues are actually holding a top 5 position. And if I talk to [Matt Dorsey] in the New York in the commercial real estate, he has actually forecasted increases in his revenue, very important business. Not affected by this at all. So I really do think that also there given not only top-down, let's hope, revenue assumptions, given that we haven done this plan over the last 3 months bottom-up, that these guys exactly know in those business, which are not affected that they can grow. There's where we are focused on. We are getting smaller in the investment bank, but far more competitive. And therefore, I believe in these numbers very much.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Mrs. Anke Reingen?</p><p>ANKE REINGEN, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Anke Reingen from RBC. Two questions, please. First on slides 22 and 23. If you can talk a bit about the trajectory. So should we see the revenues going down in some divisions and move back unloaded and the same -- on the costs, how much of the costs will be coming through early 2021 and 2022? And then on the tax rate. Just a numbers question, what's the assumption?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Sure. So to start with the revenue trajectory, look, it's complicated because, of course, the CRU is coming down the core businesses. We would see continuing the level of growth that we've seen in recent quarters and that underlying growth would be partially offset in the early quarters with the dip that I've described, if you like a franchise impact on adjacent -- in adjacent businesses. But we would see essentially a stabilization around the pro forma level, maybe a little lower next year, and then growth after that in '21. The -- we've talked about the step-down in expenses, obviously a significant step next year. And then I think a slightly more gradual path to 2017. But a lot will have been done in our glide path assumptions by 2021 in terms of the distance traveled to EUR 17 billion.</p><p>On the tax rate, that will have moved up a little bit with the shift of earnings into the jurisdictions that have slightly higher tax rates. And so we've talked in the past about low 30s, towards 30%. This probably moves it up by 2% or 3% on a run-rate basis, maybe as high as 35% while it settles down. It just takes some time for pretax profits to grow to a point where the effective tax rate begins to converge to the blended statutory rate, given the impact of temporary differences on a relatively low level of pretax profitability. So I think build 33% in sort of long term into your models maybe a little higher in the early years of stabilization.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: (inaudible)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Two questions. The first one just maybe touching on one of the points you just raised. In terms of the investment bank profitability and revenue assumptions that you factored in, maybe a slight difference versus the Slide 22 because I think in the remarks you mentioned about EUR 7.5 billion of revenues in 2022 versus EUR 6.8 billion you show for 2018, so a 2-and-a-bit percent CAGR there, but what I just want to understand is in terms of that glide path for 2019, what kind of IP revenue are you expecting in terms of maintaining the EUR 6.8 billion and where that can go, so if we think of any kind of surprises?</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Okay. I don't want to go too detailed into the model, and 2019 is underway, we'll talk about the second quarter in a few weeks' time and move into the second half. I will say and, I think, it's important on this Chart 22 to just aggregate the revenue impacts we're seeing over this projection period from the combination of interest rates and funding costs, which are essentially on the right. They represent a little less than half of the latter or the steps to 2022.</p><p>The compound growth rates that we're articulating for the businesses exclude those and they refer to the basis to your question in 2018. Clearly, there's uncertainty as to whether there's a small step back in 2019, but we've built expectations about that into our plan.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Great and thanks. And the second question is more just about when you're thinking about the plan when you're thinking about capsule, I'm just kind of curious in terms of that your point of if you were to have raised, would you have been able to do more? Just how you thought about that because obviously you're trying to differentiate, you're trying to do this in a self-contained manner, but there is also an argument some people have made to me that was potential for more restructuring if you raise some capital or that type of thing. So just curious what you're looking at?</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: I think the underlying point from where we started the whole plan is what Deutsche Bank is actually good at that you always have been certain further adjustments, which we may also think about that can happen, but the basic strategic setup and outset is done now. We know exactly where we can win. We know exactly in which businesses also in the investment banking we are strong enough to compete is exactly that where we want to be. There are some businesses also in the investment banking which stand alone, do not actually generate yet and potentially also not in 1, 2 or 3 years their returns on equity, which what you have but they are essential for our Corporate Bank, they are essential for our Wealth Management Bank. And therefore, I said already on the AGM, I want to have an investment bank with business which are either standalone that profitable that they fulfill all our return on equity requirements or they are essentially important for cross-sell into our other businesses. And that's exactly what we have done.</p><p>Now let me also give you a little bit more guidance because you may think well 6% return on equity for an investment bank in 2022 is not sufficient, why you're still doing it. That's the start. And I would like to go away from overpromising and under-delivering. I'm absolutely confident that we can deliver exactly this amount. Is my internal aspiration even higher? Yes. We have shown it last year on costs, we have shown it on the cleanup of balance sheet, we have shown it in our regulatory controls. We got progress, and we will also do it here. But times of overpromising at Deutsche Bank should be over.</p><p>KARL JONATHAN PEACE, MD, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jon Peace with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. And you've kind of given us the first half numbers for revenues the group in the old format, what would it look like in the new format, the split of core and non-core? Just give us an idea of the current year run rate?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: So we've given you '18. We're in the process of -- as you can imagine, the resegmentation exercise here is complex. Some elements of it are drag and drops, some of it is more complicated than that. So I'd ask you to wait until we're ready to provide more pro formas for you or, ultimately, the resegment numbers -- segmented numbers ahead of the third quarter.</p><p>KARL JONATHAN PEACE: And then just as a follow-up on Slide 23. The costs in the CRU units EUR 3.3 billion in 2019 trending down to EUR 1 billion in 2022, how quick does that step down? It looks like the asset has stepped down pretty quickly into 2020. So do the cost follow that?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Yes. We're aware that by the way there is a degree of lag between the front office and the support. So one of our areas of real focus and I'm looking at my partner, Frank Kunke, that we're going to have is on making sure that we target those additional expenses that support those businesses in our current allocations. So a portion of it is pretty fast. Some of it lags, and our goal is to get after of the whole block. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we're realistic that stranded funding or stranded -- I'm sorry, expenses are one of the most challenging elements of a restructuring like this. And so we're assuming that EUR 1 billion is still with us in 2022. And that's in some ways some upside that sits behind 2022 is if we can continue to get after those expenses thereafter.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Potentially just add one thing also a reason why we have been that detailed. This is not just a plan on a yearly basis. You can imagine that in particular for the next 18 months, this would be comprised of monthly plans, whether it'd be on FTE reduction, cost reduction. And therefore we know exactly where we need to be in 6 months' time, 7 months' time and 8 months' time. That's a monthly bottom-up plan which we now have to deliver on. And you know we have some experience also with kind of the Capital Release Unit from our former non-core. It's the reason why we asked Frank to lead it because he was the COO of the non-core department before, and I think we know how to then also take the cost out.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Jernej.</p><p>JERNEJ OMAHEN, MD &amp; HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GROUP, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Jernej from Goldman Sachs. I'm going to kick it off with 3 very short questions for James and then a couple of slightly longer ones. So can I just ask you the decision at the Board level was it unanimous? It's my first question. The second one is, James, you've talked about getting an initial positive indication from your home supervisor, I was just wondering whether you've triangulated or coordinated a plan with the rating agencies as well? And what response we should be expecting over the next phase? And the third very short question is, you talked about the cooperation agreement with BNP, but you left the closure date open-ended, I was just wondering whether you have a binding agreement you've entered into BNP? Or whether this is still at exploration stage? And then the slightly longer questions, so.</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Let's take a break. Everyone, let's pause.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Yes, we have full approval at the Management Board that nevertheless does not mean that each and everybody is happy then with the way forward how we strategically go about the overall plan was approved by all, that's #1. Home supervisor, I think we have had long meetings and detailed meetings, and I think also that this plan is not only discussed with them in detail, but that the milestones in terms also of target financials have been syndicated with them and then agreed was in particular the -- at least 12.5% to show that this plan was done in a robust way. And James, I hand over to you with regard to the discussions on the rating agencies.</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Sure. On the rating agencies, we're always careful about commenting. I think they'd all be writing notes in the next several days. But as you can imagine we took care to go through this planning and our strategy in a lot of detail with them, including things like the capital path and what the balance sheet will look like on a pro forma basis.</p><p>On BNP Paribas and that is a nonbinding agreement with -- versus other than some small elements of it. It's one that I wouldn't say is exploratory at all. Yes, there's been some time for preliminary due diligence, work on what the transition would look like and what have you. So we feel very comfortable with BNP Paribas as a very capable home for those balances, those clients and also the staff and technology that we're transferring. There's some work to do over the next couple of months to get to a definitive agreement and then close it, but our aim is to do that all within the year. And I hedged a little bit on the balance transfer. We think that's largely achievable within the year. Some clients may not have not repapered. And so it introduces a little bit more uncertainty into the wind-down glide path, but we actually think it was the more responsible thing to do to manage an orderly transition to a new home.</p><p>JERNEJ OMAHEN: That's very clear. So then I was hoping to get the answer to the following. So your starting point for the balance sheet reduction is year-end 2019, but we have half the year through. So when you indicated the leverage assets are going to go down from EUR 288 billion at the end of last year to, I think, it's EUR 117 billion at the end of this year. How much of that is already done in the same on the risk-weighted assets?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: So you would have -- and that was one of the reasons. Again our planning, as Christian mentioned, started some months ago. So we'd sort of keyed off December 2018 and stuck with that. As you would imagine with the emphasis that we had and the limits and the capital allocations, decisions we're making over time, you would expect that the businesses we defined is core have been growing and the non-core less so. I wouldn't say though that a significant amount of this deleveraging has taken place as of this quarter. I would expect to announce it's preliminary at this stage, couple of weeks ahead of time that we think we're starting from a leverage ratio very close to 4% much as we've reported at the end of this year.</p><p>And our current estimate is that the CET1 will be somewhere between 13.4% and 13.5% in Q2 pro forma for the charges that we announced today. So those are kind of good anchor points at least until we announce our earnings on the 24th for the starting point capital base.</p><p>JERNEJ OMAHEN: And then I was hoping to ask you just here on Page 22, I think a lot of people have touched on that. So James, can you explain exactly what is interest rate tab actually means for you? If I understood you correctly, it's a notion that short-term rates go to 0, but your Central Bank is pretty much telegraphed that they're going down first, all right. So should we be adjusting these downwards before we adjust it up? Or how you're thinking about this?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: So what we did was, and this has been, as you know, are part of our dialogue with investors and obviously internally for planning. We built this new plan on the basis of the market environment and implied forward rates that prevailed at the very end of May. So in our judgment, it built in most, if not, perhaps all of the impact of the recent developments in monetary policy. I will say that moves back and forth. You can't chase every announcement with your planning. But in that planning, as I mentioned, we assume that, that short-term rates, I think, of the 3-month based on implied forward rates at that time would get to -- towards 0 in 2021. And so this interest rate impact is a pretty modest relief over this time frame from the current environment.</p><p>The other thing that's baked in there, Jernej, is we've, I think, been very conservative in our interest rate risk management. One of the reasons for that has been limited hedge capacity. We think we found some opportunities to expand the hedge capacity and so be able to extend the duration on the asset side a little bit during this time and so -- and open up more tools to manage interest rate risk. So there's a little bit of that also baked in here. It's not just sort of optimism about the rate environment that some development better tools to manage the balance sheet.</p><p>JERNEJ OMAHEN: And then just final, I'm sorry. So you talked a lot about total leverage exposure and risk-weighted assets tied up in the Capital Release Unit, but you actually haven't said how much capital you think is tied up in that? You talk about a EUR 5 billion buyback at some point in the future, but what's wrong with just applying the current capital ratios to leverage exposure and risk-rated assets and coming up with EUR 10 billion to EUR 11 billion?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Yes, you can absolutely do that. Our calculation is sort of a more complicated growth in the business, reduction in Capital Release Unit and reg inflation. We also do the tangible equity allocation in again a slightly more complicated way of leverage exposure, RWA and also stress losses. So the way we look at tangible equity is more detailed, but you could absolutely do that math to have a view yourself how much capital is freed up from the CRU wind-down.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Can we just go back once to the revenue slide, because, Jernej, I understand your question obviously, but if you just look by the graph and not giving you the detailed numbers, but you can see that actually the revenue increases half from operating business and then from the interest rate and balance sheet efficiency. Now again just think about that we have 3 businesses in there, with the Corporate Bank, the Private Bank and Asset Management, which have been growing over the last 6 to 9 months already. Now the full focus will be put on this. There is no cut in those business, we want to grow. And then thinking about this number, which you can extract from the slide, it doesn't actually mean a lot if you also think the overall GDP growth where actually our strength in this bank is again by putting a 0 growth in the operating business in the investment bank. And therefore, I really do think and I have been here for 30 years, it is for first time actually a conservative revenue assumption for Deutsche Bank.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Lee Street.</p><p>LEE STREET, HEAD OF IG CSS, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Lee Street from Citigroup. Firstly, can you just explain how do you expect your MDA [roll down] in the coming year to a 11.8%? Presently, how will that roll down in the forthcoming years?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: So that's not in our control, obviously, but I think it's a good way to think about the announcement that we made yesterday about the 12.5% and at least 12.5% ratio that we would be comfortable running at. And the ECB, I think, has implicitly also got uncomfortable with. Now let's start with the point that capital ratios today for banks tend to be conservatively created and then buffers on a buffer and sometimes a buffer on top of that. So our starting point is that we have the highest P2R in the industry in Europe at 275 basis points. And the -- think about the 12.5%, then as what kind of buffer is put on top of MDA that itself is a buffer on top of minimum requirements. And those minimum requirements today include not just our G-SIB surcharge, but also know some countercyclical buffer and other stuff in it.</p><p>So in terms of your feelings of conservatism what is 12.5% or at least 12.5% represent, you got to start with that factored in. We are aware obviously that the gap between MDA and where we run today will narrow, but implicitly and as I said, we do draw some comfort from the fact that our business model is evolving, the business mix is changing so dramatically that it informs an expectation that over time that MDA would come down and hence the buffer if you like the 12.5% or at least 12.5% represents would grow.</p><p>LEE STREET: Second is on Slide 22. What is the balance sheet efficiency as referred to 12.5% revenue growth assumptions?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: So this is simply that in deleveraging, you get lower funding costs, less requirement for among other things non-preferred debt and just efficiency and how we manage the balance sheet. So that's built into the future. It's, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's just a modeled outcome of the balance sheet restructuring that we anticipate. And by the way, it's not aggressive in terms of assumptions of credit spreads, rating or anything of that nature. We more or less have a steady-state world, just a more smaller, more efficient balance sheet.</p><p>LEE STREET: And just finally on the strategy which you've announced, the plan yesterday. Was this Plan A or was Commerzbank Plan A and what's your thinking around that? It's obviously a quite diversion outcome.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Say it again.</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Was this Plan A -- was the merger Plan A we love the letter convention for our plans.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: So I think again, first of all, this plan has been developed, I think, for months now, but when we started last year for us, it was always clear that we wanted to stabilize Deutsche Bank in year 1, clean up the balance sheet, instill a cost discipline, improve our regulatory controls, which we all ticked. But it was clear for us that, as I said, last year already in the AGM that I would like to come up with some more stable and balanced business model. And hence we started very early on what we can spend. And if you compare this one was that what could have come out with the Commerzbank transaction, this one is clearly more competitive, more prevailing and also we don't need incremental capital that would have been different in the other transaction. And therefore, it was clear for us also from the execution risk that we are here controlling our own destiny in control of our restructuring, knowing how this bank functions, knowing the strengths and the weaknesses and hence obviously we think this plan is clearly the beneficial one.</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Yes. I mean just to be clear, when we made the decision back in April to discontinue the discussions with Commerzbank together with Commerzbank, it was -- this plan was reasonably well developed at that time. And so you can assume that we concluded that it was the superior plan.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Jeremy, just right behind.</p><p>JEREMY CHARLES SIGEE, RESEARCH ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jeremy Sigee from Exane. Two questions on capital, please. So first of all, could you talk a little bit more about the operational risk RWAs that are going into CRU sort of what are they? What type of operating risk? And what triggers would cost them to come off what we need to happen, is it just time elapsed or getting out of businesses that kind of things? That's my first question. My second question is also on capital. The 5% leverage ratio target in 2022, is that a -- I always get into trouble for talking about leverage ratio, but is that a sort of hard requirement that you sat down and agreed with the regulators? Or is that from a buffer and buffer and buffer?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Yes, Jeremy, I'm waiting for applause on leverage after our discussions on that. Look, on OpRisk, as you know, we are an AMA bank and so there is other great deal of detail built into our models, built into the loss history and ultimately the allocations that we make of OpRisk RWA to the businesses. What we have essentially done is take the OpRisk RWA that are allocated to the businesses and activities moving into the CRU and ported them over to the CRU with them. And so that gets you the EUR 36 billion number that we start with.</p><p>Now in the operational risk world, you can drop the -- and I'll speak under Stuart's control, you can drop the loss history ultimately from your modeled results if you exit a business, again in consultation with your regulators. In our view, this is a reasonably conservative glide path and because all it really does is assume that the loss history falls out associated with those things that we are definitively out of. We think there is more opportunity as we've outlined for a variety of reasons that are both methodological and relate to the size of the company that we are on a pro forma basis, but again as Christian emphasized, we have not built that into our capital plan or path. And it's one of the things when we talk about levers that we have to manage against downsides conceivably, that is certainly one that we have on the opportunities risk -- list. And we, of course, have identified what the risks are and how we scale those.</p><p>Your question on leverage, look, I know you've noticed the tilde ahead of the 5%, and it's not because I don't believe we're on a clear glide path to 5% and that we'd be able to maintain it. I wanted to give myself a little or give us a little bit of room here just because in 2022, I don't want to be constrained by a hard and fast leverage ratio target at year-end in terms of capital return, beginning the capital return that we promised. But we're on a very clear glide path from that 4.5% to 5% and conceivably beyond. We talked a bit about the leverage, the RWA inflation over time that is just bringing the leverage ratio and CET1 into the type of balance that I think you'd be looking for.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Stuart.</p><p>STUART OLIVER GRAHAM, HEAD OF BANKS STRATEGY, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: I had 3 questions, please. Just back to Lee's question on the capital again. If I understood correctly, the MDA hasn't changed. It's 11.82%, but looking forward the regulators given you some wiggle room. What is that on? Is that the G-SIB, the D-SIB, the Pillar 2 R? Can you tell us exactly what that relief comes on?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: We don't want to speak for the regulators. We're simply making management decisions here on the basis of our expectations about the future, the business mix. Although that, of course, has been done after some consultation with the regulators.</p><p>STUART OLIVER GRAHAM: So your management buffers come down rather than the regulatory guidance or...</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: So the management is indicating, it's comfortable running closer to MDA. And as we've indicated, our hope and expectation is that over time MDA will go down.</p><p>STUART OLIVER GRAHAM: Okay. And then on Slide 14, you got those 25% of Investment Bank businesses are not top 5, I just want to check I understood you correctly, you're saying you're kind of okay with that because they support the rest of the business. We're not going to be sitting here in 18 months' time and now talking about another restructuring. I think I understood you correctly on that?</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Stuart, as I said, exactly, you have some business which you simply need to support the other business divisions, be it in worlds of the corporate banking. Of course, we will do everything also to further improve these and work on it. Therefore, I said, 6% is the starting point in the return on equity for the Investment Bank. We're confident to achieve this one. But if you just saw the slide on how we allocate capital, how disciplined we would be around this one, I'm very much confident that we can get there at even above it.</p><p>STUART OLIVER GRAHAM: Okay. And my last question. Sorry to flog a dead horse, but Basel IV, on the one hand, you want us to give us -- give you credit for the EUR 5 billion of buybacks, on the other hand, you won't disclose the Basel IV figure while the EBA put an analysis out saying the average for G-SIB was 28%. I think you did [poll this everyone] going to assume you're higher than that not lower than that. So why don't you just give us the figure and you can make some commentary around mitigation, if you wish. But...</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Look, again, we think, I mentioned a variety of things about that the costs that I think are preliminary. And now we're talking about, we have, as I said, built in the glide path, including FRTB. Our view is that some of what's taking place now when you see us -- hear us talking endlessly about TRIM about some of the adjustments that are being made over time, frankly a good way to think about it is that some of that ultimate impact of the floor is being brought into these earlier years. And so the impact of the floor would then consequently be less. Naturally, we're building everything we know into our capital planning. And again we're indicating that we're comfortable with that EUR 5 billion return based on everything we know. But as I pointed out, I think there are still significant uncertainties around what that final rule will look like and the impact on us. There are, let's say, 4 sort of conditions or decisions that the supervisors and regulators can make, but together would cut our inflation down by half. Just as I sit here today, I can analytically point, and this is all based on the December 31, 2018 balance sheet. So Stuart, I understand your interest, but I continue to believe that talking about that '25, '26, '27 impact to the floor is just too soon based on what we know.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: And Stuart, just to your first question, just to take any concerns here out of the room, we wouldn't have gone out with the new management target in terms of core Tier 1 if this wouldn't have been discussed, but also agreed with the ECB. So I just want to be clear on that.</p><p>ROLAND BOSCH;HERMES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT LIMITED;SECTOR LEAD: Roland Bosch from Hermes. Two quick questions. I see on Page 12, if you talk about incremental spend on your controls. Maybe some details on that in terms of AML, KYC? And then the second question, the team I see 3 additions to the management board. You already mentioned Mr. Leukert, but can you maybe explain key skills or experience, which Christiana and Stefan will bring to your team?</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Sure. The first one, the incremental spend, it's just simply important with the overall cost measures we have taken that you don't get the wrong impression that we are now starting to cut costs on our regulatory control framework. I think we have done a lot. We have invested a lot. You can see now, I think, the first positive signs was passing various tests, but we are clearly further investing into this in order to further improve our systems, to further make our systems more efficient because that helps over time obviously also to become a more efficient bank in terms of costs. So clearly we are committed despite the cost cuts to further improve on the regulatory side and invest into the control system.</p><p>Number -- your question #2, yes, Bernd Leukert, obviously, technology expert with 25-year history at SAP. I think that will help us tremendously, actually not only with regard to our technology and our own systems, but in particular also when it comes to innovation, he was responsible for digital and innovation at SAP and it will also help us in particular with regard to client offerings. Christiana has been a DB lifer, and we wanted to have somebody overlooking the regional responsibility for the U.S., who has actually the connection between Europe, Frankfurt and the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. will also have in future approximately a EUR 5 billion revenue business. It is important for us. It is just size-wise second largest country in terms of revenues after Germany, and we need to have a person over there who is not only understanding the regulatory impact there. And as a German-American, I think, with her background she definitely understands this, but has the network also into Germany, and she will join the Board so that we make sure that group and regional strategy is fully aligned.</p><p>Mr. Simon has been on our Supervisory Board expert in legal given the new rule from (inaudible). We have looked for continuity. We have looked for somebody who knows, obviously, our legal portfolio, who has contributed to the cleanup over the last 2 to 3 years. So simply continuity and was the person who knows Deutsche Bank very well and hence these 3 choices.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Anke wants to follow up, and then we will go to the phone lines.</p><p>ANKE REINGEN: Two questions, please. The EUR 5 billion of share buyback and dividends, what's the time frame for it?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Well, look our intention is to start it in 2022. It's deliberately open-ended for some of the reasons we've talked about. There are uncertainties that we face. There is a glide path of RWA inflation, but we thought it was important to set a management commitment that of course we'll aim to meet as early as we can, as quickly as we can starting in 2022. One other thing that I'll perhaps take the opportunity to explain is that we are not having a dividend, suspending a dividend in respect of '19 and '20 so as to be able to preserve the distribution of capital that's available. The ADI that's available to us to give back to shareholders. And you can only do that under statutory accounting if the losses under HGB in '19 and '20 are applied to the share capital accounts. So we're essentially barred from doing so until 2022, but then we've got the capacity to do so thereafter.</p><p>As we think about it, again German statutory environment would be limited to about a 10% buyback at that point in time. So it can't reasonably come out as quickly as in 1 year. But again, it represents a commitment that we think is important as much in its scale and as well as in the discipline that we want to communicate by doing that, that we are going to be holding ourselves in the businesses to hurdle rates and discipline in the use of capital because it's very clear to us at the current multiple, the capital is better deployed being given back to shareholders than currently in our business.</p><p>ANKE REINGEN: And then -- sorry, on the new 3% revenue growth in corporate banking, I mean, I'm a bit surprised because almost every bank I cover talks about the growth potential in Germany and SME, and you're already in the market and you think you can take that market share. So from whom are you taking market share? And is it just because of what was going on with Deutsche you fell behind and you're recapturing some of the market share you lost? Or -- yes, I'm just surprised that you're still thinking you can take market share.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Yes. I mean first of all, the Corporate Bank is not only focused on Germany. Germany is obviously one region, the Corporate Bank is a global division. We have actually lots of growth, which we also see and have seen over the last 6 to 9 months in particular in the Asian area. I talked about our investments which we do selectively in the U.S. and, of course, Europe is something which we are focusing on. So there is no doubt.</p><p>I think there is a difference, in particular, now when we put more resources into the Corporate Bank, if we also describe the strategy of the bank around this Corporate Bank that we can gain more market share not only in Germany, but by simply making it clear to clients, but also to our own people for what we actually stand. That is the business, which grew already also in Germany by the way in Q4, in Q1. Now with more resources with the focus on this one, it is clearly something which is achievable and we can always see that it is a growth rate which you can compare to the GDP growth globally. And as it is a global business with 60 locations where we're doing this business, it needs to succeed country network. We are more than confident to get to 3%.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Great. Operator, let's go to the phone lines, if we have questions.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Joe Hopkins with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>JOE A. HOPKINS, STRATEGIST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions from me. One on capital, one on ratings. Considering the new minimum capital target of 12.5%, is it correct to assume that total CET1 needs, including Pillar 2G on top of your SREP is 12.5% or lower? And on ratings, how much have you factored in maintenance of credit ratings into new strategy, particularly given the negative outlook of Moody's?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: So P2G is confidential supervisory and information, so we would not talk to it. But you should just assume as, I think, we very articulated that in these numbers, we are comfortable running at a ratio of at least 12.5%. And that the regulators have indicated to us that that is acceptable to them within the framework of their P2G expectations.</p><p>From a ratings perspective, as I mentioned, we've spent some time with the rating agencies. We expect them to comment. By and large, our view that we've expressed to the rating agencies is that these actions are creditor positive in a variety of ways. One is that they simply remove us or significantly reduce our footprint in the more volatile businesses of Global Markets, and they move us or orient us to real economy, corporate banking, private banking and other businesses where we're seeing growth and stability. I think secondly, I talked about the balance sheet and as the balance sheet comes down, it essentially capitalizes itself more and more conservatively over time and the comfort we draw from it's not being exposed to third-party financing conditions as it has been over the past several years. So we think all of these things are -- and the leverage that we've talked about, all of the things are creditor friendly, despite the, in my judgment, relatively modest decline in our -- the CET1 ratio minimum that we've articulated. And so that's our view. I think I certainly hope that that will prevail in the judgment of our rating agencies.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of Carlo Digrandi with HSBC.</p><p>CARLO NICOLA DIGRANDI, FORMER GLOBAL HEAD OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS RESEARCH, HSBC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a question on Slide 28, if I may, please. You have the breakdown of the operational and credit risk. So the question is why is that the operational risk remains relatively flat from 2019 onwards? And related to this, can we assume that the 28% plus the 6% will be reabsorbed eventually into the business? Or it will continue to be worked out?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: So simply, as I mentioned, because it's only that amount of the loss history that we assume falls out of our AMA calculations over this time period, the answer to the first part of the question. The second is, at this point, we're not making any assumptions about the end of the CRU's life and its reabsorption into, call it, the rest of the bank. But we are articulating that there is about EUR 1 billion of expense and then the RWA and leverage exposure that you see here, which is also a way of saying that we will remain focused on removing those resources whether they are balance sheet resources or expense out of the CRU in this time period.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: I don't want to repeat myself, but I think it's so important to mention that again, I really do think that the rundown on the operational risk is a rather conservative picture. I know that Stuart Lewis is working on various ideas and measures in order to accelerate that, but we simply wanted to show that what we think is definitely possible and not again overpromise, but you're pointing to an issue where we think there is more room, which obviously can then be used for business or even for capital return.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS.</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS SMALLEY, MD, HEAD OF CREDIT DESK ANALYST GROUP, AND STRATEGIST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Lot of questions asked and answered, particularly around 28. So just a couple of follow-ups. One, you recently passed the stress test CCAR in the U.S., was today's plan part of that? And did the U.S. regulators get a little -- did they sign off on that first? That's #1. #2, are you assuming that in terms of your AT1s and any of your Tier 2s, are you assuming non-calls there so you can maintain that capital cushion as well? Or are you assuming calls and refis as you go down the road?</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: With regard to your CCAR question, no. I think the CCAR passing CCAR is in particular result of improving our controls, delivering on that what we have promised. I said last year when we failed the qualitative test that this is one of our top 5 -- top 4 priorities for 2018 and 2019. And that's what we delivered on, but of course, we give regular updates also to our regulator in the U.S. on what we are planning, that is clear. But this plan or approval of this plan was not a precondition for passing CCAR, but I think also the regulator there acknowledges our improvements as why we know that we have to further improve.</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: And on the AT1 question or our capital instruments generally, Robert, we'd stick with our usual formulation that any such activity would have to be economically rationale at the time. I mentioned that we haven't made heroic assumptions in all of this planning about spread tightening or rating actions. So certainly, we'd hope there would be opportunity and time to lower the cost of our capital stack, if you like, but I'd stick with the formulation about economically rationale at each call date.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.</p><p>KIAN ABOUHOSSEIN, MD AND HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN BANKS EQUITY RESEARCH TEAM, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have, first of all, some number questions for 2022 and then some strategic, if I may. On Slide 25, you have the EUR 1.2 billion cost or savings, which is other cost saving. Can you just explain where they're coming from or what they're related to? Also the run-off division loss in 2022, could you explain me what we should be thinking of in terms of magnitude of pretax loss? And Christian, in some press, I think, you mentioned a EUR 6 billion pretax profit by 2022, which sounded very low to me. I just wanted to get some clarity, is that correct, is that what you're aiming for? Or is there any one-off items or just expanding this number? Or is it a different number? And what number it would be actually? Strategically, if I may very...</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Perhaps we'll stop you and then follow-up with the additional questions, if that's okay? Just on the other -- on the right -- far right of 25, there is a bunch of non-comp expense built into that. Some amount of it is real estate related expenditure. There is third-party consultants and professional services baked in. There is just a host of other non-comp in that area. I guess the main point that I do want to drive here is that the much of the expense, if you like, above the compensation line can be discontinued without restructuring other charges. That isn't totally true of the other line as you see with the real estate impairment, we are assuming some costs to exit from the real estate items.</p><p>I think your second question was the CRU losses in 2022. You should assume that it's a little bit greater on a pretax basis than just the operating expenses that we've outlined. There is probably in our judgment a little bit of negative revenue still around the CRU at that -- in that time, but sort of modest increase over just the stranded expense on a pretax basis in 2022.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: On the EUR 6 billion pretax profit that is the guidance we give you or over EUR 6 billion pretax profit based on the guidance we have given you on the divisional profitability of the investment bank, asset management, the private bank and the corporate bank, which I mentioned in my presentation. Of course against that, you have certain central C&amp;O costs still allocated. So again based on the cost reduction we plan, the overall 2% revenue increases that is a number where we feel absolutely confident that we can achieve this. But yes, it is not something, which is heroic or looking at this task. It is something, which is again based on a bottom-up plan, which has been signed off by the businesses and infrastructure functions and that was the most important that we have the solid plan which is owned by the people who have to execute it.</p><p>KIAN ABOUHOSSEIN: Okay. And sorry, I'm not 100% sure then what equity or tangible book value you're focusing on for 2022. Can you give that as well and then I can put my numbers together because I don't -- I get very low book value level if I assume.</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Kian, I think that's the one piece that we then ask you to solve in your own models, but I'm sure you'll be able to work out a glide path in your model.</p><p>KIAN ABOUHOSSEIN: Yes, I can do a glide path, but the numbers go down quite significantly. That's why I'm just asking so I don't do anything wrong, but I can do it. If I may also ask a strategic question, the equity -- in investment banking business you mentioned that you keep selectively research functions and I'm just trying to understand how big of a research function that you actually require to run the investment? Can you give us a bit more of a background because we hear that you have contacted clients that you will keep a European franchise? And in that context also investment banking versus corporate bank, most banks seem to put them together now to get the synergies out, you're separating them. Can you just explain to us the thinking around that?</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Let me start with the second one. Yes, we are showing given the strengths of the transaction bank, and that is and has been in particular in the past the core DNA of Deutsche Bank. We want to show this division as one of the cornerstones of Deutsche Bank. If you look at the clients who will be served out of this Corporate Bank was 1 million corporate clients. I think it deserves to have an own division, in particular also with the profitability numbers we have there.</p><p>Nevertheless, that does not mean that there is no interlink and a close cooperation with the Investment Bank. That is also the reason while on the Management Board, I'm overlooking those, the Investment Bank plus the Corporate Bank, because obviously there must be a strong link between both, but it is important that both have then in their day-to-day business they are individual management team, managing the business. And again look at the Corporate Bank, we include all the corporate exposures out of Germany into this one, these are small- and mid-cap companies, medium-sized mid-cap companies who obviously have different demands than large corporates, which is more gain than to the Investment Bank.</p><p>So given the differentiation, but also the diversity in the Corporate Bank, I think it absolutely warrants its own division. At the same time, given that it is in the Management Board under my wings, there is a close cooperation between Mark Fedorcik running the Investment Bank and Stefan Hoops running the transaction bank. On the research, it's in particular Equity Research. I won't give you now exactly the detailed numbers how many people it consists of. We feel that for the offering, we have in particular in ECM and in order to help our advisory business that we want to keep that in particular in core and selected industries we're covering and hence we took that decision.</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Kian, it's James. I think just to follow up on your question. I was reacting to the -- give me the tangible book value in 2022 question that I think I heard. But maybe one number that would be useful for you that I thought I had in my prepared remarks was EUR 3.6 billion is the tangible book value reduction that we expect in '19 from the actions that we announced yesterday. So hopefully that's a number that's -- that you can anchor on to help think about a number of things, including that glide path. I hope that's helpful.</p><p>KIAN ABOUHOSSEIN: Yes, that's actually very helpful. And if I may just very briefly one more, the run-off business derisking cost, could you tell me how much you factored in for that?</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: No is the answer that -- we're not going to give the market a view on the derisking cost, but what I'll say is, first of all, we think we've been conservative in how we've estimated that derisking cost. Again as I said, portfolio by portfolio. It's an area where I hope to see upside in the coming months and quarters. But I do want to say about this derisking cost, I'll emphasize what we said at the outset, which is this is very unlike what you all are used to in seeing a pool of non-core assets for rundown. This is a -- almost exclusively a fair value portfolio.</p><p>So it's -- think of it as mark-to-market on the balance sheet. These are by and large liquid assets. Some, of course, have longer maturities, but many of them don't. We mentioned the run-off profile, which is relatively rapid as you can see particularly of the leverage exposure. One thing that I just want to maybe give you as a guide, you can see that in the first -- from this points 18 months and into -- at the end of 2020, the RWA deleveraging is about EUR 28 billion. Think of that as -- about 3/5 of that would happen naturally based on a run-off schedule. And maybe another EUR 10 billion that we would then seek to or 2/5 seek to accelerate through active derisking. So that can give you the sense of scale against which we would estimate the need for a derisking budget. It is very unlike what you're used to seeing and I do want to emphasize that as you think about estimating these costs as investors or on behalf of your investors.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time. I hand back to James Rivett for closing comments.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Excellent. Thank you very much all for your time. Thank you, Christian. Thank you, James. You know where we are, if you want us. Otherwise, we'll see you in a couple of weeks for our second quarter earnings.</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING: Thank you.</p><p>JAMES RIVETT: Thank you.</p><p>JAMES VON MOLTKE: Thank you.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Drastic measures. Deutsche Bank announcing 18,000 job cuts and abandons global equity trading. You're fired. President Erdogan removes his Central Bank Governor, Turkish assets stumble. And equal pay for equal play. The women's football World Cup champions calling for action. It's Monday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE this Monday. Really great to be back in action. I can't describe it enough. Congratulations, of course, too, to Team USA. Some incredibly fancy footwork from the women's team this weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's hope the Fed Chair Jay Powell has been taking note, of course, because we don't want any own goals when he testifies in front of Congress later this week. I'm going to have lots of analogies like that this show.</p><p>Right now, we're looking like a softer open for U.S. equities this morning as we kick off a new trading week. It's probably some choppy trading, though, in the session on Friday after that strong jobs number. Clearly, it was good news for the U.S. economy here. But I think it's forcing a bit of a rethink for global investors about the justification here for rate cuts.</p><p>It's simply going to come down to how Jay Powell frames the debate, perhaps no surprise, though, that Asian stocks fell in the session on Monday, too, but I do think there's a risk of overthinking this guy. Powell, I think will once again point out the longer term challenges here that he's been reiterating for months and months.</p><p>Look at the statement that we got in the session on Friday, the latest report to Congress shows low inflation, trade uncertainty and manufacturing weakness, none of these risks right now have gone away.</p><p>And as we keep saying on FIRST MOVE here, you know, I like this context is everything. It's just one jobs report. It's just one data point. And what we've got now is a market that's fully priced, if not slightly more for a rate cut come the end of July, not cutting if the Fed doesn't decide to cut rates that would create some kind of market volatility and something that Jay Powell is clearly trying to avoid here, too.</p><p>It's not going to stop questions, though, about political interference, though. But on the bright side, at least Jay Powell has a job, unlike the Turkish Central Bank Governor of course that was ousted over the weekend, something like that could never happen here.</p><p>All right, let's get to the drivers. Enough being naughty. Deutsche Bank announcing an $8 billion plus overhaul including 18,000 job cuts. Shares right now lower than more than three percent.</p><p>Anna Stewart joins us now on this story. Anna, I think for anyone that's been watching this over the last decade and the struggles that this bank has faced, it comes as no surprise, but it's really tough reading, particularly as far as job losses are concerned. Talk me through it.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Yes, 18,000 is a really quite extraordinary number. It counts for nearly one in five Deutsche Bank jobs. And while the scale of this restructuring, which I'll get into has actually taken some analysts by surprise, the area in focus here has been investment banking. It was always going to be the case, wasn't it?</p><p>We don't have a regional breakdown of those 18,000 jobs. But we understand that most of them are likely to be in the United States. The bank did tell us they were communicating redundancies to employees starting off across Asia early this morning.</p><p>Plenty of media reports now about people leaving the London office with their boxes full of their belongings, all very sad. Now in addition to shrinking the investment bank, they are creating a bad bank of course, to wind down some $83 billion worth of assets.</p><p>I mention that number because that is much bigger than many analysts had thought and they are also surprised that they are closing the entire equity sales and trading division even in Europe. That's another little nugget that took some people by surprise.</p><p>But essentially, in many ways, this is making a return to what Deutsche Bank started off as a corporate bank. And I think many people are quite happy to see this, as JPMorgan put it, as resizing to where it came from.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting, Anna. I mean, you mentioned all the key points here. The other thing for me that when I look at it is, you're not going to get a dividend as a shareholder for the next two years.</p><p>A lot of the action that we're seeing is back loaded. The execution risk here after so many failed attempts to turn this around is a real problem as far as I'm concerned. If I were looking at this as a shareholder in particular.</p><p>And the other thing of course, here, one of the key challenges is going to be going forward. What's the growth driver if we go back to the past and go back to being a corporate bank that's lending to small companies as important as that is? What the growth and the profitable driver here for the company going forward?</p><p>[09:05:17] CHATTERLEY: Because this is what analysts are saying, too.</p><p>STEWART: This is absolutely at the heart of what we're seeing today because there was a small relief rally, I think, due to the absence of a capital raise on the announcement. Of course, a lot of it was baked in already. We've been expecting an announcement for days and days.</p><p>But if you look at the share price, now, Julia, it was down last time I checked around four percent. It really came off that relief rally pretty quickly; over four percent now, and speaking to analysts, two main concerns here.</p><p>Firstly, this is not a cheap plan, it's going to cost them $8 billion. That's a lot more than many people expected. Definitely at the higher end. And also some analysts I spoke to like Credit Suisse just question the bank's projections for, as you say, revenue growth, particularly in this new core bank, given the scale of these cost cuts, and also the fact that this is a very grand radical restructuring, but it is the umpteenth, they want to see it in execution.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, they do. And of course, Anna, to your point as well, hearts go out to those who are losing their jobs and lost them today in particular. Anna Stewart, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Let's move on to our next driver and the Turkish Lira losing some ground versus the U.S. dollar today. Tech bonds also under a bit of pressure.</p><p>President Erdogan, sacking his Central Bank chief over the weekend, raising fresh concerns about the bank's independence.</p><p>Matt Egan joins me now. A slight eyebrow raise on that, Matt. I'm not sure that this Central Bank have any ounce for credibility left, quite frankly, after recent months.</p><p>But talk us through this decision and the replacement and what that will mean for the Central Bank now.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: Julia, Erdogan who is really -- you know, he is playing a dangerous game here, because this could actually backfire in two different ways.</p><p>One, it is already undermining the credibility and the independence of the Central Bank of Turkey, which is a big deal anywhere, but especially in emerging markets where you could have inflation flare up with little notice.</p><p>The other problem is that as you mentioned, it's causing the Turkish Lira to lose ground, which could actually limit the ability of the Central Bank to do the rate cuts that Erdogan wants in the first place.</p><p>So no official reason was given for the decision to oust the Central Bank Chief whose term wasn't set to expire until the end of 2020.</p><p>But you know, it's important to think about the backstory here. Turkey's President has called himself the enemy of interest rates. He has this sort of fringe idea that high rates actually cause high inflation, and so he was very upset with the high interest rates in Turkey.</p><p>Win Thin of Brown Brothers Harriman said in a recent report over the weekend, that you know, the only crime of the Central Bank Chief was the fact that he refused to cut interest rates. And that this move shows who is really pulling the strings at the Central Bank.</p><p>Now, it's no surprise to see that the lira initially plunged by about four percent against the U.S. dollar, it has come back and cut those losses in about half. I think that is probably a reflection of the fact that Turkey's 10-year yield still is at about 16 percent, and so some investors are willing to gamble on it, because you've got negative rates in Germany and in France and the U.S. 10-year is just that two percent.</p><p>So it's possible that, you know, all of the Central Bank policies elsewhere is actually -- they're actually masking the impact of the firing over the weekend.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Oh, you make such a great point. In a world of zero rates, yes, you face risks with this country. But oh, boy, is there some degree of compensation relative to other countries right now.</p><p>But I think to your point as well, investors got really furious with this Central Bank governor that he was too slow, to raise rates to try and stabilize some of the currency volatility that we saw in the selloff last summer. So we had his own President lambasting him for not cutting rates. Investors saying he was too slow to raise rates last year.</p><p>It's a tough gig. But to your point, the politicization here of Central Banks, whether it's here in the United States and the risks of Jay Powell and the pressure he faces from President Trump or what we're seeing in Turkey -- a really fine line that you walk here with investors amid concerns of politicization and political interference here. It's a huge risk.</p><p>EGAN: That's right, Julia, you know, it is a tough job. They are walking a very fine line. And so the next big event in Turkey is when the Central Bank meets again in July 25th. Now, Rabobank said in a research report that they think that Turkey's new Central Bank Chief could actually cut rates by several percentage points at this meeting to appease the President of Turkey.</p><p>Now, they say that that would actually be a big mistake because of the currency weakness. Now, as you mentioned, all of this is occurring in the backdrop of President Trump repeatedly attacking the U.S. Federal Reserve.</p><p>So I don't know Julia, maybe we're entering a new world where politicians have greater say over Central Bank policy, but it's hard to see how that's going to turn out well.</p><p>[09:10:13] CHATTERLEY: Yes, shipping Christine Lagarde. Unfortunately, she's already got the job with the ECB in Europe. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that. We'll see. Okay, let's move on to our next driver.</p><p>U.S. women's football team of course making history this weekend with a fourth World Cup when they beat Netherlands in the final -- thrilling final -- two nil. CNN's sports analyst Christine Brennan. Great to have you with us, Christine. Huge win for women's football. Huge win I think global women's football and the challenge here, but it has turned into a bit of a political football here over equal pay. So talk me through the success this weekend and also the challenges I think that follow here.</p><p>CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: Julia, if the U.S. team was trying to devise the best strategy possible to get to the bargaining table to fight for equal pay with the U.S. Soccer Federation, the national governing body for the sport, this would have been exactly it. This month-long march to victory, with Donald Trump chiming in and Megan Rapinoe going after Donald Trump and some of her teammates doing that as well.</p><p>And obviously, look who won that one in the end. It looks like the women's soccer team certainly got the better of that, in terms of playing -- backing it up with their great play with the fact that U.S. jersey, the women's Jersey is the best-selling soccer jersey and United States ever according to Nike. With the fact that TV ratings not just in the U.S., but around the world were sky high. They figure a billion people watched. That's one out of eight people on the planet watching women's football.</p><p>All these things thrown together, plus all the headlines. I was at CNN earlier today here in the D.C. Bureau and every single big newspaper, \"New York Times,\" \"Washington Post,\" \"Wall Street Journal,\" \"USA Today,\" front and center, the biggest picture, top of the page, A-1 women's soccer.</p><p>I think this is a pretty good -- they have a pretty good argument now when they take that to the bargaining table.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, I couldn't agree more with you. It's great to see the publicity that we're seeing. But if we bring it back to the numbers here, I mean, the prize and this is what they're arguing about for the 2018 Men's World Cup was $400 million. The female players get $30 million. So there is a huge disparity.</p><p>But then if I look at the revenues generated by the Men's World Cup, $6 billion last year. We're talking $131 million for women's football. So yes, there's a pay gap. These are incredibly skilled athletes. But when you look at the kind of money that the sport itself is generating, there is a huge disparity. So how do you sort of square that circle or circle that square?</p><p>BRENNAN: That's the international conversation and you're right. I mean, FIFA has been dominated by men for generations. I think it's the most sexist organization I have ever seen in sports, in covering sports for over 35 years. And it's -- they've kept the women down. They haven't supported the women. I mean, how is it that England for generations did not allow women to play soccer? The nation that gave us soccer.</p><p>Argentina? Where have you been for all these years with the women's game? Spain now of course is there. Netherlands obviously cares, but they didn't for generations and shame on FIFA for not throwing money and not demanding that every single governing body for these federations and in these various countries didn't do 10, 15, 20, 25 percent of its budget for women's football 30 to 20 years ago. That's that side of the argument.</p><p>What we're talking about with this equal pay fight, Julia, is the United States. And there, it is about as crystal clear as can be. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that over the last three years, the U.S. women's team made more money, game revenue than the U.S. men's team.</p><p>Obviously, the U.S. women's team is far superior to the men's team in terms of play, winning World Cups, winning Olympic gold medals. The U.S. men didn't even qualify for the last World Cup.</p><p>So on all those measures within the United States, that's where the women have their argument, and that's where the battle will be joint.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, go the girls. Christine Brennan, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, take you up to speed now, with some of the other stories that we are following around the world. Greece's new center-right Prime Minister has been sworn in following a landslide win in snap elections this weekend. The party Kyriakos Mitsotakis won 39.6 percent of the vote on a pledge to reignite the country's recovering economy. He said his priority now is to boost investment while slashing taxes and regulations.</p><p>Donald Trump has lash back at the British Ambassador who described him as quote, \"incompetent and insecure.\" The U.S. President said Kim Darroch has not served the U.S. well in his role as Ambassador to Washington. His comments about President Trump was supposed to be confidential, but came to light when diplomatic cables were leaked.</p><p>[09:15:11] CHATTERLEY: Iran has announced it has breached its uranium enrichment limit set in the landmark 2015 nuclear deal. Tehran had warned it would do so unless sanctions on its banking and all sectors were eased. It follows Donald Trump's decision last year to pull out of the nuclear deal.</p><p>Nic Robertson joins us now live. Nic, we are expecting U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to speak any moment. The question is, what will he say if indeed he says something about this, but just talk us through what we saw and heard from the Iranians at the weekend because this is expressly what a few months ago, Mike Pompeo said would not happen that the Iranians would not do this, as a result of the U.S. withdrawal.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: The Iranians have been very explicit in laying out an exact timeline and timeframe for when they would breach the terms of the JPOA, that international joint nuclear agreement that the United States pulled out over a year ago.</p><p>It was 60 days ago yesterday that they said that they would announce on July 7th, their changes to how they would meet or not meet the terms of that agreement. And they had indicated back then that they may enrich uranium above the maximum threshold that they're allowed to enrich it to.</p><p>They announced today that they were now enriching it to 4.5 percent, which is above the 3.67 percent threshold they were allowed. And that was something that they had said that they were going to consider that they would announce it on that date. They announced it on that day.</p><p>And today, they laid down a further warning, if you will, saying in a further 60 days, they will announce -- potentially announce another way that they're breaking the terms of that agreement.</p><p>So at the moment, there are two ways that they're breaking the agreement, one by having over the allowed amount of low-enriched uranium, 300 kilograms. They've said they've gone up on that level. They've gone now above the percentage of low enriched uranium that they are allowed --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Actually, Nic, I am just going to get in there because Mike Pompei has actually began speaking. Let's listen in to what he has to say.</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I made clear that the Trump administration has embarked on a foreign policy that takes seriously the founders' ideas of individual liberty and constitutional government. Those principles have long played a prominent role in our country's foreign policy, and rightly so.</p><p>But as that great admirer of the American experiment, Alex de Tocqueville noted, democracies have a tendency to lose sight of the big picture in the hurly-burly of everyday affairs.</p><p>Every once in a while, we need to step back and reflect seriously on where we are, where we've been, and whether we're headed in the right direction, and that's why I'm pleased to announce today the formation of a Commission on Unalienable Rights.</p><p>The commission is composed of human rights experts, philosophers, and activists, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents of varied background and beliefs, who will provide me with advice on human rights grounded in our nation's founding principles and the principles of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p><p>An American commitment to uphold human rights played a major role in transforming the moral landscape of the international relations after World War II, something all Americans can rightly be proud of. Under the leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt, the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights ended forever the notion that nations could abuse their citizens without attracting notice or repercussions.</p><p>With the indispensable support of President Ronald Reagan, a human rights revolution toppled the totalitarian regimes of the former Soviet Union.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, that was the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo there. If he mentions anything about Iran, we will bring that to you and update you probably a bit later on in the show, but for now, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE.</p><p>Coming up though, June's strong jobs report here in the United States may be a boost for the economy, but it's a challenge for markets right now. Do they get the cuts they want? We'll be talking about that.</p><p>And Boeing can't seem to get a lift off. What Saudis deal with the Airbus spells for embattled old airliner? When we return, stay with us.</p><p>[09:22:27] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. We're counting down to the market open as always. I'm with Kristina Hooper, Global Market Strategist at Invesco. Great to have you with us.</p><p>KRISTINA HOOPER, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, INVESCO: Great to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Happy Monday. Let's talk about the jobs reports. Because we did see a bit of recalibration in the market. Certainly, we were talking about 50 -- half a percent cut from the Federal Reserve. That's getting you a bit excitable, surely.</p><p>HOOPER: That absolutely was off the table, I think and really was never a possibility.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No, it was never on the table.</p><p>HOOPER: Yes, exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay. Does it make it more difficult for Jay Powell even to justify at this stage cutting rates, in light of what we're seeing? The consumer is such a huge part of the economy. The jobs market is really strong.</p><p>HOOPER: Well, that's certainly what the market reaction suggests that we saw on Friday. But I would argue that there are other reasons. So there are justifications for the Fed cutting rates in July. First of all, the Fed could easily just say they're moving the inflation target, let's raise it; and then economic conditions don't have to change.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay.</p><p>HOOPER: But also, if you look at the jobs report, one area that is somewhat lackluster is actually wage growth. We're still at about 3.1 percent, we really should be three and a half percent or higher at this stage in the economic cycle. So for that reason, you could make the case that maybe there's also a need to cut rates.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it is interesting, I was making the point earlier that we're in a situation now when the market has fully priced something, very difficult for any Central Bank Governor to suddenly about turn and do something different. It creates a huge amount volatility just in doing it and is there the justification there the risk of the question again, about the politicization of the Fed and of Jay Powell being backed into a situation either by the markets or by the White House here to cut rates when absolutely not necessary.</p><p>HOOPER: Oh, absolutely. I think anytime we see a Central Bank make an about face, do any kind of dramatic change, it creates economic policy uncertainty. And in particular, of course, we're seeing all this political pressure being heaped on Central Banks. And it's not just the Fed. Of course, we've seen it in Turkey Earlier today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>HOOPER: But also, we've seen it in India. And perhaps that is just adding to the economic policy uncertainty out there and the lack of credibility that we could see for Central Banks.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is it smart then for the European Central Bank to say, \"Hey, in this case, we'll have Christine Legarde and we'll go for someone who perhaps understands the sort of tightrope that you have to walk between economic policy and politics here.\"</p><p>HOOPER: Well, that's the great irony. By appointing a career politician, you might actually be able to navigate the political scene much better as head of the ECB.</p><p>[09:25:08] CHATTERLEY: What questions are investors asking you at this stage? What are the big concerns? Because we are now in the third quarter of the year. And people obviously want to either hold on to the gains that they've made, the money that they've made so far this year, but also not just getting chopped around in the back half of the year, too.</p><p>HOOPER: Oh there are really two key questions. The first, of course, is what's the Fed going to do? Is it really going to cut rates in the near term?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>HOOPER: And secondly, of course, when is recession coming?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right. And your argument and call here on recession, because you said, look, we're not looking at recession.</p><p>HOOPER: We're not seeing recession. We certainly see a slowdown, but our expectation is the Fed is going to be dovish. It may not give the market what it wants, but it will give the market what it needs. And in doing that, it should be supportive enough, that we will see a slowdown, but we won't go into recession in the next year.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're heading into earning season, too. And we've seen investors and analysts also paring back their expectations, particularly for profit growth. Have we raised the likelihood, actually, therefore, that we beat expectations, and we perhaps give some tailwind to this market higher?</p><p>HOOPER: That could certainly happen, especially since we have seen so many downward revisions. So that is certainly a distinct possibility. I think will skate by this earning season as well, without any kind of huge disappointments, ultimately.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Big risk?</p><p>HOOPER: A big risk going forward, of course, is I think, the potential that the trade wars get worse. Just because we have had some sort of an abatement, a truce so to speak in the U.S.-China trade war, it doesn't mean that the situation is going to get better. In fact, I would argue that it will ultimately get worse. But it's not just the U.S.-China trade war, right? We also have now the U.S. and the European Union looking like they're headed for something worse.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Watch this space, Kristina Hooper. But thank you so much for that. The market opens next. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. That was the opening bell here from the New York Stock Exchange for the first trading session of the new week. It is the first full week of course of Q3 trading here on Wall Street, too. And we are looking at a softer open to the markets.</p><p>Jay Powell, front and center this week. His testimony before Congress is going to be a key market event. That's coming Wednesday, Thursday. Of course, we've also got the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting. So gaining some further details from that, too.</p><p>We have got ongoing concerns about global growth as we were just discussing there with Kristina Hooper, still justification here for that rate cut despite the strong jobs numbers on Friday.</p><p>Morgan Stanley also turning caution on stocks worldwide. It is cutting its global equity allocation to its lowest level in five years. That's interesting. It says the outlook for stocks over the next three months is not so good.</p><p>All right. Let me walk you through some of the individual movers in the session today. Apple in focus. The stock was downgraded by Rosenblatt Securities, for neutral to sell. They say there is right now less reward quote \"for owning the stock.\" They believe Apple will face deterioration over the next six to 12 months. However, they did maintain their 12-month $150.00 price target. China of course and the challenges there, most likely front and center.</p><p>Pepsi, a touch lower in the session. The beverage giant is set to report earnings tomorrow. It's one of the first U.S. companies of course to report this season and investors are expecting pretty strong results, though some modest results compared to Q1 where it reported its fastest growth in multiple years. They're predicting earnings will be drop by one percent in fiscal 2019.</p><p>Verizon also in focus today. The stock was downgraded by Citi from buy to neutral. The firm citing a potential lower wireless pricing in the future, though, again, it maintained its $62.00 price target.</p><p>All right, let's move on to one of today's also top stories. Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein is set to appear in a Manhattan Federal Court today. He is expected to be charged with sex trafficking involving minors.</p><p>Epstein has escaped similar charges more than a decade ago, thanks to a controversial plea deal. Shimon Prokupecz joins us now. I mean, this is an explosive story, an explosive case, Shimon for many reasons. I mean, the plea deal a decade ago that the victims involved and those that accused him didn't know about, but also just the links to business moguls, right up to the White House. Talk us through what we're expecting today and why there's so much focus on this case.</p><p>SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: It's significant in many ways, because when you think about there were so many victims here who cooperated with investigators in 2008, and they had expected that there would be charges. They expected that they would have their day in court.</p><p>And then all of a sudden there was this plea deal that they didn't know about that prosecutors there in Florida, in 2008, the Federal prosecutor there who was now the -- who now works for the U.S. government, essentially, for the Trump administration struck this secret deal with Jeffrey Epstein. That is essentially, where he avoided a significant amount of jail time. The victims never got an opportunity to talk to court.</p><p>Now today, what's happened is, U.S. prosecutors here in New York in the Southern District of New York have brought their own case against Epstein from 2002 to 2005. They allege that he ran his sex trafficking enterprise, that he paid hundreds of dollars to underage girls, some as young as 14, and really deplorable disgusting acts that were going on inside his home.</p><p>In some cases, they say that he'd say, \"Oh, come over for a massage, I'll pay you for a massage.\" And then things would quickly escalate according to prosecutors, and then he would engage in sexual activity with these underage girls. He also used other girls to recruit other potential victims, people who he would engage in sex with.</p><p>So this is significant on many levels because it took many years to finally bring this case. For victims, it will definitely be something of a moment. Finally, they have their day in court. And obviously you have all of the political ramifications of who he is, his connections to politicians, to very wealthy people, and some think that that's what allowed him to get away with this for so many years.</p><p>Well, the Southern District of New York has finally said you know, enough is enough. They brought their own case and we expect to see him here in court later this afternoon. And we'll see. We'll see if a judge decides to allow him to go free or if he is going to remain in jail as he awaits a trial here.</p><p>[09:35:12] CHATTERLEY: Fascinating in the #MeToo era that more hasn't been done in the in the past 10 years. But now perhaps, some of those people that have challenged him and accused him of crimes, at least have their voices heard. We'll see how this goes. Shimon, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for that. Plenty more to come on FIRST MOVE. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Now, I happen to love math. But mathematical formulas are not the route to happiness for most people. But one man claims to have equations that enter the least mathematical among us will appreciate. Joining us is Scott Galloway. He's author of \"The Algebra of Happiness,\" and professor at NYU Stern School of Business. Great to have you with us.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, AUTHOR AND PROFESSOR, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Good to see you, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I love the book.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Oh, thanks. Thanks for saying that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's basically -- a sort of ode to being successful. How to be successful and not to listen to billionaires, not to listen to interesting people who say \"Find your passion.\" Because actually that's not going to work.</p><p>GALLOWAY: I find that that's the worst advice you can get. At NYU, we have two types of people who come speak to us -- interesting people and billionaires -- because there's an assumption that if you've aggregated a billion dollars, you have insider wisdom and the advice always ends with, \"Follow your passion.\" And the guy on stage has usually made his billions in iron ore smelting and he is telling you to follow your passion.</p><p>So what I tell young people is their job isn't to find their passion, but find something they're good at and then invest the requisite perseverance, hard work, thousands of hours to become great at it and the accouterments of being great at it: Success, economic security, relevance, opportunities will make you passionate about whatever it is.</p><p>Jay-Z followed his passion and became a billionaire. Assume you are not Jay-Z, find something you're good at and you will become passionate about it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, you were in Cannes for the sort of media festival there and you made some great comments and I pulled them out. The best tax lawyers, you were talking about tax lawyers and your quote was, \"The best tax lawyers in the world fly in private jets and find people better looking than them to marry which makes them passionate about tax law.\"</p><p>[09:40:10] GALLOWAY: Well, there's still 12-year-olds who say, \"I'm going to be a tax lawyer.\" But there's people who have wonderful lives because they're great at tax law.</p><p>So again, this notion of being great at something gives you unbelievable opportunities, and you will become passionate about whatever it is. The passion in the sectors -- sports, food, nightlife -- typically are over invested. It's like any asset class, when there's too much investment, the return goes down.</p><p>So if you want to manage a nightclub or go to work for \"Vogue,\" just to ensure you get a ton of psychic income, because on a risk adjusted basis, your efforts are not going to be well rewarded.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I guess, their argument though is if you're passionate about something you'll put the time in because in the end, we only get good at something if we put the time in, so in essence, one follows the other.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You hope.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, you can't hate what you do, right, but I think some people love numbers. Some people love medicine. Some people love, you know whatever it might be -- teaching -- and those might not be considered passions. But in fact, if you're good at it, the money will follow, the relevance and the passion will follow.</p><p>So the key is to find something you're good at and to say, find me economic security so you can pursue your passions on the weekend. The majority of people telling you to follow your passions are already rich.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: My father always says, money doesn't buy you happiness, but you can be miserable in comfort.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, there's a lot of research showing that unfortunately, money can buy you happiness. Middle income people are happier than lower income. Affluent are happier the middle income, but it tops out at a certain level. Once you get to a point that you can afford housing, absorb an economic shock, have healthcare, send your kids to good schools, which in most U.S. cities is about $100,000.00 to $150,000.00 a year in household income. I would argue here in New York, it is closer to a million dollars a year.</p><p>But once you get to that point, happiness tops out. And that is once you're economically somewhat secure, getting more money won't make you any happier. Money is the ink in your pen. It can write different stories. It can make certain stories burn brighter, but it's not your story.</p><p>So bust a move in a capitalist society to some level of economic security. But then figure out beyond that what makes you happy, what drives -- what drives reward and satisfaction in your life.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's a really interesting book. So you've said don't listen to interesting people and billionaires basically who say, \"Follow your passion.\" What happens because this also happened at Cannes when Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg says, \"We're going to launch a new cryptocurrency called Libra.\" What do you say?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, that's you know what happens when Michael Jackson shows up to babysit your kids. Anything that goes wrong is your fault. They've done such a great job with our media and our information, we're going to give them control of our economy? We are rightfully concerned.</p><p>This is an organization that has shown gross negligence around information and media. The takeover society. This has gotten very serious very quickly. The takeover society has three legs of a stool. First, you get control of the media, then the control of the money, and that leads to control of the military.</p><p>Facebook has not done a great job taking control of the media. And let's be honest, they have control of most of the narrative in the media right now. Do we really want to give them control of our money and our economy? Buyer beware. Anything goes wrong here, it is our fault.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But it's interesting though. I mean, they do have 2.4 billion users.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Half of those, a quarter of those actually use it. You have a currency here that would be --</p><p>GALLOWAY: A new default currency.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, a new reserve currency. So they arguably have the power and to your point, you know, we don't care enough about our privacy, to delete our user profiles, even if we delete the app, so the potential here is huge.</p><p>GALLOWAY: We're supposed to have a government that prevents us from a tragedy of the commons. And I'd like to think that the immunities are kicking in. We haven't had what I would say the referees on the field to make sure that Facebook doesn't get weaponized by foreign actors, respects our privacy. The government hasn't done a great job regulating Facebook around unintended consequences.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's done a terrible job.</p><p>GALLOWAY: So I think this is an opportunity for us to press the reset button and really say, \"Do we really want this organization potentially in charge of the default currency?\" Because the one thing capitalists fear more than the weaponization of our elections is recession.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>GALLOWAY: We could have the mother of all negative unintended consequences if we let Facebook established a new default currency.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think this is one area then where the regulators will step in and go, \"Hang on a second.\" Rather than the situation and we'll go into this about regulating Big Tech and the question about the breakup of Big Tech and the fact that the argument is regulators are way behind the curve here. It will still take years for them to act. Is this someway, given the potency potentially of this, where they'll act first and perhaps learn more later?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I hope so. I mean, we are already seeing it. We've had regulators across Europe express concern. Everyone from the head of the Senate panel on banking to Representative Maxine Waters out of Los Angeles has expressed concerns, so I think you're naturally seeing what I would call a well-deserved and well-earned gag reflex around this idea.</p><p>So they're trying to do everything right, set up an independent body in Switzerland, make it a nonprofit, but there's one problem, Julia, it comes from Facebook, and people are just sort of like, you know, burn me a million times, shame on me; burn me a million and time times. Or excuse me, shame on you, burn me a million and one times, shame on me. So I think the natural response is the correct one and that's one of mild horror.</p><p>[09:45:17] CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting every time I talk about Facebook and the challenges Facebook represents or face themselves, I end up talking myself into buying the stock, because I just don't think there's incentive anywhere to tackle it. Final question on Big Tech. What are we missing here? Do you think ultimately, and you've talked about your Amazon, we've just had the 25th Anniversary. We've talked about breakup. We've talked about the threat, perhaps they represent to democracy. In the end though, how does this play out?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, I'd say that if you ask me what is the thing we've missed? And given where we are overlooking the NYSE, I would say the thing that markets got wrong is on the day that the D.O.J. and the F.T.C. announced that we're going to seriously look at these companies, their stocks on a combined aggregate basis like the market capitalization of Boeing.</p><p>The market has got it wrong, Julia. These companies are going to skyrocket once the analysts get out their pencils and realize that broken up, these companies and these stocks are worth more. WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, all the amazing independent companies, if you look at all the big breakups of the past in our economy, post three, five years post the breakup, the companies are worth more disaggregated, so these stocks are going to skyrocket once breakup actually becomes a reality.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But activist shareholders and investors are going to have to force that because the companies themselves ultimately are not going to get to that point surely.</p><p>GALLOWAY: I don't think it's an activist because most of these companies are two-class shareholder companies. They have a controlling shareholder. I think it's the government that's going to break them up. I think the D.O.J. is going to keep these lights green for a while if they do the right thing and that is moving and oxygenate the economy by breaking these guys up. It's good for the planet, good for the economy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg end up far richer.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Richer.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, how to be successful and happy. Scott, fantastic to have you with us.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And great book. It's worth reading. Scott Galloway there. All right, more trouble for Boeing, the playmaker losing a deal with billions to Airbus as it struggles to get its embattled 737 MAX jet back in the air. All the details, next. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Boeing in focus. The plane maker has lost a deal with a Saudi Arabian airline to buy some of its 737 MAX jets. The carrier Flyadeal says it will now fly an all Airbus fleet.</p><p>Clare Sebastian joins us on this story. Clare, this is fascinating because the order book is everything to Boeing on this MAX jet. What do we know about this story? And how easy is it to transfer to Airbus here for this company?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, so Flyadeal, as you say is the less than two-year-old low cost carrier that's owned by the parent company of Saudis national carrier Saudia. Now, we know back in December that they made a commitment with Boeing by up to fifty 737 MAX jets for a price of almost $6 billion. It now seems that commitment is well and truly off although they haven't said so in so many words.</p><p>[09:50:10] SEBASTIAN: They are now going to buy they say up to fifty eight 320 Neo planes, which is the direct competitor to the 737 MAX. The critical line in the statement, this order will result in Flyadeal operating all Airbus A320 fleet in the future.</p><p>So they have not said it in so many words, but made it abundantly clear, but I will say, Julia, this is more of a problem reputationally to Boeing than it is commercially. They still have about four and a half thousand of these planes on order that haven't yet been delivered which shows that most airlines are still holding out for a fix to that software problems. They are still waiting this out.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely, and it's a waiting game if you want to transfer to Airbus. I was looking at the numbers here and we've made this comment all the way along. As of February of this year, the order backlog over Airbus for the comparative plane, the Neo, 5,962 for that single aisle jet.</p><p>You're going to have to wait years and years and years if you want to transfer. And we have to give context here, too. AIG, of course, the owner of British Airways signed a letter of intent to buy 200 MAX a couple of weeks ago, so some perhaps pulling away, others are saying, \"Look, we'll still buy these.\" I just hope they've got a big discount.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: It certainly seems that they would have gotten a big discount, Julia. But yes, context is really important. That deal with AIG announced at the Paris Air Show for 200 planes which means that even though Flyadeal made a deal to buy 50 Airbus jets in replacement of the Boeing 737 MAX at Paris, Boeing still comes out of Paris at a net positive. The stock is still up on the year. Its order book is still four and a half thousand.</p><p>But as you say, switching to Airbus not that easy. They have a backlog of about 5,800 Airbus A320 Neo jets. The CEO in their recent shareholder meeting said that ramping up production of the A320 Neo is one of their top priorities. But either way, whether it's the Boeing 737 MAX, they are waiting for it as they work with the regulators on a fix or the A320 Neo, this is definitely a waiting game for these airlines.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, watch this space. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that. All right. Speaking of British Airways, the British Airways owner AIG is facing a record $230 million fine. The proposed penalty follows a massive data breach back in 2017, which saw hackers steal the personal details of half a million customers.</p><p>The fine would amount to one and a half percent of BA's revenues that year. Hadas Gold joins us on this story. Hadas, the message there is actually it could have been worse under the new proposals, but far higher a fine that it would have been under the old ones.</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Julia, that's right. If this fine is actually imposed, because this is sort of a notification that they intend to impose this fine. If this fine by the ICO actually goes through of $230,000.00, it would represent the highest ever fine the ICO , the Information Commissioner's Office has ever levied against any company.</p><p>But you're right, it's not actually the maximum penalty that they could have imposed. Its 1.5 percent of British Airways revenues for 2018. When actually according to GDPR, that data protection law that rules over Europe, they could have imposed fines of up to four percent of those revenues. So not as bad as it could have been. But compared to what the old rules were, the maximum they could have fined them was 500,000 pounds, which the difference to what they've been fined -- potentially fined now, it is quite a big difference.</p><p>Now, you're right, this stemmed from a data breach from last year where about 500,000 customers' personal information, everything from logins to credit cards, to their names and addresses were leaked because of malware that was placed on British Airways' website that somehow redirected the traffic to a fraudulent website.</p><p>And no British Airways made the breach public. The GDPR laws and the ICO said that they did not protect their users' data well enough and that's why they imposed this fine.</p><p>Now, British Airways CEO Alex Cruz said that they are surprised and disappointed, and that they will plan to appeal the fine once it goes through -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you know, I still think it's peanuts when you're talking about four percent of global revenues. But I do think that some of these big tech companies, Facebook, we've just been talking about them. You've got to think very carefully about your privacy policies given past data breaches. This is a far more material fine than it's ever been.</p><p>GOLD: That's exactly right. And actually what this lesson proves to companies is that these data breaches aren't just public relations nightmares, it is that now they actually carry some significant financial liabilities, as well. And we're seeing the British Airways parent company stock prices be slightly affected by this. It's down about 1.6 percent.</p><p>But as we've seen, if they can go up to four percent of annual revenues, this is going to be more than just the pocket change in terms of those fines that we've seen in the past for people like Facebook, where it's 500,000 pounds. They could easily pay that off. This is going to get companies to start to sit up and pay more attention. It is at least what the regulators hope.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the question is, do users. Hadas Gold thank you so much for joining us on that story.</p><p>[09:55:08] CHATTERLEY: All right, I want to give you a quick update now on Jeffrey Epstein, of course, the billionaire Jeffrey Epstein has just been indicted in New York with having operated a sex trafficking ring involving minors.</p><p>According to the indictment, Epstein ran a trafficking enterprise between 2002 and 2005 in which he paid hundreds of dollars in cash to girls as young as 14 years old for sex. He is being charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count, conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors. We will continue to follow that story. 10 years it seems in the making.</p><p>All right. Let me give you a look at what we're seeing for the market here. The U.S. majors as we get to -- this session shaping up to be -- well we're seeing losses right now. Six tenths of one percent and NASDAQ under more broad pressure. Nine tenths of one percent, Jay Powell is going to be the key this week. What does he say to justify what the market has priced? And of course, that rate cut later this month.</p><p>That's it for me. I'm Julia Chatterley. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to make yours. Happy Monday.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019070801cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHS-5431-JB20-G4T3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8085\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Was hat es damit auf sich?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Es gibt aktuell zwei wichtige Initiativen im Zahlungsverkehr. Eine nationale, die unter dem Namen #DK (digitale Kreditwirtschaft) l\u00e4uft, und eine europ\u00e4ische unter Federf\u00fchrung der franz\u00f6sischen Banken. Ziel von #DK ist die s\u00e4ulen\u00fcbergreifende Zusammenarbeit im Zahlungsverkehr.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Und welches Ziel verfolgen die franz\u00f6sischen Banken?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Die franz\u00f6sischen Banken haben 18 internationale Institute zur sogenannten Pan-European Payment Solution eingeladen, wo \u00fcber einen einheitlichen europ\u00e4ischen Zahlungsverkehr gesprochen wird. Im ersten Schritt soll Instant Payment als neuer Zahlungsverkehrsstandard etabliert werden.</p><p>- Dass Banken im europ\u00e4ischen Zahlungsverkehr so eng kooperieren, hat es seit Einf\u00fchrung des Euroschecks vor 50, 60 Jahren nicht mehr gegeben.</p><p>Das Thema ist auf h\u00f6chster F\u00fchrungsebene verankert: Bei allen Gespr\u00e4chen auf europ\u00e4ischer Ebene - mit der Europ\u00e4ischen Zentralbank (EZB), den Nationalbanken und der Aufsicht - spricht die deutsche Kreditwirtschaft inzwischen mit einer Stimme.</p><p>- Woher kommt die pl\u00f6tzliche Erkenntnis, dass ein einheitlicher Zahlungsverkehr notwendig ist?</p><p>Die EU-Kommission und die Europ\u00e4ische Zentralbank sind treibende Kr\u00e4fte. Hier setzt sich immer st\u00e4rker die Ansicht durch, dass wir im europ\u00e4ischen Zahlungsverkehr der US-amerikanischen Dominanz etwas entgegensetzen m\u00fcssen.</p><p>- Und in Deutschland?</p><p>Wir sprechen hierzu mit der Bundesbank und dem Bundesfinanzministerium. Denn Ziel einer B\u00fcndelung im Zahlungsverkehr ist, das Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell weiterzuentwickeln und damit Ertr\u00e4ge f\u00fcr die deutsche Kreditwirtschaft zu sichern. Das ist ein wichtiges Thema, denn Kunden werden uns f\u00fcr Infrastruktur-Leistungen nicht mehr Geld zahlen. Ertr\u00e4ge generieren wir k\u00fcnftig vor allem \u00fcber kundenorientierte Zusatzleistungen und Vermittlungsprovisionen. Deswegen \u00f6ffnen wir nun unsere Infrastruktur.</p><p>- Banken in Deutschland m\u00fcssen also umdenken?</p><p>Ja, wir m\u00fcssen anfangen, global zu denken. In diesem Punkt k\u00f6nnen wir von Big Techs lernen: Denken Amazon, Apple oder Google in nationalen M\u00e4rkten? Nein, sie denken in weltweiten Dimensionen. #DK ist ein erster Schritt in diese Richtung und weg von einem zersplitterten Markt. Es kann aber nur ein erster Schritt sein, danach muss es z\u00fcgig Richtung Europa gehen.</p><p>- Was konkret wollen Sie b\u00fcndeln?</p><p>Wir erw\u00e4gen, die bisherigen L\u00f6sungen in einem neuen Verfahren zusammenzufassen, dieses eng ans Girokonto zu koppeln und als ein Produkt \u00fcber alle Kan\u00e4le anzubieten. Das ist die Idealvorstellung. In der deutschen Kreditwirtschaft ist und bleibt das Girokonto mit der Girocard der Ankerpunkt. Da diese jedoch nicht im E-Commerce verwendbar ist, haben wir Paydirekt und Giropay. F\u00fcr die Person-to-Person-Zahlungen (P2P) bieten wir Kwitt sowie Paydirekt an.</p><p>- Wie wollen Sie Girocard, Paydirekt und Kwitt b\u00fcndeln? Warum b\u00fcndeln, wenn doch alles durch Instant Payment ersetzt wird?</p><p>Instant Payment ist die Langfristperspektive. Zun\u00e4chst muss man sich auf ein Verfahren f\u00fcr P2P-Zahlungen einigen. Paydirekt ist gesetzt, muss sich aber stetig weiterentwickeln.</p><p>- Wie sieht der zeitliche Fahrplan aus?</p><p>Einen genauen Zeitplan kann ich Ihnen heute noch nicht nennen. Insgesamt brauchen wir f\u00fcr die B\u00fcndelung aber sicherlich zwei, drei Jahre.</p><p>- Wie soll die Vereinheitlichung des europ\u00e4ischen Zahlungsverkehrs technisch und organisatorisch funktionieren?</p><p>Wir haben gute Voraussetzungen, denn Instant Payment ist ein Sepa-Format, das f\u00fcr alle europ\u00e4ischen Banken gilt. Allerdings haben wir in Europa einen sehr unterschiedlichen Umsetzungs- und Einf\u00fchrungsgrad auf L\u00e4nderebene. Hier besteht Handlungsbedarf, denn wir brauchen einen Standard in Europa, und zwar auf Basis von Instant Payment. Wenn wir das nicht schaffen, dann wird der Regulator uns das vorgeben. Davon bin ich \u00fcberzeugt.</p><p>- Wenn Echtzeit\u00fcberweisungen europaweit zum \"new normal\" werden, was ver\u00e4ndert sich dann konkret?</p><p>Der Kunde kann \u00fcberall im E-Commerce und am Point of Sale (PoS) \"instant\" bezahlen. Noch hat im Online-Banking oder an der Ladenkasse jedes europ\u00e4ische Land andere Verfahren. Gegen diesen Flickenteppich hilft nur ein gemeinsamer Standard wie Instant Payment.</p><p>- Muss im Smartphone dann eigentlich noch eine Karte hinterlegt sein?</p><p>Perspektivisch nein, denn der Kunde bezahlt \u00fcber sein Smartphone von Person zu Person, direkt an der Ladenkasse oder im Online-Shop. Ohne Karte, einfach \u00fcber die Instant-Payment-Funktion, in Echtzeit.</p><p>- Ist das im Sinne des Kunden? Immerhin ist die 100 Millionen mal in Deutschland ausgegebene Girocard sehr beliebt. W\u00fcrden die Menschen so einfach auf sie verzichten wollen?</p><p>Dass Kunden an der Girocard h\u00e4ngen, ist v\u00f6llig berechtigt. Schlie\u00dflich hat sie vielfach einen Zusatznutzen: man kann etwa Punkte mit ihr sammeln oder Mitgliedschaften auf der Karte hinterlegen. Fraglich ist jedoch, ob wir von der Grundstruktur noch eine Karte ben\u00f6tigen. Man braucht Instant f\u00fcr Europa und die Kreditkarte im Rest der Welt.</p><p>- Es gab in den letzten Jahrzehnten zahlreiche Anl\u00e4ufe, die Zahlungssysteme zusammenzuf\u00fchren, darunter die dann gescheiterte Initiative Monnet, aus der die Franzosen ausgestiegen sind. Jetzt sollen die Franzosen Vorreiter sein und w\u00fcrden sogar ihre Carte bancaire aufgeben?</p><p>Ja, weil auch sie sp\u00fcren, dass der Druck durch amerikanische Technologiekonzerne zunimmt. Wir alle sp\u00fcren das. Wenn Sie mich vor einem Jahr gefragt h\u00e4tten, ob die f\u00fchrenden K\u00f6pfe der deutschen Kreditwirtschaft die B\u00fcndelung ihrer Kr\u00e4fte im Zahlungsverkehr planen w\u00fcrden, h\u00e4tte ich das f\u00fcr wenig realistisch gehalten. Damals w\u00e4re es schlicht undenkbar gewesen, dass die Privatbankenmit den Sparkassen und Landesbanken sowie mit den Genossenschaftsinstituten so eng zusammenarbeiten.</p><p>- Fr\u00fcher sind gemeinschaftliche deutsche Initiativen durch kartellrechtliche Bedenken blockiert worden. Hat man im Kartellamt erkannt, dass der Wettbewerb im Internetzeitalter global stattfindet?</p><p>So ist das. Ich habe den Eindruck, dass es hier Bewegung gibt und das Bundeskartellamt schon heute immer st\u00e4rker europ\u00e4isch und global denkt.</p><p>- Wie kommen Echtzeitzahlungen bisher beim Kunden an?</p><p>Die genossenschaftlichen Institute wickeln derzeit durchschnittlich knapp 20 000 Transaktionen am Tag ab, mit einem durchschnittlichen Einzelumsatz von mehr als 700 Euro. Instant Payment wird also sehr gut angenommen, und das, obwohl wir erst am Anfang stehen und die Banken noch lernen, mit dem neuen Verfahren umzugehen.</p><p>- Ist die Betragsgrenze ein Hindernis?</p><p>Es gibt \u00dcberlegungen, die aktuelle Betragsgrenze von 15 000 Euro auf 100 000 Euro zu erh\u00f6hen. Das w\u00e4re eine echte Verbesserung, vor allem f\u00fcr Firmenkunden. Gerade f\u00fcr sie ist Instant Payment eine Chance. Das Geld ist binnen von Sekunden auf dem Konto, und das inklusive s\u00e4mtlicher Geldw\u00e4sche- und Compliance-Pr\u00fcfungen.</p><p>- Was ist mit den Privatkunden, die ihre Girocards gewohnt sind? Gehen die in den Supermarkt, halten ihr Smartphone ans Terminal und zahlen mobil?</p><p>Hier m\u00fcssen wir unterscheiden zwischen dem mobilen Bezahlen in der App, beispielsweise \u00fcber Google Pay oder Apple Pay, und dem kontaktlosen Bezahlen. Unsere Kunden pr\u00e4ferieren klar Letzteres. Dabei halten sie ihre Karte ans Terminal - bis 25 Euro geht das sogar ohne PIN-Eingabe. Bis Jahresende stellen wir alle unsere Karten auf kontaktlos um. Im Vergleich dazu wird das Mobile Banking bisher verhalten angenommen.</p><p>- K\u00f6nnen Sie Zahlen nennen?</p><p>Die Genossenschaftsbanken haben 30 Millionen Girocards ausgegeben, \u00fcber 20 Millionen davon sind kontaktlos, und gut 150 000 sind digital, also f\u00fcr Google Pay auf Android-Ger\u00e4ten freigeschaltet. Im Mai wurden Girocard-Transaktionen mit einem Volumen von 4 Mrd. Euro kontaktlos get\u00e4tigt. Das ist viel, und ich rechne mit einer weiteren Steigerung.</p><p>- Bei Apple Pay waren Sie zur\u00fcckhaltend mit Blick auf den Datenschutz. Haben Sie sich nun geeinigt?</p><p>Ja, wir haben uns geeinigt. Im Laufe des Jahres werden die Genossenschaftsbanken ihren Kunden Apple Pay anbieten.</p><p>- Wie wird sich das mobile Bezahlen Ihrer Meinung nach weiterentwickeln?</p><p>Es wird sich zeigen, bei welchen Verfahren sich die Investitionen rechnen. Bei der Kontaktlos-Technologie bin ich sehr zuversichtlich. Wenn man sich die Liste der popul\u00e4rsten Smartphone-Bezahlverfahren anschaut, so hat Apple Pay nach einer aktuellen Studie der Postbank noch Potenzial.</p><p>- Wie weit sind Sie mit den Vorbereitungen f\u00fcr die Umsetzung der Zahlungsdiensterichtlinie PSD2, die am 14. September greift?</p><p>Bei PSD2 geht es um zwei Aspekte: Erstens um die \"starke Authentifizierung\", auch Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung genannt. Diese betrifft das Zahlen mit Kreditkarte. Der zweite Teil der Richtlinie betrifft den Zugriff von Dritten auf Informationen von Kundenkonten. Aktuell hakt es noch an einigen Stellen, gerade bei der Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung. Zwar haben die Banken ihre Kunden umfassend dar\u00fcber informiert, dass sie bis September ihre Sicherheitsmerkmale f\u00fcr Online-Eink\u00e4ufe festlegen und ihre Kreditkarte freischalten m\u00fcssen. Ein gro\u00dfer Teil der Kunden hat dies auch bereits getan. Jedoch sind viele H\u00e4ndler noch nicht in der Lage, die neuen Technologien anzuwenden. Der Handel wartet auf Spezifikationen, die der Regulator erst sp\u00e4t herausgegeben hat.</p><p>- Die Standards (Regulatory Technical Standards, RTS) sind doch schon beschlossen?</p><p>Ja, aber bis sie umgesetzt werden k\u00f6nnen, dauert es. Stand heute haben noch keine 50 % unserer Kreditkartennutzer eine Freischaltung f\u00fcrs E-Commerce. Unsere Sorge ist, dass viele Kunden am 14. September im Internet einkaufen wollen und das nicht funktionieren wird. Deswegen hat die europ\u00e4ische Aufsicht EBA den nationalen Aufsichtsbeh\u00f6rden nun vorgeschlagen, den 14. September nicht als hartes Datum zu sehen, sondern Flexibilit\u00e4t zu gew\u00e4hren. Fest steht: Die Marktteilnehmer tun alles, um die PSD2-Anforderungen p\u00fcnktlich umzusetzen, aber die Komplexit\u00e4t ist nicht zu untersch\u00e4tzen.</p><p>- Das ist aber nur ein Teil der PSD2, wo stehen Sie mit dem zweiten?</p><p>Der zweite Teil betrifft den Kontozugriff durch Dritte. Das Problem ist, dass es derzeit keine einheitliche europ\u00e4ische Schnittstelle gibt. Deshalb setzt sich beispielsweise die Initiative \"Berlin Group\" daf\u00fcr ein, diese Schnittstelle zu harmonisieren, und zwar banken- und l\u00e4nder\u00fcbergreifend. Dazu hat sie den \"NextGenPSD2\"-Standard ins Leben gerufen, worunter man eine Reihe moderner, offener, harmonisierter und untereinander kompatibler Programmierschnittstellen versteht. Dar\u00fcber sollen Daten sicher bereitgestellt werden k\u00f6nnen.</p><p>- Fintechs werfen den Banken vor, die Schnittstellen zu blockieren. Stimmt das?</p><p>Die Banken blockieren die Schnittstelle nicht, sie halten sich lediglich streng an die Regeln der PSD2. Das bedeutet in der Konsequenz, dass weniger Daten als fr\u00fcher zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt werden d\u00fcrfen. Die bisherige Schnittstelle, die Fintechs genutzt haben, hat Zugriff auf viel mehr Daten erm\u00f6glicht.</p><p>- Was genau bekommen Drittanbieter jetzt nicht mehr?</p><p>Fintechs leben von der Datenanalyse. Bislang war es so: Wenn Kunden ihre Bankanwendungen ge\u00f6ffnet hatten, konnten Drittanbieter Daten direkt auslesen. Unter PSD2 funktioniert dieses Screen Scraping nicht mehr. Das wird der Fintech-Community erst jetzt richtig bewusst. Das wird noch eine spannende Diskussion, die auf uns zukommt und der wir uns gerne stellen.</p><p>- Wurde das bisher nicht getestet?</p><p>Seit Mai gibt es die sogenannte Sandbox zum Testen. Bei der DZ Bank hat jedoch noch kein Firmenkunde oder Fintech im Hinblick auf die Nutzung der PSD2-Schnittstelle angefragt. Anders sieht es bei den Genossenschaftsbanken aus, die eine verhaltene Nachfrage nach dem Testen \u00fcber die Sandbox verzeichnen. Meine Prognose ist, dass auf diese PSD2-Schnittstelle wahrscheinlich nur die gro\u00dfen Technologieunternehmen zugreifen wollen, um ihren Datenpool zu erweitern. Alle anderen, die die Schnittstelle nutzen k\u00f6nnten, wie H\u00e4ndler oder Firmenkunden, haben bislang \u00fcberhaupt kein Interesse an den Daten und deren Analyse.</p><p>- Was erwarten Fintechs speziell?</p><p>Bei der PSD2 werden nur Girokontodaten zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt. M\u00f6glicherweise wird mit der n\u00e4chsten Richtlinie nach PSD2 die Schnittstelle auch auf Datent\u00f6pfe, wie zum Beispiel Depotdaten, erweitert. Hier sagen die Regulatoren aber, dass Fintechs und Technologieunternehmen f\u00fcr mehr Daten auch mehr zahlen m\u00fcssen. Vielleicht nicht in Euro, sondern ebenfalls in Daten, soll hei\u00dfen: Sie m\u00fcssten ihre Daten ebenfalls bereitstellen.</p><p>- Was erwarten Sie am 14. September von den Tech-Unternehmen?</p><p>Die Technologiefirmen werden zun\u00e4chst abwarten, wie sich alles einspielt. Gerade im Hinblick auf den zuvor erw\u00e4hnten flexiblen Start-Termin der PSD2.</p><p>- Zumal der Kunde dem Zugriff auf seine Daten zustimmen muss.</p><p>Das ist der n\u00e4chste Punkt. Wir bieten unseren Kunden ein Steuerungscockpit im Online-Banking an, das Zugriffe von au\u00dfen dokumentiert. Die Bank kann entweder vorgeben, wie viele Tage sie die Zugriffsm\u00f6glichkeit bereitstellen will, und nach diesem Zeitraum muss der Kunde jeden Zugriff genehmigen. Oder sie kann festlegen, dass der Kunde jede Zugriffsanfrage freigeben muss. Wenn wir also feststellen, dass die Technologiekonzerne regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Daten abgreifen, k\u00f6nnen wir mit dem Einverst\u00e4ndnis des Kunden den Zugriff beschr\u00e4nken.</p><p>- Apropos Big Techs: muss der Regulator nicht ein viel st\u00e4rkeres Auge auf die Tech-Konzerne haben als auf die Fintechs?</p><p>Das ist richtig. Die Big Techs werden schneller Tatsachen schaffen, als der Regulator Bedingungen formuliert. Das sehen wir doch gerade bei der Diskussion um die neue Facebook-W\u00e4hrung Libra, alle stehen Kopf. Dass Libra auch direkt bei einem G7-Gipfel diskutiert wird, verdeutlicht die Brisanz dieses Themas.</p><p>- Libra will rund 1,7 Milliarden Menschen Zugang zum Finanzsystem verschaffen, die heute keinen haben, insbesondere in der dritten Welt. Das ist doch ein positiver Antritt?</p><p>Nat\u00fcrlich kann eine Chance in so einer W\u00e4hrung liegen. Facebooks Vision ist, dass diese Menschen durch ihr Smartphone und Facebook Zugang zu einer Bankverbindung bekommen. Und die Libra soll mit einem Staatsanleihenkorb unterlegt werden. Im Gegensatz zu Kryptow\u00e4hrungen wie Bitcoin hat Libra den Vorteil, dass sie keine starken Kursschwankungen erleben d\u00fcrfte. Das ist eine der zentralen Herausforderungen auf dem Weg zu einem stabilen Online-Zahlungsmittel. Spannend wird es, wenn Facebook \u00fcber die Phase der Ank\u00fcndigung hinauskommt. Dann muss man sich auch genau anschauen, welche Pl\u00e4ne das Unternehmen beim Thema Verbraucher- und Datenschutz hat. Diesbez\u00fcglich gab es bisher ja vor allem negative Schlagzeilen.</p><p>- Wie sollte sich der Regulator hier verhalten? Sollte er die Entwicklung von Libra aufhalten?</p><p>Den Schritt vom Bargeld und Buchgeld zum virtuellen Geld ist vor dem Hintergrund allgegenw\u00e4rtiger Digitalisierung schon fast eine logische Konsequenz - umso wichtiger ist, dass dieser Prozess reguliert und kontrolliert abl\u00e4uft. Weder Politik noch B\u00fcrger k\u00f6nnen ein Interesse daran haben, dass Monopolisten entstehen. Das gilt auch bei digitalen W\u00e4hrungen. Ich mache mir gro\u00dfe Sorgen, dass das Thema Datenschutz und Datensicherheit in einem bisher nicht regulierten, von Facebook entwickelten Framework vernachl\u00e4ssigt wird.</p><p>- Wer w\u00e4re der Regulator f\u00fcr Libra?</p><p>Mit Libra m\u00fcssten sich die europ\u00e4ischen, amerikanischen und asiatischen Bankaufsichtsbeh\u00f6rden befassen. Das Thema ist bei den G7- oder G20-Staatschefs schon richtig aufgehoben. Vor allem wird es auf ein abgestimmtes und geschlossenes Handeln der Beh\u00f6rden ankommen. Nur so kann man einem global agierenden Unternehmen sinnvoll begegnen.</p><p>- Was m\u00fcssten die Aufseher bei Libra beachten?</p><p>Die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Herausforderung f\u00fcr die Aufseher ist sicher, dass keine Erfahrungswerte bez\u00fcglich der Regulierung digitaler W\u00e4hrungen vorliegen. Also muss man sich viele Fragen zum ersten Mal stellen. Um beim Beispiel Libra zu bleiben: Was passiert, wenn Facebook eines Tages nicht mehr existiert? Wie wird Wertstabilit\u00e4t garantiert, wie Geldw\u00e4sche verhindert? Ich habe Bedenken, dass der Regulator zu sp\u00e4t reagiert, indem er sich dazu nicht rechtzeitig positioniert.</p><p>----</p><p>Das Interview f\u00fchrte Karin B\u00f6hmert.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"67379401\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14219\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF-Dokument</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2019148021\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14219\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BORZTG-2019148021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BORZTG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRP-Y9R1-JBJ9-H4K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253914</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Herausgebergemeinschaft Wertpapier-Mitteilungen Keppler, Lehmann GmbH &amp; Co.

We're going to be looking at  the earnings effect on your markets.</p><p>Investors also eyeing the economy, Maria speaking to Vice President Mike  Pence in an exclusive interview, weighing in on the state of the economy  after Friday's GDP report driven by a surge and, yes, exports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Whether we'll see those  dramatic increase in business investment, a dramatic increase in American  exports all support the conclusion that the policies that President Trump  has been advancing that a republican congress have been supporting are  actually working to revive this economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, checking the markets to start your new week.  Right now  Futures pointing to a little bit of a mixed (INAUDIBLE).  The Dow is up  five points in the premarket, S&amp;P is down by two, and the NASDAQ, tech- heavy NASDAQ down by 11 and three quarters.</p><p>This is all after a down day on Friday yet weakness in the tech sector  weighing in on the rest of the market.  That is Friday's close.  And as you  can see, it was, again, the NASDAQ that took the biggest hit, down almost  one and a half percent on Friday.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at Europe, modest declines there, not too bad.  The  FTSE, the CAC40, the DAX are all in the red.  And then taking a look at  Asia overnight, we did see declines across the board.  As you can see, the  Nikkei down.  Biggest lost there, down three quarters of a percent.</p><p>Well, devastation in California, deadly wildfires are spreading rapidly  across the northern part of the state.  We're going to take you there for  the latest on the battle against that raging and deadly blaze.</p><p>And uncertainty this morning at CBS, the company's board is looking at CEO  Les Moonves's future amid sexual harassment allegations.  The details  coming up later on this hour.</p><p>And a big win at Pocono, Kyle Busch coming from behind for his sixth win of  the season, but a scary scene on the track after Bubba Wallace, ooh,  crashed.  Ouch.</p><p>And then on the links we go, Dustin Johnson coming out on top of the RBC  Canadian Open joining elite company with his 19th career victory.  We're  going to have all those sports highlights coming up for you during this  hour.  </p><p>And then from the road to the sea, Elon Musk is now offering Tesla branded  surfboards and they're already out.  Oh yes.  </p><p>All of that coming up.  And with me this morning, I got a great panel this  morning, Republican Strategist Erin Elmore is with me this morning.  FOX  Business Network's Adam Shapiro.  And Maslansky &amp; Partners President Lee  Carter.  Boy, I'm a lucky girl today, good morning.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Good morning.  We're lucky to  have you.</p><p>CASONE:  Where -- it's -- where to start?  I mean, Adam, I can't wait for  Tesla.  I'm like this.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Are you going to go surfing?</p><p>CASONE:  Oh, no.  No. Anything with Elon Musk's name.  But, yes, all these  big Dow components today and the economy in trade, it's going to be great.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Yes.  And then we've got Apple coming up and that's going to be - - Apple's tomorrow as a matter of fact, so it's going to be interesting to  see how Mr. Cook responds to whether the -- was the iPhone X.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  You know, you don't see a lot of advertising for the X right now.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  And we're so used Erin obviously to having these big iPhone  announcements, but investors --</p><p>ELMORE:  Right.</p><p>CASONE:  -- are kind of thinking, \"No, not so great anymore.\"</p><p>ELMORE:  I need a new one, I know that much.  But they're saying that the  new one is like they're going to come out in September which they did help  for fourth quarter, so that should be an interesting fourth quarter. </p><p>CASONE:  Well we have a lot to get to this morning.  Our top story this  hour, yes, second quarter earnings continuing.  You've got five Dow  components reporting this week starting with Caterpillar today and followed  by Pfizer, P&amp;G, Apple, and Dow DuPont.  Those are all coming up in the days  ahead as we're just talking about it.</p><p>Now this is coming on the hills of a tumble in technology stocks after  Facebook results disappointed investors last week leading the company to  lose $119 billion in market value in just one day.  This marks the biggest  market cap decline in a single day in market history.</p><p>All right.  So after the big meltdown that we had with Facebook Adam, we  were just talking about it a little bit.  But the bigger story for Apple  obvious is going to be the iPhone sale.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  It's going to -- it is going to be iPhone sales, it's always  iPhone sales.  But it's going to be interesting to see -- they were never  going to be in jeopardy with tariffs in China because finished product is  not being -- there's not a tariff imposed on finished product.</p><p>But it's going to be interesting to see if they address this issue because  the Chinese can retaliate against the United States by cracking down on  companies that are reliant on Chinese producers for components.  It's going  to be interesting to see if they do weigh in on that.</p><p>CASONE:  You know, and also Lee, you know, you can tell by your polling I'm  sure that if prices start to really creep up on the U.S. consumers whether  it's Apple, whether it's Harley-Davidson, their (INAUDIBLE) products,  that's going to have an impact on the politic side of this.</p><p>CARTER:  It is going to have an impact on the politics side of this.  I  think it's really important though that the president had that victory with  Europe last week because I think people were really starting to concern --  get concerned about trade.</p><p>For a long time, more than two-thirds of Americans were saying we're  willing to say that we believe that these tariffs are negotiating strategy  by the president.  We don't think it's going to have a long-term impact on  us.  </p><p>So he needed to have a win to try and keep those concerns at bay as the  midterms are coming up because if people start to feel it in their pocket  book in whatever the case is, it's going to be hard for the republicans to  say this is a good strategy.</p><p>CASONE:  Erin, that's a really good point.  The midterms is going to be all  about the economy, is it going to -- is there going to be a good or bad  story?</p><p>ELMORE:  Right.  Because what Trump sees is a long play and when you have a  midterm election of such significance and importance, long plays really  don't work.  </p><p>But he is a businessman, we know the art of the deal, he is the art of the  deal, this is a way like he showed with his meetings in Europe to squeeze  these people and say, \"Hey, I promised you on the campaign trail in 2016  that I was going to make things fair for America, NAFTA included.\"  </p><p>And we're all starting to see these things happen in change.  So the long  play, maybe shortened and the midterms could be saved, we have to wait and  see.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  But to Lee's point about people filling in their pocket book,  there are people in the country who are being asked to take a greater  sacrifice during these negotiations and that's the farmers.  </p><p>And, yes, there's $12 billion to assist but we export $140 billion with  agriculture products future, $12 billion is not going to carry these men  and women very far for very long.  And they are not happy, they are very --  I mean, look at the Des Moines Register, $642 million loss just because of  soybean and it's not just soybean that's taking a hit, it's corn, you saw  the story about beef piling up in freezers.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh yes.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  This -- you know, we have an election cycle every two years, the  Chinese don't have the same kind of pressure on them to react.</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>CASONE:  Well obviously this interview that Maria had with the vice  president made a lot of news.  You know, Vice President Pence did tout the  Trump Administration's economic progress.</p><p>And he denied that that part of the GDP growth was due to foreign buyers  stocking up on American products like Adam was just talking about soybeans  before retaliatory tariffs go into place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE:  The reality is in the last two administrations, the economy grew by  less than two percent and in the first 18 months of this administration.</p><p>We were a little shy of three percent last year, we're on track to be at  three percent or better this year.  And --</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  How much of this quarter was  goosed by businesses trying to get ahead of the president's tariff?</p><p>PENCE:  So we think we're seeing real progress, we don't think this was an  anomaly.  We think American exports are on the rise as a reflection of a  strong economy and frankly, a reflection of the president's strong  leadership on improving our trade relationships for American jobs and  American workers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Lee, what is your reaction to his comment?  And this is all about  at the end of the day even if it's a little bit messy, it's about the  American worker, that is their focus.</p><p>CARTER:  That is right.  And I've got to say that this messaging, this  focus on getting people come to the long-term strategy but also this  message that we're fighting for the American people, putting America first.</p><p>I think it set people up to believe this is what's going to happen.  They  (INAUDIBLE), they keep seeing these kinds of things, they see the growth,  they see the markets, they see their 401(k) and IRA is growing.  </p><p>And what they're going to think right now is, \"You know what, I'm willing  to take a bet on some of these things that I'm not agreeing with.\"  And  let's be very, very clear, a lot of voters out there are saying there's  certain things about this president that make me very uncomfortable.  </p><p>But when I look at the members, when I look at my balance, when I look at  tax reform, when I look at growth on the economy, I'm willing to take it.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  And Erin, you know, James Carville said (INAUDIBLE) that  famous quote that the economy is stupid, that quote still rings true today.</p><p>ELMORE:  At the end of the day, I think -- and Lee will probably know him  better than I.  But the average American isn't worrying about Stormy  Daniels and all of these controversies, they're worrying about paying their  bills and sending their kids to school, and making sure that their taxes  are within range.</p><p>And the American people really do care about that and the economy is  working as (INAUDIBLE) said himself.</p><p>CASONE:  But what is interesting thing there -- I love -- I love James  Carville.  But, you know, the same that if you look at what the Chinese are  doing, they're targeting Trump states, they are targeting his base to put  pressure on him to back off of them.  That's the Chinese strategy, but does  it work?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Well that's what the Chinese are doing when you see them  retaliate against agriculture in the Midwest.  </p><p>But the other question, if the tax cuts are so beneficial as republicans  are saying, why are some republicans not using that on the campaign trail  with their constituents?  I mean, democrats will point out the thousand  dollar bonuses that a lot of people got were not pay increases.  You must  got the bonus but not the raise.</p><p>CASONE:  Nancy Pelosi called them crumbs.  Yes.  Come on.  </p><p>CARTER:  See, that polled well rightly.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  </p><p>CARTER:  That was -- that was the soundbyte that kept (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, you know, Nancy Pelosi came out back in May.  Remember she  kind of hinted that the democrats took back the House that she would push a  rollback to tax cuts?  I mean, really?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Well, good luck trying to get that done.  But you can expect to  hear from the democrats, you're going to hear we're going to have a  trillion dollar deficit.  And -- but the republican said is the tax cuts  would pay for themselves overtime and what you're hearing different people  in the administration is.</p><p>I think it was Kudlow who said on Friday, we're going to need another year  or two to ramp up to the point where we grow ourselves out of these  deficits. </p><p>CASONE:  A lot of officials were out over the weekend in particular talking  to the media.  You had Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying that he  sees a period of sustained GDP growth over the next several years, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  We can only project a couple of  years in the future.  But I think we're well on this path for several  years, so I don't -- I don't think this is a one or two-year phenomenon.  I  think we definitely are in a period of four or five years of sustained  three percent growth at least.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Sustained three percent.  Adam, is that realistic you think?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  It's a simple answer.  Yes, I do think it's realistic simply  because of what the tax cut did lowering the corporate tax rate down to 21  percent and conceivably putting more money into the pockets of more  Americans that --</p><p>CASONE:  Sure.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Yes.  I think you're going to see that overtime.  Five years?  I  hope so.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  That would be nice, right?  </p><p>CARTER:  That would be really nice.</p><p>ELMORE:  That's what the president says he foresee.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Well that's what Steven Mnuchin said on FOX News Sunday Lee.   And I mean, you know, again, there's no reason at this point not to think  that the, you know, three, four, five percent GDP growth overtime is -- was  attainable.  I mean, the companies are doing really well right now. </p><p>CARTER:  Companies are --</p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) still doing.</p><p>CARTER:  Companies are doing really well, earnings are going really well  outside of some of these techs.  But they have their own reasons for it.   So I think those are kind of -- you know, there should be a distraction  from what the larger methods is.</p><p>And I think by enlarge the American people are very optimistic about the  future right now.  They feel good, they feel these things.  Now I think,  you know, Adam to your point about the farmers and, you know, China going  after the red states, I think that's significant.</p><p>But I think that the president has done so much laying that foundation that  people understand it might be hard to get winds in the long-term.  And as  long as they see small victories along the way, I think they're going to be  willing to stick with them.  I don't know how long but I think they're  going to be willing to stick with them for some period of time.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  The only thing I would say to that is it's easy for us who don't  rely on income based on selling agriculture to ask other people to stick it  out.  And I realized the $12 million supplements are designed to help  folks.</p><p>But as 330 million of us in the United States are not being asked to make  the sacrifice that thousands of men and women who are farmers are being  asked.  And how long you can ask that of just a small portion of the  population for these negotiations, we'll see.</p><p>CASONE:  Trade, not aid.  We've heard that phrase so many times down the  last week.  Well we're going to be bringing you much more of Maria's  exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence.</p><p>That's going to be coming up on the show including, this is cool, a never  before seen look inside the vice president's office at the White House.   Just a sneak peak for you.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, the ferocious wildfires in California have killed a  woman and her two great grandchildren.  Officials believe at least seven  people are missing as they continue to battle this monster blaze.</p><p>And Tesla creating surfboards with the same materials as its cars, we're  going to tell you how much the now sold out boards are going for.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Dow Futures searching for a little bit of direction on  this Monday.  Right now the Dow itself is up by five points in the  premarket, S&amp;P is down one and three quarters, NASDAQ is down 12 and three  quarters.  Tech-heavy NASDAQ maybe crucial again to watch this week.</p><p>Well, wildfires causing death and destruction in northern California.   Thousands flee their homes as the blaze charge nearly 150 square miles.   FOX News Correspondent Lauren Blanchard is live in Redding, California with  the latest.  It's been a rough night for them Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN BLANCHARD, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning Cheryl.  And  we are in front of what is left of a home here in Redding.  An entire  neighborhood left nearly in ashes. </p><p>Now the car fire has destroyed about 650 homes so far burning nearly  100,000 acres.  Fire official say they've been able to contain 17 percent  of the fire, that's up from only five percent Sunday morning.  But they say  this fire is uniquely tough to stop.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER MOORE, REDDING POLICE DEPARTMENT:  With the intensity that we have  here, it's really hard to stop and move -- fast moving wind-driven fire.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This fire is scary to us.  This is something we haven't  seen before in the city.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD:  The car fire fueled by strong winds and dry bushes killed four  civilians and two firefighters.  A grandmother and her two young  grandchildren killed when the fire quickly spread to their home.</p><p>Plus, another person discovered Sunday and the car fire is just one of more  than a dozen fires burning in California.  Another firefighter killed  Sunday battling the fire in Yosemite National Park.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is fire is -- has not mercy, this is everywhere.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well I've had a few friends whose house are already --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD:  And more than 3,300 firefighters are battling the car fire  alone, there are about 12,000 firefighters around the state of California  also working to tap down on the number of those fires.</p><p>We have seen reports and seen stories of volunteers using their trucks and  (INAUDIBLE) to help move livestock as well as help those families who are  fleeing their homes, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  And some -- especially with some of those firefighters themselves  losing their homes as they battle those fires, it's incredible.  Lauren  Blanchard.  Lauren, thank you very much.</p><p>We've got a lot more coming up.  A possible shakeup at CBS to tell you  about, the board could decide today on whether or not CEO Les Moonves to  step aside amid sexual harassment allegations.  We've got details on why  the probe could go far beyond the company's chief.  </p><p>And after a bumpy ride from other tech giants, investors are looking for  some sweet news from Apple earnings tomorrow.  We're going to have a  preview for you, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, big technology on tap this morning.  Apple set to release  their earnings tomorrow after the close.  The company's second quarter  report follows disappointing numbers from its fellow tech titan.</p><p>Facebook last week wiping out all of its 2018 gains imposing the largest  one-day loss in market value by any company in history following a  disastrous quarterly report.  Twitter also taking a hit from a decline in  monthly users, that stock went plummeting.</p><p>Let's bring in Jonathan Hoenig, Capitalist Pig.com Founder.  Oh man, I'll  tell you, it was a rough week for technology Jonathan last week, all of it  on earnings.</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOUNDER, CAPITALIST PIG.COM:  Yes, they're brutal.</p><p>CASONE:  Let's --</p><p>HOENIG:  Yes, (INAUDIBLE).  I haven't seen anything like it.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.  I feel like we should move on and talk about Apple and  try to put last week behind into Facebook and Twitter but let's talk about  Apple's report.  Do you think that's actually going to help the sector turn  itself around?</p><p>HOENIG:  Let's hope so.  Let's hope so Cheryl because as you pointed out  the bloodbath in the NASDAQ last week almost like something that we really  haven't seen certainly since the election. </p><p>I mean, since the election technology stocks like Apple have accounted for  about half the market's total gain.  So these big cap stocks, the  Netflixes, the Apples, the Tesla also reporting earnings this week.  These  have been the drivers of the market.</p><p>So, of course, investors are going to be listening very closely not only  about the prospect of a new phone, we've heard that, of course, hinted from  Apple's conference calls but also about the prospect of growth in their  cloud business.</p><p>You know, the iPhone still counts for 62 percent of Apple sales but that's  almost the old news.  The new news for Apple in terms of earnings is the  cloud.  But Cheryl, to your original point, given the damage in tech stocks  last week, I think a lot of investors are just going to be hoping to get  through this earning season without any more major blowups like Tesla and  like Twitter.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Jonathan hey, it's Adam Shapiro.  I wanted to pick up on  something you said about, you know, the -- as they shift towards the cloud  because we saw what Amazon did with their web services blew everyone away.</p><p>And Apple's making that kind of -- we think of them as -- you know, I  always get confused but it's a hardware company and yet they're software  and they're cloud services, you know, the music offerings, the T.V.  offerings.  This is where they're trying to go, isn't it?</p><p>HOENIG:  Yes, you're absolutely right Adam.  And to -- I think what has  made Apple so successful.  I mean, this is a company that is on the cusp of  becoming a $1 trillion company for the first time which made them so  successful.</p><p>Adam to your point, is their willingness to not only cannibalize their own  products but truly reinvent themselves.  You know, majority of the profit  now, their revenue comes from iPhone, this is a product that didn't even  exist 15 years ago.  So absolutely.</p><p>And the crowd really is where the margins are, it is where the growth is.   And that prospect of growth Adam, I think that's what has investors very  concerned because these big cap techs have been trading historically pretty  expensive, these are not cheap stocks.  Many of them are called unicorns  like Tesla for example.</p><p>So once that growth becomes a little more murky, the stocks can take a dive  and take a dive big time like we saw last week.</p><p>CASONE:  Well they're going to have their -- they're going to have the  conference call obviously now after the numbers come out at 5:00 p.m.  Eastern Time.  I can't wait to hear what they say about China.  That's  going to be what I'm really going to be listening for when they report.</p><p>OK.  I'm going to break a promise and go back to Facebook because there was  some late breaking news Friday night that the company, the CEO Mark  Zuckerberg are going to be sued by Manhattan shareholder after that big  stock drop of 19 percent.</p><p>The -- what's interesting about the Wall Street though Jonathan is it says  that Facebook misled the shareholders about business and the stock price  fell once the truth was revealed.  What do you make -- I mean look,  shareholder losses happen all the time but the base of this one I think is  interesting.</p><p>HOENIG:  Yes.  Well especially it happened a lot of time with big  successful companies with a lot of money like Facebook.  Don't see this in  particular Cheryl having a major impact but simply the confidence of  shareholders themselves.</p><p>Obviously some who've lost money have lost some confidence but more and  more are going to continue to lose confidence.  And, you know, essentially  if big cap tech can't power the market forward, what will?  That's what  investors should be most worried about, not small lawsuits like this, this  will come and go.</p><p>But what's going to leave the economy?  What's going to leave the market if  it's not going to be big cap tech, we'll have a better idea a little later  in the week after these earnings are released.</p><p>CASONE:  Erin's got a question for you.</p><p>ELMORE:  Hi Jonathan, good morning.  So I know you're a hedge fund guy.   Hedge funds had according to the (INAUDIBLE) more than 10 percent of hedge  funds count Facebook as a top holding.  Was this a big hit to those hedge  funds or do you think this is going to rebound pretty quickly?</p><p>HOENIG:  Well no.  I mean listen, you can't follow the crowd whether you're  an individual investor or whether a hedge fund or anyone else.  You have to  try to get ahead of the crowd.  </p><p>So to your point, so many investors whether they're big time hedge fund or  just everyday folks have really bought in this idea of the big cap tech  stocks as being the market leaders, the market essentials.  And you know,  we saw very much the same idea back in the late 1990s when people felt as  if, you know, Cisco and Microsoft were the only stocks you needed to own.   That was in the last big tech blow up back in the late '90s --</p><p>CASONE:  Oh, and pet.com.</p><p>HOENIG:  -- I think you could make the case -- yes, it does.  By the time,  we're seeing -- we've seen the same type of attitude now, I think that's  one reason. </p><p>You know, Warren Buffett has great line he says, \"Be greedy when others are  fearful, fearful when others are greedy\" --</p><p>CASONE:  That's true.  That's true.</p><p>HOENIG:  -- and bullish in the economy but I see some greed right now, I  think it's a good time for (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Yes, all right.  I do want to switch gears, there's  this new report out in the Wall Street Journal today, it's called, \"No  Experience Necessary.\"  Basically certain companies are saying, \"Nah, we're  not going to read about your work history.  College degree, yes, don't  worry about that either.\"</p><p>They're lowering the bar because they need to hire people, they're  desperate to get people into the company.  I mean, is this actually  beneficial for companies though in the long-term if you get somebody that  doesn't have the experience they need?</p><p>HOENIG:  What a -- what a change Cheryl.  I mean remember talking with you  10 years ago.  What -- it wasn't even met when, you know, people with  advance degrees were banging on doors, couldn't find work at all. </p><p>And that was, of course, in the amid of the great recession following the  financial implosion.  Times have change, it's indicative of a tremendous  workforce.  I think it's also indicative of the fact that the job market  has changed Cheryl.</p><p>I mean, what does Google care what school you went to, they want to know if  you can program, if you can produce, this is a positive thing looking  forward the fact that employers are now looking at skills and not just the  hoi polloi name on the top of a degree.</p><p>CARTER:  So it sounds like you're a little thought pessimistic about the  market based on the fact that you think that tech drives so much of growth.   Are there any bright spots that you're looking at?</p><p>HOENIG:  Yes.  I mean, I think -- I think you have to be cautious again,  just given what we saw last week.  And I think now more than anything is  the time and it's not sexy, it's not exciting like stock tickers.</p><p>But, you know, we've heard time and time again how most investors or most  Americans couldn't even come up with three to six month worth of living  expenses, couldn't come up with cash.  So look, I agree with the vice  president and her -- his terrific interview with Maria about how stellar  the economy is. </p><p>Knowing that I think now is a good time to just get one's financial house  in order, get three months, six months' worth of cash living expenses in  the bank, then I think it's time to really get optimistic because, you  know, even if the economy falls, you're protected long-term.</p><p>CASONE:  We want to have that extra cash on hand because you never know.  </p><p>HOENIG:  Yes.  Yes, you never know.</p><p>CASONE:  Jonathan, it's been true for decades.  Jonathan, it's good to see  you, thank you for coming on.</p><p>HOENIG:  Thanks Cheryl.  Be well.</p><p>CASONE:  Jonathan Hoenig.  You too.  All right.  Well coming up, a last  minute emergency action in Pennsylvania stops a company from releasing  blueprints for 3D guns online.  We have a new controversy of what was  already a controversy coming up.</p><p>And Dustin Johnson pulls up a big victory at the RBC Canadian Open, details  on how lucky 19 secures his place in history.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CASONE:  Good morning, I'm Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo, it is  Monday, July 30th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern time.  Another  week of big name earnings are coming up.  We are waiting on Caterpillar  this morning, and some other Dow components are going to report this week,  and that includes Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble and yes, Apple.</p><p>All eyes on the tech giants report tomorrow, after the close.  And after  last week's disappointing performance by Facebook and Twitter, it's even  more important, one word on the lips of companies all over the world is,  tariffs.  Maria spoke with Vice President Mike Pence in an exclusive  interview when she talked about President Trump's attempt to level the  trade playing field.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE:  It's a great day for America.  Its 4.1 percent quarter in a year  that's on track for more than three percent growth, is a testament to the  President's leadership and his vision for this economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, meanwhile, speaking of the economy, Futures are actually  showing a mixed bag this morning after that blockbuster number on Friday,  Dow up seven in the premarket, S&amp;P down one and three quarters, NASDAQ is  down 13-1/2.</p><p>Now, the markets ended in the red, as you can see on Friday, the Dow lost  76, the S&amp;P down 18, NASDAQ, that was the big story, Friday.  Obviously,  the technology story, NASDAQ lost almost 1-1/2 percent on Friday.  We will  see if today is a different story.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at Europe, as you can see, all of those markets are  in the red, that follows our tech selloff Friday, put the CAC 40, DAX, all  in the negative.  And then Asian markets, ending lower across the board,  the big losses were actually in Japan, down three quarters of a percent  there.</p><p>Well, it is a black eye for CBS, the network's board of directors preparing  an investigation into allegations that CEO Les Moonves, sexually harassed  women.  We've got the details coming up on that.  </p><p>And then plans for 3D printed guns, jams in Pennsylvania, lawmakers with  the last-minute attempt to block the distribution of the plans in the  state.</p><p>Massive impact at Pocono, Bubba Wallace, in high-speed crash, we're going  to have the latest on his condition this morning, following that crazy  story.  And then, Dustin Johnson, making history at the RBC Canadian Open,  his new elite status, we're going to talk about it with Jared.</p><p>And not content with just making electric cars, Tesla is making a leap to  the surf.  You have got to see this one to actually believe it, but, yes,  it's real.</p><p>And now to our top story this half hour, tariffs, hitting consumers, many  companies are increasing prices on goods, ranging from soda, to  recreational vehicles, to beer, and that's now going to cost more, of  course, to produce as a result of recent aluminum and steel tariffs.  </p><p>BMW, following Tesla, is one of the companies announcing it's going to  raise prices of its U.S.-made SUVs in China, to counteract the effects of  the tariffs.  Here now is Hugo Gurdon, Gurdon, excuse me, Washington  Examiner, Editorial Director, Hugo, good morning.</p><p>HUGO GURDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Good morning,  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  So, do you think these price increases are going to basically turn  American voters off to the President's, you know, message of renegotiating  all of these agreements?</p><p>GURDON:  Well, it's a big risk.  Raising tariffs is essentially like  raising taxes on Americans, it also kills job.  If you -- if you raise  tariffs -- it's -- on steel and aluminum, it's going to push up the prices,  soda cans, so you buy more, you pay more for your soda.  It's going to push  up more of the price of nails, it's going to push up the price of houses.   It's a very high-risk strategy.  </p><p>But just recently, we have also been seeing signs from some notable  economic writers, Donald Luskin, in the Wall Street Journal, Marc Thiessen,  who's at the American Enterprise Institute, writing in the Washington Post,  suggesting that these tariffs are having their effect on China.  </p><p>Last week, we saw a deal with the European Union or the beginnings of a  deal which will going to open up their markets, and at the same time, the  Europeans agreed to buy more soybeans, now, that counteracts China, which  is the biggest importer of American soybeans.</p><p>So, there are signs that what Donald Trump is doing is putting the squeeze  on China.  And the point that you made earlier, Adam, about, you know, how  long can people stand the pain of this, is the big question.  Do more  people turn against the President because they themselves are losing their  jobs or does it have the impact on China?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Well, can I ask you about a question about China?</p><p>GURDON:  Yes, sure.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  because, you know, the squeeze is on China and I know we're going  to go into that.  But the Chinese, and this is an extreme statement, but  the Chinese killed their own people (INAUDIBLE) years ago.</p><p>So, the government in China, the 80 million people who are members of the  Communist Party in the Politburo, is the squeeze on them.  I realized 600  million in the middle class in China might have pressure.  But the Chinese  government shows willingness to ignore their own people.</p><p>GURDON:  Well, certainly, I think, one doesn't expect the Chinese Politburo  and the Party to care very much about the people.  But the Chinese stock  market has lost 25 percent in the first half of this year.  The Yuan, its  currency, it had a terrible June and it looks like it's having a terrible  July, as well.</p><p>What they really fear for an emerging market, even though it's the second  biggest in the world, is flight of capital.  So, you know, they don't want  to see that further tanking in their stock market, they really are going to  feel the pressure from these --</p><p>CASONE:  They have to come to the table, though, when it comes to  intellectual property and the vice president talked about that with Maria,  that we are very, obviously, aware that this sharing of technology that's  forced sharing of technology between U.S. companies and China.  You want to  deal with China, you got to open up your I.P., that's the big problem.</p><p>GURDON:  Exactly.</p><p>CASONE:  I want to stay with trade, to, kind of, switch gears, to something  else, because South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said yesterday --</p><p>GURDON:  Right.</p><p>CASONE:  -- on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" that the U.S. may pull out of the  World Trade Organization, unless China starts playing by the rules.   Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Let's go to zero as soon as we  can.  Get rid of the subsidies, unite and reform the WTO, until China, if  you want to stay in the WTO, we're going to have new rules you have to  abide by.  Either kick them out or we get out, one to two, because the WTO  is not working.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  So, a standing tough on China, is that the (INAUDIBLE)  message do you think for the Republicans in the midterms?</p><p>GURDON:  Well, I don't know how much trade issues are going to affect the  midterms.  I think people will feel that -- if their pocketbooks feel good,  then they're going to be happy if it does, if they don't, then they're not  going to be.  But I do think that -- I think it's very unlikely that the  United States is going to pull out of the WTO, I think that's a very long- term process.  </p><p>But Lindsey Graham is right.  China has been unfair to the United states in  its trade policies.  President Trump is putting a lot of pressure on them  and, you know, there are signs that they might crack, I -- you know, I  don't think that the WTO process is quick enough.</p><p>CASONE:  Lee, what do you make of that, because you're constantly doing  polling of --</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  Americans, what do you think of that?</p><p>CARTER:  You know, I am consistently surprised by how much people support  the President on these issues, even knowing that they might hurt them in  the short term or even the long term.  We don't know how long this is going  to go.  </p><p>GURDON:  Right.</p><p>CARTER:  When we talk about China, and I think you mentioned this, they are  a long gain.</p><p>GURDON:  Yes.  Go on.</p><p>CARTER:  They don't have midterms, they don't have four-year elections.   They have this long-term view on the world that we simply can't understand.  </p><p>But when I talk to the American voters, when I talk to Republican voters  and even a large -- a large number of independents, they're out there  saying, you know what, it's about time that we have a politician who is  willing to get up there and stand up for us first, not give us platitudes,  do what he says, and say, we're going to put our needs first, And we are  willing to take short-term pain.</p><p>And I never would have believed that this was going to happen.  When I'm  looking at these polling numbers and I'm looking consistently, people are  saying, I'm willing to stick this out.  And I understand, Adam, your point  about the farmers.  They're taking it on the chin and I know a lot of them  are really, really upset right now.  </p><p>The same time, the President is going out there and offering them aid  packages and we're talking about what's happening, either seeing deals  happening in the E.U.  </p><p>I think people are still optimistic and you think about how -- is there --  this is -- this is almost, like, opposite of any other political movement  that you've seen before where people are going to say, you know what, I get  it, it's going to be harder for me but it's worth it.</p><p>CASONE:  It's upended.  Hugo, I want to ask you about something else.  I  want to move on to another interview with Maria's, social media censorship,  a big issue.  House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, was on  \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" with her, yesterday.  </p><p>He's considering legal action to deal with Twitter's shadow banning of  conservative voices.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  And you  had a report that came out, where in fact, there were four people in House  of Representatives.  </p><p>And the only four politicians in the country, the elected officials that  were being quote unquote -- well, they don't call it shadow banning, but,  effectively, we were getting tied up in some type of trap, to where people  couldn't see our twitter feed, that was -- that was Mr. Gaetz, Mr. Meadows,  Mr. Jordan and myself.  </p><p>So, I don't know what Twitter is up to.  It sure looks to me like they are  censoring people and they ought to -- they ought to stop it and we are  looking at any legal remedies that we can go through.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Hugo, doesn't this reinforce the idea that there's bias against  Conservative voices?</p><p>GURDON:  Yes, I think it does.  I don't know that there are legal remedies  that the Congress can take, although, they're talking about looking -- you  know, referring this to the FEC.  So, you know, maybe there's some kind of  case that you can make that this is an in-kind contribution to Democrats or  some such thing.</p><p>But these are private companies and they're allowed to be politically  biased.  But, you know, Conservatives, over the past six months have felt  themselves not being presented on social media nearly as much as they were.   You know, people have lost traffic et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>CASONE:  Right.  And Erin, you can comment on that.  I mean, you're seeing  the same thing with --</p><p>ELMORE:  Absolutely.  I just had an experience recently with Candice Owens.   I was liking various twitter comments that she had made and all of the  likes were disappearing.  </p><p>And when you try to contact these social media platforms about this, you  get absolute radio silence.  And people often speak about Facebook only,  Facebook, Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg.  </p><p>GURDON:  Right.</p><p>ELMORE:  What people failed to understand, if I'm not correct here, is that  Instagram is also owned by Facebook.  So, this is truly pervasive across  all of our social media platforms.  What do we do, what is the government  to do, what are consumers to do? </p><p>GURDON:  Look, I think -- one of the things that's really interesting about  this, is that social media is -- unlike phone companies, and that the phone  companies don't get blamed for what is said on the phone, but social media,  they've decided that they're going to police their content.</p><p>So, you know, they're saying we're going to cut out fake news.  We're going  to do, sort of, online hygiene, et cetera.  As soon as you start trying to  police, then you have to take responsibility for it.  And if people see  bias in the way that you are policing it, then they're going to get  terribly upset.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, I know that --</p><p>CARTER:  I think one of the biggest concerns here, though, is what they  label as hate language, right?</p><p>GURDON:  Right.</p><p>CARTER:  And saying that a lot of Conservatives who just hate language and  I have seen posts that get answered --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Ask Diamond and Silk.  Let's talk about how they feel about  censorship with regards to Facebook and they actually are winning their  argument, in Washington, of all places.  Hugo, it's great to see you.  </p><p>GURDON:  Thanks very much for having me.  Thank you.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Great to hear that lovely British accent this early morning,  wakes me up, Hugo, thank you.  All right, coming up, we've troubles to tell  you about at CBS.  The company's board is looking at CEO Les Moonves'  future, amidst sexual harassment allegation, that's coming up.  </p><p>And Tesla's going off road, way off road, with, yes, surfboards.  Wait till  you hear what they cost, if you can even get one.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, CBS' board meets today to consider whether CEO Les Moonves  should step aside while sexual harassment allegations against him are  investigated.  Susan Li has got the details, Susan, good morning.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Cheryl, CBS  has opened an investigation after six women accused Moonves of sexual  misconduct in a New Yorker that was published on Friday.  CBS's board also  discuss the claims against Moonves over the weekend.  And Moonves says, he  regrets any behavior that made women uncomfortable but says he never used  his position to harm or hinder anyone's career.  CBS releases earnings of  Thursday.  The stock tumbling six percent on Friday amid concerns that  Moonves might be force to resign.  </p><p>The state of Pennsylvania stopping a company that makes 3D downloadable  guns for by making them accessible in the state.  Pennsylvania's Attorney  General Josh Shapiro saying that the Texas-based company, Defense  Distributed, agreed to block Pennsylvania users after an emergency hearing  late yesterday in federal courts.  The company says it began distributing  gun files on Friday.  And by Sunday, 1,000 people downloaded 3D plans for  AR-15 assault rifles.</p><p>And Tesla catching a wave of excitement over its new 1,500-dollar  surfboard.  The limited edition custom-made surfboard sold out in just one  day after it went up on Tesla's Web site over the weekend, only 200 of  these boards which match the interior, decor, and color scheme of Tesla  cars were made.  And shares of Tesla, lower in the premarket.  So, it looks  like it's not surfs up for the stocks reaction to all of this -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CASONE:  Surfed down.  Exactly.  Well, they've got a lot more issues coming  up.  And obviously Adam, it's about the earnings that you're going to be  coming out.  Get your popcorn out.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Yes, and you know, Elon Musk has put foot in his mouth over the  last -- during the last quarter -- my brother loves his car, though.  He  has two Teslas and he has the demo that buys those cars.  But I've written  in the first one he had, it's a wonderful machine whether Elon Musk can  deliver the kind of, you know, scale he's going need to make this viable is  another question.  </p><p>CARTER:  It sounds so really hard to understand which direction he's going  at right now.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  The battery.  The car --  </p><p>ELMORE:  Is it flame throwers?  I don't know.  Or is it now surfboards.   Driverless surfboards.  </p><p>CASONE:  Now, it's surfboards.  </p><p>ELMORE:  I need one of those, I think.  </p><p>CASONE:  And also, to his behavior on Twitter.  I mean, that's actually  affected the stock prices.  </p><p>CARTER:  Significantly.  Significantly.  </p><p>CASONE:  Because he's like, OK, if you're going to get on and yell at  somebody on Twitter, you should be focusing on the growth of the company.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  It was more than yelling.  It was a real insult.</p><p>ELMORE:  Really inflammatory term.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  </p><p>CARTER:  They're calling him the Donald Trump of the business world, right?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CASONE:  All right, we've got a lot more coming up.  Helpless; that's how  Bubba Wallace describes his terrifying crash at Pocono.  More on the huge  wreck that he walked away from.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, a Major League Baseball pitcher floored with no-hitter  yesterday but that wasn't the biggest headline he made; Jared Max is here  with the controversy.  Hey, Jared, good morning.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Cheryl.   Let's start with the near no-hitter for Atlanta Braves pitcher Sean  Newcomb.  Two outs in ninth inning against the Dodgers; two strikes on  Chris Taylor, one strike away from no-hitter.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Another 2-2.  It's a base hit!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  Now, Newcomb was taken out of the game.  The Braves still win 4-1,  but after Newcomb found himself apologizing for offensive tweets sent six  or seven years ago which said: \"I just wanted to apologize for any  insensitive material.  It was a long time ago, six or seven years ago,  saying stupid stuff with friends.  I didn't mean anything by it for sure.\"   Now, hours after Newcomb got caught in -- can we call it the got-you-game?   Showed that fellow 25-year-old, Trea Turner, of the Nationals who also  apologized for offensive tweets.  </p><p>Count them up.  Six wins this year for Kyle Busch on the NASCAR circuit.   Yesterday, Busch won at Pocono, those 49th all-time victory in NASCAR and  that ties him with Tony Stewart for 13th all-time.  Bubba Wallace had a  scare yesterday.  At the end of the race lost his brakes at turn one,  crashes hard into the wall.  Amazingly, he was uninjured.  </p><p>World number one golfer, Dustin Johnson, won the Canadian Open: 23 under  par, a three-shot win for Johnson, who becomes the first golfer since Tiger  Woods in 2009 to win at least three events three years in a row.  He also  ties hall of famers Ben Crenshaw, Ernie Els, Doug Ford, Hubert Green, and  Tom Kite on the all-time wins list.  </p><p>San Francisco Giants Manager, Bruce Bochy caught a red eye from San  Francisco to Chicago Saturday night.  Then, a 90-minute lay over and then  flew to Albany, drove 75 minutes to get to Cooperstown to see two former  colleagues with Padres, Trevor Hoffman and Alan Trammel enshrined at the  baseball hall of fame.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TREVOR HOFFMAN, 2018 HALL OF FAME INDUCTEE:  We're a group of guys that  became a team, who still have got special bond with so many making an  effort being here today.  </p><p>ALAN TRAMMEL, 2018 HALL OF FAME INDUCTEE:  How do you really describe your  emotions in a time like that?  I wanted to jump up and down, yell, and  scream.  </p><p>CHIPPER JONES, 2018 HALL OF FAME INDUCTEE:  How do I, of all people, end up  here on the stage, with these iconic players; my childhood heroes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  Vladimir Guerrero also enshrined yesterday, same for Jack Mars and  Jim Thome, 612 homeruns.  Thome's daughter yesterday sang the national  anthem.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(SINGING NATIONAL ANTHEM)</p><p>And the home of the brave.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  look at that, Jim Thome, tears in his eyes.  Not only does he get  enshrined to the hall of fame, but his daughter also has that beautiful  moment.  </p><p>CASONE:  I love those moments.  Yes, (INAUDIBLE).  I want to talk about  golf for a second.  I mean, is golf becoming again like a younger person's  sport?  Because there's so much worry that the industry was losing that  young viewer because of the expense and the time.  It seems like  (INAUDIBLE) back.  Am I wrong?  </p><p>MAX:  Good question.  The tiger effect is -- a lot folks who made here are  of the older generation.  I hear trying to poo-poo Tiger Wood's comeback.   You know, stop watching Tiger, there's other good golf and a young  generation, and saying, yes, look at guys like Dustin Johnson.  And I was  watching yesterday thinking you might see the world number one winning  again.  </p><p>CASONE:  Lucky 19.  </p><p>ELMORE:  And what about NASCAR for a second?  I'm a huge NASCAR fan to the  degree that I know cars which isn't that great.  But Kyle Busch, he's been  winning a lot.  But every time he goes, they're booing him.  </p><p>MAX:  Unfortunately, Dagen is not here.  </p><p>CASONE:  I know.  </p><p>MAX:  It's a requirement that whoever is going to sit in that seat will  talk about NASCAR.  </p><p>CASONE:  Erin, you messed up. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ELMORE:  All I know is that when I went and found him at Charlotte Speedway  he was boo, boo.  Maybe it's because he's on top.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  I lost my brakes on 64 (INAUDIBLE), so I know what it's like to  lose your breaks, but that was more on a testament to how terrible I am as  a mechanic, than it is to driving with that car. </p><p>ELMORE:  Well, I'm glad you both made it out OK.  Sorry to put you on the  spot.  </p><p>MAX:  No, we're all good.  We're all good.  </p><p>CASONE:  Jared Max.  You can catch Jared's sports reports, Fox News  Headlines 24/7 on Siriusxm 115.

But another issue affecting business trade with  China.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PENCE:  For too long, China has had virtually unfettered access to the  American economy and the American consumer.

You had weakness in the technology sector  weighing on the rest of the market.  The Nasdaq in particular lost almost  1.5 percent on Friday.

Power panel on a Monday, which I  need.</p><p>All right.  Well, Vice President Mike Pence speaking exclusively with Maria  to discuss the President's ongoing trade agenda and an effort to make the  historic Trump tax cuts permanent.</p><p>They began with Friday's robust report on the GDP and expectations for the  future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Let's talk about the economic  data, first off -- 4.1 percent growth.  Your reaction?  We were expecting a  big number.  </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, it's a great day  for America.  You see in the second quarter, 4.1 percent growth, exports  growing dramatically, that added to the reality of 3.7 million new jobs  created since Election Day 2016. </p><p>I just -- I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who has  been working every day to keep the promise he made to the American people,  to roll back red tape, to cut taxes, unleash American energy.  And I think  this 4.1 percent quarter and a year that's on track for more than 3 percent  growth is a testament to the President's leadership and his vision for this  economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were the most important takeaways from this quarter?  A  lot of conversation about whether or not this is a one-quarter thing or  whether or not we're going to see this sustained.  </p><p>PENCE:  Well, it's important to recognize in context that the reality is in  the last two administrations, the economy grew by less than 2 percent.  And  in the first 18 months of this administration we were a little shy of 3  percent last year.  We're on track to be at 3 percent or better this year.</p><p>And we really believe the internals of these numbers -- whether it be the  dramatic increase in business investment, the dramatic increase in American  exports -- all support the conclusion that the policies that President  Trump has been advancing, that a Republican Congress have been supporting,  are actually working to revive this economy.</p><p>But you sense real momentum.  You know, I was in North Dakota and Montana  this week, West Virginia just a couple days ago, and you sense out on the  street, talking to everyday Americans, talking to business leaders, that  the best is yet to come, that these numbers tell the tale but the  enthusiasm and the confidence all across this country among business  leaders and businesses large and small tells the same story and more.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Vice President -- how much of this quarter was goosed by  businesses trying to get ahead of the President's tariffs?  There is a  narrative out there that China, for example, was rushing to buy more  soybeans, buy crude oil and other commodities so that they would get ahead  of the President's tariffs that haven't taken effect yet.  </p><p>PENCE:  Well, you know, we heard that theory.  But the reality is when you  look at the whole quarter, American exports were up by more than 9 percent  and our trade deficit was down by $50 billion.  You know, you heard the  President say on Friday just how enthusiastic he was about seeing our trade  deficit coming down.</p><p>And we really think we're just getting started.  So we don't believe this  was a reaction to the President's strong leadership in renegotiating our  trade relationships.  A great breakthrough this last week with the European  Union, now the United States and the E.U. are going to begin working toward  a trade arrangement that has zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers and  really opens up commerce between our two countries in new and renewed says,  as well as having the E.U. commit to immediately begin to buy more soybeans  from American farmers.</p><p>So we think we're seeing real progress.  We don't think this was an  anomaly.  We think American exports are on the rise as a reflection of a  strong economy and frankly a reflection of the President's strong  leadership on improving our trade relationships for American jobs and  American workers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  When do you expect the President will be able to announce  another solid official trade deal?  Will you be able to announce trade  deals before the midterm elections, for example?  </p><p>PENCE:  Well, we're very encouraged about the progress that we're making in  discussions about the North American Free Trade Agreement.  I know the U.S.  trade representative continues to believe that there's a possibility that  before we get to Labor Day we may have a reformed NAFTA agreement.  But  those details are still being worked out.</p><p>But look, the President came into this administration with the belief that  for too long Americans, our economy, our workers had been taken advantage  of by imbalanced trade deals.  And whether it be in renegotiating South  Korea, whether it be opening up markets to American exports and  agricultural goods, renegotiating NAFTA or resetting the balance in our  relationship with the European Union and of course resetting the balance or  huge imbalance with China.</p><p>We really believe that that kind of strong leadership on behalf of American  jobs and workers is actually contributing the momentum that we saw in these  second quarter numbers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll have a deal with Mexico by Labor Day?  </p><p>PENCE:  Well, we remain hopeful that in the coming months that we'll be  able to reach an agreement.  But I can assure you that President Trump's  going to continue to stay focused on American manufacturing and American  agriculture and we're going to renegotiate NAFTA in a way that's a win for  working Americans in the city and on the farm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Vice President -- some lawmakers criticized the meeting  with the E.U. and Mr. Juncker.  Twenty-four lawmakers said that this is  impacting their chances of reelection come November.  You've got Andy Barr,  for example, in Kentucky saying well, the bourbon makers in Kentucky are  being hurt by the retaliatory tariffs out of Europe.  You've got Mr.  Huizenga of Michigan complaining about high raw material prices.  Is this  going to impact those races in?  </p><p>PENCE:  We think a better trade relationship with the European Union; a  more fair, more reciprocal relationship is going to benefit every American.   And look, we respect members of Congress.  It's remarkable to think all the  progress that we've made in the last 18 months has been made in partnership  with Republican majorities but it's been against an unprecedented level of  Democrat obstruction.</p><p>It is amazing to think, just as an aside, Maria, that in the last year and- a-half our administration has faced more filibusters called by Chuck  Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate, by a factor of four times more  than any administration going all the way back to the Carter  administration.</p><p>So we respect members of congress.  We respect them standing up for  interests in their district.  But we're grateful for the support they  provided for the President's agenda.  And we remain confident that as we  reset the balance in those trading relationships, that it's going to win  for their districts and win for America.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the lack of Democratic support brings me to my next  question which is about tax cuts 2.0.  Now, you're working on another plan  to lower taxes, trying to make the individual cuts permanent.  But is this  just a ploy to make sure to remind the American people that yours is the  party of tax cuts right before the midterm elections?  Because the truth  is, you're not going to get any Democratic support for that.  Or do you  really believe this economy needs more stimulus?  </p><p>PENCE:  You know, President Trump and I have worked very closely with the  Republican leadership to fashion tax cuts 2.0.  The reality is that before  Christmas last year President Trump signed the largest tax cuts and tax  reform in American history.</p><p>And I think the enthusiasm that you see among everyday Americans, the  investment that we saw in this last quarter by American businesses, is an  affirmation of that tax cut package that was passed.</p><p>But President Trump absolutely believes it's important that we make tax  cuts permanent.  We're going to work with members of Congress to move this  legislation forward, even as it's unveiled in the coming weeks.</p><p>And I promise you in the years ahead President Trump is going to continue  to look for ways we can let the American people keep more of what they earn  and we can create the kind of reforms in our tax code that will encourage  businesses to invest here and create jobs here in U.S.A.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President recently tweeted about the Federal Reserve.  And  he said, you know, it's crazy that the Federal Reserve is going to be  raising interest rates.  If the economy's so great, why not raise interest  rates?  </p><p>PENCE:  Well look, we respect the independence of the Federal Reserve.  The  President reflected his own personal opinion about that.  But what we don't  want to see happen going forward is we don't want policies, whether Capitol  Hill or elsewhere, to diminish the tremendous energy that we have in the  economy today.</p><p>Look, as I said before, as I travel across this country you sense the  confidence that Americans feel again in a very real sense.  It's like a  steelworker said in Granite City, Illinois yesterday with tears in his  eyes, he said we're back.  And I sense that all across the country.  </p><p>People see in President Trump someone who has a boundless confidence in the  American future.  Also they see a president who has been keeping promises  to cut taxes, roll back red tape, unleash American energy and the American  people are responding.</p><p>I mean the second quarter numbers, 4.1 percent growth, on track this year  for 3 percent growth, after 16 years that averaged less than 2 percent.   It's a testament to the President's determination and leadership.  It's a  testament to the members of Congress and partners in the Republican  majorities that have supported the President.  And it's also a testament to  the ingenuity, the resilience, the determination and the confidence of the  American people in President Trump's vision.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That ingenuity is being robbed by the Chinese.  Let's talk  China for a moment -- </p><p>PENCE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- because the President is using tariffs as a way to leverage  to get the Chinese to stop stealing from us.  We know China has been  stealing intellectual property for decades, transferring technology.  Are  tariffs the answer to get them to stop?  They won't even admit they're  doing it.  </p><p>PENCE:  When you look at our trade deficit around the world, nearly $800  billion on an annual basis.  Maria, as you know well, fully half of that is  with China.  I mean for too long China has had virtually unfettered access  to the American economy and the American consumer.  And American companies  have faced significant barriers.</p><p>And the issues that you raise represent a genuine threat to our economy.   It's absolutely essential that we protect intellectual property from being  stolen by interests in China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But will they do it?</p><p>PENCE:  It's absolutely essential that we end the forced technology  transfers that exist.  But we remain confident, as the President takes a  strong stand, and we continue to pursue a policy of raising barriers until  we achieve reciprocal relationship with China, I truly believe based on the  relationship that President Trump has forged with President Xi and frankly,  based on some things that President Xi has said on precisely those issues,  recent speech several months ago President Xi, many reported for the very  first time, talked about the need to address and protect intellectual  property and end forced technology transfers.</p><p>And we believe raising those issues and recognizing the need for more fair  and balanced trade relationship gives us hope that we can improve this  relationship.  Make no mistake about it President Trump is going to  continue to stand strong until we achieve free, fair and reciprocal trade  relationship with China.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASONE:  And we're going to bring you more of Maria's exclusive interview  with Vice President Mike Pence including a never before seen tour of his  office where he shares his father's bronze star.

She was  spending the summer in Jordan.</p><p>American Airlines jets are back in the sky after a computer glitch grounded  flights nationwide.  The FAA saying that the 40-minute outage was centered  around the airline's main operating system.  Around 900 American flights  were delayed yesterday according to flightaware.com.

Look, I always  thought to myself, ok, maybe not a sustainable business model but fun if  you're a movie fan.  But now the company really -- </p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Well, that's always a bad sign,  right, when they get the emergency loan.  But they've got real competition.   AMC has its own version, don't they?  I always get confused by these  things.</p><p>But the minute you lose the goodwill of the customer who didn't get to go  see the movie they wanted and then you can't get hold of customer service  to get -- you were talking about this earlier with Twitter -- you lose the  customer.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>LI:  And the sense of urgency.  They want to buy these tickets when they  buy them.  They sign up for (INAUDIBLE) after 12:00 every Monday.  They  wanted it then and they couldn't get what they wanted -- you've lost their  good faith.</p><p>ELMORE:  And they're also talking about surge pricing now for these --  whether it's Moviepass or AMC or whatever it's the same.  You don't want to  go on a Friday night at 7:00 -- that' going to cost you a lot more.  </p><p>CARTER:  I know but, you know, it does make sense, (INAUDIBLE) does that  with certain classes that are, you know, if they could get more money for  the ticket, it makes sense that they do that.  They have to sustain this  business model some how.  Uber does it too.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  They have to sustain the business model but the customer doesn't  have to take part in it.  It's like, you mentioned Uber, but there's  competition with Lyft.  And then I actually go back and forth and you can  see the different prices.  </p><p>CASONE:  Interesting idea, anyway.

We need  great people coming into our country.\"</p><p>Well, Vice President Mike Pence spoke exclusively with Maria on Friday,  discussing the resistance facing Republicans in Congress.  This coming as  Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters ramped up her rhetoric against the  President yesterday.  Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE:  It is amazing to think, just as an aside Maria, that in the last  year and-a-half our administration has faced more filibusters called by  Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate by a factor of four times  more than any administration going all the way back to the Carter  administration.  </p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA:  This president is a bully.  He'll try  and intimidate all of us.  He's not going to shut down anything.  We're not  going to be intimidated by his bluffing and his bullying.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Joining us now, Tennessee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.   Congressman Fleischmann -- good morning.</p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSESS:  Good morning.  Thank you for  having me.</p><p>CASONE:  It's great to have you here.  There's so much news that broke over  the weekend.  And of course the big interview on Friday.  You serve on  house appropriations.  You passed on Homeland Security Bill.  There's $5  billion in that for a border wall.</p><p>What do you take on the fact that there's not been a vote on this and the  President wants to see action on something he ran for when he was running  for president?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, it's a good point.  House Appropriations Members and  House Republicans have done their job.  I am privileged to serve on the  Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee and the full committee.</p><p>We passed a robust bill for wall funding last week.  We've actually passed  all 12 appropriations bills in our committee.  So things are looking good  on the House Republicans side.</p><p>I think unfortunately, Democrats are impeding this wall process which is  going to happen.  The wall needs to be built.  It's got to be built.  I  think the President's correct.</p><p>We're doing our job as House Republicans.  The Democrats need to step up  and do the right thing and support increased funding, not only for the  border wall but all border security.  </p><p>CARTER:  Congressman, this is Lee Carter.  I am really curious -- I mean we  need to get Democrats on board with this.  Are there any Democrats right  now that you can engage in conversation who are willing to make some kind  of compromise?</p><p>We just see gridlock.  We just see the message of resist.  And it's  frustrating.  I want to know, who is willing to come to the table?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  You never know with the Democratic Party.  It changes week to  week but early on in the process, if you recall earlier this year even some  of the more liberal Democrats were willing to talk about wall funding in  exchange for other forms of immigration reforms.  So I think there is  always an open dialogue.</p><p>Let's face it.  It's an election year.  The Democrats don't have much to  run on.  Things are going so well in the country.  The President and Vice  President are doing a great job.  House Republicans are doing a great job.</p><p>So they don't have much to run on except their rhetoric and they go back to  their broken rhetoric time and time again.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Congressman -- Adam Shapiro here.  And I'm listening to what  you're saying.  And correct me if I'm wrong, but why do you need the  Democrats?  You have the majority in the House.  Or is there problems  within the Republican caucus that there are those who might not be quite as  willing to pass all of the appropriation bills the House has considered?  </p><p>Over time, you're right -- we have had some problems within our own  conference getting appropriations bills passed.  I don't think that's going  to be the problem now.  I would look to the senate if you're going to see  real problems.  We need 60 votes in the senate.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Right.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  That has been a constant problem.  Democrats have  filibustered this administration time and time again.  But when you look at  the basics, everything is going so well with the economy, unemployment low,  consumer confidence high.  And the Democrats really have nowhere to go  except back to their broken rhetoric.</p><p>Border security is something that the American people want and demand.  The  wall is a big part of that.  I think we need to have it.</p><p>CASONE:  It's one of the main reasons that Trump was elected back in 2016.  </p><p>I want to switch gears to the economy.  GDP grew by 4.1 percent for the  second quarter -- that's the fastest pace in nearly four years.  As we  heard earlier, you know, the Vice President did weigh in on the White  House's agenda to rev up America's economy on Friday.  Listen.  .</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE:  Couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who has been  working every day to keep the promise he made to the American people -- to  roll back red tape, to cut taxes, unleash American energy.  And I think  this 4.1 percent quarter and a year that's on track for more than 3 percent  growth is a testament to the President's leadership and his vision for this  economy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Congressman -- your take on that?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, I think the Vice President is spot-on.  He's correct.   I give very high marks to the administration for the way that they have  worked with us.</p><p>But let's also give high marks to Republicans in Congress.  The midterm  elections are coming up.  It's very important.  What did we say for years?   If you reduce taxes, if you reduce regulation, if you empower entrepreneurs  in America, the economy is going to respond.</p><p>And wow, has it responded.  It's incredible -- a 4.1 growth quarter,  unemployment down, this is great.</p><p>And what do we see all this weekend?  We saw people actually come out on  the other side trying to say well, is this an aberration, is it going to be  enough.</p><p>My gosh, whether you've got two or four percent growth you've got growth,  you've got optimism.  I served for the majority of my time in Congress  sadly under an administration -- the prior administration that really was  in the doldrums economically.  Things were down.  Things are dismal.   Things are up right now in America and moving in the right direction.  </p><p>CASONE:  So do you think so that we've had forecasts, whether it's from the  Treasury Secretary, the Vice President talked about it.  Do you think it's  realistic to say that we're going to see 3, 4, 5 percent economic growth  over the next couple of years, not just the midterms but again to the next  presidential election?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Well, working on things that we can control, obviously you've  got regulations being lowered, that's good.  You've had major tax reform at  the corporate side, on the individual side.  All of the basics, we have  energy growth, we've got an abundance of fossil fuel reserves now, not only  gas but oil in America.  The basics are very good.  </p><p>If the American government can get out of the way and we're doing a good  job of this, and let the American economy grow, I think we could have  unprecedented growth.  </p><p>CASONE:  Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.  Congressman, it's good to have you  here on this Monday.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  It's a pleasure.  </p><p>CASONE:  All right.

The tech giant in everybody's sights after last week  disappointing reports from yes, Facebook and Twitter.  As you can see,  right now, those are the stocks in the premarket.  Apple pointing  (INAUDIBLE) slightly on the upside.  Facebook is one of those little  depression there on this Monday.  </p><p>Major markets all in the red on Friday, a lot of that was of course, the  tech story, the NASDAQ down -- well, in the premarket right now the NASDAQ  is actually down by 21 points, the S&amp;P is down.  There's the close from  Friday.  Look at the NASDAQ, you see that loss of almost 1.5 percent,  that's the technology story.  Dow lost 76 on Friday.  The S&amp;P lost 18.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at Europe, as you can see here, the pressure on the  tech story kind of continued.  FTSE just coming into the green actually,  just a little more than six points, CAC 40 and the DAX are still in the  red.  </p><p>And take a look at Asia.

You don't want to miss our never before seen look  inside the vice president's office in the White House where he shares his  father's bronze star.  </p><p>All right, security insecurity, the TSA has reportedly been using computers  to track information on U.S. citizens, even if they're not suspected of  terrorism, details ahead on that.  </p><p>And, from flipping burgers to flipping coins.

Because guess what?   It's national cheesecake day.  It's a great day, everybody.  We're going --  we're going to find out where you can score some deals during this  incredible celebration in just a bit.  </p><p>And now to (INAUDIBLE).  Now to our top story this half hour, major  meeting, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh set to meet with West  Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin latertoday.  Manchin expected to be  a pivotal vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation this fall.  Here now, Fox News  senior judicial analyst Judge Napolitano.  Last week, that Manchin wants  out of this one.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Votes from in  his very difficult contest with the attorney -- with the Republican  attorney general of West Virginia, a Jersey guy, who moved south because  it's a very tight race.  Look, this is the intersection of the judiciary  and politics when senators can decide that it's in their best interest,  their interest in keeping their job, to vote against what the majority of  their party wants.  I wouldn't be surprised if Joe Manchin along with two  or three other Democrats running for re-election, tough races in states  that President Trump carried by heavy margins vote for Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p>I also think that Judge Kavanaugh does not need a single Democratic vote  because I think all the Republicans will vote for him.  John McCain not  voting and that will give them the 51 votes that they need.  If that  happens, you know this better than I do.  It's easy and comfortable for  Manchin and the others to vote for him.  It lets them score points at home  and they weren't the tipping point.  </p><p>Now, if Rand Paul and Mike Lee and some of the libertarians pull away from  Brett Kavanaugh -- excuse me, then Mitch McConnell must have those  Democrats, otherwise the nomination loses.  But I don't see that happening.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes, I'm just really curious what you think that they might  uncover in this that might cause concern about this justice.  Is there  anything?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, there are Republicans, I among them, who object to Judge  Kavanaugh's views on the fourth amendment.  I have characterized Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination at the exact opposite of the type of person  President Trump nominated in Neil Gorsuch and said he would nominate.  </p><p>This judge is from the heart and soul of the Washington establishment.  His  entire life with the exception of his seven years at Yale, we'll grant him  those seven years at Yale, you wore Yale blue today, by the way. </p><p>CARTER:  Not on purpose.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Has been spent as part of that Washington establishment.  The  particular sticking point with Senator Paul and Senator Lee and those of us  that believe the constitution means what it says is the fourth amendment.   Because Judge Kavanaugh has written that intelligence is not covered by the  fourth amendment, meaning the NSA can spy all that likes the fourth  amendment only regulates law enforcement.  That is not so and with the  exception of his opinion, there's no -- there's no opinion holding that.  </p><p>CASONE:  So, there's a lot of confidence about this -- about Kavanaugh's  confirmation.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  And Maria spoke with the vice president, obviously.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think the vice president is correct, I don't their even --  as I've said, they're not going to need Democratic votes.  </p><p>CASONE:  Listen to what -- listen to what he told her about the nomination.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE:  For the president of the United States in this deliberation, he was  looking for a judge with extraordinary credentials and intellect, but also  a judge who would strictly interpret the constitution as it and not  legislate from the bench.  Judge Brett Kavanaugh has that judicial  philosophy.  </p><p>And we remain confident that before the fall is out that Judge Brett  Kavanaugh will be Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think he's correct and that he will be on the bench before  the first Monday in October which is when the new Supreme Court session  begins.  I just don't think that Chuck Schumer has the -- let's say, this  cover something as background none of us knows about that it's just  disabling.  I don't think Chuck Schumer has the muscle.  </p><p>CASONE:  Erin, what does that mean for the midterms though?  That's going  to be right for the midterms.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well, I mean, I actually have a question for you about the  midterms, actually.  Well, what do you think is going to happen coming down  the pike, what cases -- you're really worried about this fourth amendment  issue, what cases do you see that they could hear as the next Supreme  Court?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, not before the midterm but they will eventually be  hearing.  I'm holding up my iPhone, whether or not the computer chip in  this iPhone is protected by the fourth amendment, whether the government  needs a warrant in order to get into or get access to this iPhone.  The  cases are all over the place. </p><p>Now, I once asked Justice Scalia about this.  And he said to me, you know,  I don't think I should answer.  Because I know that case -- I asked him  this in front of an audience -- that case is making its way to the Supreme  Court.  </p><p>CASONE:  Wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That will probably make its way to the Supreme Court assuming  he's confirmed in the next two months in his first year on the bench.  </p><p>CASONE:  I have to ask you about my lady Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  All right,  she is now saying that she's got five more years on the bench, that's  according to CNN.  What do you make about that?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I mean, she once said if Donald Trump was elected  president she would move to Canada.  (INAUDIBLE) her leaving voluntarily.   And I don't know where the number five came from.  She is really up there  in years, the oldest justice we ever had was Oliver Wendell Holmes that  went on at 63 and retired at 93.  So she still has a little ways to go.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  She's 85.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She's only -- she's only 85.  </p><p>ELMORE:  I think all the wine is keeping her young.  </p><p>CASONE:  Her new movie career I think is what's keeping her young.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right and the calisthenics.  </p><p>ELMORE:  She does calisthenics in her office.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I've seen her lifting weights, she does exercises every day.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>ELMORE:  Wine and exercise.  </p><p>CASONE:  There you go, wine and exercise.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Not a bad combination.</p><p>CASONE:  No, not at all.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Even at 7:45 in the morning.  </p><p>CARTER:  At least I have one of the two down.  </p><p>CASONE:  And there's food on the show as well.  So, standby for that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Where's that cheesecake?</p><p>CASONE:  I know, here's the cheesecake?   Judge, thank you so much.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p>CASONE:  Good to have you here.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure.</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Coming up, the undercover officers working to keep the  skies safe are surveilling ordinary Americans without a warrant.  Yes, the  controversy over the secret TSA program ahead.  </p><p>Plus, we just mentioned it.  Say cheesecake, how you can celebrate National  Cheesecake Day with some sweet deals, that's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, a TSA surveillance program under fire for tracking U.S.  citizens.  Susan Li has the details, Susan.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, well get this, Cheryl.  The TSA program called Quiet Skies  secretly follows Americans who may not have done anything wrong.   Undercover air marshals watch what thousands of U.S. citizens do in the  airport, who they talk to and even if they need to use the bathroom.  The  TSA says the Quiet Skies program which has been in use since 2010 is just  another way to keep passengers safe.  </p><p>American Express reportedly raising currency conversion rates for business  clients without notifying them.  The Wall Street Journal reporting that the  practice has been going on since at least 2004 to early this year in an  attempt to try to boost revenue and employee commissions.  The practice  mainly targeted small and mid-size businesses.  Now shares of American  Express they're up five percent so far this year.  </p><p>McDonald's is rolling out special coins for a golden anniversary.  The Big  Mac is turning 50 and McDonald's will be giving customers who buy Big Macs  a MacCoin to commemorate the occasion.  The MacCoin redeemable for one free  Big Mac through the rest of this year.  The release starts Thursday.   Because it would have been the inventor of the Big Mac's 100th birthday.   Shares of McDonald's are down though, more than eight percent so far this  year.  </p><p>And today, will you tell me Cheryl, what is today?  </p><p>CASONE:  It is National Cheesecake Day, the best day ever.  </p><p>LI:  Always, The Cheesecake Factory has a deal for favorite holiday.  You  can dine at a Cheesecake Factory and enjoy any slice for half price.  So,  The Cheesecake Factory also marking the occasion by debuting two new  flavors, Cinnabon Cinnamon Swirled Cheesecake.</p><p>CASONE:  My God.</p><p>LI:  So good.  Very Cherry Ghirardelli Chocolate Cheesecake.  And for every  Very Cherry Cheesecake sold through February, The Cheesecake Factory is  donating $00.25 to feeding America.  Shares of Cheesecake Factory are up 23  percent so far this year.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  That was incredible. CASONE:  Forks are ready, people.  We have forks ready to roll.  There's --  everybody will be eating something this morning.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  This is the Cinnabon one?  </p><p>CARTER:  Ghirardelli.  </p><p>CASONE:  This is the Cinabbon one, right Susan?</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>ELMORE:  Wow, chocolate cherry.  Good grief.</p><p>CASONE:  You have to eat too, Susan.  It's kind of a roll.  We didn't get  you a fork.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  It's really good.  </p><p>ELMORE:  Really, really good.  I need to buy that one.</p><p>LI:  I'll be stressed afterwards though.  My God.</p><p>CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Add to the point (INAUDIBLE) regret.</p><p>CASONE:  That's really good.  </p><p>CARTER:  That is so good.  </p><p>ELMORE:  I'm surprised how good that is.  </p><p>LI:  Cinnabon, I mean cinnabon is good alone.</p><p>ELMORE:  Very cherry.  It's delicious.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  (INAUDIBLE) it's healthy, it's got cherries.  I don't want to --</p><p>ELMORE:  I know.</p><p>CASONE:  I like that they're giving money back to charity.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Isn't that amazing.</p><p>CASONE:  That's actually cool too.  Not just some promotion, it's just like  -- just, you now, eat.  But I like the fact that --</p><p>LI:  Eat, enjoy the calories.  You got to live a little.  It is Monday.</p><p>CASONE:  We're not try -- you know, we're not trying to deprive you of food  on the morning show.  </p><p>LI:  No.  I just can't find --</p><p>CASONE:  We need a fork.</p><p>LI:  We need to find one.</p><p>ELMORE:  There's one that fell on the floor.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  The five second rule has passed.  </p><p>CASONE:  We won't do that to you.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  That really is incredible.</p><p>CASONE:  As the girl on Maria's show, (INAUDIBLE) does the food segments.   Nice job.</p><p>LI:  Thank you.  </p><p>CASONE:  Very good job this morning.  Susan Li.</p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>CASONE:  All right, thank you.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Do we get Del Frisco's steak day, by any chance?  I'm just  saying.</p><p>CASONE:  Where's the burgers, by the way?  </p><p>CARTER:  I want to know where the Big Macs are.  </p><p>LI:  MacCoins.  Yes, you get to redeem them through the rest of this year.   And you get a MacCoin for every Mac you eat, so that's like double the  calories every time you walk in, right?  Commemorate the 50th anniversary  of the Big Mac.  </p><p>CASONE:  You can't argue with the power of the Big Mac.  </p><p>LI:  You cannot.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, all right.  Susan Li.  Nice job, thank you very much.</p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>CASONE:  All right, we're going to get you a fork in the commercial break.  </p><p>Coming up, Apple coming out with earnings after the bell.  That's going to  be tomorrow.  Falling Facebook's meltdown last week.  We've got your  preview, coming up after a quick break and some fork retrieval.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CASONE:  All right, five Dow companies including Apple.  Are going to be  reporting earnings this week.  Nicole Petallides reporting at New York  Stock Exchange.  You're going to have a busy week, Nicole.  </p><p>NICOLE  PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, I'm ready for it and  I'm loving it.  So, so far, let's talk about what we're seeing this  morning.  Of course, we heard from Caterpillar.  So, the five that we're  going to be hearing from, we have Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble, Apple,  DowDupont.  </p><p>Here's a look also at Caterpillar's this morning.  You can see that 3.1  percent this morning, beating and boosting.  Here it is boosting the  numbers, earnings per share -- going forward.  So, that gives it that pop.   Thanks to Charlie (INAUDIBLE), senior editor noting this to add 37 Dow  points this morning.  </p><p>Also, the company saying that the imposed tariffs are expected to impact  materially in the cost of about a 100-200 million in the second half, so  we'll watch for that to add up.  So, still talking about tariffs  ultimately.  </p><p>And then we get to Apple, of course we're waiting for two 18 and 52.3 on to  say for Apple.  </p><p>And overall these fan stocks, of course, Facebook, squash I'll leave  Twitter out for a moment.  Goldman Sachs basically saying the (INAUDIBLE)  who made the note a breath.  </p><p>And the -- and the big outsized appetite for this particular group,  Facebook, Netflix.  In fact, he was saying that the negative breathe has  been masked by the outside appetite.  And you know what happened?  He uses  past to give you an education what happens to the future.  In the past,  sharp declines in breathe has signaled below average one, three, six month  returns.  So that is for the S&amp;P 500 as well as the larger than average  downturn. </p><p>So what's interesting is that this group may not be as hot.  And the other  thing that I've been hearing, the other theme I've been hearing is the  disconnect between the Facebooks, the Twitter and the Netflix and putting  aside the real deal things, such as Amazon, Google, things that have  products, services and we'll watch for Apple which will be so key.  And I  talked to analysts on Facebook, Apple, we're waiting for a few more  products on Apple as well.  Back to you.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Nicole.  I'm glad you ended up with Apple there on your  report.  Because Adam, that's what I can't wait to see as when they talk  about when it comes to China.  That's what I'm going to be listening --</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Sales in China and the impact of the trade disputes with China.   But what's really interesting, when you look at the S&amp;P 500, we have 72  percent of those who reported already as has been pointed out have beat on  revenue and on earnings per share 82 percent are beating on earnings.  So,  a lot of people think this is so much a stronger market perhaps than we'd  like to give it credit.  </p><p>CASONE:  No, you're right.  72 percent have beaten revenue estimates in  particular.  So, we've had really good numbers.  So, this is the American  consumer, this is the economy.  Are people still buying iPhones.  So, you  know, Facebook and Twitter aside with privacy issues and whatever else.   And overall, businesses are pretty much telling us a good story right now.  </p><p>CARTER:  They are telling a really good story.  And I think we had a guest  earlier who was talking about let's look at Apple not just for the phones,  let's look at the cloud service they're offering and all these other things  that are trying to get into television, music.  Not that they're trying to  get into, but they are in.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  They're there.  </p><p>CASONE:  They're everywhere.  </p><p>CARTER:  I think it's going to be interesting to see what they have to say.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, and then of course there's Tesla.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  You just love beating up on Tesla, don't you?</p><p>CASONE:  Did you -- there was a New York posted articles about a week ago,  that said Elon Musk is a fraud.  I mean, he -- either he's a genius or he's  a fraud.  We don't know which one it is yet.  So --</p><p>SHAPIRO:  He's a genius.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, you say genius.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  SpaceX, Tesla, he's brought all of this.  Even though the  companies might not be performing the way we would like.  He's brought them  into creation.  There are cars rolling that are called Tesla.  He did that.</p><p>CASONE:  That's true.</p><p>CARTER:  He's somebody who's super comfortable with risk.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Well, but when you're publicly traded company and you're --  you just laid off nine percent of your workforce, which didn't help your  stock, how much risk you're going to take.  I can't wait for Tesla.  I'm so  excited.</p><p>All right.

He's been working every day to keep  the promise he made to the American people, to rollback red tape, cut  taxes, unleash American energy.  And I think this 4.1 percent quarter and a  year that's on track for more than three percent growth is a testament to  the President's leadership and vision for this economy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Part two of Maria's exclusive in-depth interview with Vice  President Mike Pence straight ahead.

Marie posed with Vice President Mike  Pence.  But we continue the exclusive interview with the ongoing war of  words between President Trump and his critics in the press. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I'm going to ask you about  access to you and the President in this White House.  Was it necessary to  throw out Kaitlan Collins from CNN the other day?  What happened?  </p><p>PENCE:  Well, let me say that this administration believes in the freedom  of the press.  And President Trump and the entire administration have  provided extraordinary access to the media.  The President answers so many  questions and so many different settings, and I can assure you that we will  continue to do that.  But maintaining the decorum that is due at the White  House I think an issue, that we will continue to work for.</p><p>But I'm very confident that whether it would be with that network or any  network or any members of the media that we will continue to work in a way  that ensures the access of the American people to this administration and  to all the incredible progress we're making.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Discuss on this day she was the pool reporter, so she was  actually representing all of us.  I mean, did you feel like kicking her out  kicked out everybody?  </p><p>PENCE:  Well, I would leave that decision to the White House staff and I  just remain very confident.  Look, the relationship between any White House  and any press corps is always -- you know, is always healthy and robust,  and occasionally represents disagreements.  I'm confident that they will be  able to work out this relationship in a positive way.  We'll make sure that  every network, every major news organization continues to have access.</p><p>Because we stand for the freedom of the press in this White House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Vice President, the stakes are high going in to the midterm  elections.  You've been traveling a lot, I know that.  Tell us what your  priorities are going into the midterms.  </p><p>PENCE:  Our priorities to make sure that we not only reelect but that we  expand Republican majorities on Capitol Hill.  You know, as I mentioned  before, Maria, our administration has faced unprecedented obstruction by  the Democrats in Washington, D.C.  It's amazing to think in a week that  this economy grew by more than four percent which was a national goal the  President articulated during the campaign in the fall of 2015.</p><p>And we're on track for three percent growth.  Now one single Democrat in  Congress voted for those historic tax cuts.  The President's efforts to  roll back red tape unleash American energy, have met with incredible  obstruction.  And this administration we have literally faced four times  more filibusters in our first two years than any of the last  administrations going all the way back to Jimmy Carter.</p><p>So what the President and I believe and we're traveling across the country  is that we need to communicate that we need to re-elect our Republican  majorities but we need to have more Republicans in the House and Senate.   As the American people see what the President is doing as they're  enthusiastic about the President's commitment to economic growth to a  stronger military, to America standing tall in the world again and fighting  for American jobs.</p><p>Those same Americans should know that we've only been able to do that  because of partners on Capitol Hill.  Will only be able to continue to  build in the momentum in this economy with more partners and so we're going  to fight to re-elect and expand these Republican majorities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know one of the priority is to get Brett Kavanaugh confirmed.  </p><p>PENCE:  Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a man of integrity.  And he is a judge  with an extraordinary record of service on the Court of Appeals.  Literally  one of the most distinguished legal minds in the country with a proven  record of support for limited government for a second amendment, for  religious liberty.  And what I would say to every member of the Senate is  that Judge Brett Kavanaugh deserves a fair hearing.</p><p>And deserves their support to be confirmed as the next justice of the  Supreme Court of the United States.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The left is trying to make this about abortion.  Is it about  abortion for you?  </p><p>PENCE:  For the President of the United States, in this deliberation he was  looking for a judge of with extraordinary credentials and intellect, but  also a judge who would strictly interpret the constitution as written and  not legislate from the bench.  Judge Brett Kavanaugh has that judicial  philosophy.  He's a proven record.  That's what the President made this  nomination about, that's the message we'll carry to Republicans and  Democrats in the Senate.</p><p>And we remain confident that before the fall is out, Judge Brett Kavanaugh  will be Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to be meeting next week with the families of the  remains that are being sent from North Korea.  A lot of people are very  emotional about this.  Why are you going to meet with their families? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maria, President Trump has asked me to do many things on his  behalf as Vice President but frankly I've never been more humbled or more  honored to be asked to represent him as the remains of American heroes from  the Korean War arrive back on American soil.  My dad was in the U.S. Army.   He fought in combat in the Korean War.  He fought on Pork Chop Hill and  some of the legendary battles that took place there.</p><p>He came home with a medal on his chest but my dad is gone now 30 years,  raised us to understand that he always thought the heroes of Korean War  were the ones that didn't get to come home.  And the fact that this  President sitting down with Kim Jong-un to negotiate the denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula also had our fallen heroes on his heart should tell  you everything you need to know about President Donald Trump.</p><p>And my wife and I are deeply moved and deeply honored to be able to be  there when we bring our boys home.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good luck with that and I know that America is watching and  with just as much emotion.  Final question Mr. Vice President.  You and the  President have spoken about large sanctions against Turkey, a NATO ally,  you've threatened to impose large sanctions if the country does not release  the American pastor who's currently under house arrest.  And here's the  tweet.</p><p>The United States will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long-time  detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson, a great Christian, family man and  wonderful human being tweeted the President.  You're going to go the whole  way with this?  You're going to put sanctions if he is not released?</p><p>PENCE:  Pastor Andrew Brunson is an innocent man.  He is a man of profound  Christian faith who is ministered in Turkey for more than 20 years.  He was  swept up in arrests that followed the coup attempt in 2016.  There is no  credible evidence of any wrongdoing against him,  Pastor Brunson was  actually held for nearly a year without ever being charged and for the last  several years he literally has been in the Turkish prison.</p><p>From early in this administration, President Trump and I have engaged  President Erdogan engaged and the Turkish government directly to release  Pastor Andrew Brunson and send him home.  Those negotiations have been  ongoing and they have been continuous.  Now, we welcome the news this week,  the Turkey made the decision to transfer Pastor to home arrest to his  apartment in Turkey.</p><p>And actually I spoke to Pastor Brunson and his wife shortly after they  arrived.  But he wants to come home and Pastor Andrew Brunson should be  freed and should be allowed to return to his family, to his home, to his  church and his nation in the United States of America.  I mean, the truth  is, as I said earlier this week, the President has made clear, Pastor  Andrew Brunson to home arrest is just not good enough.</p><p>And the United States of America is prepared to bring sanctions against  Turkey, until Pastor Andrew Brunson is freed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you gotten a response from Turkey yet?  </p><p>PENCE:  We have heard from certain officials in Turkey but we made it very  clear and we will continue to that this innocent man of faith should be  released and allowed to return to the United States of America and  President Trump and I are going to continue to take a strong stand and are  prepared to bring sanctions against Turkey until Pastor Andrew Brunson is  freed.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>CASONE:  And stay tuned later this hour, we're going to bring you more of  Maria's exclusive interview with Vice President Pence including a never  before seen look inside the Vice President's office in the White House.  </p><p>All right.

Fox News Correspondent Lauren Blanchard  is live in Redding, California where the sun hasn't even come up yet.   Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN BLANCHARD, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Good morning, Lauren.  And  we are in front of what is less of a home here in Redding and there are  many other homes like this in this area, this neighborhood, completely  reduced to ashes.  Now, in all, the Carr Fire in Sashta County has  destroyed more than 650 homes burning nearly 100,000 acres.  They say this  fire is uniquely tough to stop because it is being fueled by winds and dry  brush.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With the intensity that we have here, it's really hard  to stop the fast-moving wind-driven fire.</p><p>ROGER MOORE, REDDING POLICE CHIEF:  This fire is scary to us.  This is  something we haven't seen before in the city.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BLANCHARD:  The Carr Fire has killed four civilians and two firefighters.   A woman and her two young great grandchildren killed when the fire quickly  spread to their home.  Plus, another person discovered Sunday.  And the  Carr Fire is just one of nearly 20 fires burning in California, another  freighter killed Sunday battling the Ferguson Fire in Yosemite National  Park.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This fire is -- has no mercy.  This is everywhere.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I've got a few friends' houses are already -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BLANCHARD:  However, at least some good news for 3300 firefighters working  on the Carr Fire.  The blaze slowed down Sunday.  And fire officials say  they have been able to contain 17 percent of the fire that's up from only  five percent Sunday morning.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRET GOUVEA, CAL FIRE DEPUTY CHIEF:  We are starting to gain some ground  rather than being in the defensive mode on this fire, all the time --  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD:  In all about 200,000 acres in California are burning on the  ground there are 12,000 firefighters from all over the state trying to tamp  down these blazes and they say they are bringing in more than 100 fire  trucks from all over the country, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Hopefully today they can get a better handle on it.  It's just  been devastating this weekend.  Lauren Blanchard.  Lauren, thank you very  much for the update.  </p><p>Well, coming up.  Honoring America's heroes.  Maria Bartiromo speaks  exclusively with Vice President Mike Pence about his father receiving the  bronze star and his dads service in the Korean War.  That's ahead.

How Harley-Davidson has shaken up  its product line with a new electric motorcycle, that's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CASONE:  President Trump campaigned on getting America's economy back on  track.  And with the second quarter GDP reading of 4.1 percent, looks like  we're well on our way.  Former Presidential candidate Herman Cain joins us  now.  Herman, good morning.</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  All right.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes, we are.  </p><p>CASONE:  I want to get your reaction to what the President -- Vice  President said to Maria about America's economic growth.  Listen to what he  said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PENCE:  The reality is in the last two administrations, the economy grew by  less than two percent.  And in the first 18 months of this administration,  we were little shy of three percent last year, we're on track to be at  three percent or better this year.  Seeing the second quarter 4.1 percent  growth, exports growing dramatically.  That added to the reality of 3.7  million new jobs created since Election Day 2016.</p><p>I just -- I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a President who has  been working every day to keep the promise he made to the American people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  What do you make about his point that this President has got an  economy that's booming and his two predecessors did not have these kind of  GDP numbers?  </p><p>CAIN:  I think Vice President Pence was spot-on and I happen to believe  that he also right and the reason that the two previous administrations  weren't able to achieve more than a two percent GDP growths rate is because  the fundamentals based on their policies were not in place.  For example, I  heard Vice President Pence say as part of this interview that I happened to  catch earlier that business investments are way up.</p><p>And when business investments are way up, they are expanding and they  hiring people and so the unemployment is what I call low-low.  Whenever you  get to four percent unemployment, it's not just low, it is low-low.  So  when you look at the fundamentals and you look at the trade deals that are  being renegotiated, I happen to agree with the President and Vice President  Pence 100 percent.  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, I'm always curious, because there are a lot of folks out  there who will argue how can you possibly support this President when he  behaves the way he does on Twitter when he made the mistake that he did in  Helsinki when we've got children being separated from their parents, how  can you still support the President?  And yet his support continues to grow  and people look at the promises that he made on tax reform.</p><p>They look at it on trade, they look at it immigration, they look at jobs.   He said he was going to be tough on China and he's doing all those things  and they say it's worth the trade-off.  How do you talk to people about how  you can separate those two things?  </p><p>CAIN:  The difference between supporting Donald Trump, the man and Donald  Trump, his agenda.  And when I travel, people talk about the results, they  talk about the agenda, they don't talk about all of this noise out there  that it's put in place to try to distract people from the real results.   Now, Democrats want to focus on the noise because they have nothing else to  focus on.  </p><p>CASONE:  Right.  It's true.</p><p>CAIN:  There is an old saying.</p><p>CASONE:  You're right.</p><p>CAIN:  When you are in a hole, stop digging.  The Democrats are in a hole  and they won't stop digging.  So, people are not getting consumed by all of  the noise.  That's what I believe.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's the low-low.  I love it.  And I want to ask about what's  going to happen today with the President, he's going to be meeting with  Italian Prime Minister.  Now, Italy's government wants to slap down a trade  deal that they just negotiated by the E.U. between E.U. and Canada.  What  do you make of that?</p><p>The Italians are saying, this is a bad deal and they're taking their  country back. </p><p>CAIN:  They are taking the lead of President Donald J. Trump.  Remember all  of the outcry when he said he was going to challenge the E.U., he was going  to challenge the NAFTA and people's heads exploded thinking that if we are  going to come off all about international trade?  No.  It brought people to  the table.</p><p>And we are seeing some result in the negotiation face so far.  So what  Italy have said, well, if United States can do what's best for the  United  States maybe we ought to stand up and challenge the E.U. and do what's best  for our -- for Italy especially our small farmers.  That's what I see  happening.  President Trump is showing international leadership,  international courage and it's spreading to other countries.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Make Italy great again.  Herman Cain.  Herman, thank you so  much for being here this morning.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>CAIN:  It's always a pleasure.  Thank you.  </p><p>CASONE:  Good to see you.  All right.  Well, coming up.  Maria Bartiromo  speaking exclusively with Vice President Pence.  And we've got a never- before-seen look inside the Vice President's White House office.

Right  now, all of those stocks, though, in the premarket are slightly higher.  </p><p>All right.  Let's take a look for it if we can at what's happening in your  premarket, and of course, what's happening over in Europe.  First, the U.S.   futures, everything is now in the green, and that's a little bit of an  improvement what we've seen over the last hour.  Dow pointing to the  premarket, S&amp;P up a half point; NASDAQ up 2-1/2.</p><p>Now, in Europe, a little bit of a different story.  It's been a mixed bag,  though, for most sessions so far.  The FTSE is slightly higher.  CAC  Quarante and DAX are actually in the red.  And all the Asian markets  actually finished lower.  Japan's Nikkei, the biggest hit losing about  three-quarters of a percent there.  </p><p>Well, President Trump thanking North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un for  returning the remains of missing U.S.  soldiers from the Korean War.

Topping our news this half-hour: President Donald Trump  threatening a government shutdown, if Congress does not find money for the  border wall and make world changes to the immigration laws.  Blake Burman  live at the White House with the details.  Blake, good morning.  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Cheryl, good morning to you.  You might remember earlier this summer, it  was the president himself who suggested to Republicans that they wait until  after the November election to tackle immigration.  Well, now, it appears  as if the president has a new summertime demand himself because this is a  tweet that he fired off over the weekend, writing: \"I would be willing to  shut down government, if the Democrats do not give us the votes for border  security, which includes the wall.  Must get rid of lottery, catch-and- release, et cetera, and finally go to system of immigration based on merit.   We need great people coming into our country.\"  The Republican Senator Ron  Johnson immediately after that tweet was sent off, sounded leery. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN:  I certainly don't like playing shut down  politics.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And how damaging would that be for Republicans ahead  of the November races?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  I don't think it'd be helpful, so let's try and avoid it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  The Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters described it as nothing  more than a scare tactic.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA:  This president is a bully, and he'll  try and intimidate all of us.  He's not going to shut down anything.  He's  not going to shut down the government, and we're not going to be  intimidated by his bluffing and his bullying.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Now, any immigration measure would need Democrat support.  Before  that tweet was sent over the weekend, the Vice President Mike expressed to  Maria his frustration of Democrats not getting behind the president's  agenda.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PENCE:  It is amazing to think just as an aside Maria, that, that in the  last year and a half, our administration has faced more filibusters called  by Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate, by a factor of four times  more than any administration going all the way back to the Carter  administration.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  All right, Cheryl.  So, when you look at the calendar to see how  all this might play out, September 30th is the deadline for a new spending  bill -- just 60 days from today.  And after that, five weeks after that,  comes the November election, of how all of that might fit into you puzzle.   Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  And a Supreme Court nomination as well.  Blake Burman --</p><p>BURMAN:  And whatever else comes between now and then, too, right?  </p><p>CASONE:  No kidding.  Blake Burman live at the White House.  Blake, thank  you very much.  Well, let's switch gears now.  Maria Bartiromo is taking us  inside the White House for a behind closed doors look at Vice President  Mike Pence's West Wing office, where he continues to help carry out  President Trump's agenda.  Let's watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PENCE:  In the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, gosh, that is gorgeous.</p><p>PENCE:  And this is my wall (INAUDIBLE), because this is my first time --  and these are two of my favorite -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Beautiful.  And you said you have your father's bronze star  here.  </p><p>PENCE:  I do.  This is, actually, my dad receiving the bronze star.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, wow!  Beautiful.  </p><p>PENCE:  And this is the medal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can understand why it's so important for you to go and meet  with those families.  </p><p>PENCE:  Well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you to your father for serving our country.  I know he is  gone -- </p><p>PENCE:  Well, he's gone 30 years but he's still in our hearts every day,  and I know he was incredibly proud of his service and the Korean War.  And  when Karen and I made our first trip to the region, I was so deeply moved  because as we traveled around South Korea, there were signs with my  father's name on them; posters that been put up saying: \"Tell your father,  Edward Pence thank you for your service.\"  So, the name will be there, and  -- be a part of a homecoming for those heroes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even though, a long time ago, it will be closure for some  people, right?  </p><p>PENCE:  There's no question.  My father, had he lived would be in just in  his late 80s now, and he's U.S. Army infantry combat veteran.  And I know  this is going to be meaningful to other Korean War veterans, it's going to  be meaningful to every veteran, and frankly, every family, who, I think,  sees President Trump's heart in this moment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did Kim Jong-un agree to it?  </p><p>PENCE:  Because President Trump asked him.  And that is -- it's so moving  to me, to serve alongside a president while he is negotiating an issue as  significant as denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, where he's taken  such a strong stand for America's security.  That at the same time, he had  our fallen heroes on his heart, and he's secured a commitment in Hawaii  next week.  We'll see North Korea begin to follow through on the promise  that they made to President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  It will be an emotional week for you.  Thank you.  </p><p>PENCE:  Great.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>PENCE:  Thanks.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASONE:  What a great tour of his office with Maria.  Lee, let me ask you,  what was your biggest takeaway this morning from the interview that we've  been playing.  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, I think there's a few things.  One, when you look at  this man, he is such a balance to our president -- where he is very calm.   The president is really, you know, I don't know, what bombastic.  He's just  -- they're just totally opposite but complementary to each other.  So, you  look at this and you think, you feel reassured.  I also feel that the way  he talked about the president's agend, the policy, you can really see that  he supports the economic growth, the jobs; why they're doing the things  they are doing?  </p><p>And I think that you can see that you can separate the man -- I think, you  know, Herman Cain said this earlier: \"You can separate the man from  agenda.\"  And that's what the vice president does so well.  It really  points out what they're accomplishing: The jobs, the economy, what they're  doing on trade.  It really goes are great inside, but to how he thinks and  that balance is working out there.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's interesting.  Erin?  </p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I just see when I watch him, his  authenticity.  And you can see someone who truly cares about our country  and honestly making it great again.  He's so proud of the president's  agenda.  He's proud that, you know, unemployment is low, and things are  going well in terms of we're working on NAFTA.  He touched on all of those  things, that Donald Trump was pushing in 2016, and now that are coming to  fruition.  And just to see him talk about those, you can see his -- just  sincerity and how proud he is to be an American to be doing this civil  service job.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, he does seem to -- and I love his faith.  I love how much his  faith drives him in his life, and his wife as well.</p><p>CARTER:  His family.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  The thing that I'm ruminating over here, though, is the  president's threat of a shutdown on immigration, and on the spending bill.   And we saw the Republican who, on the Sunday talk shows said, this is not  the fight to pick in the fall in September.  What I keep thinking is:  Republicans have the majority in the House, so they don't need Democrats.   You need the 60 votes in the Senate, however, you know the president has  been calling to get rid of the filibuster, Mitch McConnell has said he  doesn't want to go there, but is something going on president now  threatening, you know, let's bring on shutdown if we don't get what we  want.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, he wants the border -- I mean, not only the president who  wants that wall.  I mean, he campaigned on wall; immigration is a major  issue in this country no matter what side of the aisle and you have to  admit --</p><p>SHAPIRO:  But his own party has voted against in the House.  There are  Republicans who have voted -- yes, the constituents, and the men and women  who represent all of us to Congress.  But there are Republicans have given  the president obstacles.  You know, I am thinking of Floyd we don't need no  education, we don't need no though control.  It's just another brick in the  wall.  There are Republicans who are putting up obstacle, not just  Democrats.  </p><p>CASONE:  And I grew up in two Border States: Texas and Arizona -- you can't  tell me that someone is going to be more deterred by -- they will be more  deterred by seeing 18-foot wall in front of a little -- </p><p>SHAPIRO:  My comment is not about right or wrong of the wall.  My comment  is there are Republicans who are as opposed to it and the president is  going after the Democrats when he's got people within his own party who are  saying not so fast.  </p><p>CARTER:  How are you going to pay for it?  I think that's what they --  because they're holding up for it.  Let's balance this budget, let's figure  this out.  We've got to make some short-term pain in order to, you know,  preserve the economy, and that's what conservatives should be all about.  </p><p>CASONE:  Anyway, a great interview with Maria Bartiromo and Vice President  Pence.  We've really enjoyed playing you all of those clips this morning.   We've got a lot more, coming up, so stay with us.  </p><p>Paying your friends back could expose details of your private life; the  shocking report that highlights concerns over the peer-to-peer payment app,  Venmo, ahead.  Plus, a new take on an old classic; how Harley-Davidson is  shaking up its product line with the new electric motorcycle.  That is  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, CBS' board meets today to consider whether CEO Les Moonves  should step aside while sexual harassment allegations against him are  investigated.  Susan Li's got those details.  Susan?</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Cheryl, this is the  corporate story of the day, CBS has opened an investigation, after six  women accused Moonves of sexual misconduct in a New Yorker story that was  published on Friday.  CBS' board also discussing the claims against Moonves  over weekend.  Now, Moonves says that he regrets any behavior that made  women uncomfortable but says he never used his position to harm or hinder  anyone's career.  CBS releases earnings on Thursday, the stock which is  under pressure in the premarket dropped six percent on Friday on concerns  that Moonves might be forced to resign.  </p><p>Meantime, shares of Caterpillar, CAT rallying in the premarket trade after  the company's latest earnings beat the street's estimates and have raised  its full-year guidance thanks to strong global demand.  Caterpillar's  adjusted profit blowing out expectations by more than $0.20.  The strong  results coming despite the threat of tariffs on the company's exports.  </p><p>Now, it's a different story for Tyson Foods with the stock plunging in the  premarket.  The company is out with a profit warning for fiscal 2018,  blaming increased tariffs and what it calls uncertain trade policies.   Tyson will release its earnings on August the 6th, before the bell.  </p><p>Four years, after unveiling its electric motorcycle concept to the world,  Harley-Davidson is ready to bring the LiveWire bike to production, the  company announcing this morning, that the bike will be ready to hit  dealerships next year, 2019.  And the LiveWire which was built with  performance in mind isn't the only electric model Harley-Davidson is  rolling out.  Two middleweight electric bikes are slated for release in  2021 and then 2022.  Harley-Davidson will even be making pedal-assist bikes  as part of its new electric line up.  Shares of Harley-Davidson are down  though close to 13 percent on the year.  </p><p>And, finally, my favorite story of the day, a heartwarming one out of  Pennsylvania, a father working three jobs surprises his daughter with the  dress of her dreams for 8th grade formal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LI:  After initially telling her that he couldn't afford it, the dad  revealed a $200 dress while the daughter visited him as one of his jobs,  and you can see the 14-year-old wearing her dream dress.  The father is  working at McDonald's, Popeye's, and a convenience store.</p><p>CASONE:  Oh, my gosh.</p><p>LI:  And I think he should be up for father of the year.</p><p>CASONE:  Father of the year.  Oh, we love that story, Susan, thank you.</p><p>LI:  That was fun.</p><p>CASONE:  That was amazing.  (INAUDIBLE) Good dad.  All right.  We've got a  lot more, coming up.  Taking the extra steps to protect your privacy  online, the new concerns over how much the payment at Venmo is exposing  consumer's private financial information and nanny choices, that's coming  up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Payment site, Venmo, at the center of a new  controversy.  A shocking report from a German researcher finds your  purchase history can be tracked by almost anyone.  And due to lack of  privacy protections, this could be just the tip of the iceberg.  Let's  bring in The Cyber Guy, Kurt Knutsson.  Kurt, hey, good morning.</p><p>KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBER GUY:  Cheryl, good morning to you.  Why do we care  about this story?  I'll tell you why, because you can look up all these  transactions that are publicly available on Venmo unless you have taken the  effort to make that transaction private, or make all your transactions  private.  In the meantime, anybody can see what you've bought, when you  bought it, using this payment service, Venmo, so why do you care?  Well,  the fact is if you can see that I'd buy a particular coffee at a particular  store at a particular time on a -- on a habitual level, you could tell me  that also -- well, that's a good time to go maybe rob my apartment or my  house, or you might also be able to engage me at that point in a nefarious  acts where you can discover when you add up our purchase patterns, you can  add up what I might be at risk for in life.  Let's say that I buy a lot of  donuts on a regular basis, well, an insurance company may be able to buy  that information and then suddenly, I would be considered a greater risk  and would my insurance go up?  You better believe it.</p><p>CASONE:  It can raise your insurance premium, yes.  We happened to have on  set today, Erin Elmore who is the ultimate Venmo stalker it turns out.   Listen to this first.</p><p>ELMORE:  So, Kurt, first of all, to change these -- I don't want people to  get too scared at home because all you have to do is swipe button, and then  all of your transactions are private, so let that be told.  However, two  occurrences, one, if you go to your friends, say, hey, my friend Stacey has  a really good nanny.  You go to her Venmo and you see she pays Bethany for  child care, I've seen people poach nannies and actually steal nannies from  Venmo.  Taking it one step further --</p><p>KNUTSSON:  Right.  And you find out what they're paying for the nanny so  you may have an advantage to pay the nanny just a little bit more.</p><p>ELMORE:  She pays $25.00, you say I'll pay you 30, guess who doesn't have a  babysitter or a nanny anymore.</p><p>KNUTSSON:  Erin, you are good.  You are good.</p><p>ELMORE:  Also, let's make it even worse, let's take this a little more  (INAUDIBLE) for you, here.  You could steal someone's -- you can find out  if someone is cheating on you, your boyfriend or something.  You find out,  hey, so and so is friends with this girl.  I don't know who this girl is,  and then you find out on her Venmo page, they're paying for each other's  dinners, sending heart emojis, kissing emojis.  This -- you better turn the  privacy settings on private or else you're going to have no babysitter and  no girlfriend.  You should be very careful.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Erin, we've got a new career for you.  My gosh!</p><p>ELMORE:  Cyberstalking.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Her private investigation skills are available online via Venmo.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ELMORE:  But what do you think?  Do you think these are really things that  could happen to other people or am I just crazy with crazy friends and know  a lot of cyberstalking skills?</p><p>KNUTSSON:  No, I think -- I think this is a real problem.  I think you're  right, I think this is a real problem, and now that we've educated a lot of  people on how to do this, fact is there -- what Erin is saying is correct,  you can -- you can make your transactions private, but Venmo does no big  favor to us to help us do that.  They don't put that out front.  And now,  it's our job to tell you, you need to be out front with your privacy, they  offer the ability for you to make one of your transactions private, or you  can globally set all of your transactions to private, you could even go  back to old transactions, and make those private, and that is what I would  recommend you do.  So hit settings, private, privacy (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  -- Erin stealing your boyfriends.</p><p>ELMORE:  Or nanny.  I'm a happily-married lady.</p><p>KNUTSSON:  I'm scared now.  She scared the bejesus out of me.</p><p>ELMORE:  I'm a happily-married lady but I will steal your babysitter.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CASONE:  Kurt, thank you very much.  Good tips from you as always, Kurt  knutsson.</p><p>KNUTSSON:  Good to see you guys.</p><p>CASONE:  Kurt Knutsson.  All right, coming up, we've got final thoughts  from our all-star stalking panel.</p><p>ELMORE:  Oh, no, don't put it --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CASONE:  Final thoughts from our all-star panel.  Lee Carter?</p><p>CARTER:  I can't wait to see what's going to happen with Trey this week.   Italian meeting, the rest of the stuff that's happening this week.  Trey's  big deal.</p><p>CASONE:  Oh, it's going to be a very big deal.  Adam?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Once we get onto August, we're going to get the July unemployment  numbers and look at the wage number.  If you're year-over-year wage growth  has not budged up from 2.7 percent year-over-year, it's a problem because  that means wages are not rising as fast as they need to.</p><p>CASONE:  Erin Elmore?</p><p>ELMORE:  Make your Venmo private.  That's it.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Special stalker.</p><p>CASONE:  Erin can stalk you.</p><p>ELMORE:  Doing it right now.  Cheryl Casone.</p><p>CASONE:  The best.  Here we go, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\".  Up next, Charles Payne  in for Stuart.  Take it away, Charles.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Thank you very much, Cheryl.   I'm Charles Payne in for Stuart.

Apple later came out with an email product that was similar to BlueMail, prompting the cofounders to file a lawsuit against the smartphone maker in 2019.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Google kicked an app off its Google Play Store after its developers contributed questions for the US lawmakers to use during Wednesday's antitrust hearing.Blix cofounder Ben Volach, who created the BlueMail app that was suspended, tweeted the revelation on Friday morning. Brothers Ben and Dave Volach both publicized their cooperation with the antitrust investigation earlier this week, as the Washington Post[2] reported.\"If this isn't retaliation due to our role in the congressional hearing, then what is?\"</p><p> Volach tweeted. He also wrote \"Apple &amp;#38; Google must be regulated. 2 gatekeepers to rule them all.\" \u2014Ben Volach (@benvol) July 31, 2020[3] In a screenshot of an email viewed by Business Insider, the Blix developers were told by Google that its BlueMail app was now suspended after a recent review found it \"not compliant with one or more of our Developer Program Policies.\" But according to the company, they were given \"zero notice,\" a move that is \"far too coincidental\" considering the app is six years old and that it happened so soon after the hearing.\"Google either suspended BlueMail because we helped the House Antitrust Subcommittee prepare for the hearings or because Google just launched a competitor to Blix, our BlueMail for Teams product,\" cofounder Dan Volach said in an emailed statement. \"Regardless, the fact that they have the power to kick you out of the store and cut your revenue stream with no notice is nothing short of absurd.\"The company also told Business Insider that a \"lite\" version of the BlueMail app, one that customers barely use, remains active on the store as Google apparently only took down the heavyweight version.Google  later told Blix, per the Washington Post report, that the BlueMail app was suspended because the company found it to have copied another app.\"At minimum they should explain what the issue is, and not just remove it before the weekend,\" Ben Volach told Business Insider in an interview.The Blix cofounders have openly expressed their complaints[4] regarding Apple and Google and what they say is the two firms' unfair treatment of developers in their respective app stores.\"Apple and Google have no respect for their partners and they have too much control over our business,\" Ben Volach said in a statement sent to Business Insider. \"It stifles innovation and tells the developer that it's not safe to bring new ideas to the store.\"Google and Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.Leading up to the hearing, big tech's treatment of third-party app developers was expected to be a major point of scrutiny, especially for Apple. According to Blix, Apple removed the BlueMail app form its own App Store in 2018 ahead of its Worldwide Developer's Conference. Apple later unveiled an email product that was similar to BlueMail, which prompted Blix to file a lawsuit against Apple over claims of patent infringement and antitrust violations. The lawsuit is still ongoing.

However, the innovation landscape is uncertain as \"BigTech1\" entrants make their presence felt and incumbents face technical and regulatory complexity in developing collaborative payments ecosystems between themselves and fintechs. </p><p>More than bank-led initiatives will be needed to grow the new payments landscape, the report noted. The broader financial services community\u2014 including public-sector organizations, regulators and third parties \u2014have to work together with large payment users to ensure a smooth, balanced and robust payments ecosystem, according to a press release on the report. Non-cash transactions are expected to post a compound annual growth rate of 12.7 percent through to 2021, following growth of 10.1 percent in 2015-16, which saw the total volume of non-cash transactions reach $482.6 billion.Developing markets lead growthDeveloping markets are driving the non-cash boom, with Russia (CAGR of 36.5 percent), India (33.2 percent) and China (25.8 percent) as notable movers during 2015-16. Mature markets maintained steady growth of more than 7 percent. Developing markets are set to post a 21.6 percent CAGR, led by Asia at 28.8 percent over the next five years. By 2021, developing markets are expected to account for around half of all non-cash transactions worldwide, overtaking the mature markets for the first time, whose current share stands at 66.3 percent.Big tech firms open e-walletsDisruption of the payments market is accelerating as new technologies take hold. In particular, e-wallets are on the rise and present a major market opportunity for non-traditional payments providers. In 2016, e-wallets accounted for 8.6 percent of non-cash transactions (a volume of $41.8 billion), of which 71 percent were facilitated by big tech providers. Although disruption is accelerating and market entrants are proliferating, there are regulatory and technical complexity challenges to the development of innovative new payments ecosystems. Only 38 percent of bank executives said they were \"planning an anchor role\"in new payments ecosystems. \"As demand for digital payments is strong, especially in developing markets, some banks may want to revisit their choice to not seek an anchor role in the new emerging payments ecosystem,\" Anirban Bose, CEO of Capgemini's Financial Services and a member of the group's executive board, said in the release. \"With their significant market share in the payments industry and implementation of new technologies, banks are in a unique position to shape the marketplace. They can also create new revenue streams through innovative, collaborative relationships with fintechs and active participation by the broader financial services community.\" Like banks, corporate treasurers should also consider their role in the new ecosystem as they expect value-added services that are safe, efficient, reliable and global and could co-design these services with banks. \"Large payments users are also a key constituency in the evolution of innovation in the payments industry. Without their participation, payments services providers are missing a vital opportunity to shape new offerings in transaction banking such as in cash aggregation, cash forecasting and automated treasury,\" said Bruno Mellado, head of international payments and receivables at BNP Paribas, in the release. \"These offerings could equip corporate treasurers with the means to move beyond a tactical or operational role and towards a more strategic one for their companies.\"Innovation faces complexitiesMany respondents said adoption of a real-time payments infrastructure was being inhibited by lack of interoperability between schemes (identified by 74.1 percent of executives) and weak data and authorization standardization (59.3 percent). Regarding distributed ledger technology, 85.9 percent highlighted lack of interoperability, 83.1 percent lack of regulatory clarity, and 77.1 percent ability to scale, as factors limiting adoption. The report also noted regulatory and industry initiatives are threatening to create conflicts as they spread from a regional to a global level. Conflicting KRIIs pose implementation and operational challenges that could hinder the transition to new payments ecosystems. Examples include the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) and PSD2 conflict, as well as GDPR and PSD2. The World Payments Report 2018 is comprised of primary research based on executive interviews and an online survey. This edition also includes the introduction of the Payments Open Banking Assessment, which demonstrates the state of open banking in 16 countries from a payments perspective.

They also share something else in common: a partnership with Verily, the life sciences spinout of Google parent company Alphabet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two deals seek to accomplish different things - one centers on hardware, the other on data - but they show growing overlap between health care and technology. Medical devices are one facet of the intersection, in which players must consider data-sharing concerns.</p><p>Dexcom makes a sensor that frequently transmits glucose levels to a smartphone, teasing out relationships between eating, exercise and blood sugar. It turned to Verily for help building a smaller and less expensive diabetes monitoring device.</p><p>But Verily contributed more than engineering support.</p><p>\"They had a different perspective,\" said Dexcom CEO Kevin Sayer in an interview with the San Diego Business Journal. \"We learned a lot from them.\"</p><p>The Perspectives</p><p>He said Verily thinks about things more from a consumer perspective, whereas Dexcom knows how to navigate clinical studies and the regulatory process.</p><p>The fruit of the partnership, Dex-com's latest technology called G7, will roll out late this year. Sayer said the company is scaling up its manufacturing footprint to meet demand for G6, its current diabetes system, and to prepare for G7.</p><p>Dexcom has been on a growth tear. In third-quarter earnings shared in November, the company posted $396.3 million in revenue, a 49% year-over-year increase. Net income came to $45.8 million during the period, according to the company.</p><p>Amended Deal</p><p>Last year, Dexcom and Verily amended their deal, which analysts said would improve Dexcom's profitability. Under the revision, Dexcom paid $250 million in stock to Verily, and in addition, Dexcom could make up to $280 million in milestone payments to Verily.</p><p>In exchange for these payments, the updated agreement nixed a provision in the original deal in which Dexcom would have paid royalties.</p><p>\"We restructured the partnership to more accurately reflect each of our roles,\" Sayer said.</p><p>Verily, formerly Google Life Sciences, in 2015 announced diabetes as the company's first major disease target, drawn by a painful process.</p><p>Historically, diabetes patients pricked a finger multiple times a day to track glucose levels. But a few years ago Dexcom and competitor Abbott released technology that doesn't require blood draws for calibration, easing the burden.</p><p>In 2017, the total cost of managing diabetes was estimated at $327 billion, up from $245 billion in 2012, according to the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>As the dominant force in online search, Google's wheelhouse is data, artificial intelligence and analytics. But Dexcom isn't tapping that expertise - though it could.</p><p>\"Over time that might be an avenue we pursue with them. That isn't the case today,\" Sayer said, adding Verily algorithms could potentially make care more predictive.</p><p>Option of Sharing Data</p><p>Sayer said Dexcom users have the option of sharing their data with outside parties. Notably, a recently announced partnership allows Dexcom devices to be synced with the diabetes management platform Livongo for health nudges based on glucose readings.</p><p>\"Our patients own their data. We don't even consider us as the custodians of that data. It is our patients,\" Sayer said.</p><p>Companies must be mindful of data concerns given pushback in recent months over Google collecting detailed personal health data as part of a deal with St. Louis-based health system Ascension. Patients and physicians weren't notified about the project, dubbed Project Nightingale, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The newspaper confirmed in subsequent reporting that Google didn't break federal law, but the news stirred conversations about the ethics of medical data sharing.</p><p>A joint venture between ResMed and Verily only includes de-identified patient data, ResMed said in a statement.</p><p>The companies are researching and developing software to better reach millions of Americans unknowingly stricken by sleep apnea, in which breathing stops and starts, causing tiredness during the day and potentially serious issues like heart disease.</p><p>ResMed - which produces devices for breathing disorders - has amassed a trove of patient sleep data. Meanwhile, Verity's algorithm looks to produce data insights. Together, they aim to improve diagnosis, management and even the treatment of sleep apnea.</p><p>\"Our philosophy is that the more a person knows about how much they suffocate every night and the consequences of that suffocation on their own personal health, the more likely they will seek solutions to improve their sleep and overall health,\" said ResMed in a statement.</p><p>ResMed Allocates $47.7M</p><p>The company has allocated $47.7 million to the 50/50 partnership. Verity's contribution hasn't been disclosed.</p><p>What made Verily interested in partnering with the likes of Dexcom and ResMed?</p><p>\"We strive to work with preeminent leaders in scientific areas of interest to Verily, who have exhibited a solid history of preserving the privacy and security of patient information, and a commitment to putting patients first that mirrors our own,\" Verily said in a statement.</p><p>\"While we will embark on our own initiatives, partnering will always be a core element to our growth strategy. We believe in the power of partnering with experienced, like-minded companies, which has at times the potential to launch initiatives faster than building from scratch.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDBUSJ-2352576716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDBUSJ2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y61-W3V1-DY0W-40HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312604</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"919\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 San Diego Business Journal Jan 27-Feb 2, 2020</copyright><publicationName>San Diego Business Journal</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 87506890</issn><volume>Vol. 41</volume><issueNumber>No. 4</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

I'm David Asman sitting in for Lou Dobbs.  The Supreme Court today handing President Trump a major victory in his effort to combat national security crisis at our southern border.  The court upholding administration's right to detain criminal illegal immigrants prior to their deportation.  We take up the decision with Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, President Trump today meeting with Brazilian President Bolsonaro.  The two leaders pledging the strength and ties on security and trade, promoting democracy and capitalism in the western hemisphere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  There relationship that we have right now with Brazil is never been better.  I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents.  His zero hostility with me.  We're working on different military sites and military options, we're working on visas and going in a much easier fashion.  One of the big elements of the relationship is trade.</p><p>Brazil makes great product and we make great products, so I think our trade with brazil will go substantially up in both directions and we look forward to that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  We take up the President's meeting with Bolsonaro with -- and what a close relationship with Brazil means for American security.  The Daily Caller's Christopher Bedford, the Hudson Institute's Michael Pillsbury among our guests tonight.  And the Trump economy still booming.  The White House today issuing the President's annual economic report.  For second consecutive year, the economy is out performing expectations.  Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett today touting the administration's extraordinary successes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS:  Getting a capital expenditure boom up about nine percent since the tax cuts passed and that nine percent capital spending boom is creating jobs and this year it's going to output and also continue.  We can see that in order's data.  And so the fact is that it's an old rule that I'm for economist that if you cut the cost to capital nine percent, then capital spending goes up nine percent.</p><p>And that's almost exactly what happened last year.  And that's we're very confident, it will continue.  I know --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  We take up the economy's strong performance and the positive impact to the President's tax cuts and deregulatory cuts.  We are joined by Trump 2020 Strategic Communications Director Marc Lotter and Trump 2020 Surrogate Gina Loudon.</p><p>Our top story, the Supreme Court today issuing a decision making it easier for Federal authorities to detain criminal illegal aliens prior to their deportation.  It's another victory for President Trump.  Justice Clarence Thomas siding with the administration's effort to act unilaterally in detaining criminal immigrants writing, \"I continue to believe that no court has jurisdiction to decide questions concerning the detention of aliens before final orders of removal have been entered.\"</p><p>The President is singlehandedly fighting for border security using his executive powers to declare a national emergency and then vetoing a resolution rejecting that declaration.  Attorney General William Barr, a man of the law, not politics defending the President's national emergency declaration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  The humanitarian and security crisis we have on the border right now is exactly the kind of emergency that presidents are permitted to address under the National Emergencies Act.  The crisis that we're dealing with today is right on our doorstep and it presents a real clear and present danger to the American people.  So what you've done from a legal standpoint is now that we grounded in law and from the standpoint of protecting the American people, it's imperative.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  The President also receiving another victory from the Defense Department.  The Pentagon identifying nearly $13 billion that could be used to fund the President's border wall.  The decision couldn't have come a moment too soon as tens of thousands of migrant families from Central America continue to try to enter our country illegally.  As National Correspondent William La Jeunesse shows us it's a situation that is overwhelming and already overworked border patrol.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  As the fight over the President's border policy continues, crews outside of San Diego just completed a 14-mile steel fence and started a second one.  Stretching from mountains to the ocean.</p><p>RODNEY SCOTT, CHIEF, SAN DIEGO BORDER PATROL:  This last year we've seen about a 700 percent increase in families and significant increase in unaccompanied minors here in San Diego.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  This weekend 52 migrants rushed through a hole in the old fence.  They tried to evade agents then claimed asylum when caught.  Unlike Mexicans who are quickly deported, Central Americans take hours to process to verify country of origin, travel documents, medical condition and available bed space.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Between 25 up to 40 percent of the agents are assigned non-patrol duties today processing transport or care and feeding of these -- of the family units.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We are seeing increasing medical problem as they come across the border.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Smuggler also use children as decoys, dropping off this six and nine-year-old over a fence, while t 10 migrants cross illegally only a mile away.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have to identify and then go apprehend every single person that crosses the border.  Whether they're claiming asylum, whether they're smuggling narcotics or whether they're involved in human trafficking.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  In a recent 73-day period, DHS released 84,000 immigrant families back into the United States.  In San Diego, nonprofits their own shelter to help ICE handle the overflow.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It has been a non-stop flow of people from anywhere from 50 to 140 people a day.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  The border fence stretched more than 650 miles when the President took office.  Now he's replaced about 140 miles of that with this new style bollard fence.  But he still wants at least 200 miles more either from the Defense Department or the 2020 budget.  David?</p><p>ASMAN:  William La Jeunesse, thank you very much.  Well, President Trump meeting with Brazilian President Bolsonaro, where the two leaders pledged to work together, economically, militarily and socially to create a stronger relationship.  Edward Lawrence has the very latest tonight from Washington.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINES NETWORK REPORTER:  Well, David, President Donald Trump and the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro talked about becoming closer trade allies, also becoming closer partners.  President Donald Trump saying he wants to elevate Brazil to be a major non-NATO ally.  That will open up opportunities for farmers.  Brazil will now allow 750,000 tons of wheat tariff free.</p><p>In exchange the U.S. will start a process to Brazilian beef.  The Brazilian president known as Trump of the tropics wants to try and open up his economic and spark a boom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  The President's vision for freeing the private sector and opening the economy is the right way for Brazil to achieve strong economic growth and our great companies are ready to go.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  The relationship of the two presidents has grown because of the crisis in Venezuela, Brazil has helped the U.S. get aid to much needed people in Venezuela who badly need medical supplies and food.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Together we could and have been really very happy to feed thousands and thousands of starving Venezuelans.  The Venezuelan people have appreciated it.  And if the Maduro forces would step aside it could be a truly great and successful humanitarian project.  We call on members of the Venezuelan military to end their support for Maduro.  Who is really nothing more than a Cuban puppet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  President Donald Trump says that all options or on the table to get Maduro out of power.  50 countries -- more than 50 counties around the world recognize Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela.  Brazil has not always been the best partner for the United States, it seems to change now with this new president, this meeting, very important meeting kicking off a new era in our relationship.  Thank you, David.</p><p>ASMAN:  Edward, thank you very much.  Well, we are learning new information tonight about just how long the Mueller witch-hunt has been investigating President Trump's former lawyer.  For details on probe into Michael Cohen we turn to Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  David, this heavily redacted court record show the investigation to Michael Cohen began nearly a year before the FBI raided his New York business in April, 2018.  The Special Counsel requested and obtained multiple warrants for Cohen's e-mails that covered correspondents during the presidential campaign.  The filing runs into the hundreds of pages and 19 are completely blacked out or redacted with the heading \"Illegal campaign contribution scheme, underlying how the President's greatest legal exposure may be in southern district of New York and unrelated to Russia collusion.\"</p><p>Cohen pled guilty to lying to Congress as well as multiple financial crimes including campaign finance violations after two women were paged to remain silence about alleged affairs  prior to the presidential election.  President Trump denies their allegations.  The unsealed court record show Federal investor s also wanted historical and future location data for Cohen's iPhones to confirm from where he sent and received e-mails.</p><p>In April 2018, the FBI sought and obtained authority to use an electronic technique known as Triggerfish.  On Fox earlier today, a former Justice Department official said, the investigative strategy is not common.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER DOJ PROSECUTOR:  I think it's probably is geo location and knowing where this guy is which could mean that they're trying to corroborate on an important point or could mean they're trying to find out if he's lying to them about an important point.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  The April 2018 timeframe may be significant because Cohen testified last month that he was told by U.S. attorney to not discuss his conversations after the FBI raid.  David?</p><p>ASMAN:  Catherine, thank you.  Still to come tonight.  Elizabeth Warren's ideas for America come at the cost of trillions of dollars.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  It's time to start the national full-blown conversation about reparations in this country.  We should make a big investment in housing.  Medicare for All.  The Green New Deal, I have got plans to reduce student loan debt.  Universal child care, universal pre-K for every child in America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  And it's all your money.  We take that up later tonight with the Trump 2020 Campaign's Marc Lotter and Gina Loudon.  But up next, Rod Rosenstein is still lurking around the Department of Justice.  So what is he up to?  We'll ask Judicial Watch's Tim Fitton when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has reached an agreement with Attorney General William Barr to stay on at the Justice Department for \"a little while longer.\"  Rosenstein who planned to step down in mid March is still main liaison between the Department and Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  But it's Barr who has had main oversight of the probe since his confirmation.</p><p>Joining me now is Tom Fitton, the President of Judicial Watch.  Good to see you, Tom.  So isn't it about time for Rosenstein to move on?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Look, it seems to me that Mueller is still running the Justice Department, and the Attorney General has got to take back control of his Justice Department.  Rod Rosenstein and Mueller have been working closely together on this abusive investigation targeting President Trump.  Rosenstein is responsible for obstruction of Congressional investigations covering up which way he can, details about the abuses of the Justice Department and the FBI and targeting President Trump and others.</p><p>And it's just remarkable to me that the Attorney General continues to have him in place in this position of power.  He is effectively running the Justice Department as number two.  That's what the A.G. does.  And by outsourcing control of the Justice Department to Rod Rosenstein, Mr. Barr is sending a signal that it's business as usual at the deep state.</p><p>ASMAN:  How long do you think he will be there?  I mean, it can't go on that much longer, can it?</p><p>FITTON:  Well, I think they have nominated someone to take over his slot.  So, you know, but it could be four, five, six months before that position is filled.  So, you could continue to -- as you highlight at the beginning of the segment effectively collaborate with Mr. Mueller as he continues this presidential harassment campaign.</p><p>ASMAN:  Meanwhile, we're learning a little bit more about the deep state and the witch-hunt through the Michael Cohen revelations.  The search warrant was released.  Can -- so much of it has been redacted.  Have you tried reading in between the redactions to try to come to some conclusion about it?</p><p>FITTON:  You know, I think the big takeaway of this is that you have the Mueller operation behind the abusive effort to impede on the President's attorney-client relationship with Michael Cohen.  They immediately began dismantling that expectation of privacy that clients have for communication with their attorneys almost immediately upon on his coming into office Mr. Mueller.  And then they outsourced it to the southern district of New York later but they weren't really fooling anyone because they were obviously operating as avatars for Mueller in raiding Cohen in that really unusual raid of an attorney.</p><p>You know, the President's attorney was subject to investigation.  I don't think they had good reason to target him other than the fact he was the President's attorney.  And again, Mueller behind an audacious attack on the President.  I'll tell you, the Attorney General has to figure out what's going on there.  And if I were him, I'd freeze the whole operation until he figures out what's up and down in terms of all the peculiar activities and corruption involved in the operation including Strzok, Page, the hiring and the firing, the FISA warrants.</p><p>Why would he allow that investigation to go forward given all the concerns about abuse of the -- of the Justice Department and the FBI.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, and the concerns now are boiling over in the American public.  I mean, it's not -- you don't have to be a fervent Trump supporter in order to believe it's a witch-hunt.  Now the majority of Americans do.  They got the message, they understand it.  I mean, there is enough evidence and there's enough push I think from the public itself to justify ending this, no?</p><p>FITTON:  I agree.  You know, the Justice Department was in court today arguing that states attorney, Maryland and other states had no business harassing the President on this emoluments clause, absurd litigation.</p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.</p><p>FITTON:  Yet the Justice Department seems to take the position they have the right to harass the President.  And they can investigate him anyway they want and this Mueller report is being used as a way to further abuse the President, hanging it over him.  And just causing worry and consternation about the operation of our government.  Again, this is the Justice Department.  The President under our constitution controls the Justice Department.</p><p>Yet the Justice Department is operating as if it's a fourth brand of government.  And the Attorney General I think needs to fix that.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, despite all of this, despite all the roadblocks to success the President continues to chock up victories.  The most recent with the Supreme Court over immigration was a close decision, it was a 5-4 but we read some comments by Justice Thomas just moments ago. What do you think of this decision?</p><p>FITTON:  Well, it's a big victory for the rule of law.  It's a case that goes to the Obama administration.  So this wasn't even a Trump administration policy.  Look, the left is attacking our efforts to hold up the rule of law and immigration by affording illegal aliens' rights, they're not due under our constitution.  And in this case, they wanted aliens who were released to not pick up immediately by ICE.</p><p>Wanted to give them the ability despite having committed crimes for which they have been jailed otherwise to be free on the streets.  And the court said no, the law doesn't allow that.  And, you know, just because ICE gets around later to arresting someone who ought to be detained doesn't mean they give up their rights to detain them.  And it's a common sense decision but the closeness shows that there is a legal effort under way to undermine the rule of law in immigration.</p><p>And I tell you, you know, a further challenge to this law may succeed with the Supreme Court.  And again, it will be just open borders mania as a result.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, and as I said, it was -- I was disappointed it was as close, it was a win but it shouldn't have been a 5-4 decision, and yet -- and yet there you go.  Tom Fitton, great to see you, my friend.  Thank you very much for being here.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome, David.</p><p>ASMAN:  And we'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this.  Share your comments and follow on Twitter @LouDobbs, like him Facebook and follow him on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Coming up.  Congressman Devin Nunes promises to sue more social media giants for political bias.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  This is the first of many lawsuits that are coming.  We have to help all of these people accountable because if we don't our First Amendment rights are at stake here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  The Daily Caller's Christopher Bedford joins me next with more.  But before we go to a break, a look at the U.S. national debt, $22.1 trillion and climbing.  We're back with more after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  President Trump today condemning big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook for their anticonservative bias against him and other prominent Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Thing are happening, names are taken off, people aren't getting through.  You've heard the same complaints and it seems to be if they're Conservative, if they're Republicans, if they're in a certain group, this discrimination and big discrimination.  I see it absolutely on Twitter.  So some things happening with those groups or folks that are running Facebook and Google and Twitter.  And I do think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>ASMAN:  Joining me now is Daily Caller News Foundation, Editor-In-Chief, Christopher Bedford.  Good to see you, Chris.  So where --</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION:  Good evening.</p><p>ASMAN:  -- do we go with the bias in social media?  I mean, nobody doubts, I don't think that they're shadow banning that goes on as much as they might protest and say it doesn't happen.  Most people realize it does.  It's clearly anticonservative but where do you go from there?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Yes.  So Twitter first started shadow banning people in an attempt to lower the impact that racist could have on conversation.  And what goes back and forth on Twitter.  And an investigation by Vice News which by -- is no one would ever call a conservative news outlet for sure found that this investigation, this -- the shadow banning by Twitter seemed to wrapping up a number of prominent Republicans including then Chairman Devin Nunes.</p><p>Now, they also found it didn't wrap up any Democrats, there was no one else who was in the Democratic Party who we shadow banned.  And time and time again, we see this.  With different search engines, with Facebook, with Twitter, and their response is always, well, hey, this was an accident, it shouldn't have happened.  They never quite explain how it happened.  And because there's a veil of secrecy around their formula which is kind of necessary for them to continue as a company.</p><p>They've been using that veil secrecy however and saying everything is actually a mistake.  But over and over again, these mistakes only target Republicans, and this is a real cause for concern about what's going on and who is making these decisions.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, we do know a little of what's going on which is that some of the algorithms were either developed by or continuing to be use with organization like the Southern Poverty Law Center which views just normal Conservatives as dealing in hate speech and awful things that lead to violence which is not at all true.</p><p>BEDFORD:  And the Southern Poverty Law Center does exactly what you said.  They grouped in a ton of Republicans, conserved publications, Christian groups and said that these are hate group.  And one part of their racket which is very lucrative racket is that they are parroted by left-wing press across the board.  We've had examples -- for example when The Daily Caller most of their staff was docked which means their personal details or their parents' addresses or their phone numbers were put on the internet and these were retweeted by groups on Twitter.</p><p>ASMAN:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  We reached out to Twitter on this and the first response we got was, this does not fit our examples of what harassment is.  Of course that was just somebody in one of the offices who made the call, probably someone with a strong, strong bias.</p><p>ASMAN:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  The time we got into San Francisco, we were able to get that shut down and get those tweets shut down.  But the average person who doesn't run a media company or isn't a Congressman doesn't have that weapon to be able to pull in and actually make Twitter do anything to stop it.</p><p>ASMAN:  Here's the interesting thing from my perspective as a journalist is that you could be discriminated against by the social media companies but at the same time use the social media companies to your political advantage and this is what President Trump already has been doing preparing for reelection.  We remember -- I remember when Jared Kushner, his son-in-law was on the cover of Forbes Magazine after 2016 was hailed as a genius by Forbes for what he did, how he used Facebook in targeting particular audiences.</p><p>They're at it again, they're -- I think $3-1/2 million they've spent on Facebook just in the past three or four months.  So, despite all of this bias, it's fascinating how the Trump reelection campaign it using it in order to pursue their political goals.</p><p>BEDFORD:  They've been extremely successful with it, but look at some of the public outcry over this.  When President Barack Obama used Facebook and social media, it was a victory.</p><p>ASMAN:  Oh, it was a victory.  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  He was viewed as a genius.</p><p>BEDFORD:  They had profiles, there were books written about intelligent this was.  And President Trump did the same thing, there were calls to put Steve Bannon and other people in prison over this.  They called nefarious. So, these platforms exists and they have huge amounts of power.  Facebook is one of the biggest arbiters of where people read their news in this entire country.  And when they use that power for ill it's very, very dangerous and it's very clear that all these social media companies are aligned politically and culturally against conservatives.</p><p>ASMAN:  And as they were in 2016 but again it didn't -- it didn't stop the election from happening the way it did.</p><p>I got to ask you about old Joe Biden and his pursuit of the presidency it seems to be edging ever closer, but do you think he's going to be able to elbow out all of the energy coming from the far left, from the socialists and others?</p><p>BEDFORD:  And he accidentally announced that he was running and then had to take it back.</p><p>ASMAN:  Sort of.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Yes, you know, (INAUDIBLE) he always said I'm the only candidate.  Well, hold on a second, I'm not a candidate yet.</p><p>ASMAN:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Joe Biden seems to be the kind of politician and the candy enough politician that he would be able to push aside a lot of this.  The amount of money he's raised has been pretty impressive already.</p><p>But the problem with Joe Biden is outside of President Barack Obama.  He has not been able to compete very well nationally.  His previous campaigns for national platforms of fizzled out very, very quickly when he was a side person to President Barack Obama who according to report, then he did very well.  So, how he will do without this colossal political figure backing him up, he could fizzle out just as quickly.</p><p>ASMAN:  And of course, all he has to do is defend the Obama record which when you compare eight years of President Obama with a couple of years of President Trump, it doesn't look so favorable when you look at the stats.  I know they love to say how wonderfully he did but again starting from zero practically anybody could.  He's got a tough record to defend and he's going to be forced to do so by President Trump.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Looking at it objectively, I totally agree with you, but a lot of the Democrats wish and pined for President Barack Obama to be back.  And anyone who would say we're going to bring it back to these golden years when President Barack Obama was in for seen, one of the most liberal agendas America has ever seen is going to get a lot of Democratic support.</p><p>ASMAN:  Christopher Bedford, good to see you, Chris.  Thank you very much.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Good to see you.</p><p>ASMAN:  Appreciate it.  Coming up next, prosecutors in Florida offer a plea deal for New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.</p><p>Plus, the U.S. and China are planning new high-level trade talks.  We're going to take that up and more with China expert Michael Pillsbury right after these quick messages.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Welcome back everyone.  I'm David Asman sitting in for Lou Dobbs.  Some headlines we're looking at tonight President Trump's new pick to lead the FAA is Steve Dickson.  Dickson is a former Delta pilot and V.P. of flight operations this coming amid growing scrutiny of the FAA after two crashes of Boeing planes.</p><p>Florida prosecutors reportedly offering to drop charges against New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.  In exchange, Kraft and all those charged must admit that they would have been found guilty at trial.  Last month, prosecutors charged Kraft with soliciting prostitution.</p><p>And U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin travelling to China next week for trade talks.  This coming after report the summit between President Trump and Xi Jingping may be delayed until June.</p><p>Joining me now is Dr. Michael Pillsbury, director of the Senate Center for Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute, author and trade advisor to the Trump administration.  Good to see you doctor.</p><p>You know, in the midst of all these trade negotiations and friendly smiles, shaking hands and everything, you have pretty disturbing reports like that report that was a Wall Street Journal exclusive of the Navy review of a cyber attack of one of our key new missile development programs which would go on our submarines around the world.  This was -- they had now have details of one of the most secret missile technologies we have.  How do you square that with these friendly trade negotiations?</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR, SENATE CENTER FOR CHINESE STRATEGY:  Well I don't think the trade negotiations are all that friendly, David.  I think they've been pretty fraught with tension and the fact that Secretary Mnuchin and Bob Lighthizer are going over yet again, I think it's a setback.</p><p>But frankly with China, we have a strange relationship.  We both prepare for war against each other.  Our military officers write articles about how to win war against each other.  But we also have this enormously complicated and rich economic relationship with each side investing heavily in the other efforts to decouple our supply chains with China.  Usually just shouted down by Wall Street.  So, it's a complex relationship and it's hard to take the temperature.  Know how are we doing, are we friends with China today but then we're military enemies tomorrow?  It's getting more difficult.</p><p>And President Trump is the first president to launch into this as you know.  So now, there's much more attention to how what China only thinks of America.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, and you mentioned supply chains.  One of the things that the trade negotiators are working on something called mandatory purchase orders.  The Wall Street Journal again wrote something about this because chip manufacturers, computer chip manufacturers in the U.S. are worried that these mandatory purchase orders may force them to set up some operations in China.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  That's right.</p><p>ASMAN:  In order to fulfill those requirements of how much we sell to the Chinese.  They're worried because they know in China it's virtually impossible to stop spying.  And of course, they have some real key corporate secrets in ship manufacturing.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  That's why I think the big news of the evening is the announcement confirmed by two sources to the Wall Street Journal that the secretary of the Treasury and our ambassador for trade are going back next week, this is pretty big news.</p><p>And also, the chip manufacturing community does not seem to like this idea of being forced to build more factories in China.  So, some of the aspects of this trade deal apparently are coming apart, and to put them back together again is in everybody's interest.  But I believe President Trump when he said at CPAC, I would had a pretty good seat when he said it.  He doesn't really want a deal if it's not a good deal in the -- for the long-term of the United States.  That's the issue we're facing now as we confront these new developments from China especially the spying on our military.</p><p>ASMAN:  Yes, and then there is the odd case of the willing cooperation, apparently of some companies in particular Google to cooperate with the Chinese, not cooperate with our Pentagon, but cooperate with the Chinese in a way that could directly benefit the military.  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, no less, General Joseph Dunford spoke to that point last week.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Yes.</p><p>ASMAN:  Let me just play a clip and get your reaction.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Very scary.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF:  The work that Google is doing in China is direct -- is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military.  But frankly, indirect maybe not a full characterization of the way it really is, it's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  Now Google, since that those remarks by Ggeneral Dunford has said, that's not true, we don't do anything that directly or indirectly benefits the military.  Who do you trust, General Dunford or Google?</p><p>PILLSBURY:  I trust General Dunford.  I saw the denial Google put out just a couple hours ago again in the Wall Street Journal who are really earning a Pulitzer Prize --</p><p>ASMAN:  They are.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  -- for the coverage of China.</p><p>ASMAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  But Google should be ashamed of itself.  There's no doubt about it.  This young man who quit Google and protests last summer revealed how far Google had gone, buying a place in China, buying a web site, beginning to help spy on the Chinese people.  If they Google something like Dalai Lama or a particular phrase.  Google's got a lot to apologize for.</p><p>ASMAN:  So, I'm sure what you have seen what I've seen is I cover the markets I see any strong hint that some positive element has happened in these trade talks, the markets go up.  If there's negativity, the markets go down.  I do think that there is going to be a pop if there's some kind of trade agreement.  You know, a market pop they'll see that as a positive.</p><p>Would you see that -- is it possible that the market could get it wrong?  I guess is what I'm asking that's something that is viewed by them is very positive may in the end be negative for the United States.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Well, a really good trade deal obviously could be a thousand points on the Dow Jones be a really big pop as you put it.  But a bad trade deal, that's what I'm worried about.  That there's no enforcement, that the Chinese do what they've been doing the last month or so.  They're passing laws and rules that don't have the word America in them.  They say all foreign companies will be treated better or all foreign investments will be treated fairly.  They're leaving out who started this, President Trump and America.  It's kind of insulting what they've been doing with these new laws and rules.  They've got to focus more on giving President Trump what he's asking for before this gets out of hand.</p><p>ASMAN:  Doctor Michael Pillsbury, great to see you doctor.  Thank you for coming in tonight, appreciate it.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Thanks David.</p><p>ASMAN:  Coming up next, President Trump says the end of socialism is near.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The twilight hour of socialism has arrived in our hemisphere and hopefully by the way, it's also arrived that twilight hour in our great country.  The last thing we want in the United States is socialism.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  We'll take that up and more after the break with the Trump 2020 campaigns Mark Water and Gina Loudon, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  On Wall Street, Stocks closed mix.  The Dow lost 27 points, the S&amp;P closed flat, the NASDAQ gained nine points, volume on the big board 3.6 billion shares.  Crude oil closing relatively flat at $59.00 a barrel, gold and silver also closing flat.</p><p>And the White House released its economic report proving the Trump economy continues to boom.  Real GDP growth hit 3.2 percent throughout the first three quarters of 2018.  $30 billion were saved through decreased regulations and the U.S. surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world's largest producer of crude oil.</p><p>And a reminder to listen to Lou's reports three times a day coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Well, Democrat presidential candidate Liz Warren revealing her unrealistic socialist proposals.  And according to recent estimates, her grand proposals will cost $100 trillion.  Warren socialist agenda includes the Green New Deal, universal child care, and slavery reparations.</p><p>Joining me now is Gina Loudon, Political Analysts, Author, and Member of President Trump's Media Advisory Board and Marc Lotter, Director of Strategic Communication for the Trump 2020 campaign, former Press Secretary to V.P. Pence.  Good to see you both.</p><p>Marc, let me start not with Liz Warren's economic plans, if you pardon the expression, but with the President -- what the President has actually done with the economy.  This economic report is incredible.  He just tweeted out something about his economic efforts.  He said, amazingly CNN just released a poll at 71 percent saying the economy is in the best shape since 2001, 18 years.  Wow, CNN becoming a believer.  What do you think of that?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN:  Well, the numbers are outstanding.  It's -- if we're finally starting to see in the polls what the economists and the data has shown for so long, that the low unemployment rate, rising wages, people are starting to feel more secure.</p><p>But one of the biggest Nuggets in that poll was it 42 percent of Americans, a plurality said that they are better off financially now than they were three years ago.  Only 15 percent said that they were worse off.  So it shows that this economy is working for everyone.  And that's one of the -- going to be one of the key messages heading into 2020.</p><p>ASMAN:  And Gina, the only way -- and I don't think even then you could buy into Liz Warren's solution, but the only way to buy into a solution -- a solution in quotes that that costs $100 trillion of taxpayer money, and I don't know where you're going to get that, is if you believe the economy is absolutely in desperate shape.</p><p>I mean, the worst shape, nothing compared to the Great Depression, I mean even worse than that.  And clearly, Americans don't feel it so.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, MEMBER, TRUMP'S MEDIA ADVISORY BOARD:  Well, if Elizabeth Warren and the Democrats who have become actually socialist, that's self-stated, that's not my implication, if they have their way we will be back in no time to the Great Depression.  Every single thing that they are proposing is either so completely desperate, David, that it makes absolutely no sense.  Or it's almost some ploy to just grab attention in headlines so that someone will write a story about them more so than an actual practical proposal.</p><p>Because everything that Democrats are saying is antithetical to this economy that the American people are enjoying.  It's excruciating to watch.</p><p>ASMAN:  And then Marc, you just do the math.  I mean, she comes out with these $100 trillion worth of proposals, and then she says she's going to pay for with a wealth tax.  If you were to tax a 100 percent of the wealthy in this country, you wouldn't get $1 trillion.</p><p>LOTTER:  You wouldn't even come close.</p><p>ASMAN:  So the point is that you've got $100 trillion here, $1 trillion dollars to pay for $100 trillion.  I mean, people can do the math.  Americans know how to do the math.</p><p>LOTTER:  And when you break it down, just the Green New Deal so not the additional $7 trillion she's proposing on top of the Green New Deal, it works out to about $5,000 a month coming out of every household's personal budget.  I think most Americans out there are would be shocked to say to look at their household monthly budget and then take $5,000 a month out of it.</p><p>It's just unrealistic.  It's not going to happen.  And that's why this election is not just about the results we were talking about, it's going to actually be a choice.  Do you want to keep this going or do you want go to Socialism?</p><p>ASMAN:  And then, Gina, you have the problem that they have with the Constitution.  The United States Constitution which they want to change on so many different levels.  Let's start with the Supreme Court.  Now, they want to go back to something that was last tried in 1937 by FDR when he tried to pack the Supreme Court by increasing its number and turn it into a political body.  Now it's being suggested as a real suggestion by Liz Warren, by Cory Booker, by a lot of Democrats.</p><p>LOUDON:  But it goes right along with all of their other desperate power grabs.  David, nothing they're proposing is for the sake of the American people.  Do you remember when the Democrats were the party of jobs and veterans?  Remember that?  This has all changed now.</p><p>This is all a massive power grab and a massive vote grab with one basic underlying principle, and that is that Americans have decided they will no longer vote for Democrats and that Democrats don't know what to do to ever win an election again except to cheat or grab power away from the American people when it's unconstitutional.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, they want to change the Constitution.  That's just the point Marc is that they don't believe in the Constitution.  They think that it's flawed on several different levels.  First of all with regard to the Supreme Court, the Electoral College, of course, is part of it.  I mean, they want to change America at its core, at its roots.</p><p>LOTTER:  And if the fundamental premise here is that when Democrats don't like the outcome, just change the rules.  Whether it's the Supreme Court, whether it's the -- whether it's the Electoral College, they now want 16-year-olds to vote, illegal aliens to vote.</p><p>LOUDON:  Illegals, yes.</p><p>LOTTER:  Where do you -- where do they stop, what rule won't they change in order to get power?</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, and again, Gina, it's not make America great again, it's change America to something that it never has been.  I mean, that -- there are a lot of Americans -- I think there are people that -- even Americans who want change who don't want to change the fundamental character, the basic principles on which this country was founded.</p><p>LOUDON:  But this is exactly why.  You know, people are going to vote their pocketbooks, David, when it all comes down to it.  As long as they feel safe which they feel safer than they've ever felt under this president, and as long as they have jobs and can provide for their families, those are the principles which they're going to vote -- under which they're going to vote.</p><p>And so everything that Democrats are proposing is a massive departure from everything that has been accomplished over the last couple of years.  And so I don't see how the Democrats win unless they start to come up with some ideas that are not radical and that actually support the economy and the national security that we have established at this point.</p><p>ASMAN:  It's going to be something to see.  Gina Loudon, Marc Lotter, great to see both of you.  Thank you for coming in.  I appreciate it.</p><p>LOUDON:  Great to see you.</p><p>ASMAN:  Coming up next, President Trump sees Brazil as a top military ally in the Western Hemisphere.  We'll have more on that when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  President Trump today welcoming the new Brazilian president, Bolsonaro at the White House.  The two aiming to strengthen trade, energy, and military cooperation.  Trump even suggesting Brazil could be given NATO privileges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I also intend to designate Brazil as a major non-NATO ally or even possibly if you start thinking about it, maybe a NATO ally.  I have to talk to a lot of people, but maybe a NATO ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  And a critical Supreme Court ruling, Justices upholding the Trump Administration's right to detain criminal illegal immigrants prior to their deportation.  Also, the Wall Street Journal reporting that former Vice President Joe Biden reach out to at least a half dozen supporters today to tell them he intends to run for president.</p><p>That's it for us tonight.  Lou is back tomorrow.  He's going to be speaking with White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett, Congressman Mark Green, and National Security Expert K.T. McFarland.</p><p>And at a programming note, my show \"BULLS AND BEARS\" airs every weeknight at 5:00 p.m. Eastern right here on Fox Business Network.  We hope to see you there.  Thanks for joining us.  Good night from New York.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2194268476</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-09R1-JBHT-D0RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7104\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm David Asman sitting in for Lou Dobbs.  The Supreme Court today handing President Trump a major victory in his effort to combat national security crisis at our southern border.  The court upholding administration's right to detain criminal illegal immigrants prior to their deportation.  We take up the decision with Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, President Trump today meeting with Brazilian President Bolsonaro.  The two leaders pledging the strength and ties on security and trade, promoting democracy and capitalism in the western hemisphere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  There relationship that we have right now with Brazil is never been better.  I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents.  His zero hostility with me.  We're working on different military sites and military options, we're working on visas and going in a much easier fashion.  One of the big elements of the relationship is trade.</p><p>Brazil makes great product and we make great products, so I think our trade with brazil will go substantially up in both directions and we look forward to that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  We take up the President's meeting with Bolsonaro with -- and what a close relationship with Brazil means for American security.  The Daily Caller's Christopher Bedford, the Hudson Institute's Michael Pillsbury among our guests tonight.  And the Trump economy still booming.  The White House today issuing the President's annual economic report.  For second consecutive year, the economy is out performing expectations.  Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett today touting the administration's extraordinary successes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS:  Getting a capital expenditure boom up about nine percent since the tax cuts passed and that nine percent capital spending boom is creating jobs and this year it's going to output and also continue.  We can see that in order's data.  And so the fact is that it's an old rule that I'm for economist that if you cut the cost to capital nine percent, then capital spending goes up nine percent.</p><p>And that's almost exactly what happened last year.  And that's we're very confident, it will continue.  I know --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  We take up the economy's strong performance and the positive impact to the President's tax cuts and deregulatory cuts.  We are joined by Trump 2020 Strategic Communications Director Marc Lotter and Trump 2020 Surrogate Gina Loudon.</p><p>Our top story, the Supreme Court today issuing a decision making it easier for Federal authorities to detain criminal illegal aliens prior to their deportation.  It's another victory for President Trump.  Justice Clarence Thomas siding with the administration's effort to act unilaterally in detaining criminal immigrants writing, \"I continue to believe that no court has jurisdiction to decide questions concerning the detention of aliens before final orders of removal have been entered.\"</p><p>The President is singlehandedly fighting for border security using his executive powers to declare a national emergency and then vetoing a resolution rejecting that declaration.  Attorney General William Barr, a man of the law, not politics defending the President's national emergency declaration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  The humanitarian and security crisis we have on the border right now is exactly the kind of emergency that presidents are permitted to address under the National Emergencies Act.  The crisis that we're dealing with today is right on our doorstep and it presents a real clear and present danger to the American people.  So what you've done from a legal standpoint is now that we grounded in law and from the standpoint of protecting the American people, it's imperative.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  The President also receiving another victory from the Defense Department.  The Pentagon identifying nearly $13 billion that could be used to fund the President's border wall.  The decision couldn't have come a moment too soon as tens of thousands of migrant families from Central America continue to try to enter our country illegally.  As National Correspondent William La Jeunesse shows us it's a situation that is overwhelming and already overworked border patrol.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  As the fight over the President's border policy continues, crews outside of San Diego just completed a 14-mile steel fence and started a second one.  Stretching from mountains to the ocean.</p><p>RODNEY SCOTT, CHIEF, SAN DIEGO BORDER PATROL:  This last year we've seen about a 700 percent increase in families and significant increase in unaccompanied minors here in San Diego.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  This weekend 52 migrants rushed through a hole in the old fence.  They tried to evade agents then claimed asylum when caught.  Unlike Mexicans who are quickly deported, Central Americans take hours to process to verify country of origin, travel documents, medical condition and available bed space.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Between 25 up to 40 percent of the agents are assigned non-patrol duties today processing transport or care and feeding of these -- of the family units.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We are seeing increasing medical problem as they come across the border.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Smuggler also use children as decoys, dropping off this six and nine-year-old over a fence, while t 10 migrants cross illegally only a mile away.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have to identify and then go apprehend every single person that crosses the border.  Whether they're claiming asylum, whether they're smuggling narcotics or whether they're involved in human trafficking.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  In a recent 73-day period, DHS released 84,000 immigrant families back into the United States.  In San Diego, nonprofits their own shelter to help ICE handle the overflow.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It has been a non-stop flow of people from anywhere from 50 to 140 people a day.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  The border fence stretched more than 650 miles when the President took office.  Now he's replaced about 140 miles of that with this new style bollard fence.  But he still wants at least 200 miles more either from the Defense Department or the 2020 budget.  David?</p><p>ASMAN:  William La Jeunesse, thank you very much.  Well, President Trump meeting with Brazilian President Bolsonaro, where the two leaders pledged to work together, economically, militarily and socially to create a stronger relationship.  Edward Lawrence has the very latest tonight from Washington.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINES NETWORK REPORTER:  Well, David, President Donald Trump and the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro talked about becoming closer trade allies, also becoming closer partners.  President Donald Trump saying he wants to elevate Brazil to be a major non-NATO ally.  That will open up opportunities for farmers.  Brazil will now allow 750,000 tons of wheat tariff free.</p><p>In exchange the U.S. will start a process to Brazilian beef.  The Brazilian president known as Trump of the tropics wants to try and open up his economic and spark a boom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  The President's vision for freeing the private sector and opening the economy is the right way for Brazil to achieve strong economic growth and our great companies are ready to go.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  The relationship of the two presidents has grown because of the crisis in Venezuela, Brazil has helped the U.S. get aid to much needed people in Venezuela who badly need medical supplies and food.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Together we could and have been really very happy to feed thousands and thousands of starving Venezuelans.  The Venezuelan people have appreciated it.  And if the Maduro forces would step aside it could be a truly great and successful humanitarian project.  We call on members of the Venezuelan military to end their support for Maduro.  Who is really nothing more than a Cuban puppet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  President Donald Trump says that all options or on the table to get Maduro out of power.  50 countries -- more than 50 counties around the world recognize Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela.  Brazil has not always been the best partner for the United States, it seems to change now with this new president, this meeting, very important meeting kicking off a new era in our relationship.  Thank you, David.</p><p>ASMAN:  Edward, thank you very much.  Well, we are learning new information tonight about just how long the Mueller witch-hunt has been investigating President Trump's former lawyer.  For details on probe into Michael Cohen we turn to Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  David, this heavily redacted court record show the investigation to Michael Cohen began nearly a year before the FBI raided his New York business in April, 2018.  The Special Counsel requested and obtained multiple warrants for Cohen's e-mails that covered correspondents during the presidential campaign.  The filing runs into the hundreds of pages and 19 are completely blacked out or redacted with the heading \"Illegal campaign contribution scheme, underlying how the President's greatest legal exposure may be in southern district of New York and unrelated to Russia collusion.\"</p><p>Cohen pled guilty to lying to Congress as well as multiple financial crimes including campaign finance violations after two women were paged to remain silence about alleged affairs  prior to the presidential election.  President Trump denies their allegations.  The unsealed court record show Federal investor s also wanted historical and future location data for Cohen's iPhones to confirm from where he sent and received e-mails.</p><p>In April 2018, the FBI sought and obtained authority to use an electronic technique known as Triggerfish.  On Fox earlier today, a former Justice Department official said, the investigative strategy is not common.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER DOJ PROSECUTOR:  I think it's probably is geo location and knowing where this guy is which could mean that they're trying to corroborate on an important point or could mean they're trying to find out if he's lying to them about an important point.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  The April 2018 timeframe may be significant because Cohen testified last month that he was told by U.S. attorney to not discuss his conversations after the FBI raid.  David?</p><p>ASMAN:  Catherine, thank you.  Still to come tonight.  Elizabeth Warren's ideas for America come at the cost of trillions of dollars.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  It's time to start the national full-blown conversation about reparations in this country.  We should make a big investment in housing.  Medicare for All.  The Green New Deal, I have got plans to reduce student loan debt.  Universal child care, universal pre-K for every child in America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  And it's all your money.  We take that up later tonight with the Trump 2020 Campaign's Marc Lotter and Gina Loudon.  But up next, Rod Rosenstein is still lurking around the Department of Justice.  So what is he up to?  We'll ask Judicial Watch's Tim Fitton when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has reached an agreement with Attorney General William Barr to stay on at the Justice Department for \"a little while longer.\"  Rosenstein who planned to step down in mid March is still main liaison between the Department and Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  But it's Barr who has had main oversight of the probe since his confirmation.</p><p>Joining me now is Tom Fitton, the President of Judicial Watch.  Good to see you, Tom.  So isn't it about time for Rosenstein to move on?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Look, it seems to me that Mueller is still running the Justice Department, and the Attorney General has got to take back control of his Justice Department.  Rod Rosenstein and Mueller have been working closely together on this abusive investigation targeting President Trump.  Rosenstein is responsible for obstruction of Congressional investigations covering up which way he can, details about the abuses of the Justice Department and the FBI and targeting President Trump and others.</p><p>And it's just remarkable to me that the Attorney General continues to have him in place in this position of power.  He is effectively running the Justice Department as number two.  That's what the A.G. does.  And by outsourcing control of the Justice Department to Rod Rosenstein, Mr. Barr is sending a signal that it's business as usual at the deep state.</p><p>ASMAN:  How long do you think he will be there?  I mean, it can't go on that much longer, can it?</p><p>FITTON:  Well, I think they have nominated someone to take over his slot.  So, you know, but it could be four, five, six months before that position is filled.  So, you could continue to -- as you highlight at the beginning of the segment effectively collaborate with Mr. Mueller as he continues this presidential harassment campaign.</p><p>ASMAN:  Meanwhile, we're learning a little bit more about the deep state and the witch-hunt through the Michael Cohen revelations.  The search warrant was released.  Can -- so much of it has been redacted.  Have you tried reading in between the redactions to try to come to some conclusion about it?</p><p>FITTON:  You know, I think the big takeaway of this is that you have the Mueller operation behind the abusive effort to impede on the President's attorney-client relationship with Michael Cohen.  They immediately began dismantling that expectation of privacy that clients have for communication with their attorneys almost immediately upon on his coming into office Mr. Mueller.  And then they outsourced it to the southern district of New York later but they weren't really fooling anyone because they were obviously operating as avatars for Mueller in raiding Cohen in that really unusual raid of an attorney.</p><p>You know, the President's attorney was subject to investigation.  I don't think they had good reason to target him other than the fact he was the President's attorney.  And again, Mueller behind an audacious attack on the President.  I'll tell you, the Attorney General has to figure out what's going on there.  And if I were him, I'd freeze the whole operation until he figures out what's up and down in terms of all the peculiar activities and corruption involved in the operation including Strzok, Page, the hiring and the firing, the FISA warrants.</p><p>Why would he allow that investigation to go forward given all the concerns about abuse of the -- of the Justice Department and the FBI.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, and the concerns now are boiling over in the American public.  I mean, it's not -- you don't have to be a fervent Trump supporter in order to believe it's a witch-hunt.  Now the majority of Americans do.  They got the message, they understand it.  I mean, there is enough evidence and there's enough push I think from the public itself to justify ending this, no?</p><p>FITTON:  I agree.  You know, the Justice Department was in court today arguing that states attorney, Maryland and other states had no business harassing the President on this emoluments clause, absurd litigation.</p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.</p><p>FITTON:  Yet the Justice Department seems to take the position they have the right to harass the President.  And they can investigate him anyway they want and this Mueller report is being used as a way to further abuse the President, hanging it over him.  And just causing worry and consternation about the operation of our government.  Again, this is the Justice Department.  The President under our constitution controls the Justice Department.</p><p>Yet the Justice Department is operating as if it's a fourth brand of government.  And the Attorney General I think needs to fix that.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, despite all of this, despite all the roadblocks to success the President continues to chock up victories.  The most recent with the Supreme Court over immigration was a close decision, it was a 5-4 but we read some comments by Justice Thomas just moments ago. What do you think of this decision?</p><p>FITTON:  Well, it's a big victory for the rule of law.  It's a case that goes to the Obama administration.  So this wasn't even a Trump administration policy.  Look, the left is attacking our efforts to hold up the rule of law and immigration by affording illegal aliens' rights, they're not due under our constitution.  And in this case, they wanted aliens who were released to not pick up immediately by ICE.</p><p>Wanted to give them the ability despite having committed crimes for which they have been jailed otherwise to be free on the streets.  And the court said no, the law doesn't allow that.  And, you know, just because ICE gets around later to arresting someone who ought to be detained doesn't mean they give up their rights to detain them.  And it's a common sense decision but the closeness shows that there is a legal effort under way to undermine the rule of law in immigration.</p><p>And I tell you, you know, a further challenge to this law may succeed with the Supreme Court.  And again, it will be just open borders mania as a result.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, and as I said, it was -- I was disappointed it was as close, it was a win but it shouldn't have been a 5-4 decision, and yet -- and yet there you go.  Tom Fitton, great to see you, my friend.  Thank you very much for being here.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome, David.</p><p>ASMAN:  And we'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this.  Share your comments and follow on Twitter @LouDobbs, like him Facebook and follow him on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Coming up.  Congressman Devin Nunes promises to sue more social media giants for political bias.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  This is the first of many lawsuits that are coming.  We have to help all of these people accountable because if we don't our First Amendment rights are at stake here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  The Daily Caller's Christopher Bedford joins me next with more.  But before we go to a break, a look at the U.S. national debt, $22.1 trillion and climbing.  We're back with more after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  President Trump today condemning big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook for their anticonservative bias against him and other prominent Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Thing are happening, names are taken off, people aren't getting through.  You've heard the same complaints and it seems to be if they're Conservative, if they're Republicans, if they're in a certain group, this discrimination and big discrimination.  I see it absolutely on Twitter.  So some things happening with those groups or folks that are running Facebook and Google and Twitter.  And I do think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>ASMAN:  Joining me now is Daily Caller News Foundation, Editor-In-Chief, Christopher Bedford.  Good to see you, Chris.  So where --</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION:  Good evening.</p><p>ASMAN:  -- do we go with the bias in social media?  I mean, nobody doubts, I don't think that they're shadow banning that goes on as much as they might protest and say it doesn't happen.  Most people realize it does.  It's clearly anticonservative but where do you go from there?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Yes.  So Twitter first started shadow banning people in an attempt to lower the impact that racist could have on conversation.  And what goes back and forth on Twitter.  And an investigation by Vice News which by -- is no one would ever call a conservative news outlet for sure found that this investigation, this -- the shadow banning by Twitter seemed to wrapping up a number of prominent Republicans including then Chairman Devin Nunes.</p><p>Now, they also found it didn't wrap up any Democrats, there was no one else who was in the Democratic Party who we shadow banned.  And time and time again, we see this.  With different search engines, with Facebook, with Twitter, and their response is always, well, hey, this was an accident, it shouldn't have happened.  They never quite explain how it happened.  And because there's a veil of secrecy around their formula which is kind of necessary for them to continue as a company.</p><p>They've been using that veil secrecy however and saying everything is actually a mistake.  But over and over again, these mistakes only target Republicans, and this is a real cause for concern about what's going on and who is making these decisions.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, we do know a little of what's going on which is that some of the algorithms were either developed by or continuing to be use with organization like the Southern Poverty Law Center which views just normal Conservatives as dealing in hate speech and awful things that lead to violence which is not at all true.</p><p>BEDFORD:  And the Southern Poverty Law Center does exactly what you said.  They grouped in a ton of Republicans, conserved publications, Christian groups and said that these are hate group.  And one part of their racket which is very lucrative racket is that they are parroted by left-wing press across the board.  We've had examples -- for example when The Daily Caller most of their staff was docked which means their personal details or their parents' addresses or their phone numbers were put on the internet and these were retweeted by groups on Twitter.</p><p>ASMAN:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  We reached out to Twitter on this and the first response we got was, this does not fit our examples of what harassment is.  Of course that was just somebody in one of the offices who made the call, probably someone with a strong, strong bias.</p><p>ASMAN:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  The time we got into San Francisco, we were able to get that shut down and get those tweets shut down.  But the average person who doesn't run a media company or isn't a Congressman doesn't have that weapon to be able to pull in and actually make Twitter do anything to stop it.</p><p>ASMAN:  Here's the interesting thing from my perspective as a journalist is that you could be discriminated against by the social media companies but at the same time use the social media companies to your political advantage and this is what President Trump already has been doing preparing for reelection.  We remember -- I remember when Jared Kushner, his son-in-law was on the cover of Forbes Magazine after 2016 was hailed as a genius by Forbes for what he did, how he used Facebook in targeting particular audiences.</p><p>They're at it again, they're -- I think $3-1/2 million they've spent on Facebook just in the past three or four months.  So, despite all of this bias, it's fascinating how the Trump reelection campaign it using it in order to pursue their political goals.</p><p>BEDFORD:  They've been extremely successful with it, but look at some of the public outcry over this.  When President Barack Obama used Facebook and social media, it was a victory.</p><p>ASMAN:  Oh, it was a victory.  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  He was viewed as a genius.</p><p>BEDFORD:  They had profiles, there were books written about intelligent this was.  And President Trump did the same thing, there were calls to put Steve Bannon and other people in prison over this.  They called nefarious. So, these platforms exists and they have huge amounts of power.  Facebook is one of the biggest arbiters of where people read their news in this entire country.  And when they use that power for ill it's very, very dangerous and it's very clear that all these social media companies are aligned politically and culturally against conservatives.</p><p>ASMAN:  And as they were in 2016 but again it didn't -- it didn't stop the election from happening the way it did.</p><p>I got to ask you about old Joe Biden and his pursuit of the presidency it seems to be edging ever closer, but do you think he's going to be able to elbow out all of the energy coming from the far left, from the socialists and others?</p><p>BEDFORD:  And he accidentally announced that he was running and then had to take it back.</p><p>ASMAN:  Sort of.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Yes, you know, (INAUDIBLE) he always said I'm the only candidate.  Well, hold on a second, I'm not a candidate yet.</p><p>ASMAN:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Joe Biden seems to be the kind of politician and the candy enough politician that he would be able to push aside a lot of this.  The amount of money he's raised has been pretty impressive already.</p><p>But the problem with Joe Biden is outside of President Barack Obama.  He has not been able to compete very well nationally.  His previous campaigns for national platforms of fizzled out very, very quickly when he was a side person to President Barack Obama who according to report, then he did very well.  So, how he will do without this colossal political figure backing him up, he could fizzle out just as quickly.</p><p>ASMAN:  And of course, all he has to do is defend the Obama record which when you compare eight years of President Obama with a couple of years of President Trump, it doesn't look so favorable when you look at the stats.  I know they love to say how wonderfully he did but again starting from zero practically anybody could.  He's got a tough record to defend and he's going to be forced to do so by President Trump.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Looking at it objectively, I totally agree with you, but a lot of the Democrats wish and pined for President Barack Obama to be back.  And anyone who would say we're going to bring it back to these golden years when President Barack Obama was in for seen, one of the most liberal agendas America has ever seen is going to get a lot of Democratic support.</p><p>ASMAN:  Christopher Bedford, good to see you, Chris.  Thank you very much.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Good to see you.</p><p>ASMAN:  Appreciate it.  Coming up next, prosecutors in Florida offer a plea deal for New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.</p><p>Plus, the U.S. and China are planning new high-level trade talks.  We're going to take that up and more with China expert Michael Pillsbury right after these quick messages.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Welcome back everyone.  I'm David Asman sitting in for Lou Dobbs.  Some headlines we're looking at tonight President Trump's new pick to lead the FAA is Steve Dickson.  Dickson is a former Delta pilot and V.P. of flight operations this coming amid growing scrutiny of the FAA after two crashes of Boeing planes.</p><p>Florida prosecutors reportedly offering to drop charges against New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.  In exchange, Kraft and all those charged must admit that they would have been found guilty at trial.  Last month, prosecutors charged Kraft with soliciting prostitution.</p><p>And U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin travelling to China next week for trade talks.  This coming after report the summit between President Trump and Xi Jingping may be delayed until June.</p><p>Joining me now is Dr. Michael Pillsbury, director of the Senate Center for Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute, author and trade advisor to the Trump administration.  Good to see you doctor.</p><p>You know, in the midst of all these trade negotiations and friendly smiles, shaking hands and everything, you have pretty disturbing reports like that report that was a Wall Street Journal exclusive of the Navy review of a cyber attack of one of our key new missile development programs which would go on our submarines around the world.  This was -- they had now have details of one of the most secret missile technologies we have.  How do you square that with these friendly trade negotiations?</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR, SENATE CENTER FOR CHINESE STRATEGY:  Well I don't think the trade negotiations are all that friendly, David.  I think they've been pretty fraught with tension and the fact that Secretary Mnuchin and Bob Lighthizer are going over yet again, I think it's a setback.</p><p>But frankly with China, we have a strange relationship.  We both prepare for war against each other.  Our military officers write articles about how to win war against each other.  But we also have this enormously complicated and rich economic relationship with each side investing heavily in the other efforts to decouple our supply chains with China.  Usually just shouted down by Wall Street.  So, it's a complex relationship and it's hard to take the temperature.  Know how are we doing, are we friends with China today but then we're military enemies tomorrow?  It's getting more difficult.</p><p>And President Trump is the first president to launch into this as you know.  So now, there's much more attention to how what China only thinks of America.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, and you mentioned supply chains.  One of the things that the trade negotiators are working on something called mandatory purchase orders.  The Wall Street Journal again wrote something about this because chip manufacturers, computer chip manufacturers in the U.S. are worried that these mandatory purchase orders may force them to set up some operations in China.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  That's right.</p><p>ASMAN:  In order to fulfill those requirements of how much we sell to the Chinese.  They're worried because they know in China it's virtually impossible to stop spying.  And of course, they have some real key corporate secrets in ship manufacturing.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  That's why I think the big news of the evening is the announcement confirmed by two sources to the Wall Street Journal that the secretary of the Treasury and our ambassador for trade are going back next week, this is pretty big news.</p><p>And also, the chip manufacturing community does not seem to like this idea of being forced to build more factories in China.  So, some of the aspects of this trade deal apparently are coming apart, and to put them back together again is in everybody's interest.  But I believe President Trump when he said at CPAC, I would had a pretty good seat when he said it.  He doesn't really want a deal if it's not a good deal in the -- for the long-term of the United States.  That's the issue we're facing now as we confront these new developments from China especially the spying on our military.</p><p>ASMAN:  Yes, and then there is the odd case of the willing cooperation, apparently of some companies in particular Google to cooperate with the Chinese, not cooperate with our Pentagon, but cooperate with the Chinese in a way that could directly benefit the military.  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, no less, General Joseph Dunford spoke to that point last week.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Yes.</p><p>ASMAN:  Let me just play a clip and get your reaction.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Very scary.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF:  The work that Google is doing in China is direct -- is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military.  But frankly, indirect maybe not a full characterization of the way it really is, it's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  Now Google, since that those remarks by Ggeneral Dunford has said, that's not true, we don't do anything that directly or indirectly benefits the military.  Who do you trust, General Dunford or Google?</p><p>PILLSBURY:  I trust General Dunford.  I saw the denial Google put out just a couple hours ago again in the Wall Street Journal who are really earning a Pulitzer Prize --</p><p>ASMAN:  They are.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  -- for the coverage of China.</p><p>ASMAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  But Google should be ashamed of itself.  There's no doubt about it.  This young man who quit Google and protests last summer revealed how far Google had gone, buying a place in China, buying a web site, beginning to help spy on the Chinese people.  If they Google something like Dalai Lama or a particular phrase.  Google's got a lot to apologize for.</p><p>ASMAN:  So, I'm sure what you have seen what I've seen is I cover the markets I see any strong hint that some positive element has happened in these trade talks, the markets go up.  If there's negativity, the markets go down.  I do think that there is going to be a pop if there's some kind of trade agreement.  You know, a market pop they'll see that as a positive.</p><p>Would you see that -- is it possible that the market could get it wrong?  I guess is what I'm asking that's something that is viewed by them is very positive may in the end be negative for the United States.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Well, a really good trade deal obviously could be a thousand points on the Dow Jones be a really big pop as you put it.  But a bad trade deal, that's what I'm worried about.  That there's no enforcement, that the Chinese do what they've been doing the last month or so.  They're passing laws and rules that don't have the word America in them.  They say all foreign companies will be treated better or all foreign investments will be treated fairly.  They're leaving out who started this, President Trump and America.  It's kind of insulting what they've been doing with these new laws and rules.  They've got to focus more on giving President Trump what he's asking for before this gets out of hand.</p><p>ASMAN:  Doctor Michael Pillsbury, great to see you doctor.  Thank you for coming in tonight, appreciate it.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Thanks David.</p><p>ASMAN:  Coming up next, President Trump says the end of socialism is near.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The twilight hour of socialism has arrived in our hemisphere and hopefully by the way, it's also arrived that twilight hour in our great country.  The last thing we want in the United States is socialism.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  We'll take that up and more after the break with the Trump 2020 campaigns Mark Water and Gina Loudon, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  On Wall Street, Stocks closed mix.  The Dow lost 27 points, the S&amp;P closed flat, the NASDAQ gained nine points, volume on the big board 3.6 billion shares.  Crude oil closing relatively flat at $59.00 a barrel, gold and silver also closing flat.</p><p>And the White House released its economic report proving the Trump economy continues to boom.  Real GDP growth hit 3.2 percent throughout the first three quarters of 2018.  $30 billion were saved through decreased regulations and the U.S. surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world's largest producer of crude oil.</p><p>And a reminder to listen to Lou's reports three times a day coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Well, Democrat presidential candidate Liz Warren revealing her unrealistic socialist proposals.  And according to recent estimates, her grand proposals will cost $100 trillion.  Warren socialist agenda includes the Green New Deal, universal child care, and slavery reparations.</p><p>Joining me now is Gina Loudon, Political Analysts, Author, and Member of President Trump's Media Advisory Board and Marc Lotter, Director of Strategic Communication for the Trump 2020 campaign, former Press Secretary to V.P. Pence.  Good to see you both.</p><p>Marc, let me start not with Liz Warren's economic plans, if you pardon the expression, but with the President -- what the President has actually done with the economy.  This economic report is incredible.  He just tweeted out something about his economic efforts.  He said, amazingly CNN just released a poll at 71 percent saying the economy is in the best shape since 2001, 18 years.  Wow, CNN becoming a believer.  What do you think of that?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN:  Well, the numbers are outstanding.  It's -- if we're finally starting to see in the polls what the economists and the data has shown for so long, that the low unemployment rate, rising wages, people are starting to feel more secure.</p><p>But one of the biggest Nuggets in that poll was it 42 percent of Americans, a plurality said that they are better off financially now than they were three years ago.  Only 15 percent said that they were worse off.  So it shows that this economy is working for everyone.  And that's one of the -- going to be one of the key messages heading into 2020.</p><p>ASMAN:  And Gina, the only way -- and I don't think even then you could buy into Liz Warren's solution, but the only way to buy into a solution -- a solution in quotes that that costs $100 trillion of taxpayer money, and I don't know where you're going to get that, is if you believe the economy is absolutely in desperate shape.</p><p>I mean, the worst shape, nothing compared to the Great Depression, I mean even worse than that.  And clearly, Americans don't feel it so.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, MEMBER, TRUMP'S MEDIA ADVISORY BOARD:  Well, if Elizabeth Warren and the Democrats who have become actually socialist, that's self-stated, that's not my implication, if they have their way we will be back in no time to the Great Depression.  Every single thing that they are proposing is either so completely desperate, David, that it makes absolutely no sense.  Or it's almost some ploy to just grab attention in headlines so that someone will write a story about them more so than an actual practical proposal.</p><p>Because everything that Democrats are saying is antithetical to this economy that the American people are enjoying.  It's excruciating to watch.</p><p>ASMAN:  And then Marc, you just do the math.  I mean, she comes out with these $100 trillion worth of proposals, and then she says she's going to pay for with a wealth tax.  If you were to tax a 100 percent of the wealthy in this country, you wouldn't get $1 trillion.</p><p>LOTTER:  You wouldn't even come close.</p><p>ASMAN:  So the point is that you've got $100 trillion here, $1 trillion dollars to pay for $100 trillion.  I mean, people can do the math.  Americans know how to do the math.</p><p>LOTTER:  And when you break it down, just the Green New Deal so not the additional $7 trillion she's proposing on top of the Green New Deal, it works out to about $5,000 a month coming out of every household's personal budget.  I think most Americans out there are would be shocked to say to look at their household monthly budget and then take $5,000 a month out of it.</p><p>It's just unrealistic.  It's not going to happen.  And that's why this election is not just about the results we were talking about, it's going to actually be a choice.  Do you want to keep this going or do you want go to Socialism?</p><p>ASMAN:  And then, Gina, you have the problem that they have with the Constitution.  The United States Constitution which they want to change on so many different levels.  Let's start with the Supreme Court.  Now, they want to go back to something that was last tried in 1937 by FDR when he tried to pack the Supreme Court by increasing its number and turn it into a political body.  Now it's being suggested as a real suggestion by Liz Warren, by Cory Booker, by a lot of Democrats.</p><p>LOUDON:  But it goes right along with all of their other desperate power grabs.  David, nothing they're proposing is for the sake of the American people.  Do you remember when the Democrats were the party of jobs and veterans?  Remember that?  This has all changed now.</p><p>This is all a massive power grab and a massive vote grab with one basic underlying principle, and that is that Americans have decided they will no longer vote for Democrats and that Democrats don't know what to do to ever win an election again except to cheat or grab power away from the American people when it's unconstitutional.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, they want to change the Constitution.  That's just the point Marc is that they don't believe in the Constitution.  They think that it's flawed on several different levels.  First of all with regard to the Supreme Court, the Electoral College, of course, is part of it.  I mean, they want to change America at its core, at its roots.</p><p>LOTTER:  And if the fundamental premise here is that when Democrats don't like the outcome, just change the rules.  Whether it's the Supreme Court, whether it's the -- whether it's the Electoral College, they now want 16-year-olds to vote, illegal aliens to vote.</p><p>LOUDON:  Illegals, yes.</p><p>LOTTER:  Where do you -- where do they stop, what rule won't they change in order to get power?</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, and again, Gina, it's not make America great again, it's change America to something that it never has been.  I mean, that -- there are a lot of Americans -- I think there are people that -- even Americans who want change who don't want to change the fundamental character, the basic principles on which this country was founded.</p><p>LOUDON:  But this is exactly why.  You know, people are going to vote their pocketbooks, David, when it all comes down to it.  As long as they feel safe which they feel safer than they've ever felt under this president, and as long as they have jobs and can provide for their families, those are the principles which they're going to vote -- under which they're going to vote.</p><p>And so everything that Democrats are proposing is a massive departure from everything that has been accomplished over the last couple of years.  And so I don't see how the Democrats win unless they start to come up with some ideas that are not radical and that actually support the economy and the national security that we have established at this point.</p><p>ASMAN:  It's going to be something to see.  Gina Loudon, Marc Lotter, great to see both of you.  Thank you for coming in.  I appreciate it.</p><p>LOUDON:  Great to see you.</p><p>ASMAN:  Coming up next, President Trump sees Brazil as a top military ally in the Western Hemisphere.  We'll have more on that when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  President Trump today welcoming the new Brazilian president, Bolsonaro at the White House.  The two aiming to strengthen trade, energy, and military cooperation.  Trump even suggesting Brazil could be given NATO privileges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I also intend to designate Brazil as a major non-NATO ally or even possibly if you start thinking about it, maybe a NATO ally.  I have to talk to a lot of people, but maybe a NATO ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  And a critical Supreme Court ruling, Justices upholding the Trump Administration's right to detain criminal illegal immigrants prior to their deportation.  Also, the Wall Street Journal reporting that former Vice President Joe Biden reach out to at least a half dozen supporters today to tell them he intends to run for president.</p><p>That's it for us tonight.  Lou is back tomorrow.  He's going to be speaking with White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett, Congressman Mark Green, and National Security Expert K.T. McFarland.</p><p>And at a programming note, my show \"BULLS AND BEARS\" airs every weeknight at 5:00 p.m. Eastern right here on Fox Business Network.  We hope to see you there.  Thanks for joining us.  Good night from New York.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2194268476</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPY-H751-JBHT-D2CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7104\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm David Asman sitting in for Lou Dobbs. The Supreme Court today handing President Trump a major victory in his effort to combat national security crisis at our southern border. The court upholding administration's right to detain criminal illegal immigrants prior to their deportation. We take up the decision with Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, President Trump today meeting with Brazilian President Bolsonaro. The two leaders pledging the strength and ties on security and trade, promoting democracy and capitalism in the western hemisphere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There relationship that we have right now with Brazil is never been better. I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents. His zero hostility with me. We're working on different military sites and military options, we're working on visas and going in a much easier fashion. One of the big elements of the relationship is trade.</p><p>Brazil makes great product and we make great products, so I think our trade with brazil will go substantially up in both directions and we look forward to that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: We take up the President's meeting with Bolsonaro with -- and what a close relationship with Brazil means for American security. The Daily Caller's Christopher Bedford, the Hudson Institute's Michael Pillsbury among our guests tonight. And the Trump economy still booming. The White House today issuing the President's annual economic report. For second consecutive year, the economy is out performing expectations. Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett today touting the administration's extraordinary successes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: Getting a capital expenditure boom up about nine percent since the tax cuts passed and that nine percent capital spending boom is creating jobs and this year it's going to output and also continue. We can see that in order's data. And so the fact is that it's an old rule that I'm for economist that if you cut the cost to capital nine percent, then capital spending goes up nine percent.</p><p>And that's almost exactly what happened last year. And that's we're very confident, it will continue. I know --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: We take up the economy's strong performance and the positive impact to the President's tax cuts and deregulatory cuts. We are joined by Trump 2020 Strategic Communications Director Marc Lotter and Trump 2020 Surrogate Gina Loudon.</p><p>Our top story, the Supreme Court today issuing a decision making it easier for Federal authorities to detain criminal illegal aliens prior to their deportation. It's another victory for President Trump. Justice Clarence Thomas siding with the administration's effort to act unilaterally in detaining criminal immigrants writing, \"I continue to believe that no court has jurisdiction to decide questions concerning the detention of aliens before final orders of removal have been entered.\"</p><p>The President is singlehandedly fighting for border security using his executive powers to declare a national emergency and then vetoing a resolution rejecting that declaration. Attorney General William Barr, a man of the law, not politics defending the President's national emergency declaration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: The humanitarian and security crisis we have on the border right now is exactly the kind of emergency that presidents are permitted to address under the National Emergencies Act. The crisis that we're dealing with today is right on our doorstep and it presents a real clear and present danger to the American people. So what you've done from a legal standpoint is now that we grounded in law and from the standpoint of protecting the American people, it's imperative.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: The President also receiving another victory from the Defense Department. The Pentagon identifying nearly $13 billion that could be used to fund the President's border wall. The decision couldn't have come a moment too soon as tens of thousands of migrant families from Central America continue to try to enter our country illegally. As National Correspondent William La Jeunesse shows us it's a situation that is overwhelming and already overworked border patrol.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: As the fight over the President's border policy continues, crews outside of San Diego just completed a 14-mile steel fence and started a second one. Stretching from mountains to the ocean.</p><p>RODNEY SCOTT, CHIEF, SAN DIEGO BORDER PATROL: This last year we've seen about a 700 percent increase in families and significant increase in unaccompanied minors here in San Diego.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: This weekend 52 migrants rushed through a hole in the old fence. They tried to evade agents then claimed asylum when caught. Unlike Mexicans who are quickly deported, Central Americans take hours to process to verify country of origin, travel documents, medical condition and available bed space.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Between 25 up to 40 percent of the agents are assigned non-patrol duties today processing transport or care and feeding of these - - of the family units.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are seeing increasing medical problem as they come across the border.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Smuggler also use children as decoys, dropping off this six and nine-year-old over a fence, while t 10 migrants cross illegally only a mile away.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have to identify and then go apprehend every single person that crosses the border. Whether they're claiming asylum, whether they're smuggling narcotics or whether they're involved in human trafficking.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: In a recent 73-day period, DHS released 84,000 immigrant families back into the United States. In San Diego, nonprofits their own shelter to help ICE handle the overflow.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It has been a non-stop flow of people from anywhere from 50 to 140 people a day.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: The border fence stretched more than 650 miles when the President took office. Now he's replaced about 140 miles of that with this new style bollard fence. But he still wants at least 200 miles more either from the Defense Department or the 2020 budget. David?</p><p>ASMAN: William La Jeunesse, thank you very much. Well, President Trump meeting with Brazilian President Bolsonaro, where the two leaders pledged to work together, economically, militarily and socially to create a stronger relationship. Edward Lawrence has the very latest tonight from Washington.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINES NETWORK REPORTER: Well, David, President Donald Trump and the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro talked about becoming closer trade allies, also becoming closer partners. President Donald Trump saying he wants to elevate Brazil to be a major non-NATO ally. That will open up opportunities for farmers. Brazil will now allow 750,000 tons of wheat tariff free.</p><p>In exchange the U.S. will start a process to Brazilian beef. The Brazilian president known as Trump of the tropics wants to try and open up his economic and spark a boom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The President's vision for freeing the private sector and opening the economy is the right way for Brazil to achieve strong economic growth and our great companies are ready to go.</p><p>LAWRENCE: The relationship of the two presidents has grown because of the crisis in Venezuela, Brazil has helped the U.S. get aid to much needed people in Venezuela who badly need medical supplies and food.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Together we could and have been really very happy to feed thousands and thousands of starving Venezuelans. The Venezuelan people have appreciated it. And if the Maduro forces would step aside it could be a truly great and successful humanitarian project. We call on members of the Venezuelan military to end their support for Maduro. Who is really nothing more than a Cuban puppet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: President Donald Trump says that all options or on the table to get Maduro out of power. 50 countries -- more than 50 counties around the world recognize Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Brazil has not always been the best partner for the United States, it seems to change now with this new president, this meeting, very important meeting kicking off a new era in our relationship. Thank you, David.</p><p>ASMAN: Edward, thank you very much. Well, we are learning new information tonight about just how long the Mueller witch-hunt has been investigating President Trump's former lawyer. For details on probe into Michael Cohen we turn to Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: David, this heavily redacted court record show the investigation to Michael Cohen began nearly a year before the FBI raided his New York business in April, 2018. The Special Counsel requested and obtained multiple warrants for Cohen's e- mails that covered correspondents during the presidential campaign. The filing runs into the hundreds of pages and 19 are completely blacked out or redacted with the heading \"Illegal campaign contribution scheme, underlying how the President's greatest legal exposure may be in southern district of New York and unrelated to Russia collusion.\"</p><p>Cohen pled guilty to lying to Congress as well as multiple financial crimes including campaign finance violations after two women were paged to remain silence about alleged affairs prior to the presidential election. President Trump denies their allegations. The unsealed court record show Federal investor s also wanted historical and future location data for Cohen's iPhones to confirm from where he sent and received e-mails.</p><p>In April 2018, the FBI sought and obtained authority to use an electronic technique known as Triggerfish. On Fox earlier today, a former Justice Department official said, the investigative strategy is not common.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER DOJ PROSECUTOR: I think it's probably is geo location and knowing where this guy is which could mean that they're trying to corroborate on an important point or could mean they're trying to find out if he's lying to them about an important point.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE: The April 2018 timeframe may be significant because Cohen testified last month that he was told by U.S. attorney to not discuss his conversations after the FBI raid. David?</p><p>ASMAN: Catherine, thank you. Still to come tonight. Elizabeth Warren's ideas for America come at the cost of trillions of dollars.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: It's time to start the national full-blown conversation about reparations in this country. We should make a big investment in housing. Medicare for All. The Green New Deal, I have got plans to reduce student loan debt. Universal child care, universal pre-K for every child in America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: And it's all your money. We take that up later tonight with the Trump 2020 Campaign's Marc Lotter and Gina Loudon. But up next, Rod Rosenstein is still lurking around the Department of Justice. So what is he up to? We'll ask Judicial Watch's Tim Fitton when we come back.</p><p>ASMAN: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has reached an agreement with Attorney General William Barr to stay on at the Justice Department for \"a little while longer.\" Rosenstein who planned to step down in mid March is still main liaison between the Department and Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But it's Barr who has had main oversight of the probe since his confirmation.</p><p>Joining me now is Tom Fitton, the President of Judicial Watch. Good to see you, Tom. So isn't it about time for Rosenstein to move on?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Look, it seems to me that Mueller is still running the Justice Department, and the Attorney General has got to take back control of his Justice Department. Rod Rosenstein and Mueller have been working closely together on this abusive investigation targeting President Trump. Rosenstein is responsible for obstruction of Congressional investigations covering up which way he can, details about the abuses of the Justice Department and the FBI and targeting President Trump and others.</p><p>And it's just remarkable to me that the Attorney General continues to have him in place in this position of power. He is effectively running the Justice Department as number two. That's what the A.G. does. And by outsourcing control of the Justice Department to Rod Rosenstein, Mr. Barr is sending a signal that it's business as usual at the deep state.</p><p>ASMAN: How long do you think he will be there? I mean, it can't go on that much longer, can it?</p><p>FITTON: Well, I think they have nominated someone to take over his slot. So, you know, but it could be four, five, six months before that position is filled. So, you could continue to -- as you highlight at the beginning of the segment effectively collaborate with Mr. Mueller as he continues this presidential harassment campaign.</p><p>ASMAN: Meanwhile, we're learning a little bit more about the deep state and the witch-hunt through the Michael Cohen revelations. The search warrant was released. Can -- so much of it has been redacted. Have you tried reading in between the redactions to try to come to some conclusion about it?</p><p>FITTON: You know, I think the big takeaway of this is that you have the Mueller operation behind the abusive effort to impede on the President's attorney-client relationship with Michael Cohen. They immediately began dismantling that expectation of privacy that clients have for communication with their attorneys almost immediately upon on his coming into office Mr. Mueller. And then they outsourced it to the southern district of New York later but they weren't really fooling anyone because they were obviously operating as avatars for Mueller in raiding Cohen in that really unusual raid of an attorney.</p><p>You know, the President's attorney was subject to investigation. I don't think they had good reason to target him other than the fact he was the President's attorney. And again, Mueller behind an audacious attack on the President. I'll tell you, the Attorney General has to figure out what's going on there. And if I were him, I'd freeze the whole operation until he figures out what's up and down in terms of all the peculiar activities and corruption involved in the operation including Strzok, Page, the hiring and the firing, the FISA warrants.</p><p>Why would he allow that investigation to go forward given all the concerns about abuse of the -- of the Justice Department and the FBI.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN: Well, and the concerns now are boiling over in the American public. I mean, it's not -- you don't have to be a fervent Trump supporter in order to believe it's a witch-hunt. Now the majority of Americans do. They got the message, they understand it. I mean, there is enough evidence and there's enough push I think from the public itself to justify ending this, no?</p><p>FITTON: I agree. You know, the Justice Department was in court today arguing that states attorney, Maryland and other states had no business harassing the President on this emoluments clause, absurd litigation.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>FITTON: Yet the Justice Department seems to take the position they have the right to harass the President. And they can investigate him anyway they want and this Mueller report is being used as a way to further abuse the President, hanging it over him. And just causing worry and consternation about the operation of our government. Again, this is the Justice Department. The President under our constitution controls the Justice Department.</p><p>Yet the Justice Department is operating as if it's a fourth brand of government. And the Attorney General I think needs to fix that.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, despite all of this, despite all the roadblocks to success the President continues to chock up victories. The most recent with the Supreme Court over immigration was a close decision, it was a 5-4 but we read some comments by Justice Thomas just moments ago. What do you think of this decision?</p><p>FITTON: Well, it's a big victory for the rule of law. It's a case that goes to the Obama administration. So this wasn't even a Trump administration policy. Look, the left is attacking our efforts to hold up the rule of law and immigration by affording illegal aliens' rights, they're not due under our constitution. And in this case, they wanted aliens who were released to not pick up immediately by ICE.</p><p>Wanted to give them the ability despite having committed crimes for which they have been jailed otherwise to be free on the streets. And the court said no, the law doesn't allow that. And, you know, just because ICE gets around later to arresting someone who ought to be detained doesn't mean they give up their rights to detain them. And it's a common sense decision but the closeness shows that there is a legal effort under way to undermine the rule of law in immigration.</p><p>And I tell you, you know, a further challenge to this law may succeed with the Supreme Court. And again, it will be just open borders mania as a result.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, and as I said, it was -- I was disappointed it was as close, it was a win but it shouldn't have been a 5-4 decision, and yet -- and yet there you go. Tom Fitton, great to see you, my friend. Thank you very much for being here.</p><p>FITTON: You're welcome, David.</p><p>ASMAN: And we'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this. Share your comments and follow on Twitter @LouDobbs, like him Facebook and follow him on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Coming up. Congressman Devin Nunes promises to sue more social media giants for political bias.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA: This is the first of many lawsuits that are coming. We have to help all of these people accountable because if we don't our First Amendment rights are at stake here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: The Daily Caller's Christopher Bedford joins me next with more. But before we go to a break, a look at the U.S. national debt, $22.1 trillion and climbing. We're back with more after this.</p><p>ASMAN: President Trump today condemning big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook for their anticonservative bias against him and other prominent Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Thing are happening, names are taken off, people aren't getting through. You've heard the same complaints and it seems to be if they're Conservative, if they're Republicans, if they're in a certain group, this discrimination and big discrimination. I see it absolutely on Twitter. So some things happening with those groups or folks that are running Facebook and Google and Twitter. And I do think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>ASMAN: Joining me now is Daily Caller News Foundation, Editor-In-Chief, Christopher Bedford. Good to see you, Chris. So where --</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION: Good evening.</p><p>ASMAN: -- do we go with the bias in social media? I mean, nobody doubts, I don't think that they're shadow banning that goes on as much as they might protest and say it doesn't happen. Most people realize it does. It's clearly anticonservative but where do you go from there?</p><p>BEDFORD: Yes. So Twitter first started shadow banning people in an attempt to lower the impact that racist could have on conversation. And what goes back and forth on Twitter. And an investigation by Vice News which by -- is no one would ever call a conservative news outlet for sure found that this investigation, this -- the shadow banning by Twitter seemed to wrapping up a number of prominent Republicans including then Chairman Devin Nunes.</p><p>Now, they also found it didn't wrap up any Democrats, there was no one else who was in the Democratic Party who we shadow banned. And time and time again, we see this. With different search engines, with Facebook, with Twitter, and their response is always, well, hey, this was an accident, it shouldn't have happened. They never quite explain how it happened. And because there's a veil of secrecy around their formula which is kind of necessary for them to continue as a company.</p><p>They've been using that veil secrecy however and saying everything is actually a mistake. But over and over again, these mistakes only target Republicans, and this is a real cause for concern about what's going on and who is making these decisions.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, we do know a little of what's going on which is that some of the algorithms were either developed by or continuing to be use with organization like the Southern Poverty Law Center which views just normal Conservatives as dealing in hate speech and awful things that lead to violence which is not at all true.</p><p>BEDFORD: And the Southern Poverty Law Center does exactly what you said. They grouped in a ton of Republicans, conserved publications, Christian groups and said that these are hate group. And one part of their racket which is very lucrative racket is that they are parroted by left-wing press across the board. We've had examples -- for example when The Daily Caller most of their staff was docked which means their personal details or their parents' addresses or their phone numbers were put on the internet and these were retweeted by groups on Twitter.</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: We reached out to Twitter on this and the first response we got was, this does not fit our examples of what harassment is. Of course that was just somebody in one of the offices who made the call, probably someone with a strong, strong bias.</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: The time we got into San Francisco, we were able to get that shut down and get those tweets shut down. But the average person who doesn't run a media company or isn't a Congressman doesn't have that weapon to be able to pull in and actually make Twitter do anything to stop it.</p><p>ASMAN: Here's the interesting thing from my perspective as a journalist is that you could be discriminated against by the social media companies but at the same time use the social media companies to your political advantage and this is what President Trump already has been doing preparing for reelection. We remember -- I remember when Jared Kushner, his son-in-law was on the cover of Forbes Magazine after 2016 was hailed as a genius by Forbes for what he did, how he used Facebook in targeting particular audiences.</p><p>They're at it again, they're -- I think $3-1/2 million they've spent on Facebook just in the past three or four months. So, despite all of this bias, it's fascinating how the Trump reelection campaign it using it in order to pursue their political goals.</p><p>BEDFORD: They've been extremely successful with it, but look at some of the public outcry over this. When President Barack Obama used Facebook and social media, it was a victory.</p><p>ASMAN: Oh, it was a victory. Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN: He was viewed as a genius.</p><p>BEDFORD: They had profiles, there were books written about intelligent this was. And President Trump did the same thing, there were calls to put Steve Bannon and other people in prison over this. They called nefarious. So, these platforms exists and they have huge amounts of power. Facebook is one of the biggest arbiters of where people read their news in this entire country. And when they use that power for ill it's very, very dangerous and it's very clear that all these social media companies are aligned politically and culturally against conservatives.</p><p>ASMAN: And as they were in 2016 but again it didn't -- it didn't stop the election from happening the way it did.</p><p>I got to ask you about old Joe Biden and his pursuit of the presidency it seems to be edging ever closer, but do you think he's going to be able to elbow out all of the energy coming from the far left, from the socialists and others?</p><p>BEDFORD: And he accidentally announced that he was running and then had to take it back.</p><p>ASMAN: Sort of.</p><p>BEDFORD: Yes, you know, (INAUDIBLE) he always said I'm the only candidate. Well, hold on a second, I'm not a candidate yet.</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: Joe Biden seems to be the kind of politician and the candy enough politician that he would be able to push aside a lot of this. The amount of money he's raised has been pretty impressive already.</p><p>But the problem with Joe Biden is outside of President Barack Obama. He has not been able to compete very well nationally. His previous campaigns for national platforms of fizzled out very, very quickly when he was a side person to President Barack Obama who according to report, then he did very well. So, how he will do without this colossal political figure backing him up, he could fizzle out just as quickly.</p><p>ASMAN: And of course, all he has to do is defend the Obama record which when you compare eight years of President Obama with a couple of years of President Trump, it doesn't look so favorable when you look at the stats. I know they love to say how wonderfully he did but again starting from zero practically anybody could. He's got a tough record to defend and he's going to be forced to do so by President Trump.</p><p>BEDFORD: Looking at it objectively, I totally agree with you, but a lot of the Democrats wish and pined for President Barack Obama to be back. And anyone who would say we're going to bring it back to these golden years when President Barack Obama was in for seen, one of the most liberal agendas America has ever seen is going to get a lot of Democratic support.</p><p>ASMAN: Christopher Bedford, good to see you, Chris. Thank you very much.</p><p>BEDFORD: Good to see you.</p><p>ASMAN: Appreciate it. Coming up next, prosecutors in Florida offer a plea deal for New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.</p><p>Plus, the U.S. and China are planning new high-level trade talks. We're going to take that up and more with China expert Michael Pillsbury right after these quick messages.</p><p>ASMAN: Welcome back everyone. I'm David Asman sitting in for Lou Dobbs. Some headlines we're looking at tonight President Trump's new pick to lead the FAA is Steve Dickson. Dickson is a former Delta pilot and V.P. of flight operations this coming amid growing scrutiny of the FAA after two crashes of Boeing planes.</p><p>Florida prosecutors reportedly offering to drop charges against New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. In exchange, Kraft and all those charged must admit that they would have been found guilty at trial. Last month, prosecutors charged Kraft with soliciting prostitution.</p><p>And U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin travelling to China next week for trade talks. This coming after report the summit between President Trump and Xi Jingping may be delayed until June.</p><p>Joining me now is Dr. Michael Pillsbury, director of the Senate Center for Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute, author and trade advisor to the Trump administration. Good to see you doctor.</p><p>You know, in the midst of all these trade negotiations and friendly smiles, shaking hands and everything, you have pretty disturbing reports like that report that was a Wall Street Journal exclusive of the Navy review of a cyber attack of one of our key new missile development programs which would go on our submarines around the world. This was -- they had now have details of one of the most secret missile technologies we have. How do you square that with these friendly trade negotiations?</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR, SENATE CENTER FOR CHINESE STRATEGY: Well I don't think the trade negotiations are all that friendly, David. I think they've been pretty fraught with tension and the fact that Secretary Mnuchin and Bob Lighthizer are going over yet again, I think it's a setback.</p><p>But frankly with China, we have a strange relationship. We both prepare for war against each other. Our military officers write articles about how to win war against each other. But we also have this enormously complicated and rich economic relationship with each side investing heavily in the other efforts to decouple our supply chains with China. Usually just shouted down by Wall Street. So, it's a complex relationship and it's hard to take the temperature. Know how are we doing, are we friends with China today but then we're military enemies tomorrow? It's getting more difficult.</p><p>And President Trump is the first president to launch into this as you know. So now, there's much more attention to how what China only thinks of America.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, and you mentioned supply chains. One of the things that the trade negotiators are working on something called mandatory purchase orders. The Wall Street Journal again wrote something about this because chip manufacturers, computer chip manufacturers in the U.S. are worried that these mandatory purchase orders may force them to set up some operations in China.</p><p>PILLSBURY: That's right.</p><p>ASMAN: In order to fulfill those requirements of how much we sell to the Chinese. They're worried because they know in China it's virtually impossible to stop spying. And of course, they have some real key corporate secrets in ship manufacturing.</p><p>PILLSBURY: That's why I think the big news of the evening is the announcement confirmed by two sources to the Wall Street Journal that the secretary of the Treasury and our ambassador for trade are going back next week, this is pretty big news.</p><p>And also, the chip manufacturing community does not seem to like this idea of being forced to build more factories in China. So, some of the aspects of this trade deal apparently are coming apart, and to put them back together again is in everybody's interest. But I believe President Trump when he said at CPAC, I would had a pretty good seat when he said it. He doesn't really want a deal if it's not a good deal in the -- for the long- term of the United States. That's the issue we're facing now as we confront these new developments from China especially the spying on our military.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes, and then there is the odd case of the willing cooperation, apparently of some companies in particular Google to cooperate with the Chinese, not cooperate with our Pentagon, but cooperate with the Chinese in a way that could directly benefit the military. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, no less, General Joseph Dunford spoke to that point last week.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes.</p><p>ASMAN: Let me just play a clip and get your reaction.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Very scary.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: The work that Google is doing in China is direct -- is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military. But frankly, indirect maybe not a full characterization of the way it really is, it's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: Now Google, since that those remarks by Ggeneral Dunford has said, that's not true, we don't do anything that directly or indirectly benefits the military. Who do you trust, General Dunford or Google?</p><p>PILLSBURY: I trust General Dunford. I saw the denial Google put out just a couple hours ago again in the Wall Street Journal who are really earning a Pulitzer Prize --</p><p>ASMAN: They are.</p><p>PILLSBURY: -- for the coverage of China.</p><p>ASMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>PILLSBURY: But Google should be ashamed of itself. There's no doubt about it. This young man who quit Google and protests last summer revealed how far Google had gone, buying a place in China, buying a web site, beginning to help spy on the Chinese people. If they Google something like Dalai Lama or a particular phrase. Google's got a lot to apologize for.</p><p>ASMAN: So, I'm sure what you have seen what I've seen is I cover the markets I see any strong hint that some positive element has happened in these trade talks, the markets go up. If there's negativity, the markets go down. I do think that there is going to be a pop if there's some kind of trade agreement. You know, a market pop they'll see that as a positive.</p><p>Would you see that -- is it possible that the market could get it wrong? I guess is what I'm asking that's something that is viewed by them is very positive may in the end be negative for the United States.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, a really good trade deal obviously could be a thousand points on the Dow Jones be a really big pop as you put it. But a bad trade deal, that's what I'm worried about. That there's no enforcement, that the Chinese do what they've been doing the last month or so. They're passing laws and rules that don't have the word America in them. They say all foreign companies will be treated better or all foreign investments will be treated fairly. They're leaving out who started this, President Trump and America. It's kind of insulting what they've been doing with these new laws and rules. They've got to focus more on giving President Trump what he's asking for before this gets out of hand.</p><p>ASMAN: Doctor Michael Pillsbury, great to see you doctor. Thank you for coming in tonight, appreciate it.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Thanks David.</p><p>ASMAN: Coming up next, President Trump says the end of socialism is near.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The twilight hour of socialism has arrived in our hemisphere and hopefully by the way, it's also arrived that twilight hour in our great country. The last thing we want in the United States is socialism.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: We'll take that up and more after the break with the Trump 2020 campaigns Mark Water and Gina Loudon, stay with us.</p><p>ASMAN: On Wall Street, Stocks closed mix. The Dow lost 27 points, the S&amp;P closed flat, the NASDAQ gained nine points, volume on the big board 3.6 billion shares. Crude oil closing relatively flat at $59.00 a barrel, gold and silver also closing flat.</p><p>And the White House released its economic report proving the Trump economy continues to boom. Real GDP growth hit 3.2 percent throughout the first three quarters of 2018. $30 billion were saved through decreased regulations and the U.S. surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world's largest producer of crude oil.</p><p>And a reminder to listen to Lou's reports three times a day coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Well, Democrat presidential candidate Liz Warren revealing her unrealistic socialist proposals. And according to recent estimates, her grand proposals will cost $100 trillion. Warren socialist agenda includes the Green New Deal, universal child care, and slavery reparations.</p><p>Joining me now is Gina Loudon, Political Analysts, Author, and Member of President Trump's Media Advisory Board and Marc Lotter, Director of Strategic Communication for the Trump 2020 campaign, former Press Secretary to V.P. Pence. Good to see you both.</p><p>Marc, let me start not with Liz Warren's economic plans, if you pardon the expression, but with the President -- what the President has actually done with the economy. This economic report is incredible. He just tweeted out something about his economic efforts. He said, amazingly CNN just released a poll at 71 percent saying the economy is in the best shape since 2001, 18 years. Wow, CNN becoming a believer. What do you think of that?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Well, the numbers are outstanding. It's -- if we're finally starting to see in the polls what the economists and the data has shown for so long, that the low unemployment rate, rising wages, people are starting to feel more secure.</p><p>But one of the biggest Nuggets in that poll was it 42 percent of Americans, a plurality said that they are better off financially now than they were three years ago. Only 15 percent said that they were worse off. So it shows that this economy is working for everyone. And that's one of the -- going to be one of the key messages heading into 2020.</p><p>ASMAN: And Gina, the only way -- and I don't think even then you could buy into Liz Warren's solution, but the only way to buy into a solution -- a solution in quotes that that costs $100 trillion of taxpayer money, and I don't know where you're going to get that, is if you believe the economy is absolutely in desperate shape.</p><p>I mean, the worst shape, nothing compared to the Great Depression, I mean even worse than that. And clearly, Americans don't feel it so.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, MEMBER, TRUMP'S MEDIA ADVISORY BOARD: Well, if Elizabeth Warren and the Democrats who have become actually socialist, that's self- stated, that's not my implication, if they have their way we will be back in no time to the Great Depression. Every single thing that they are proposing is either so completely desperate, David, that it makes absolutely no sense. Or it's almost some ploy to just grab attention in headlines so that someone will write a story about them more so than an actual practical proposal.</p><p>Because everything that Democrats are saying is antithetical to this economy that the American people are enjoying. It's excruciating to watch.</p><p>ASMAN: And then Marc, you just do the math. I mean, she comes out with these $100 trillion worth of proposals, and then she says she's going to pay for with a wealth tax. If you were to tax a 100 percent of the wealthy in this country, you wouldn't get $1 trillion.</p><p>LOTTER: You wouldn't even come close.</p><p>ASMAN: So the point is that you've got $100 trillion here, $1 trillion dollars to pay for $100 trillion. I mean, people can do the math. Americans know how to do the math.</p><p>LOTTER: And when you break it down, just the Green New Deal so not the additional $7 trillion she's proposing on top of the Green New Deal, it works out to about $5,000 a month coming out of every household's personal budget. I think most Americans out there are would be shocked to say to look at their household monthly budget and then take $5,000 a month out of it.</p><p>It's just unrealistic. It's not going to happen. And that's why this election is not just about the results we were talking about, it's going to actually be a choice. Do you want to keep this going or do you want go to Socialism?</p><p>ASMAN: And then, Gina, you have the problem that they have with the Constitution. The United States Constitution which they want to change on so many different levels. Let's start with the Supreme Court. Now, they want to go back to something that was last tried in 1937 by FDR when he tried to pack the Supreme Court by increasing its number and turn it into a political body. Now it's being suggested as a real suggestion by Liz Warren, by Cory Booker, by a lot of Democrats.</p><p>LOUDON: But it goes right along with all of their other desperate power grabs. David, nothing they're proposing is for the sake of the American people. Do you remember when the Democrats were the party of jobs and veterans? Remember that? This has all changed now.</p><p>This is all a massive power grab and a massive vote grab with one basic underlying principle, and that is that Americans have decided they will no longer vote for Democrats and that Democrats don't know what to do to ever win an election again except to cheat or grab power away from the American people when it's unconstitutional.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, they want to change the Constitution. That's just the point Marc is that they don't believe in the Constitution. They think that it's flawed on several different levels. First of all with regard to the Supreme Court, the Electoral College, of course, is part of it. I mean, they want to change America at its core, at its roots.</p><p>LOTTER: And if the fundamental premise here is that when Democrats don't like the outcome, just change the rules. Whether it's the Supreme Court, whether it's the -- whether it's the Electoral College, they now want 16- year-olds to vote, illegal aliens to vote.</p><p>LOUDON: Illegals, yes.</p><p>LOTTER: Where do you -- where do they stop, what rule won't they change in order to get power?</p><p>ASMAN: Well, and again, Gina, it's not make America great again, it's change America to something that it never has been. I mean, that -- there are a lot of Americans -- I think there are people that -- even Americans who want change who don't want to change the fundamental character, the basic principles on which this country was founded.</p><p>LOUDON: But this is exactly why. You know, people are going to vote their pocketbooks, David, when it all comes down to it. As long as they feel safe which they feel safer than they've ever felt under this president, and as long as they have jobs and can provide for their families, those are the principles which they're going to vote -- under which they're going to vote.</p><p>And so everything that Democrats are proposing is a massive departure from everything that has been accomplished over the last couple of years. And so I don't see how the Democrats win unless they start to come up with some ideas that are not radical and that actually support the economy and the national security that we have established at this point.</p><p>ASMAN: It's going to be something to see. Gina Loudon, Marc Lotter, great to see both of you. Thank you for coming in. I appreciate it.</p><p>LOUDON: Great to see you.</p><p>ASMAN: Coming up next, President Trump sees Brazil as a top military ally in the Western Hemisphere. We'll have more on that when we come back.</p><p>ASMAN: President Trump today welcoming the new Brazilian president, Bolsonaro at the White House. The two aiming to strengthen trade, energy, and military cooperation. Trump even suggesting Brazil could be given NATO privileges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I also intend to designate Brazil as a major non-NATO ally or even possibly if you start thinking about it, maybe a NATO ally. I have to talk to a lot of people, but maybe a NATO ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: And a critical Supreme Court ruling, Justices upholding the Trump Administration's right to detain criminal illegal immigrants prior to their deportation. Also, the Wall Street Journal reporting that former Vice President Joe Biden reach out to at least a half dozen supporters today to tell them he intends to run for president.</p><p>That's it for us tonight.

Good morning, everyone. We're going to get started over here. My name is Margaret Kaczor, I am the research analyst at William Blair &amp; Companywho covers DexCom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First off, I'd like to welcome you guys to the 30th Annual Growth Stock Conference. Our primary objective during these days of the conference is to present a variety of interesting investment ideas from our research universe. So these companies, both of which are relatively new and others that we've followed for many years, in our opinion, are a great representation of our quality growth philosophy. So we do appreciate your attendance and hope that you guys enjoy the conference.</p><p>Before we get started with our first company here, I just want to run through a few logistical details. First, you guys have a small booklet that you've received at registration. It contains the final agenda as well as room assignments for all the formal presentations and the breakout sessions. Second, with the exception of the last presentations of the day in which the breakout is going to be held in the same presentation room, the breakout sessions are all located on the seventh floor and specific room locations will be announced at the end of each of the formal presentations.</p><p>If you do have any questions regarding the conference, feel free to inquire at the registration desk or to any William Blair representative. In terms of disclosures, I am required to inform you that I personally own shares of DexCom. Beyond that, you can obtain a complete list of research disclosures or potential conflicts of interest at williamblair.com.</p><p>So before I turn it over to Steve and Matt, in terms of my preamble on the company, DexCom's been one of the best performing stocks in our coverage universe year-to-date.</p><p>And a lot of that's really been driven by 2 things: number one, competition to enter the market and despite a lot of fears that maybe with compressed shares, compressed price, it's actually not done that. In fact, it's expanded the market in terms of growth and adoption. Number two, the company received FDA approval for its next-generation sensor through an entirely new FDA regulatory pathway that should not only accelerate innovation but also keep DexComa step ahead of its peers in our opinion. So we think these are early signs over the next 5 years to push towards CGM is going to accelerate and whether that's driven by innovation, big tech, payers, patients, it should double or triple in size relative to where it is today, which is less than a quarter penetrated.</p><p>So we do find this to be an attractive market. We find DexComto be an attractive stock. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve and Matt.</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI, EVP OF STRATEGY &amp; CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT, DEXCOM, INC.: Thanks, Margaret. I was going to let you actually keep going, you were kind of on a roll there. So good morning. Good morning, everyone. So what we talked about with Margaret, I'll probably do about maybe 10 or, maybe, 15 minutes of kind of high-level overview slides for those of you who are a little bit less familiar with the company and then we'll kind of jump into Q&amp;A and then continue to Q&amp;A in the breakout session.</p><p>Briefly, the safe harbor statement. So what you see on the screen here is that we've characterized the diabetes management ecosystem. You see companies play in many aspects of the ecosystem. What we have highlighted here in green is kind of the glucose measurement and the analytic side of the business and this is really where DexComis focused. We're the industry leader in continuous glucose monitoring. So we have industry-leading technology for continuously sensing a patient's blood sugar levels. And more recently, we've really delved into the data analytics side. So what you'll start to see from the company is not just continued leadership in the sensing business but also data analytics capabilities in terms of helping patients make better decisions to manage their diabetes.</p><p>From a drug delivery perspective, we've actually opted to partner with industry-leading companies, such as Insulet, the manufacturer of the OmniPod; Tandem, which is the manufacturer of the durable insulin pump. We work with all of the insulin companies who manufacture injectables, some are also working on insulin pump technology. We've chosen, at this point, though to stay out of the drug delivery business. Obviously, we're not a drug company so we began partnering with the insulin companies. And then on the service side, we're actually starting to do some exploration into how does our technology apply outside of just the intensively managed patients. So how do we bring our technologies into type 2 patients? How do we bring our technologies into the hospital, into gestational diabetes? And so you'll hear more from that in the coming months and years.</p><p>So managing diabetes is really a delicate balancing act. Patients are really trying to maintain a blood sugar in a target range without going too high or too low. When patients are too high, they're called hyperglycemia. These patients -- this is when they're experiencing -- they don't really feel the effects of hyperglycemia, but it's with high blood sugar, they're really causing all of the long-term chronic complications, the micro- and macro-vascular damage associated with diabetes. So when you think about cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy, kidney failure, this is all caused by patients having elevated blood sugar levels. So the patients are constantly to take insulin, constantly trying to bring that blood sugar down into a target range. The problem is, insulin, once on board, is really hard to control. It's really hard to stop. If you over -- take too much insulin. And if they take too much insulin, they end up with low blood sugar or hypoglycemia. And it's really hypoglycemia is what patients actually fear the most, right? When patients are low, they start to feel a little clammy, they get -- start to lose -- you'll see them get a little sweaty, start to lose cognitive function. And if not treated, if they don't get glucose into their system, they can actually pass out on the floor. It's not uncommon to see a patient literally hit the floor. And if not treated then probably by an EMT, could end up in a coma and actually could end up dead.</p><p>So it's really trying -- that delicate balance that the patient is trying to maintain can only be achieved through continuous glucose monitoring. I can show you -- the unfortunate reality today, patients spend about 70% of their time outside of the target range, they're either too high or too low. It's a really, really tough disease to manage.</p><p>So historically, patients have used, to manage their blood sugars, a single-point fingerstick. And what you're seeing in this slide, is a day in the life of a typical patient. They would take 4 fingersticks. They're going to take a fingerstick, check their blood sugar at breakfast, at lunch, at dinner and then at bedtime. The problem is, this patient would look at the 4 fingersticks and actually come to some incorrect conclusions and think, \"I had a pretty good day. Two of my fingersticks were actually within the target zone and my high for the day was a little north of 200 milligrams per deciliter, which is elevated but not terrible.\" But then when you overlay a continuous glucose monitoring trace, you see a completely different picture. This patient was above their target range for almost 14 hours. And more importantly, if you look about 4:00 a.m., this patient actually missed a dangerous hypoglycemia event. So this patient was probably still asleep. With continuous glucose monitoring, this patient would've actually been alerted to this low. Unfortunately, this patient during this portion of their clinical trial is actually blinded to the CGM data. So he didn't have the benefit of a critically important alarm at 4:00 a.m. So really, it's only by means of continuous glucose monitoring, not intermittent monitoring, that patients have the appropriate alerts and alarms to take action to manage their diabetes.</p><p>So this is where it starts. Our technology is really all about the sensor. As Margaret mentioned, the FDA recently approved our sixth generation product. Really, a step function for many of you who follow the company, really yet another leap forward in terms of our technology. We now have a sensor labeled by the FDA to be worn by patients for 10 days. The system no longer has to be calibrated and I can't overemphasize how important that is. So historically, our products require the patient to take a single-point fingerstick every 12 hours to calibrate the device. Now, the patient actually, with the new simple one-button inserter, click the sensor, push a button, sensor is inserted, pop in the transmitter. After a brief warm-up period, away they go, with no calibrations for a full 10 days. It's a remarkable user experience. It's a much more consumer-friendly user experience.</p><p>The transmitter on the body is much smaller than our prior transmitter. It's about 30% smaller than the prior transmitter. We've added predictive alerts. So I mentioned how important alerts are to the patient to let them know if they're crossing a threshold. Now we actually can predict up to 30 minutes in advance when a patient is going to either too high or too low so then they could actually intervene in advance of having a dangerous high or a dangerous low.</p><p>And as Margaret mentioned, as part of this approval, the FDA actually reclassified us. We followed a de novo process and the FDA is now actually down classified sensors if they meet certain special controls. And I can explain what that means. The FDA has established very, very rigorous controls. And basically said, if you can meet -- any sensor company, if you can meet these controls, you now qualify as a Class II CGM device. What this does is, this enables us now to iterate our products much more rapidly, while maintaining a level of performance required by the FDA that we believe is going to be very tough for any of our competitors to meet. So we were quite pleased this approval came in at the end of the first quarter of this year. Quite, quite pleased with the FDA and the work we did there.</p><p>So as I mentioned, the goal of the FDA is really to help us advance interoperability, and this 510(k) process is really designed to call it -- we're not classified as an iCGM or interoperable CGM. The goal with the FDA is to try to help advance our ability to interoperate with other technologies. So what you see on the screen here, as you see the insulin patch pump, that's an OmniPod, we're working together with Insulet to incorporate our sensor technology into the OmniPod. Working with the insulin companies, over time, we believe, be it DexComor the insulin companies themselves, we're going to develop technologies probably phone-based technologies to take our sensor data, their insulin data, marry those 2 together and really provide a much more holistic picture for the patient and really provide them key decision support help on how to better manage their diabetes. You see a Tandem pump there also making great progress with our partner at Tandem.</p><p>We extend that with the iCGM. What else can we do? We can extend the wearables. So we worked with Apple. We actually were announced by Apple as the first company they're going to let as a medical device display directly on the Apple Watch without having to use the phone as an intermediary. We're also working with Fitbit, working with Samsung on their wearable technologies.</p><p>We capture a lot of data. If you imagine patients using their phone to read their CGM. We're receiving 288 data points per day. We're capturing those 288 data points. With the patient's permission, we're able to share that data with other providers of decision-support, we can share with the doctors, with the patient, with caregivers. So wonderful work going on there, really opening up this architecture and really driven as much by DexComand by the FDA to open up this architecture and make this data available, really how the patient wants the data, who they want to share their data with and how they want their data displayed.</p><p>So today our market is really focused -- it's just the beginning, right? We're really focused today on the intensively managed patient. What I mean by that is, patients who have either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes who have progressed to a point in type 2 where they're actually taking insulin at mealtime. There's about -- we estimate about 3 million total people in the U.S. and another maybe 3 million people in Europe that fall into that category. And that's for the foreseeable future, for the next several years, that intensively managed business is going to be the vast majority of our revenues. But when you look at the overall market, that's a tiny piece -- a tiny sliver, that intensively managed patient population.</p><p>Just in Europe and the U.S. alone, we estimate there are roughly 60 million people living with type 2 diabetes and we're working together with United Healthcare and with some other providers to really figure out how we can apply our technology in the best fashion and sort of think about almost like a diabetes prevention program. Patients will wear sensors, will capture other data, really work with the patient and the provider and the caregiver to modify their drug regimens, modify exercise, modify diet. And these programs are really in their infancy at this point. You're going to hear it much, much more about these in the coming quarters. But then our takeaway here is we're just in the beginning in terms of our market opportunity.</p><p>And then finally, before we open up to some Q&amp;A. Our future is in miniaturization. Again, we're -- our core focus is always going to be on the sensor. We engaged in a relationship with Verily, which is the life sciences arm at Google, a couple years back to develop really some super miniaturized sensor technologies, really leveraging some expertise Google has on the microelectronic side, miniaturized radios, miniaturized batteries, data analytics capabilities to marry that technology with our core sensor technology. And so you should see the first products coming out within the next year or so with kind of what we call the home run product is probably coming in 2020. And that'll be a fully disposable, just a tiny little sensor that's worn on the body for up to targeting 14 days. The patient will wear that, insert it, it will talk to their phone and after that 14-day wear, they'll throw the thing away and put on another one. So truly remarkable, kind of game-changing sensor technology for us. And again, more on that to come in the coming quarters. So with that, I'll open it up to questions. Margaret?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: Q</p><p>Well, I'll start out and then we'll go to the audience. But just to -- overnight and this morning, you guys actually had some news. So first, maybe on the CE mark that you received for the G6. How important do you think the G6 technology is for you guys in Europe? Could it help open new markets or what's the game plan over there?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: Yes. I think it's critically important. As I mentioned, our target focus right now is really on this kind of 3 million patients in the U.S. and 3 million patients in Europe who are intensively managed, who take mealtime insulin. The performance and convenience aspects of G6 is game-changing. Not having to calibrate the device, the accuracy, not having to calibrate, but maintaining a level of accuracy that far exceeds anyone else in the industry is critical. So I think the CE mark and our ability to roll G6 out in Europe -- we'll probably start in the U.K. and then kind of roll it out into the other markets. Germany obviously has been a big market for us in the coming months.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: Good. And the other piece of news was that you received approval for mobile devices for Medicare, which happened yesterday. So maybe walk us through that and whether that could increase interest demand or maybe even impact P&amp;L a bit.</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: Yes. So what Margaret's referring to is, we received Medicare coverage actually at the beginning of 2017 in a sort of a roundabout way. I don't want to go into the details now. It took us months to actually get to the place where we could put the processes in place to actually bill Medicare. Medicare has subsequently been a great market for us. But one of the critical aspects to our system is the ability for patients to use a mobile device, to not only to manage their diabetes by themselves, but also to share their data with a caregiver. So imagine a parent sending a child to school can no longer have to stress all day that the child is either taking fingersticks or who's managing their child, but the parent can be wherever they are as long as they're with their mobile device and could actually follow the kid in real time. Medicare, for some weird nuances in the way Medicare classified our system, Medicare actually initially prohibited the use of a cell phone. So we're quite pleased and actually we were at a point where we're having to tell Medicare patients if they were using their phone, we would obviously know, because we could track their data. We have to actually call them and tell them they have to stop using it or else Medicare would stop reimbursing for them. So very pleased. We've worked really hard and this has been a 15-month process. We worked really hard to push with CMS. And literally just yesterday, we announced that Medicare has changed the language in our approval so patients can actually take advantage of the mobile technology that we provide.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: I think there was a question in the middle over there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. What's the hurdle or what has to happen to get the other 90% of the market?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: That's a great question. So...</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: If you can repeat the question?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: So the question is, what has to happen for us to get to the other 90% of the market. It's a couple of things. I mean, first and foremost, we need to figure out what the right usage case is for the vast majority of type 2s. We don't believe -- so people taking intensive insulin like intensive insulin therapies, so meaning they're taking mealtime injections whether they're type 1 or type 2, have wild fluctuations in their blood sugar every day. So these are people who we believe need to wear sensors in real time, all the time. When you tick the -- per typical type 2 because they can't take an injection. If they're not taking an injection of insulin with or right after or right before a meal, it isn't as simple as just taking a correction to try to correct an excursion. So really what we're trying to do there is figure out how do we apply our sensor technology to this broad base of people to ultimately to reduce costs. That's what the payers care about. But really, how do we apply the technology, both sensor technology, I think, activity data, diet, exercise and marry all this data together and then really help the patient work with the clinician to either change their drugs, maybe hopefully prevent the patient from going onto the next most expensive drug. What typically happens today is, the patient will go on that format and then they want to see their blood sugars -- their average blood sugars will creep up, they'll put them on another drug and then another drug and then another drug. It's not uncommon to see type 2s on 5 or 6 or 7 compounds, very expensive for the system. If we can either prevent that next drug from patient from going on that next drug or, better yet, actually redo some of the drugs just by changing timing of dosage or changing their diet, changing their exercise, working together with their doctor could be huge. But we don't think that market is going to be patients wearing sensors in real time, all of the time. It's going to be much more kind of diagnostic programmatic, if that makes sense. And so still working through bringing some pilots we announced late -- early this year. A pilot of about 10,000 patients we're working on with United Healthcare to really figure out together with United how they've got the claims data, really how do we apply this technology in the appropriate manner and really bring down cost for the patient, for the payer, for the system. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Are you wearing a 6, Margaret...</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: I am now wearing a 6.</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: I'm actually wearing a 6.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: I still have to get access to one first.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I'm sorry, but can you just walk through how you are able to do the recalibration?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: The recalibration?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: How you calibrate on the 6. How are you able to improve that?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: Yes. So the Gen 6 sensor, so it's a combination of things. Our technology really is kind of threefold. Let me characterize it as the core sensor technology that the chemistry that goes around the wire that sits under the skin. The algorithms that basically translate. So we measure at a very low -- we measure at picoamps, we measure an electrical signal under the skin, then we have to translate into a usable value, a number that the patient can read. And then the kind of the third most critical, another critical piece, is the ability to manufacture repeatedly. So -- and that's a critical component with Gen 6 to be able -- we've done some additional automation. So advancing the sensor technology, advancing the algorithms, but then being able to make these things super repeatable. So every sensor that comes off the line is basically the same. What you'll find with other companies, other competitors, some of their sensors work okay, others don't work hardly at all. And it's really -- a lot of it is lot to lot variability that they find in manufacturing. They just can't produce them repeatedly. It's kind of a combination of those things that just allowed us to get to a place where we knew we needed to maintain a level of performance. We were already with our G5. We were at an industry level performance -- industry-leading performance in terms of our accuracy. We decided, as a company, that before we would go to a no-calibration sensor, that we needed to be comfortable, that we could produce that level of performance in accuracy while eliminating calibrations. And we got there.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: Great. So maybe just to get back for a second to the G6. You had mentioned launching initially in the U.K. So maybe talk to us why the U.K. is the right market for you to launch there and why Germany's the right second market.</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: I mean, the U.K. and Germany will launch somewhat simultaneously. To be honest, you have to translate the IFU and things like -- there's some work to be done to get it into Germany. It just takes a little longer. Germany -- the Germany and U.K. will both launch in Q3 and then try to roll out to the rest of Europe through the balance of the year.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: Does it change your reimbursement structure at all in any of these countries?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: Great question. It's kind of country-by-country. But the short answer is, I don't believe so. I think -- and we've kind of guided The Street that while we have the opportunity going from a 7-day sensor to a 10-day sensor to potentially pick up some additional price in terms of our modeling and our guidance, we're right now assuming that pricing is going to remain relatively stable in terms of going to a 10-day sensor.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: What's the pricing versus drugs?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: So pricing today, we're roughly, when you include the transmitter, somewhere between $8 to $10 per day. A typical patient on -- actually, I should -- historically, a typical patient is going to spend around $3 or $4 per day taking fingersticks. That pricing now has come down quite dramatically. So today, the fingersticks are probably in the -- maybe a patient spends a couple bucks a day. But again, hard to compare apples-to-apples, right? We're providing the equivalent of 288 fingerstick measurements per day plus proactive alerts, alarms. I mean, it's really difficult to try to compare the 2 technologies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Will the G6 have to use a phone?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: No. The G6 does not have to use the phone. So there is a separate dedicated handheld, but the patient has the option to use either the handheld or their phone. We're exploring options where -- today, the FDA actually mandates that the patient have a receiver as a backup in case their phone dies. We're exploring with the FDA, they're getting more comfortable with the use of mobile technologies. To be in a place where the patient wouldn't have to buy if they don't want -- for example, I'm wearing a G6 today. I don't even have a receiver with me. I just use my phone. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So you talked about the 2 big competitors that are in the market with you. And it's different things (inaudible). And I understand that, but they're very successful. Someone on Libre is unlikely to go with G6 because they're satisfied in that market because the people are more interested. (inaudible) training ground...</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: Yes. I would say the latter, quite the opposite. In fact, what we've seen -- we've got much more experience with Libre in Europe, because they've been out for a couple of years. One of the big impediments we've had to adoption over the years is just the willingness of someone to wear something on their body, right? Because there's an internal transmitter, the radio transmitter sits outside of the body. What we found is that patients who try Libre, Libre is more cost effective to start than a DexCom but not nearly as feature rich. It's not a true CGM. It's an intermittent monitor. What we found though is, that patients are comfortable wearing, particularly in the reimbursed market, if patients are comfortable wearing something on their body, they start with a Libre, try it, and then they progress to a DexCom. So yes, it's actually the opposite. Libre's been quite successful. They've added a number of patients, or at least they had quite a few patients try the system, largely result of the fact that it's pretty inexpensive to get onto the system. In the U.S, for example, they have very little reimbursement, it's really just a cash pay product right now that they're kind of rebating down to make it a little more affordable for the patient. Our understanding is their attrition rates are pretty high, that the patients aren't really sticking to the technology. But as Margaret mentioned at the outset, we are seeing with the aggressive marketing that Abbott is doing with that Libre product, it really is creating a significantly greater awareness of kind of sensing as a category. And it's kind of a rising tide, it lifts all boats, it's been a great thing for us. On the Medtronic side, Medtronic is really a struggle. They just recently announced approval of a standalone sensor. We haven't really seen it much yet. It's going to be a sensor that, at a minimum, requires 2 calibrations per day to obtain any level of reasonable accuracy. What we're hearing -- seeing in their clinical data, patients are having to calibrate it closer to 4 times a day. So really hard to convince someone to wear a sensor, they have to calibrate every 6 hours versus one that you don't have to calibrate at all. So we'll have to see how that one plays out when they actually launch it.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: Steve, I think there's one in the middle here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, just what with -- from the perspective of the patients obviously (inaudible) effectively a generation of saying that. I just wondered (inaudible).</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: Why would someone continue to use a strip? Either, lack of awareness, believe it or not, that they haven't been exposed to CGM. Economics is always a big one. I mean, there's still -- while we have broad reimbursement here in the U.S. and in Europe, there's still a co-pay associated with it. But I do believe now that we've moved -- the technology has progressed to a point where incremental improvements now in accuracy are probably not that significant because the patient is not going to be able to perceive them. But making it, like I showed you with the Verily product, making it smaller, just making the entirety of the system more user-friendly, more consumer-friendly for the patient, continuing to develop new and better tools to help the patient. But I think 20 years from now, you're not going to find anybody on intensive insulin using anything other than a sensor. I just can't imagine why you would.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: And then, Steve, you guys launched the G6, I believe June 4 was the right day...</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: Yes, just beginning of June. Yes.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: So you're a few weeks in. I know it's extremely early, but it seems like you're actually marketing pretty aggressively already, or at least picked up the marketing spend. So maybe walk through why and what you see...</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: Yes, we did -- if you read the blogs, we did more of a limited launch starting in May and the demand generation was just off the charts. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on the quarter or anything like that, but we've seen just the demand curve just go up pretty significantly on this product. People are real excited to get their hands on it. So it's still early in the full launch rollout. So we'll probably give better commentary when we do our Q2 call in 45 days or so but so far, so good.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: And then...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Insurance companies reimburse?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: They do. We're typically lumped into the bucket of what they call durable medical equipment. So let's say, a patient is going to spend somewhere -- or a patient together with insurance is going to spend somewhere around 30 -- $3,000 to $3,500 per year, the insurance company is going to pay basically 80% of that and the patient will be responsible for about 20%.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And Medicare will pay for the whole thing?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: So Medicare is a little bit different. There is a co-pay associated with Medicare. So Medicare is actually a bundled solution. So with Medicare, we -- basically the first month, we ship the handheld receiver and the first set of sensors with the transmitter. And then each month thereafter, the patient is on a subscription model. So we bill Medicare monthly, and we call the patient or email the patient saying, what supplies do you need as part of the bundle and ship them the supplies they need. It's actually a wonderful model. We would look to actually try to mirror that Medicare model if we could with some of the commercial payers because it's much more predictable and much more efficient for DexCom.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: And then the last question for me and I got to finish with this because last year at our conference I asked Kevin, what he saw CGM penetration was going to be in 2022? And I think he said 80%. But how has your thought process changed since then, whether it's changed to the space, the iCGM, the Libre approval, has that shifted at all relative to that?</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: No. I mean -- I assume he is referring to type 1 patients.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: Yes.</p><p>STEVEN R. PACELLI: In the U.S., I don't know if that's not -- I mean, that is realistic, I believe. I mean, Libre is actually -- Libre has actually helped in terms of market awareness. I still think we need to -- while insurance does cover the product, I think we need to still improve access for patients. It's still -- not now, we're talking on the way in from the airport were talking about the patient who had like 15 or 16 interactions with their insurance company just to get approved. It's easier to buy a house than it is to get a sensor sometimes. So we need to improve access. We need to continue to improve the user-friendliness, the on-body footprint needs to continue to shrink, the performance characteristics. Again, I think we've reached a point where we're getting close to kind of a diminishing return in terms of improved performance, but if we can continue forward with some of the other feature sets that we've talked about, there's no reason that we can't achieve that level of penetration.</p><p>MALGORZATA MARIA KACZOR: Good. Well, with that, we're going to finish off here. And the breakout will be held downstairs, one floor in the Oak Room.

Again, thanks for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Good evening, everybody. For more than six weeks now, the City of Portland has been under siege by radical leftist mobs who are intent on destroying everything America stands for and the leftwing Democrat Mayor of Portland, eagerly supporting the anarchists, the leftwing activist and is permitting unchecked mayhem in the city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the head of the Department of Homeland Security tore into the radical Dem leadership in Portland for allowing lawless anarchists as he called them to destroy and desecrate that city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For 47 straight days and nights now, leftist groups like Rose City Antifa and Black Lives Matter have plunged Portland into chaos. The leftist activists attacking citizens and destroying property and the Mayor just grins at it all. Law enforcement under constant attack, and today, the police had to step in to clear two downtown parks of demonstrators trying to create their own Autonomous Zone.</p><p>Businesses have lost millions of dollars because of the rioting and the looting, and Federal buildings, including the Courthouse have been firebombed and vandalized.</p><p>Acting D.H.S. Secretary Chad Wolf today said that, quote, \"A Federal Courthouse is a symbol of justice. To attack it is to attack America.\" End quote. I would add, to attack a city is to attack America.</p><p>Federal D.H.S. and D.O.J. officers and agents have been deployed to protect the courthouse and other Federal buildings and to keep the mobs in check.</p><p>The radical Dems aren't happy about that. They don't want the Federal agents in Portland for obvious reasons, because the Feds, of course will protect citizens and they will protect property, and they will enforce the law.</p><p>How leftwing is the City of Portland and Oregon and their representatives in Washington and the leaders of their city and state? Well, a letter signed by Oregon's two U.S. senators and two radical Dem Members of Congress. The Fed's response was described by them as intolerable to try to protect life and limb and property.</p><p>Portland's activist radical Dem Mayor Ted Wheeler also claims it's the Federal agents who are causing all of the problems. There he is in all his glory. He wants them to just clean up the graffiti on Federal buildings and to allow Antifa to run rampant through Portland, to continue their rampage against law and order and the citizens of that city.</p><p>This isn't the first time, by the way, Wheeler has clashed with the Feds. In 2018, protesters created the Occupy I.C.E. Movement. You may recall that, harassing Federal agents for weeks. Mayor Wheeler cheered on the anarchists then, just as he does now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR TED WHEELER (D-OR), PORTLAND: To all demonstrators, I urge you to keep up this effort. We will continue to support the safe expression of First Amendment rights.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We invited Mayor Wheeler to join us here for full expression of First Amendment rights to join the broadcast, but our calls and our e-mails reaching out to this advocate of the First Amendment went unreturned.</p><p>In his statement today, Secretary Wolf summed up the situation, the crisis in Portland saying, quote, \"Instead of addressing violent criminals in their communities, local and state leaders are instead focusing on placing blame on law enforcement and requesting fewer officers in their community. This failed response has only emboldened the violent mob as it escalates violence day after day.\"</p><p>And what we are witnessing in Portland is occurring across the country.</p><p>As chaos unfolds in Portland, the New York Police Department today has been making arrests after a high ranking officer and several others were injured during a protest -- one of those peaceful protests you know how those go -- a female arrested today. She is suspected of being the one seen here wielding a cane and hitting police officers over the head. The NYPD says the woman is having a psychiatric evaluation now at a local hospital but is in custody.</p><p>Some officers involved in yesterday's clash with protesters along the Brooklyn Bridge, well, bones were broken. They are receiving staples to the head to fix their injuries. Among those injured, the Chief of the Department, Terence Monahan, the NYPD's highest-ranking uniformed officer injured in this clash. This is how out of control things are in New York City.</p><p>At least 36 people have been arrested during that protest. At least one person was charged with assault. It is quite a scene.</p><p>The Trump administration has been intimating an announcement on how it plans to intervene in cities with a rise in violent crime and with, well, governments that are not responding to protect their citizens.</p><p>The President's decision to stand in solidarity with police, with all law enforcement has earned him a key endorsement for the presidential election from the National Association of Police Unions.</p><p>The officers they represent are dealing with what is nothing less than a massive rise in violence in their cities. Again, cities led by Democrats.</p><p>In Los Angeles, shootings have risen 28 percent. In New York, they're up 130 percent. And California's Governor, Gavin Newsom is planning to release 18,000 prisoners into the public by the end of August.</p><p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has already released more than 1,500 prison inmates citing concerns about the China virus. And today, de Blasio even bragged about his city being a safer place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY: We now have fewer people in our jails than any time since World War II and we are safer for it and better for it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: That is borderline moronic to suggest that the way to get fewer people incarcerated is to simply release them from prison. But there you heard it from the good socialist, Bill de Blasio.</p><p>Recent data shows murders in the country's largest 25 cities are up 16 percent compared to a year ago. Crime has also risen in Minneapolis, as you might expect, where City Council members are working to entirely disband their police department.</p><p>Fox News correspondent Mike Tobin is in Minneapolis with the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHAEL TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Following riots and public demonstrations against the Minneapolis Police, the city is now seeing a surge in crime. Homicides have doubled this year. Gun crimes dramatically outpaced last year.</p><p>People who live and work where the riots hits say prostitution, drugs and burglary are now unabated and they want help from the police.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It reminds me of Gotham City. So I'll call it the Gotham City of Minneapolis.</p><p>TOBIN (on camera): Because of what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because of the kind of lawlessness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOBIN (voice over): Members of the Minneapolis City Council made the announcement that they want to disband the police replacing cops with the Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention.</p><p>With a segment of the public and the City Council against them, the police union says morale is terrible. Officers don't proactively police and are reluctant to use force.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SGT. ANNA HEDBERG, POLICE OFFICERS FEDERATION OF MINNEAPOLIS: Because any situation can turn violent. Something as simple as, you know, theft report could be an ambush situation. And you know, anybody might be out there to try to amp up a call just to put us into a situation where we have to use physical force and force hardly ever looks good on camera.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOBIN (on camera): According to an attorney specializing in workplace disability claims, in the last six weeks, 160 Minneapolis police officers started the process of filing for disability. Most of those are officers who say they're suffering posttraumatic stress.</p><p>In Minneapolis, Mike Tobin, Fox News.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: Mike, thank you very much.</p><p>And coming up here next -- well, first let's take a look at Wall Street. Stocks finishing lower. The Dow Jones Industrials down 135 points. The S&amp;P, down 11. The NASDAQ lost 77 points. Volume on the big board, moderate trading, four billion shares.</p><p>Crude oil down more than a percent, but still well above $40.00. $40.72 a barrel.</p><p>A reminder listen to my reports three times a day, coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Up next, a major shakeup in the Trump campaign. Is this the change needed for the President's re-election victory? Ed Rollins joins us with that, next.</p><p>We'd also like to promote my new book, so here we go. \"The Trump Century: How Our President Changed the Course of History Forever.\" Just to drive the left nuts, preorder your copy or copies. There's something they don't like about the title. I can't put my finger on it. They just don't seem to like \"The Trump Century.\"</p><p>You can preorder at thetrumpcentury.com and drive the lefty nuts, amazon.com, Barnes and Noble as well. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking News now. Most voters Pennsylvania believe there is a silent majority -- a silent majority that supports President Trump's re- election.</p><p>The latest Monmouth University poll finds 57 percent say there are so called secret voters in Pennsylvania who support Trump, but don't tell anyone what they're about to do.</p><p>On Election Day in 2016, the silent majority was born out, FiveThirtyEight's polling average had Hillary Clinton up by nearly four points with a 77 percent chance of winning. \"The New York Times\" by the way, famously suggested 91 percent chance of winning. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania by more than 44,000 votes.</p><p>President Trump making a change to his re-election campaign, removing Brad Parscale as his campaign manager, Bill Stepien now takes over in Parscale's place.</p><p>Stepien previously served as Deputy Campaign Manager. He is also the Political Director for the Trump transition team -- he was -- and a National Field Director during the 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>Parscale will lead digital and data strategies as he has throughout and remains on as a senior adviser. President Trump tweeted, \"Both men were heavily involved in our historic 2016 win and I look forward to having a big and very important second win together.\"</p><p>Joining us tonight to take all of this up, former Reagan White House political director, Republican strategist, Fox Business political analysts, the savant himself, Ed Rollins.</p><p>Ed, I don't see a smile on your face. You've been calling for Parscale's removal on this show repeatedly for weeks, and here we go. Did the move surprise you that the President made last --</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK POLITICAL ANALYST: It was a necessary move. One, you need to bring some intensity to this campaign. Bill is one of the top operators in the country. He worked for Christie. He worked for Rudy Giuliani. He worked for Trump. He was the White House political director. He knows politics. He knows how to run campaigns.</p><p>Parscale, obviously is a media genius, social media, but has never run any kind of a campaign before. The place was not intense. You could go on there anytime on weekends, nobody was around.</p><p>Yes, you need to have a campaign with the time that's left here, every single person that's working 12 to 14 hour days, seven days a week. Bill will make that happen.</p><p>Equally as important, Bill shouldn't report to Kushner or Meadows, he should report directly to the President and make this President get re- elected again.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the understanding is that the President's son-in-law is in charge of the campaign and in charge for so many things, and he is the one who announced the change itself, which suggests that he will remain a strong voice over the campaign.</p><p>ROLLINS: He can be a voice, he can't run it though. There's a lot of things he is involved in that he doesn't know anything about and a campaign is something he definitely doesn't know anything about.</p><p>The people in the White House who know something about campaigns are Kelly -- Kellyanne Conway, who has been in many, many campaigns. She needs to get more involved. She's one of the top pollsters. She was a campaign manager last time.</p><p>I would get her involved and being a constructive force, not a destructive force. She's never been.</p><p>Equally as important, I would not be opposed to some of the people, Bannon and some of the others who were there last time coming in and being advisers or giving advice, not running the campaign, at least helping Bill move forward.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, I have a somewhat different view on that. Because Kellyanne right now, I mean, my gosh, her daughter is on social media, her husband attacking the President and has an organization behind it. It's a very difficult thing for her not to be a distraction, particularly if she were at the forefront of a campaign.</p><p>Let's turn to what this President can do.</p><p>ROLLINS: I think --</p><p>DOBBS: No, no. Let me finish. If I may, Ed. What is the one thing this President can do? What can he emphasize? Whether it's politics, a stratagem, whether it is people, it's a policy emphasis, what can -- what is the one thing you would recommend that the President do to assure his victory in November?</p><p>ROLLINS: Project strength. Everyday project strength. Focus on two things. Focus on getting to the bottom of this virus, helping state and local governments to battle this thing.</p><p>And equally as important, get us back to work. Get us back to work and get kids back in the school, and make sure that you don't chase rabbits. Don't be out there going after every little thing.</p><p>Obviously, the stuff that's going on in cities is important, but it's not the critical issue at the end of the day. Getting the economy going and getting these people back into schools and back to work is the critical thing. It's what he is going to be judged on.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. Of course, the President was elected as the Law-and-Order President, and what we're watching is not just simply disorder and unrest in a number of cities. This is a wholesale attempt by the left, the Marxist left in many cases, to overturn this nation. It's extraordinary.</p><p>So, Ed, as always, we appreciate your counsel. You get the last word here. Good word.</p><p>ROLLINS: My last word is we're still not too late. Every week, we have to win from now on, though. He can't basically be sliding around. Get intense. The President has to take -- this is not the last campaign. This is this campaign. He's got to go win it.</p><p>DOBBS: All right. Ed Rollins, thanks so much. Appreciate it. We'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this. Share your comments. Follow me on Twitter @Lou Dobbs. Like me on Facebook. Follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Up next, a former prosecutor from Roger Stone's case now setting policy for a Big Tech firm. We take that up along with a lot of other issues. Congressman Jim Jordan joins us right after these quick words. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news. The Washington Redskins who are changing their name have other problems. They've hired attorney Beth Wilkinson to review the Redskins' so-called past culture and what to do about it.</p><p>Two longtime Redskins executives fired earlier this week. Football insiders are expecting \"The Washington Post\" they say too soon publish a story on what is a blockbuster expose of the Redskins -- its organization and its owner, Snyder.</p><p>Well, also breaking tonight, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says \"The New York Times\" 1619 Project amounts to an attack on the American way of life that aligns with and supports the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>Pompeo said today, \"They want you to believe Marxist ideology that America is only the oppressors and oppressed. The Chinese Communist Party must be gleeful when they see 'The New York Times' spout this ideology.\" Well certainly the left in this country is thrilled.</p><p>Former Federal prosecutor in the Roger Stone case, Michael Marando, leaving the Justice Department to join Facebook where he will be in charge of policy on social media content. Imagine that. The content I thought was generated by the users, but there it is.</p><p>Marando one of three prosecutors who quit the Stone case in protest after Attorney General William Barr overruled their sentencing recommendations, so we know he is quite an active little daffodil.</p><p>Joining us now, Congressman Jim Jordan, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee. First your reaction, Congressman, if we may, to the appointment of Marando to being in charge of the content of Facebook.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Well, I think he was wrong in his move with the Stone case, we'll have to see what he does. I do think it's interesting that the very day you bring this up, Lou, Twitter has kept me locked out of our account all day long. We can't, we can't post any tweet. And this is of course is on top of what happened two years ago where they shadow banned four Members of Congress.</p><p>Of course, they told us that it was just a glitch in their algorithm -- Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan -- just a glitch in their algorithm. I said, well, you know, what did you put in the algorithm? The names Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, and Jordan?</p><p>So why is it always that these big social media companies, why is it always conservatives who seem to get censored? The President, conservatives in Congress or conservatives anywhere. So that is my concern. We'll just have to wait and see what happens with Facebook as we move forward.</p><p>We do have a big hearing coming in two weeks, where the CEOs of the four biggest, you know, these four big companies are going to be in front of the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the best news I've heard in ages, Congressman, is that William Barr means to bring a full investigation, antitrust investigation of Big Tech. It's long overdue.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: The President promised it. And the fact is, it's gotten even worse since the President was elected.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: This is a country being run right now by the business, community, U.S. multinationals, Wall Street, and by the way, they're aligning not only with Big Tech and Big Business, of course, but Big China. And it's a serious, serious problem. They're creating policy outside of our government.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, I would say one of the many good things the Attorney General, Attorney General Barr has done in his tenure, of course, he is coming in in two weeks for a hearing as well and he'll get asked about this issue and a host of others.</p><p>The Democrats I think will spend their time attacking him like they've done ever since he was named Attorney General. You know, they did file Articles of Impeachment against the Attorney General just two weeks ago. So that's another big hearing where we'll be able to talk about this issue, these big social media platforms attacking conservatives, censoring conservatives and a host of other things.</p><p>So we're looking forward to that. The Democrats have been out to get him ever since. I think it's amazing, Lou, ever since Bill Barr first testified in front of the Senate over a year ago, when he had the courage to use the appropriate word. He used the word \"spying\" when talking about what the Obama administration did to the Trump campaign.</p><p>And ever since he has used that word, they have been out to get him, but he just keeps pressing on, getting the truth and the facts to the American people.</p><p>DOBBS: The truth and the facts, they are slow to surface, aren't they? I mean, we're going into the end of the President's first term as President and we still don't have an accounting of Obamagate. It is outrageous.</p><p>JORDAN: No.</p><p>DOBBS: This President has been President throughout. He has been stymied. He has been blocked. And they've tried to overthrow his presidency from the moment he announced his candidacy almost.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes. All true. But we do have the facts and the truth that is coming out because of the work like folks and you and the handful of folks in the media who have pushed this issue, a handful of people in Congress and a handful of journalists around the country who push for this, and of course, the good work of Bill Barr when he was named Attorney General.</p><p>So we do have much of the facts and truth. What we don't have is anyone being held accountable. What we don't have now is this -- into this double standard, where there's one set of rules for us regular folk, but a different set if you were part of the elite political class in the Obama administration.</p><p>So that's what we need as an accounting and let's hope -- let's hope John Durham doesn't wait until after the election. Let's hope he gets his investigation done this summer, as Bill Barr said, just a few months ago, and that we ultimately hold people accountable for doing the terrible things that they did when they systematically targeted the Trump campaign, spied on American citizens, used a fake dossier that they already knew was fake as the basis to go get one of the warrants to spy on one of those Americans.</p><p>Let's hope Durham's report comes out and that there are people held accountable now.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, let's talk about Durham in terms of producing that report. Do you think he will those charges -- bring charges before the election? I have this horrible feeling that he won't. I hope so, too.</p><p>JORDAN: You know, I don't know. We want to a thorough job. We want a complete job, but as you said, it's been four years. Remember, they started July 31st, four years ago. July 31, 2016, is when they opened the investigation.</p><p>Here we are four years later, everything we've learned -- how they set up Michael Flynn, how they used the fake dossier, how they put this Mifsud guy was meeting with Papadopoulos, which starts the whole thing.</p><p>All of these things we've learned. In fact, I've said many times, I think I've said it on your show, Lou, that the only thing we had wrong about this whole sordid affair is it was worse than we thought.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely.</p><p>JORDAN: So let's hope that the investigation is complete and that people are held accountable and let's hope it happens sooner rather than later.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman, always great to have you with us. Thanks so much for all you do. Congressman Jim Jordan, thank you.</p><p>Up next, Attorney General William Barr calling at Corporate America for their work for the Chinese Communist Party. Dr. Michael Pillsbury of the Hudson Institute joins us after this quick break.</p><p>And a reminder of my new book, \"The Trump Century: How Our President Changed the Course of History Forever.\" Liberals don't want you to know this, but it's available for preorder now at thetrumpcentury.com, Amazon, Barnes and Noble.</p><p>Order your copies right away. Thanks so much. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking News. \"The Washington Post\" is now reporting that 15 women who worked for the Washington Redskins are alleging sexual harassment by former scouts and members of owner, Daniel Snyder's inner circle.</p><p>The Washington Redskins have hired attorney Beth Wilkinson as we reported to you to review the Redskins organization and culture. Two longtime Redskins executives fired earlier this week, and \"The Washington Post\" now delivering the expos that had been rumored for so long on social media.</p><p>Attorney General William Barr today strongly condemning U.S. companies who are quick to bow to Chinese pressure and influence, saying the companies need to be careful or they might be charged as foreign agents. Barr said this, quote, \"America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists, but you should be alert to how you might be used and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\"</p><p>Barr also warning the CEOs and business leaders about America's dependence on China, \"Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole, he says, relies on the People's Republic of China for vital goods and services.\"</p><p>\"The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency,\" which includes all sorts of pharmaceuticals, drugs, medical equipment, and the list goes on and on and on.</p><p>Joining us tonight Dr. Michael Pillsbury, Director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute. Mike, great to have you here. This is this is extraordinary.</p><p>The Attorney General calling at Corporate America and Wall Street, not by names, but clearly Corporate America and Wall Street who are aligning with Chinese interests over the U.S. national interest. Your reaction?</p><p>DR. MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR CHINESE STRATEGY, THE HUDSON INSTITUTE: Well, this is the most important speech I've seen yet by the Trump administration on China. I'll tell you a little secret about Attorney General Barr, his Bachelors and Master's Degree are in Chinese studies. He speaks a bit of Mandarin and his first job was at the C.I.A., analyzing China.</p><p>So frankly, Lou, he is the highest ranking China expert in the Trump administration. This speech is a blockbuster. He does give specific examples of companies. He's got a phrase I just love, Lou, that says China does not want to trade with these companies, it wants to raid these companies.</p><p>And he's got the power to prosecute. He has got a severe warning about people will get prosecuted if they don't file as foreign agents, and they go around and lobby inside the United States. He is talking about CEOs.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you and I both know who many of those CEOs are. They certainly would warrant an investigation in my judgment. I don't know whether they would be guilty, of course. I wouldn't want to prejudge that.</p><p>But certainly, I would think it's fair to say, you and I both know who might be somewhat suspicious in that regard.</p><p>Now, China -- Xi Jinping is making it pretty clear that the friendship between he and President Trump is well over and that there is no backing up. This is a Cold War and the Chinese leader means to prosecute it.</p><p>PILLSBURY: I think that's right, Lou. I think President Xi sent out a letter today to what he calls the global CEOs. This is basically an interest group, including inside the United States that he wants to lobby for China.</p><p>So he is sending them an open message, to be sure and say, you know, these various talking points. It's really quite outrageous when the leader of the second biggest economy in the world starts forcing him essentially, coercing, Mr. Barr says in his speech, coercing business leaders to put pressure on their governments.</p><p>This is the Chinese way. In our country, it's five years in jail, Lou, for each count that you're doing this if you don't register with the Department of Justice.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the Attorney General is exactly right, and we know that the Chinese have been doing this with greater breadth and with greater success over each succeeding decade for the past 30 years.</p><p>Now, they have maximum influence. The United States is, as the Attorney General points out in a position of maximum dependency and we cannot bow to the Chinese on any level, irrespective of what it means in the way in which we have to respond.</p><p>This administration is using the National Defense Production Act. We have to move away from that dependency and resolve it now. We are a great nation. This President has not asked this nation for much sacrifice. But this time, it's appropriate. We have to meet this challenge head on from the Communist Chinese.</p><p>PILLSBURY: It's a much stronger speech that F.B.I. Director Wray gave at our own Hudson Institute. He goes into detail, Lou, about Hollywood movies being censored to make money in China. It's got a very long list and specific examples and then he has the power to prosecute under various laws, including economic espionage.</p><p>This is a very powerful speech, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: It's a powerful speech and now, it has to be backed up with action and therein lies the dilemma. So much rhetoric, so many speeches, so many promises from the Department of Justice, from the Department of Homeland Security, indeed, from our Department of Defense. I get the feeling sometimes that they are inert organizations who have no plan whatsoever to actually move to action.</p><p>Tell me -- tell me, I'm wrong.</p><p>PILLSBURY: No, you're not wrong. There's a lot of things that have been empty words. What I think is happening is the President's level of frustration with Xi Jinping is growing higher and higher and so he is looking for options of ways to get leverage on China and this speech has some of those options. There are other options coming out of the Senate. So we may be entering a period where you'll be a lot happier Lou, when the President is taking action, and it's not just members of the Cabinet giving speeches.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, that is your expression. The fact of the matter is, it's correct. This administration, if there is anything that gives me great pause, that Washington has become a place where these politicians tell us what they're going to do. They tell us about their plans to do things. They talk about the problem very gently, and what they're going to do, and then nothing happens.</p><p>What is different this time as Barr is bringing great specificity to it.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Talking openly and honestly with the American people about the dependency, about who the hell is facilitating Chinese interest in this country.</p><p>By the way, we've been talking about it on this broadcast for years. This is well known, or at least should be. It's just -- it is amazing that Barr has taken the lead on this issue. And by amazing, I mean, I salute him. I thank him. I know you do as well. This is so critically important to assuring the nation's security, and it is early in the process.</p><p>But it is -- it's begun where the administration is talking openly to the American people about our dependency, our vulnerabilities, and the threat that we now face and it is immense. You get the last word, Mike.</p><p>PILLSBURY: The only flaw in this piece, Lou, is he fails to footnote two crucial books, where he got a lot of ideas in this speech. One is your book, \"Upheaval.\" The other book is called \"The Hundred Year Marathon.\" That would have made it a perfect speech. And there are a few footnotes to this speech. It's very academic in some ways.</p><p>DOBBS: Don't mess with a scholar. Dr. Michael Pillsbury, by the way, I give the Attorney General carte blanche with whatever he would like to use at any time.</p><p>Thanks so much, Mike.</p><p>Up next, how badly will the NFL be hurt by their capitulation to the radical left? We take that up and more. Victor Davis Hanson joins us. Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news now. NFL wide receiver, Kenny Stills was one of 87 people arrested this week for protesting at the home of Kentucky's Attorney General, Daniel Cameron.</p><p>Stills was protesting the death of Breonna Taylor, who was killed during a raid at her home in March. Stills and those arrested now face felony charges of intimidating a participant in the legal process and faces as much as five years in prison.</p><p>Joining us tonight to take all of this up, Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow in Military History at the Hoover Institution, Professor Emeritus of Classics at California State, author -- bestselling author, brilliant author, and \"National Review\" contributor and he doesn't do badly there either.</p><p>Victor, it's great to have you with us and turning to what we are watching, I want to put up a full screen that to me is stunning. And I think everybody in America should know this.</p><p>Let's see that Fortune 500 reporting -- the Fortune reporting on companies who've donated to BLM. Fortune 500 companies. You see those numbers? Those are pledges to the Black Lives Matter organization. Bank of America, a billion dollars over four years, PepsiCo $400 million; Walmart a $100 million; Apple, $100 million and Comcast. They are subsidizing a Marxist inspired organization. And for what reason? I have no idea. Do you, Victor?</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Yes, I do. I think that they do not want to Goya-type boycott. They don't want their franchises the objects of protest. They don't want people showing up at their executives' homes, so in their way of thinking that's a wise business preemptive decision. And they feel that given their bottom line, it's also a smart use of resources.</p><p>They have zero interest on the social stability and fabric of the United States. I hate to say that, but it's true. And so for them, it's just a straight cut business decision.</p><p>They don't know anything about Black Lives Matter. They don't want to know anything about Black Lives Matter. They don't want to know about its origins or its agenda. All they want to do is just make it go away and their usual way of dealing with that is money.</p><p>DOBBS: And they are not a nonprofit organization. They're also a Marxist inspired organization and they are behind much of the anarchy that we are watching in cities across this country.</p><p>I want to turn to an article by Victor Davis Hanson in the \"National Review\" and quote from that, if I may, and if you would put up the full screen of this so we can take a look and the audience can read along.</p><p>\"If the multibillion dollar NFL decides that multimillionaire players have no obligation to stand to honor a collective national anthem, and that there will be separate anthems and politicized uniforms, then millions of Americans will quietly shrug and change the. And that silent protest will make the 2016-17 anthem protest look like child's play.\"</p><p>We're watching something here that is the NFL, it seems is on -- there's no question. This is a pivotal moment. Their future is on the edge it seems to me. If they move ahead with all that's been discussed, a new anthem, taking on all of these political issues on the field of play, they don't call it the field protest, as it's called a field of play.</p><p>Your thoughts about where you think we're headed, what will actually happen?</p><p>HANSON: Well, we know what happened in 2017. They lost about 10 to 15 percent of their viewership, both televised and direct fan participation and attendance, and that won't be anything compared to having an alternate anthem and then politicizing the jerseys with slogans, and this comes on the heels of a lot of anti-Semitic commentary that members of the NFL players have said, and their accolades.</p><p>And remember, Lou, this industry has been exempt from scrutiny. It's been a woke progressive industry that's lectured America on its shortcomings and it's lectured us about diversity, and it's got a real problem with diversity because of the 30 teams only, there's really not any white owners. I mean, excuse me, non-white owners, and that goes against the whole idea of diversity.</p><p>And yet 75 percent of the players are African American. There's only one percent Hispanic and less than one percent who are Asian. So basically what we're going to turn on Sunday, for those who would turn on the television is a very non-diverse ownership and a very non-diverse player profile lecturing America, how they need to be woke and more diverse and that's not a sustainable proposition or at the same time, you're lecturing America about its racism and it's illiberality and then saying, oh, by the way, we're multimillionaires and we want you, the middle class to keep paying our salaries and patronizing. It's just not going to work.</p><p>The NBA is doing the same thing, but where the NBA has an advantage it has lost -- it has about a 48 percent African-American audience, but it's lost most of its white, Hispanic and Asian audiences because it's even more non- diverse.</p><p>But what they've done is they've looked toward the 1.4-billion-person market in China. And so they've got a $6 billion franchising advertising gimmick to go over to illiberal China and be very careful about censoring any criticism of China while regaining their woke credentials by unloading on their own country.</p><p>But the NFL doesn't yet have that alternative to make up lost revenue with Chinese new cur.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, corporate and television sponsorship of both leagues is critical to their survival. One could almost, given your view, imagine the NBA moving to Beijing for its center of organization and headquarters. We'll have to see. You get the last quick word here, Victor.</p><p>HANSON: Yes. Well, I think in the case of the NBA, they've almost deliberately neglected any other audience than the young African American male viewer who is very loyal, but doesn't have enough numbers to sustain an average salary of $8 million.</p><p>So they're deliberately looking toward to China so they can maintain their -- I don't know -- their non-diverse politicized messaging to the United States that doesn't appeal to many fans anymore.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely. Victor Davis Hanson, always good talking to you. Thanks so much. Talk to you soon.</p><p>A reminder before we go to break, my new book, \"The Trump Century: How Our President Changed the Course of History forever.\" Liberals take note, it's available for preorder now at thetrumpcentury.com.

Welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. I'm Ed Henry filling in tonight. Tucker will be back tomorrow and let me teased that you get to see a bit of him, later tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For now, I am practicing my Tucker face or the Tucker look as viewers like to call it. But first, <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>critic said that his wall could never work. Well, the wall hasn't even been built yet but the mere talk of one may be having a big impact already. A new report says that illegal crossings at the Mexican border dropped big league as the President might say during his first month in office. In 60 seconds, we will debate someone who doesn't think the President really deserves credit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But right now, we go live to our own Trace Gallagher who was crunching the illegal border crossing numbers. Good to see you, Trace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TRACE GALLAGHER, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Good to see you, Ed. The Department of Homeland Security says the 40 percent drop in the number of illegal immigrants trying to cross the border in February is even more remarkable when you consider that historically, border crossings in February rise by up to 20 percent. Look at the actual numbers here. In January, 31,578 people were apprehended trying to cross the Southern Border.</p><p>In February, it dropped to 18,762. That is the lowest monthly total in at least five years. And it also appears there was an all-out rush to get into the U.S. before <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>executive orders on immigration. Because in the three months prior to the inauguration, border agents apprehended 157,000 illegal immigrants. That's up 35 percent from the previous year. Then as soon as Trump took office, apprehensions plummeted.</p><p>Customs and Border Protection says, \"This is good news for those who did not try to cross the border because they didn't put themselves and their families at risk of quote, exploitation, assault and injury by human traffickers\" and the physical dangers of the treacherous journey north.\" Human traffickers by the way have increased their fees more than 100 percent in just the past 14 months -- Ed.</p><p>HENRY: Trace, thank you. We will see you later this hour. So, it's only one month but it appears that illegal immigration dropped. So why is our first guest so reluctant to give <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>some credit?</p><p>Alex Nowrasteh is an immigration policy analyst for the CATO Institute, a libertarian Think Tank, he joins us live. So, repeat after me, some good news.</p><p>ALEX NOWRASTEH, IMMIGRATION POLICY ANALYST, CATO INSTITUTE: It is some news. The President --</p><p>HENRY: You said some news, some good news.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: It's some news. I mean, it's good and bad.</p><p>HENRY: Illegal immigration went down.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Yes. But it might be for very good reasons that are good or bad.</p><p>HENRY: That's good news.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: The economy is not attracting them enough which is bad news for the American economy.</p><p>HENRY: But less illegals are coming to America.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Right. Yes.</p><p>HENRY: Good news?</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Sure. Yes. Absolutely. But it depends why it's going on. Is it going on because we spent a lot more money at the border and wasting a lot of money on border bureaucrats? Or is it going down because the US economy is not attracting them anymore, that could be bad.</p><p>HENRY: Okay. So, let's get to that. So, before the inauguration -- as you heard Trace report.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Uh-hm.</p><p>HENRY: Fair and balanced, he had the facts. Before the inauguration of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>--</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Uh-hm.</p><p>HENRY: There was a surge of people trying to get across the border. Illegals trying to get to America. They were afraid of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>building the wall and his rhetoric. Right?</p><p>NOWRASTEH: There was also a surge prior to the election going on in the first place. Well, the numbers throughout 2015 more above those of 2015 and the numbers in 2015 --</p><p>HENRY: Okay. We'll get to those. I promise I'll let you make all those points, let's just talk about the points. The actual question I asked you.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Yes.</p><p>HENRY: Before the inaugural, there was a surge in illegals trying to get across the border before <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>took office, true?</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Yes. That is true.</p><p>HENRY: Okay. So, they were afraid that he was actually going to crack down on them.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Well, as I've said, the surge --</p><p>HENRY: I'll let you go back to 2015 but let's talk about the reality print</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Before the election even occurred and the continued after the election occurred.</p><p>HENRY: Okay. But again, I just want to establish --</p><p>NOWRASTEH: I'm trying to say that it's attributable entirely to <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>HENRY: When you say entirely, I said it was good news that illegal immigration has started to drop.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Yes. And -- agreeing with you about that of course.</p><p>HENRY: Okay. And so, fast-forward, month one of the Trump administration --</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Uh-hm.</p><p>HENRY: All of a sudden, Trace says in terms of apprehensions at the border is the lowest total in five years.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: It's actually the lowest total in 17 years. I mean, if you take a look at the months going back to the year 2000, it is of course only one month and it's been one month since the President --</p><p>HENRY: And it can change, because you're right about that part.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Yes. One month.</p><p>HENRY: It's only one month. You're saying it's even better than Trace said. You're saying that it's the lowest total of apprehensions at the border, meaning less people trying to cross, getting caught trying to cross in 17 years. That's good news.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: It is.</p><p>HENRY: <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>policy started to work?</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Not necessarily. He hasn't really had much time. It's a lot of rhetoric. There is an increase in the number of illegals coming across before he came in. So, we'll see how that average shakes out over the period of time. A lot of people realize that I think the Donald, <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>bark is worse than his bite and I think we're going to see the numbers increase going forward.</p><p>HENRY: But maybe his bark is actually having an impact.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: It might. But a lot of the big decreases and decrease in the number of asylum-seekers from Central and South America mainly children and women who are trying to seek asylum who were counted as apprehended. And if they are being turned away, then there's a lot of --</p><p>HENRY: We don't know for sure. You're saying --</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Well, no, no. You could take a look at the numbers, and you dig into the numbers of people who are apprehended, it has unaccompanied alien children in the family units listed there. And there is a much bigger drop in those individuals than there are an adults who were coming by themselves.</p><p>HENRY: But here is my problem about your approach. I went back and looked back at what you said during the presidential transition before we got these numbers.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Uh-hm.</p><p>HENRY: And it seems that you're so anti-Trump that you wouldn't -- here's what you said in November. You said to the Associated Press television. Quote, \"He is doubling down on all of his anti-immigrant positions,\" stop there. He's not against legal immigration.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Did you not read his position paper?</p><p>HENRY: He's not against legal immigration.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: His position paper has said, he wanted to cut the number of green cards down to zero into unemployment as zero in the United States. And if you take a look at a number of other positions against the H1B visa --</p><p>HENRY: You might bring -- legal immigrants to come in.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Excuse me. Let me finish. If you follow through all of the positions that he wants to take it as position paper, and cut legal immigration by 63 percent.</p><p>HENRY: I'm just saying, why not be accurate and say, he's anti-illegal immigrant.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Because he wants to cut legal immigration by 63 percent.</p><p>HENRY: Maybe in the short term. Maybe in the short term.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: If somebody -- if <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said he wants to cut legal gun ownership by at 63 percent, you would say he was anti-gun, which I would say too. So, if he wants to cut legal immigration by 63 percent, I think it's fair to say that he is anti-immigration.</p><p>HENRY: The next sentence you said to the Associated Press is quote, this was in November, \"He wants to massively increase immigration enforcement at the border.\"</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Yes.</p><p>HENRY: Okay? And we have got the quote up there. What's wrong with increasing enforcement at the border of our existing laws?</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Because it's a lot cheaper and easier ways to get enforcement of the laws that does not require hiring 5,000 more border agents.</p><p>HENRY: Such as what?</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Such as what President Eisenhower did in the 1950s, increasing the number of temporary short-term guest worker visas to channel these people into the legal markets so we can check them out.</p><p>HENRY: You're telling me that we haven't improve the system since Eisenhower to come up with a better way to better use border patrol agents though if you actually send them to the border?</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Oh, in terms of the enforcement ability of the U.S. government on the border, it is a lot better than it used to be but there's also 20 times as many as there were during Eisenhower's administration.</p><p>HENRY: But you said in November, he wants to massively increase immigration enforcement at the border. It looks like it's actually working, he wanted to do that, you said it was a horrible thing in November, and the numbers are coming down.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: As you said, he hasn't done it yet. He hasn't had the ability to increase the border.</p><p>HENRY: He just started, he's talked about it --</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Okay. But you can't say that he's done it that he hasn't done it yet.</p><p>HENRY: You said in November this is a horrible thing. How was it a bad thing? Illegal immigration is now going down.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: We could get the same results much cheaper by not hiring more government employees and unionized government employees and taking thousand miles of private properly along the border through eminent domain to build a wall by increasing legal short-term temporary migration to allow people come through the legal market. So, it's about deregulating the economy.</p><p>HENRY: Okay. But --</p><p>NOWRASTEH: That's what Eisenhower to do and that's what worked.</p><p>HENRY: And again, a lot has changed since Eisenhower. But nonetheless if your issue is really cost and you want to save government money now all of a sudden.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Absolutely.</p><p>HENRY: Okay. So --</p><p>NOWRASTEH: All of a sudden, excuse me. I am a libertarian. I worked in a libertarian Think Tank. We are very much concerned with decrease the size of government.</p><p>HENRY: So, you want to decrease the size of the government.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Across the board including the massive and bloated immigration bureaucracy that closes the border.</p><p>HENRY: So, if cost is the issue. I'm just confused about why you are against the idea that like <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>hasn't even built the wall, he's talked about it.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Uh-hm.</p><p>HENRY: And illegal immigration is coming down without spending a dime on the wall.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: That's one of the best things about it. But --</p><p>HENRY: So that's a good thing. So while you're criticizing basically his entire approach, when you say part of your deal is to decrease the cost of government without even building a single plank in the wall. Illegal immigration appears to be coming down. He hasn't spent a penny of that.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: For one month, and we're going to see what happens going forward. As you said in the beginning of this segment, we're going to see what happens after this month. But he says he wants to spend tens of billions of more dollars.</p><p>HENRY: It went down 40 percent.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: There were almost 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States currently, 70 percent are entering legally and overstaying. It's a drop in the bucket. And let's not forget that during Barack Obama's administration, the number of illegal immigrants entering each year dropped by over 67 percent and it was the first administration in history, when a number of illegal immigrants at the end of it was the same as the beginning.</p><p>HENRY: All right, Alex. We will have to have you back when you get the second month statistics to see if it's still going down.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: We'll see. I hope we're going to have a lot more than a few more months to check it out.</p><p>HENRY: You said it is good news that illegal immigration is down. You didn't say it initially but you eventually got there.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: No, no. It's good news but it also depends why it's happening. Is it because the U.S. economy is about to enter a recession or is it because we're spending a lot more money in the border or is it because we have a windbag in office who says a lot of nonsense?</p><p>HENRY: Wait a second. Windbag? How do you just take a cheap shot like that?</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Well --</p><p>HENRY: You said a windbag. He is using his rhetoric and illegal immigration is actually coming down, that's all you want to address the President of the United States.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: The President during his entire time talking about --</p><p>HENRY: Do you want to take it back or --</p><p>NOWRASTEH: The President is taking every position possible on immigration throughout his career. I think it's fair to call that one --</p><p>HENRY: But he's come down and you won't fully acknowledge that and you decided to just throw a cheap shot at him. He's the president of United States.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: I said he deserves a lot of the credit for it. What do you want?</p><p>HENRY: Okay. A lot of the credit but you still call him that.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Well, when you take every position possible on an issue, I think that's what you deserve to be called.</p><p>HENRY: Okay. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>NOWRASTEH: Thank you.</p><p>HENRY: There was even more turmoil in the Intelligence Community today. FBI Director James Comey briefed the House Intelligence Committee on <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>claim he was wiretapped by President Obama.</p><p>Meanwhile, WikiLeaks announced, yes, it will share leaked CIA hacking tools with tech companies. <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge joins us with more. Catherine, quite a day.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: It was. Thank you. The FBI director briefed the Congressional leadership tonight on the Russia investigation. Earlier today, <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>was told the allegations Trump Tower was wiretapped will be dealt with, the House and Senate leadership as well as the chairman and ranking members of the Congressional Intelligence Committees left the briefing without speaking to reporters. And in another indicator that the issue is politically charged, Democrats had accused Director Comey of withholding evidence. I charged non-made by senior Republicans.</p><p>Also today, a high-level Oval Office meeting was scheduled with the President, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. The expectation is that WikiLeaks and the apparent breach of the CIA cyber unit were on the table as well as the preliminary damage assessments. Wikileaks Julian Assange held a news conference today where he offered to help tech firms to keep the CIA's hacking tools, but tonight, none of the big tech firms seem to be taking up the offer -- Ed.</p><p>HENRY: Catherine, do you think it's a genuine offer to help these tech companies? Or Wikileaks says is a mixed track record.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Well, within the ICE, I think they would say it this way. It's like getting stabbed in the back and then the person offers to drive you to the hospital. Okay? So, it's a little twisted but listen, Julian Assange has a point with the documents if they're authentic, which is that the U.S. government really has some awesome surveillance capability.</p><p>HENRY: What's your sense of this investigation? And James Comey going up to the hill talking about this back-and-forth with President Obama and <person><nameText>President Trump?</nameText></person></p><p>HERRIDGE: Well, this really puts the FBI Director under the microscope. I have to say, one of the things that caught my attention today having followed this really for over a year is that when we look at the documents, we see these incredible capabilities to record audio and video. And to use this with phones and with computers, and what we saw with our ongoing reporting along with my colleague, senior executive producer Pamela Brown is that the Clinton campaign on a number of occasions took these kinds of devices into secure facilities.</p><p>So that's yet another vulnerability. Yes, if you believe their position, somehow that Clinton server had like a special anti-hacking force field.</p><p>HENRY: Everyone else is under assault.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Exactly. Everyone else was under assault, everyone got breached, even the CIA, had an insider threat, but somehow, the Clinton server with its halo had no problems. That's what kind of jumps out at me today.</p><p>HENRY: It jumps out at us too. Thanks for bringing it to us too.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>HENRY: Good to see you, Catherine.</p><p>Coming up, Senator Rand Paul, he says, the House GOP ObamaCare replacement is dead on arrival and he's known to please with Speaker Paul Ryan, some sharp words from a feisty Rand Paul, next.</p><p>Plus, Tucker will be back to interview a Middle Eastern diplomat on how to keep young Muslims from falling prey to radical Islam, you will not want to miss it.</p><p>HENRY: Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says the American health care act is the right way to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Here he is today making the pitch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Lower-cost, more choices, not less. Patients in control. Universal access to CAIR. These are the four driving principles that we are focused on. Lowering the cost, getting people more choices, having patients and control, and universal access to CAIR. Let me walk you through how exactly we propose to do this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: The Speaker insists he can get the bill through Congress but apparently a lot of Republican senators did not get that memo. The biggest critic is Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who says the bill is dead on arrival and will destroy the party in 2020 if it's past. Senator Paul joins us now, it's good to see you.</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: Well, you know, he left out a few things in the press conference. He left out that he keeps the ObamaCare taxes for a year than he keeps the Cadillac tax forever. He keeps the ObamaCare subsidies, but renames them, you know, tax credits. He keeps the individual mandate but you don't pay the government -- they're going to pay the insurance company, the penalty and --</p><p>HENRY: But they would say there's a transition.</p><p>PAUL: Well, no, but he's keeping aspects of ObamaCare. That's a very definition of ObamaCare.</p><p>HENRY: So, it's not a full repeal is your point?</p><p>PAUL: No, it's not. In about a year ago, we did, we voted unanimously a year ago, why are we voting on what we voted a year ago?</p><p>HENRY: But I spoke to the House Republicans. They told me to ask you a simple question. You want to repeal it. What happens after that? You do a full repeal. They say the market collapses --</p><p>PAUL: Right.</p><p>HENRY: -- and you really do have a death spiral and then you Senator Paul - -</p><p>PAUL: Yes.</p><p>HENRY: You own that death spiral.</p><p>PAUL: Yes. I'm for replacing at the same time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAUL: Well, on several bill. I've written the bill. And the bill is interestingly, mostly Tom Price's idea. So, it's interesting you have Paul Ryan on one side saying, I have Tom Price's ideas and then you have Rand Paul saying, I have Tom Price's idea and it's kind of true but we don't like the refundable tax credits that came from Tom Price. What we do like his health care associations where you can join a buying pool or a group to bring down prices, this is part of the answer. Because the 11 million people in the individual market, their premiums are going through the roof.</p><p>HENRY: Uh-hm.</p><p>PAUL: So you've got to let them join a buying pool.</p><p>HENRY: House Republicans say, the premiums are going to spike even more once you repeal it all together.</p><p>PAUL: Well, that's why you replace it and what you replace it with are market reforms.</p><p>HENRY: Okay.</p><p>PAUL: We get rid of the mandates which I think Paul Ryan would agree with. You expand health savings accounts and then you expand health care associations. These associations are like co-ops or buying pools.</p><p>HENRY: Okay. All great ideas. But House Republicans also tell me that you can't get to 60 votes with that. So, it's not going to go anywhere.</p><p>PAUL: You know, I can't be blamed if somebody won't vote for something it's just not a bad idea.</p><p>HENRY: But how do you bring Democrats in and get to 60 votes?</p><p>PAUL: Well, we have to convince people that it's a good idea and we bring it forward. But the problem is, they brought forward things that are very controversial and the conservatives don't like. Conservatives hate their bill. I promise you. ObamaCare lite dead on arrival, you might as well just start over. You're hearing a lot of voices. I'm not the only voice saying this. And so, what they should do is clean it up, get rid of the ObamaCare lite stuff, get rid of the taxes, the subsidies, the mandates, the bailouts. And just to repeal.</p><p>HENRY: What they say is wrong with your idea and your support, Republican Senator Tom Cotton today basically agreed with you and said that House Republicans may wind up with something that's worse than ObamaCare.</p><p>PAUL: Right.</p><p>HENRY: And so, the Speaker said however, you're making a binary choice, Senator. If you'd don't do this, you're not really following through on the promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare.</p><p>PAUL: Let me translate what it means when someone tells you have a binary choice, they're telling you take it or leave it.</p><p>HENRY: He did. Yes.</p><p>PAUL: The speaker needs to like bring people into the room, conservatives and he needs to hear what we want. We are withholding our votes. This is a message for the speaker, we are withholding our vote, we want a seat at the table and it's not a binary choice. If we do not understand why were in a death spiral with ObamaCare, we can't fix it. The reason were of death spiral is we're telling people you can buy insurance after you get sick. So guess what.</p><p>HENRY: Yes.</p><p>PAUL: People are waiting to buy after they get sick. And that still happens after Paul Ryan's plan. He doesn't fix that problem at all.</p><p>HENRY: Last question. But the Vice President is now going to your home state on Saturday, it sounds like the administration is brushing, trying at least to brush you back a little bit. React to that but also when you say, look, it's not a binary choice, you don't have my vote Mr. Speaker --</p><p>PAUL: Right.</p><p>HENRY: You might imperil the Trump presidency.</p><p>PAUL: Well, no, not at all. I'm a big fan of the President. And also, you want to meet anybody who dislikes ObamaCare more than me. I'm a physician. I have lived ObamaCare. It is a disaster, I have voted to repeal it and I will vote again. But I will not vote for ObamaCare lite stuck on the repeal bill. We will going to have to separate, repeal, and replace. We have disagreements, serious fundamental policy disagreements with the Speaker. We're going to have to separate repeal from replacement or the deal doesn't get done.</p><p>HENRY: Senator Paul making no bones about where he stands.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAUL: I guess. Thanks.</p><p>HENRY: Clearly, clearly there is a long way to go. We're almost 50 days into the Trump presidency, who's the big winner in the first month and a half? Apparently, First Lady Melania Trump. A new CNN poll finds 52 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the First Lady. That's 16 points higher than her approval when her husband was inaugurated. She's also a lot more popular than her husband, 32 percent of the country disapproves of Melania somehow, 12 percent have no opinion, and three percent of people apparently live under a rock and have never heard of the First Lady.</p><p>Up next, we will talk to Charles Krauthammer about whether the mainstream media is pushing a Russian scandal without any real evidence just to downplay <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>winning. That's next on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRES. <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), UNITED STATES: We're going to win so much, you may even get tired of winning.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: Well, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>promised a lot of winning and he's done a bit of it already. The stock market doing great, the economy just added 300,000 jobs in a month and illegal immigration has dropped sharply according to some statistics. But if you watch the news, it focuses on <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>messes. The executive order on immigration. The never ending feud over Russia and much more. Is the Trump administration sneakily off to a good start in achieving its promises?</p><p>Charles Krauthammer joins us now. Charles, we talked about jobs up, stock market up, Alec Baldwin is even saying he may give up the impression on \"SNL,\" he thinks people may get tired of it. You think Alec Baldwin is just tired of all of us winning?</p><p>CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, I did say it is a big premature to declare we have excessive winning. I will say the stock market and the job market are things that do respond to confidence. There is great confidence that the Republicans being in charge in the House and in the Congress will pass the tax reform, lower rates, lower corporate rates. We'll cut back on regulation which is the formula for growth. So, if you're in the market, it's likely that the economy will grow.</p><p>HENRY: Isn't it tied to ObamaCare and the sense, if they get stalled on ObamaCare, that's going to push the timetable back on tax reform and tax cuts, it could be a real problem.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Which is why these early signs are nice. But they are tenuous. The market is not going to keep climbing indefinitely, I think I can predict with confidence at some point it will turn around and go backwards. And at that point, what is Trump going to say? We're going to get tired of losing? So, look, some things are attributable, some things are not. Trump himself tweeted out I think you heard this from Ben Carson. The statistic that after a month, the deficit had gone down by $10 billion under him and under Obama after the first month, it had gone up by 20 million which of course is a complete and total irrelevancy.</p><p>HENRY: It fluctuates --</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: It fluctuates every hour let alone every month.</p><p>HENRY: But what's your sense now, you mentioned Russia a moment ago. And Sean Hannity had a journalist on last night Sara Carter, she's going to come back tonight. So people will want to stick around, back with Sean, saying that the FBI has been investigating has found no evidence of collusion between the Russian officials and the Trump campaign. And as you know, James Clapper said much the same in a series of television interviews a few days ago. So, what's all the hullabaloo about if the FBI hasn't found anything that's really collusion?</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Well, that's in fact, I asked that question in my column. Here we are about to embark and we are be completely flooded with news about two accusations. The first is that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, as you say there's no evidence for that. You can ask anybody, they'll say, well, there is this, there's that.</p><p>HENRY: There was meetings. There was contacts.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: But that doesn't mean a thing. You know, Flynn had a meeting with the Russian ambassador, maybe he talked about sanctions. So what? That's his job. The meetings prove nothing. So, there is no evidence that they may discover evidence I'm not saying it's impossible. But as of now, we have this complete frenzy where there's no evidence of collusion, as you say, James Clapper is not a guy who's having a bromance with <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>They were pretty at each other's throats. Clapper --</p><p>HENRY: And he headed for the exits quickly when Trump got elected.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Exactly. But Clapper himself who wrote the report handed into Obama when he was leading, said there's nothing in there to support.</p><p>HENRY: As you say, it's still going to play out.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: We may found out. But it is a little disproportionate. The other charge of course is the Trump charge that Obama had wiretapped them, there's even less evidence on that.</p><p>HENRY: Uh-hm.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: So, here we are as a country about to go into a rabbit hole, chasing our tails on these issues. Well, perhaps we'll find something. I think the odds are that we're not and there's a lot happening that we ought to be paying attention to.</p><p>HENRY: And that investigation by the FBI is happening not in a vacuum but as WikiLeaks keeps dumping out more documents that could be very damaging to this country.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: I think the current WikiLeaks dump is the worst of all. It's one thing when you leak names, when you leak incidents, that's pretty bad, the Snowden thing. But when you're leaking documents, you're leaking here methods and sources. These are the keys to getting it. These are telling the world how we get into their systems, how we could fake intrusions, all the tricks that we need and once you release that, then I think our huge technological advantage to which we have, look at what we did .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HENRY: This is a lot worse than John Podesta in making catty comments about Hillary Clinton or reporters. And yet, I'm not seeing a lot of democratic outrage.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Yes. Look. The hypocrisy here is really unbelievable. If your side is being bitten, you get all upset. The other guys are being bitten like in the campaign, Trump says I love WikiLeaks, I don't think he loves them today.</p><p>HENRY: Because he is the commander-in-chief who has to deal with all if it.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: This is undermining our entire system. And the other thing it does apart from everything else is it exposes Americans to suspicions about the intentions of their own government.</p><p>HENRY: Sure.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Are they listening in on my microwave?</p><p>HENRY: Last question, is there some credence suspicions some of our viewers may have when, for example, Judge Napolitano was talking about a report today where Samsung is a saying, \"We care so much about privacy,\" and then it turns out, well, maybe they allowed British intelligence services to dip into American television sets here with those Samsung smart TVs. So, the CIA says, \"We don't spy on Americans.\" But did the British intelligence services tap into those TVs? That undermines confidence.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: That does. As I said to Judge Napolitano just a little while ago with special report, well, in that case, don't talk to your microwave. It's not safe anymore.</p><p>HENRY: Always good advice from Charles Krauthammer.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Yes.</p><p>HENRY: Don't talk to your microwave.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: This is where you come -- where else can you get that kind of .</p><p>HENRY: This is key insight. I appreciate it.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: . from a psychiatrist.</p><p>HENRY: Thank you, Charles. And after the break, Tucker will be here for his own show -- I kid, because we love Tucker. He talks to a Middle Eastern diplomat, serious story. That diplomat has penned a lengthy letter to his sons about how to be a Muslim in the modern world and not fall prey to radical Islam. Plus today is the 10th anniversary of a retired FBI agent disappearing in Iran. Far too many people have moved on from the story, we have not. We'll talk to his son for an emotional look at their efforts to bring Robert Levinson home.</p><p>HENRY: A growing list of states now joined Hawaii challenging <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>updated travel order affecting six Muslim majority countries. For more, we go back to Trace Gallagher live tonight in Los Angeles. Good to see you, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Hey. And Hawaii is filing a separate lawsuit against the new Trump travel ban. The other states have decided to jump on board with Washington State. Remember, it was the Washington lawsuit against the first travel ban that led district Judge James Robart to issue a temporary restraining order halting the ban. A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals then upheld that restraining order. Now, Washington state attorney general, Bob Ferguson, joined by Minnesota, Oregon, Massachusetts, and New York is asking Judge Robart to apply the original restraining order against the new executive order. Here's the agent (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB FERGUSON, WASHINGTON STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL: In our view of this new executive order contains many of the same legal weaknesses as the first and reinstates some of the identical policies as the original.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Trump's revised executive order shuts down the U.S. Refugee program and bars new visas for people from six mostly Muslim countries including Somalia, Iran, Syria, Libya, Sudan, and Yemen. Hawaii's lawsuit is basically arguing the new travel ban is nearly identical to the old travel ban. The state even said that senior White House policy advisor, Stephen Miller, who told <person><nameText>Fox News, </nameText></person>quote, \"In terms of protecting the country, those basic policies are still going to be in effect.\" Today, the White House said the new order will stand up in court, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think we feel very comfortable that the executive order that was crafted is consistent and we're going to go forward on this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Now, the old travel ban will be revoked once the new order goes into effect on March 16th unless, of course, a judge blocks the new order.</p><p>HENRY: OK. Which would surprise nobody. Trace, I appreciate your report.</p><p>The president says his second executive order focused on pausing travel from those six nations known to have trouble with terror, shows radical Islam is a major concern to this administration and the entire world. Recently Tucker spoke to Omar Saif Ghobash, the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Russia. The ambassador recently wrote a book, \"Letters to Young Muslim,\" about what it means to be Muslim in the 21st Century and how to avoid the lure of radicalism. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>HOST: Ambassador, thanks for joining us.</p><p>OMAR SAIF GHOBASH, AMBASSADOR OF UAE TO Russia: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: I think the most interesting part of your book, which is excellent by the way, is the fact that your own children have been exposed to Islamic extremism. You seem like not the candidate for that, not the family for that, very international. You live outside the Middle East. But even your children have been exposed. What do you tell them?</p><p>SAIF GHOBASH: Well, the first thing I think we have to be aware that this is part of -- I mean it's simply part of the Internet and its exposed to -- rather it presents itself in so many different ways through globalization and the technologies that we use. So, I actually worried if my children weren't immune to these ideas and really all of us are exposed to it. So, I had to take a stand of my own and I put those ideas into the book that I've written.</p><p>CARLSON: It seems like most of the spokesman for modern Islam that we see at least on American television are apostates. They are no longer affiliated with the religion. But you are -- you are Muslim, a practicing Muslim.</p><p>SAIF GHOBASH: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think the criticism is fair that moderate Muslims, such as yourself, haven't done enough to speak up against extremism?</p><p>SAIF GHOBASH: I used to be one of the moderate Muslims that would say about ourselves that we haven't done enough to speak up about it. The problem here was -- and for me personally -- was that it's very difficult to kind of latch onto particular ideas. You know, I actually write from the position of a layperson. I do not present myself as a theologian. What I am doing is I am claiming space for laypeople and people of good faith to be able to come to the table and speak to the scholars of Islam and speak to the religious authorities and really kind of stake out a new area where we can actually engage in a dialogue between those who claim, you know, that deep religious knowledge and those who simply want to be a good moral, ethical agents as Muslims in the world.</p><p>CARLSON: Is there something intrinsic to Islam that produces violent behavior?</p><p>SAIF GHOBASH: No. Honestly, I don't think so. I think there's a certain reading that would -- that allows for the violence, but I think it's a politically narrow and it's a reading that reflects a certain kind of upbringing. I think that, you know, the readings of Islam, whatever reading your coming out with, is going to be related to the socioeconomic background you are either coming out to or you are exposed to. So, you know, if you look at somebody like Osama Bin Laden, he had all the advantages possible. He had as well a (inaudible) life. He had this education. He had money. And yet, he was -- he was looking at the Arab world and said, \"You know, there's this tremendous injustice that's taking place. I must now fight in whatever way he thought he could.\"</p><p>Now, I -- that sends a particularly worrying example of how things develop. We've all sort of witnessed the privilege within our society, a Muslim society, are witness to the socioeconomic catastrophe of the Arab world in particular and parts of the Muslim world. And what I want to say is actually there are much more positive ways in which we can begin to react to that socioeconomic reality. It's people like me and my generation who are very privileged who should be taking steps to alleviate the suffering of Muslims, and to really sort of reestablish a semblance of economic well- being and a functioning state in different parts of the Arab world and North Africa.</p><p>CARLSON: So, can a Muslim who takes his religion seriously, an orthodox Muslim, be tolerant of people who aren't orthodox Muslims?</p><p>SAIF GHOBASH: I think it's -- I know many orthodox Muslims who are quite happy to accept that the world is full of many different nationalities and cultures and religious faiths. So, not only do they tolerate, you know, sort of those of weak faith within Islam, but they're quite happy to accept that there are non-Muslims in the world. So, again, these are -- these are particular readings and I think what we need to do is there is I believe a silent majority of Muslims who really believe in a much more productive engagement with the modern world. Now, do they have the theological arguments? Do they have the philosophical arguments to kind of stand up to the incredible pressure put on them by the radicals? This is a different question and that's a kind of contribution that I was trying to make. There must be a set of arguments kind of rules of thumb for how to push back against the very strong radical -- small but very strong radical kind of interpretations.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you for providing that. That's obviously necessary.</p><p>SAIF GHOBASh: Thank you very much.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you for joining us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: And elsewhere in the Middle East, 10 years ago today, Bob Levinson, an American disappeared in Iran. He is the longest held hostage in American history, but his family accuses the Obama administration of not treating his return like a top priority. Up next, we'll talk to Levinson's son and find out whether he is now optimistic about the new effort from the Trump administration</p><p>HENRY: Ten years ago today U.S. Citizen and former FBI agent, Bob Levinson, disappeared while inside Iran. The Iranian government claims it is not holding them. According to the Associated Press, Levinson was involved in a CIA operation, which is family disputes. They've accused President Bush and Obama of abandoning him, but perhaps this new administration will be different. And today, White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, signaled that determining Levinson's fate as a top priority.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SPICER: Finally, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that today is the 10-year anniversary of the disappearance of former FBI agent, Robert Levinson from Kish Island, Iran. The Trump administration remains unwavering in our commitment to locate Mr. Levinson and bring him home. The Levinson family has suffered for far too long and we will not rest until his case is resolved.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: Dan Levinson is Bob's son. He joins us no live. And in fact, you have six siblings.</p><p>DAN LEVINSON, SON OF BOB LEVINSON: Yes.</p><p>HENRY: So, big family. Walk me through -- this is to be a tough day.</p><p>LEVINSON: It absolutely is. We're optimistic now. I thought today when I woke up that I just want to get this day over with, but we have a job to do. We're trying to get him home. So, we're optimistic with this new administration and then we're hopeful after hearing statements like this.</p><p>HENRY: You told me that Senator Marco Rubio has been helping you and you're hoping to get -- actually to get a meeting with <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>talk about that that.</p><p>LEVINSON: Yes. We're hoping that -- we're hoping to get the message to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>that if there's one issue that he's so well suited for is this one, to get my dad home, because he has talked about helping take care of people who have been serving our country. He's talked about being tough with America's adversaries. And he's talked about, you know -- the fact that he's previously talked about this where he said that Iran knows exactly where he is. He has no qualms about being aggressive with them. And the thing is he is a dealmaker and this is going to require a deal. So, we're hopeful that this .</p><p>HENRY: And it involves American that he wants to stand up for.</p><p>LEVINSON: Yes. Absolutely. So, I think this is an enormous opportunity for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to do something that the two previous U.S. presidents haven't done.</p><p>HENRY: Do you think President Obama didn't do enough because of the Iran nuclear deal and he is trying to get favor with them?</p><p>LEVINSON: I think that is one of those issues and I think that it wasn't - - he told -- he had said many times over the years that it is a top priority, but he had eight years to get him out and he didn't. I think the biggest issue with that though is he was never aggressive with the Iranians. He never issued threats or repercussions for their inaction. So, we're -- we know that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has no qualms about doing that, threatening sanctions, threatening and labeling the Iranian revolutionary guard a terrorist organization. So, we're hoping that he's going to be .</p><p>HENRY: Let's talk about Iran. Because your family put on out statement and as I read it sometimes, you know, statements can be simple or straightforward. There are tough words in here. And I understand your pain obviously and it's probably coming from there. You stated for 10 years, the government of Iran has been allowed to dodge and weave every time it was asked to come clean about what happened to Bob and send is home. Where is the outrage of this treatment of an American citizen, start with that.</p><p>LEVINSON: Well, the Iranian government arrested my dad and they've held him for 10 years without any basic human rights. And this is an American citizen and there should be outrage around the world and they've been getting away with it. And this is unbelievable that it has been this long and that we're still -- I'm still coming out here and having to plead to get action and to .</p><p>HENRY: Wait. We just had the Iranians at the table and the nuclear deal.</p><p>LEVINSON: Absolutely. And I think there was enormous opportunity that was squandered as well.</p><p>HENRY: And another part of the statement caught my eye. You say, \"Even Bob's government coworkers and their bosses, they know who they are, ran away when he disappeared to their lasting shame.\"</p><p>LEVINSON: Yes. That was -- in the ensuing weeks after he first (inaudible) saying there were mistakes made. We're trying to move past that. It's an issue to be addressed in the future, but we're focused on getting him home.</p><p>HENRY: Sure.</p><p>LEVINSON: And we can do with the repercussions .</p><p>HENRY: I don't want to dwell on that, but for context for our viewers who want to see your dad come home, you deny that he was involved in a CIA mission, but what are you referring to generally when you say there are people who abandoned him? What was he doing there?</p><p>LEVINSON: Well, he was working for the CIA as a contractor and they were the people who were tasked with working with him. They denied it at first and denied -- lied to the federal investigators and the FBI about his ties. So, that was a big issue for us and -- it's just there was so many -- so many complex aspects to this and that -- the focus for us is that the Iranians really have denied everything.</p><p>HENRY: Sure. I can't even imagine your anger when I think about what the Iranian government has done with the stalling, what previous administrations have done, but then they mixed with the emotion of just sadness and a so much sorrow. How does your family deal with it?</p><p>LEVINSON: My mom had told us from the onset to take it one day at a time. We've got to focus on our lives while also working to get him home. He's missed so much. He's missed several weddings. He has two grandchildren on the way. He has several that he hasn't ever met with. And that's tough when our family is all together because we have a big family and it's a happy time.</p><p>HENRY: So, what gives you hope -- this is the last question -- after all this time some some people might have given up hope and said too much time has passed. What still gives you hope?</p><p>LEVINSON: I get it, 10 years someone's missing and you haven't heard, but we fully believe he's alive. The FBI investigators who are involved on the case on a daily basis believe he's alive. People survive 10-year president sentences all the time. He's relatively young. He's going to be 69 tomorrow. And he has a lot to come home to. And they think that the two most pressing health issues he has, diabetes and hypertension, those can be resolved with limited stable diet that he's eating over there.</p><p>HENRY: Dan, we hope he comes home very soon .</p><p>LEVINSON: Thank you.</p><p>HENRY: And we're certainly not going to turn away from the story. Tucker has committed to it .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVINSON: Thank you so much.</p><p>HENRY: Best to your family. Coming up next, we're switching gears. We'll give you a Twitter storm about something that is so much less important and that just reminds us, yes, Lindsay Lohan.</p><p>HENRY: And now it's time for \"TwitterStorm,\" our nightly forecast of social media's most powerful weather patterns. A month ago, Lindsay Lohan was in the news due to rumors she was converting to Islam. Now, she's back for the much more mundane reason that she wants Disney to give her a job. She tweeted, \"Disney, let's do freaky friday and herby sequels. Retweet if you want this.\" Some people were enthusiastic, other people less so. Jason R. Adams tweeted, \"She is desperate for work and craving attention. She got a little by saying she was racially profiled for wearing a hadjib.\" Chastity Montgomery (ph) said, \"Your career ended after Mean Girls. Stop trying.\" Oh, harsh. Though I won't know, Chastity. Mean Girls is the greatest chick flick of all time, just saying. Jake Gioff (ph) tweeted, \"Screw that, I want to Parent Trap too.\" No, Jake, just no. And L'amour said succinctly, \"This is really sad.\" Nailed it. And that is tonight's \"TwitterStorm.\"</p><p>That's about it for us tonight. Tucker will be back in his seat tomorrow. Tune in every night at 9 to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, groupthink. And also, don't forget DVR the show. \"Hannity\" is up next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2017030901cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N29-4G01-DXH2-647F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 9, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Border Procedures</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I3QTk0MDU1RTJFNDQxNkI4QjgxMzA3RTZGNkZCQjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MThGRjk5N0E2MTI4NEJGQjkwMDBCRjc5NkZDQUE4NzU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Immigration Officers</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTM0NTNBODQ1Q0FFNDZDREJBRDA0MTgzQTdGQTZEMTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MThGRjk5N0E2MTI4NEJGQjkwMDBCRjc5NkZDQUE4NzU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001193</classCode><className>TERRITORIAL &amp;

Or it says, 'Have you noticed in the afternoons your blood sugar is always low?' Or, here's a suggestion: 'Every day you walk more than a mile, your numbers are better.' \"</p><p>Tullman, who has worked as a tech investor since leaving electronic medical record company Allscripts in 2012, said he decided to run a company again because his son and niece have Type 1 diabetes.</p><p>\"It's really a family disease,\" he said. \"You want to share that information.\"</p><p>It also doesn't hurt that he thinks the market opportunity is huge.</p><p>Dr. David Kerr of California's Sansum Diabetes Research Institute said In Touch is not the first Internet-enabled glucose monitor. Telcare offers one without a pedometer, for instance.</p><p>Kerr describes this class of devices as a steppingstone to what patients really want: A noninvasive way -- without a finger prick -- to test blood sugar. Kerr speculates that lasers would be the ultimate solution.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google is working on a contact lens that continuously monitors glucose levels by allowing a wearer's tears to seep into a sensor.</p><p>\"The big tech companies -- Google, Apple, Samsung -- are looking to incorporate glucose monitors into wearable sensor devices,\" Kerr said. \"The first company that comes up with a noninvasive way to do that will win big.\"</p><p>Tullman put a different spin on the long-term future: \"Eventually, we're all going to be wearing a patch\" whether you have diabetes or not.</p><p>\"Because guess what? When we can look inside my son, who wears a continuous glucose monitor, we can also tell other things like, 'Hey, you're going to be sick tomorrow.' We know that because there are a lot of white blood cells in your body.</p><p>\"Once we capture that drop of blood, there's a lot more we can tell you about you.\"</p><p>Livongo is an outgrowth of EosHealth, a Houston-based company in which Tullman and Lee Shapiro's venture capital fund, 7wire Ventures, invested in last year. Eos, which developed the technology, is now being folded into Livongo, whose name comes from \"living on the go.\"</p><p>Tullman offered to draw some blood and show me how the device works. No need for a demonstration. My uncle has Type 1 diabetes. But it did make me think to call my uncle for his opinion.</p><p>\"I think it's a good idea, especially for people who don't control or don't take ownership of the situation,\" he said. \"Or minors. Kids going away to college. People who are busy and so involved in work.\"</p><p>One thing this device isn't going to solve is the discrepancy in pricing, which is determined by each person's health insurance policy. To win market share, the company only needs to ensure its device costs less than existing ones.</p><p>The 7wire fund has more than a 20 percent stake in the company. General Catalyst Partners, founded in Cambridge, Mass., 7wire and other venture capital firms invested $15 million into the company. The device was built in a leased facility in Silicon Valley, while the sales and business operations are out of Chicago.</p><p>\"It turns out, people don't want to be more engaged in their health care,\" Tullman said. \"If you have a chronic disease ... the last thing you want to do is spend more time focusing on it.</p><p>\"We're trying to go for a more consumer experience ... having them do less.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mmharris@tribune.com\">mmharris@tribune.com</email></p><p>Twitter @chiconfidential</p><p>ct14 0180 140910 N S 0000000000 00001932</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photos: Glen Tullman's Chicago startup has high hopes for the In Touch blood sugar tracker, top.

It has literally transformed the country, allowing everyone to communicate, gain knowledge, transact commerce, summon a taxi, order food, and stream Bollywood songs. Imagine how much more painful the Covid-19 pandemic would have been without the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The same technologies that have done a lot of good, however, also imperil India's freedoms. They have widened the global equity gap, created echo chambers of disinformation and empowered a small group of foreign companies. It is isn't one East India Company that is looking to colonize India, but several. And they come from both the East and the West.</p><p>The reality now is that technology is taking over every part of our lives; every part of society; every waking moment of every day. Once, technology could be put in a box, a discrete business dominated by business systems and some cool gadgets. Thanks to the internet, it has slowly but surely crept into more corners of our lives. In everything from biology to energy to media to politics to food to transportation, unprecedented change is redefining our future.</p><p>What are we heading for? From the East, you see an aggressive Chinese government, shedding its sheep's clothing, styling itself as a Wolf Warrior. It has become so deeply entrenched in industries such as technology, communications, social media, medicine, and high-value manufacturing that it could literally control the world. It has been perfecting the capabilities of spying on every person on the planet by spying on its own people, and seeks to influence global public opinion through social media and monopolize almost every supply chain by controlling digital infrastructure.</p><p>Now look to the West, where US policy makers from both sides of politics have been grilling the CEOs of some of the largest technology companies, trying to have them take responsibility for the global carnage their products have caused. Yet both the ruling and opposition parties are helpless in controlling these companies' influence and power. The hearings served to document the abuses they had committed, but not to correct them.</p><p>Then there are widening income inequality and a growing technological divide. As the present pandemic decimates global economies, hundreds of millions of people lose their jobs, and hundred of thousands succumb to coronavirus disease, the market valuations of these companies are reaching all-time highs, their owners becoming wealthier by the day. In the US and Europe, more and more people, paying the price but largely excluded from the benefits of technological progress, are protesting however they can. And technologies such as social media are being used to fan the flames and to exploit ignorance and bias.</p><p>As I had discussed in The Driver in the Driverless Car, a book that warned about the dark sides of technologies, the situation will get only worse - unless we find ways to share the prosperity we are creating and chart higher standards for its use. For India, the future could also hold a modern form of colonialism, with foreign companies dominating its industries and taking all the spoils.</p><p>The problem is that the same technologies that bring us together also monitor everything we do.</p><p>Through our smartphones and their applications, Apple, Google, Xiaomi, Tencent, and Facebook track our movements and habits. They know who we speak to. They know what we say. They read our texts and e-mails. And our web searches and the videos we watch tell them our thoughts and preferences. When we post our photos on social media, they store them, recognise our faces and our friends', and use them to learn who we know and where we were and are.</p><p>These companies use all these data to sell ads to us. That is how they make their billions. The problem, as we saw with the US Congressional hearings on Big Tech, is that they lack scruples and the guidance of the most basic ethics. They will allow a person or a government to serve misinformation and propaganda to anyone who fits specified criteria. And this gives them more power than governments have.</p><p>Chinese companies carry the greater risks of the Communist Party's ambition of making the rest of the world subservient to China as it has succeeded in doing to neighbouring states and even imposing force as it has done in Hong Kong. That ambition rests on technological reach. Phone applications such as TikTok and the software on Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo, and other Chinese phones are probably not doing much damage just yet; but they have that potential. Almost any technology that connects to the internet can get a software update that turns it into spyware and worse. China's National Intelligence Law of 2017 requires every company and citizen to \"support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work\". So the Chinese government can induct these companies whenever it wishes to.</p><p>Mastery over our lives is not the role that we envisaged for these technologies. And it's not the future that India wants to build for itself.</p><p>That is why India's prime focus for Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) should be the technologies it chooses to base its digital infrastructure on. India needn't build the semiconductors or mine the rare minerals for electronic components; rather, it can focus on the layers of technology built on top of these, both the assembled hardware and apps.</p><p>India also needs laws that are more stringent than Europe's Data Protection Regulation. Yes, it needs to prevent the export of data; more fundamentally, it must ensure that all Indian residents' data remain their own, for use only with their explicit permission. This will entail dramatically strengthening India's privacy laws, to limit any company's ability to spy on its users.</p><p>India doesn't have to lose this battle to the modern-day East India companies from the East or West. It has the talent to build its own infrastructure and to leap ahead. Its millions of engineers, trained to develop IT systems for the West, give it a huge advantage. It could be creating world-changing technology companies that challenge Silicon Valley as well as China. Let it do so.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

So obviously this Facebook story has been unfolding now for almost seven days and I'm curious what your take is on this, given the perspective you have from running Twitter for five years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  Yes. I think I'll try to offer something that hasn't been discussed widely outside of that technology community. One of the concerns I have or questions I have is the impact it's going to have on the way think --people think about API and access to data in the future.  </p><p>      Obviously, Facebook had built out this platform approach that enable third parties to access this data and use them to interact and engage with people on Facebook and then turned that off some years ago now and are now sort of seeing the consequences of some of that.  </p><p>      I do think it will have an impact on the way technologists and company founders and CEOs going forward think about how that data will be used, how they can audit, how that data is disposed of, et cetera.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  How does Facebook use data in a way that's different than the way Twitter handles data, because as I understand it, Twitter is more protective of user data, though Twitter, of course, has its own issues which we can talk about. But do you think Facebook has been too permissive and too careless about user data  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  Well, you know, just to be, you know, not to be an apologist for what's been going on, but this was -- this platform was public. The APIs were public, people knew what APIs were capable of, and they had been long, long disabled.  </p><p>      The big difference between Twitter and Facebook is that on Facebook, there are lots and lots of personally identifiable information and demographic information that turns out to be particularly helpful to advertisers. Advertisers want to be able to demographically target, micro target, and Twitter doesn't have a lot of that information.  </p><p>      To be, you know, so let's just go back a few years and when I was running Twitter, frequently that was thought of as a disadvantage. You know, Twitter doesn't know anything or enough about its users, so I can't target my advertisements as accurately as I can on Twitter -- on Facebook, rather.  </p><p>      So there are two sides to this coin. In some instances, it is a real benefit to the platform's business and in other areas like we're seeing now, it comes back to haunt you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  We're seeing former Facebook, is increasingly speak out about Facebook what co-founder Brian Acton twitted, #deletefacebook. This is the guy who sold his company to Facebook for $20 billion. Do you think delete Facebook will take off? Do you think this will have a significant impact on users' desirability to use the platform?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  I'm sure these people will be returning all their ill-gotten gains any moment now. I don't think this is -- these things happen. They come up every now and then when there is a big news event around these platforms.  </p><p>Facebook is such an important part of a lot of people's lives. It may be the case that a certain number of people here in Silicon Valley, inside the bubble, if you will, will delete it. I don't think it will be a big movement. It's too much -- it's too important a part of too many people's lives around the world.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Is it disingenuous for people who made a lot of money on Facebook to now --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  I already made a joke about that, come on. That is my comment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Do you think it is? Do you think it is?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  Well, I just think that it's easier, certainly, when you're not a part of the company anymore to sort of sit back and lob in, you know, Molotov cocktails. There are people working extremely hard inside these companies to do the right thing.  </p><p>      I know Edward Ho who leads product at Twitter has been talking a lot about the issues, along with Jack, the issues Twitter is trying to deal with in this regard on the platform. So there are people inside these companies trying to do the right thing and I tend to not love it when people can sit on the sidelines and sort of lob in criticisms to them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview that perhaps tech should be regulated. It's not a question of if, but how. Do you think tech should be regulated, and if so, how?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  I think it probably will. There will end up being regulations here sort of it seems like that tied is in our direction is incoming, if you will. The challenge, particularly around in areas of technology, is it tends to be frequently areas and concepts and details that are difficult to understand, which make them very susceptible to lobbying. And you know, there are lobbyists on all sides of these equations.  </p><p>      So, and then finally, I worry that in most cases the regulations start to fight the last war, right? Well, in the past this happened so let's prevent that from happening again. And the technologies are changing so quickly, they don't anticipate the next issue or challenge that may be coming up, and they sort of -- so they cause you -- they cause these companies work and maybe aren't addressing what the companies have to deal with and what society has to deal with next.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  On that note, Zack also said he sure that version two of Russian meddling is happening on the platform, if (INAUDIBLE) is happening on Facebook, it's probably happening on Twitter as well. Can Facebook and Twitter actually stay ahead of this? Now that they know that it is happens, can they really keep up?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  It's an arms race, like spam was in the past, like phishing and these other kinds of challenges were in the past. The difference now is that there are state actors involved on the other side, not just, you know, a few people trying to hack into an account.  </p><p>      When you've got state actors who have enormous amounts of resources, it's going to be a real battle keeping up with them and going after their new attack vectors. They're never going to attack the same way they attacked in the past. They'll try new and different tactics, and keeping up with that is going to be a real challenge for these platforms.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  I want to talk to you about the founders for change movement, which you have committed to. This is a committed by --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  It always good to have a 54-year old white guy on a gender equity conversation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Founders committing to consider the diversity of a venture capital firm when taking money. So whether they have a woman or a person of color who can actually write a check, you know, the founders of Airbnb, the founders of Stitch Fix, the founders of Lyft have all said that they will do this. Why do you think this important?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  So I think the difference between this and then the sort of commitments or efforts like this in the past are that you have a new generation of founders. You know, you mentioned Katrina and Stitch Fix. But in this new generation of founders have women leaders to look up to.  </p><p>      You've got CEOs like Julia Hartz of Eventbrite and then Jackie (ph) at 23 in the end, sort of on and on and on these existing female leaders and CEOs who this new generation of female founders can look up to, and realize it doesn't have to be that way.  </p><p>      So you see folks like Alyssa at Hitcamp going and raising money from Sarah Tavel at Benchmark because she wants to be able to work with women investors. And I think that -- as that happens and as we see great companies making that demand, you'll see investors starts to be more gender balance firm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So you think it will really change?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  I do. And I think it is because of this new wave of founders if you will, who have existing women CEOs who they can look up to and trust, and who are there to tell them it doesn't have to be that way anymore.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  All right, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, always good to have you here on Bloomberg. Thank you for stopping by.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COSTOLO</emphasis>:  Great to be here, thanks.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RY8-7MJ1-F15W-H3TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO,  IS INTERVIEWED ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARCH 23, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]  EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  A former big tech CEO who had some unique  perspective on this situation in particular, former Twitter CEO Dick  Costolo with me here.  So obviously this Facebook story has been unfolding  now for almost seven days and I'm curious what your take is on this, given  the perspective you have from running Twitter for five years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO:  Yes.  I think I'll try to offer  something that hasn't been discussed widely outside of that technology  community.  One of the concerns I have or questions I have is the impact  it's going to have on the way think --people think about API and access to  data in the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Obviously, Facebook had built out this platform approach that enable third  parties to access this data and use them to interact and engage with people  on Facebook and then turned that off some years ago now and are now sort of  seeing the consequences of some of that.</p><p>I do think it will have an impact on the way technologists and company  founders and CEOs going forward think about how that data will be used, how  they can audit, how that data is disposed of, et cetera.</p><p>CHANG:  How does Facebook use data in a way that's different than the way  Twitter handles data, because as I understand it, Twitter is more  protective of user data, though Twitter, of course, has its own issues  which we can talk about.  But do you think Facebook has been too permissive  and too careless about user data</p><p>COSTOLO:  Well, you know, just to be, you know, not to be an apologist for  what's been going on, but this was -- this platform was public.  The APIs  were public, people knew what APIs were capable of, and they had been long,  long disabled.</p><p>The big difference between Twitter and Facebook is that on Facebook, there  are lots and lots of personally identifiable information and demographic  information that turns out to be particularly helpful to advertisers.   Advertisers want to be able to demographically target, micro target, and  Twitter doesn't have a lot of that information.</p><p>To be, you know, so let's just go back a few years and when I was running  Twitter, frequently that was thought of as a disadvantage.  You know,  Twitter doesn't know anything or enough about its users, so I can't target  my advertisements as accurately as I can on Twitter -- on Facebook, rather.</p><p>So there are two sides to this coin.  In some instances, it is a real  benefit to the platform's business and in other areas like we're seeing  now, it comes back to haunt you.</p><p>CHANG:  We're seeing former Facebook, is increasingly speak out about  Facebook what co-founder Brian Acton twitted, #deletefacebook.  This is the  guy who sold his company to Facebook for $20 billion. Do you think delete  Facebook will take off?  Do you think this will have a significant impact  on users' desirability to use the platform?</p><p>COSTOLO:  I'm sure these people will be returning all their ill-gotten  gains any moment now.  I don't think this is -- these things happen.  They  come up every now and then when there is a big news event around these  platforms.</p><p>Facebook is such an important part of a lot of people's lives.  It may be  the case that a certain number of people here in Silicon Valley, inside the  bubble, if you will, will delete it.  I don't think it will be a big  movement.  It's too much -- it's too important a part of too many people's  lives around the world.</p><p>CHANG:  Is it disingenuous for people who made a lot of money on Facebook  to now --</p><p>COSTOLO:  I already made a joke about that, come on.  That is my comment.</p><p>CHANG:  Do you think it is?  Do you think it is?</p><p>COSTOLO:  Well, I just think that it's easier, certainly, when you're not a  part of the company anymore to sort of sit back and lob in, you know,  Molotov cocktails.  There are people working extremely hard inside these  companies to do the right thing.</p><p>I know Edward Ho who leads product at Twitter has been talking a lot about  the issues, along with Jack, the issues Twitter is trying to deal with in  this regard on the platform.  So there are people inside these companies  trying to do the right thing and I tend to not love it when people can sit  on the sidelines and sort of lob in criticisms to them.</p><p>CHANG:  Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview that perhaps tech should be  regulated.  It's not a question of if, but how.  Do you think tech should  be regulated, and if so, how?</p><p>COSTOLO:  I think it probably will.  There will end up being regulations  here sort of it seems like that tied is in our direction is incoming, if  you will.  The challenge, particularly around in areas of technology, is it  tends to be frequently areas and concepts and details that are difficult to  understand, which make them very susceptible to lobbying.  And you know,  there are lobbyists on all sides of these equations.</p><p>So, and then finally, I worry that in most cases the regulations start to  fight the last war, right?  Well, in the past this happened so let's  prevent that from happening again.  And the technologies are changing so  quickly, they don't anticipate the next issue or challenge that may be  coming up, and they sort of -- so they cause you -- they cause these  companies work and maybe aren't addressing what the companies have to deal  with and what society has to deal with next.</p><p>CHANG:  On that note, Zack also said he sure that version two of Russian  meddling is happening on the platform, if (INAUDIBLE) is happening on  Facebook, it's probably happening on Twitter as well.  Can Facebook and  Twitter actually stay ahead of this?  Now that they know that it is  happens, can they really keep up?</p><p>COSTOLO:  It's an arms race, like spam was in the past, like phishing and  these other kinds of challenges were in the past.  The difference now is  that there are state actors involved on the other side, not just, you know,  a few people trying to hack into an account.</p><p>When you've got state actors who have enormous amounts of resources, it's  going to be a real battle keeping up with them and going after their new  attack vectors.  They're never going to attack the same way they attacked  in the past.  They'll try new and different tactics, and keeping up with  that is going to be a real challenge for these platforms.</p><p>CHANG:  I want to talk to you about the founders for change movement, which  you have committed to.  This is a committed by --</p><p>COSTOLO:  It always good to have a 54-year old white guy on a gender equity  conversation.</p><p>CHANG:  Founders committing to consider the diversity of a venture capital  firm when taking money.  So whether they have a woman or a person of color  who can actually write a check, you know, the founders of Airbnb, the  founders of Stitch Fix, the founders of Lyft have all said that they will  do this.  Why do you think this important?</p><p>COSTOLO:  So I think the difference between this and then the sort of  commitments or efforts like this in the past are that you have a new  generation of founders.  You know, you mentioned Katrina and Stitch Fix.   But in this new generation of founders have women leaders to look up to.</p><p>You've got CEOs like Julia Hartz of Eventbrite and then Jackie (ph) at 23  in the end, sort of on and on and on these existing female leaders and CEOs  who this new generation of female founders can look up to, and realize it  doesn't have to be that way.</p><p>So you see folks like Alyssa at Hitcamp going and raising money from Sarah  Tavel at Benchmark because she wants to be able to work with women  investors.  And I think that -- as that happens and as we see great  companies making that demand, you'll see investors starts to be more gender  balance firm.</p><p>CHANG:  So you think it will really change?</p><p>COSTOLO:  I do.  And I think it is because of this new wave of founders if  you will, who have existing women CEOs who they can look up to and trust,  and who are there to tell them it doesn't have to be that way anymore.</p><p>CHANG:  All right, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, always good to have you  here on Bloomberg.  Thank you for stopping by.</p><p>COSTOLO:  Great to be here, thanks.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO, IS INTERVIEWED ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARCH 23, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: A former big tech CEO who had some unique perspective on this situation in particular, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo with me here. So obviously this Facebook story has been unfolding now for almost seven days and I'm curious what your take is on this, given the perspective you have from running Twitter for five years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO: Yes. I think I'll try to offer something that hasn't been discussed widely outside of that technology community. One of the concerns I have or questions I have is the impact it's going to have on the way think --people think about API and access to data in the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Obviously, Facebook had built out this platform approach that enable third parties to access this data and use them to interact and engage with people on Facebook and then turned that off some years ago now and are now sort of seeing the consequences of some of that.</p><p>I do think it will have an impact on the way technologists and company founders and CEOs going forward think about how that data will be used, how they can audit, how that data is disposed of, et cetera.</p><p>CHANG: How does Facebook use data in a way that's different than the way Twitter handles data, because as I understand it, Twitter is more protective of user data, though Twitter, of course, has its own issues which we can talk about. But do you think Facebook has been too permissive and too careless about user data</p><p>COSTOLO: Well, you know, just to be, you know, not to be an apologist for what's been going on, but this was -- this platform was public. The APIs were public, people knew what APIs were capable of, and they had been long, long disabled.</p><p>The big difference between Twitter and Facebook is that on Facebook, there are lots and lots of personally identifiable information and demographic information that turns out to be particularly helpful to advertisers. Advertisers want to be able to demographically target, micro target, and Twitter doesn't have a lot of that information.</p><p>To be, you know, so let's just go back a few years and when I was running Twitter, frequently that was thought of as a disadvantage. You know, Twitter doesn't know anything or enough about its users, so I can't target my advertisements as accurately as I can on Twitter -- on Facebook, rather.</p><p>So there are two sides to this coin. In some instances, it is a real benefit to the platform's business and in other areas like we're seeing now, it comes back to haunt you.</p><p>CHANG: We're seeing former Facebook, is increasingly speak out about Facebook what co-founder Brian Acton twitted, #deletefacebook. This is the guy who sold his company to Facebook for $20 billion. Do you think delete Facebook will take off? Do you think this will have a significant impact on users' desirability to use the platform?</p><p>COSTOLO: I'm sure these people will be returning all their ill-gotten gains any moment now. I don't think this is -- these things happen. They come up every now and then when there is a big news event around these platforms.</p><p>Facebook is such an important part of a lot of people's lives. It may be the case that a certain number of people here in Silicon Valley, inside the bubble, if you will, will delete it. I don't think it will be a big movement. It's too much -- it's too important a part of too many people's lives around the world.</p><p>CHANG: Is it disingenuous for people who made a lot of money on Facebook to now --</p><p>COSTOLO: I already made a joke about that, come on. That is my comment.</p><p>CHANG: Do you think it is? Do you think it is?</p><p>COSTOLO: Well, I just think that it's easier, certainly, when you're not a part of the company anymore to sort of sit back and lob in, you know, Molotov cocktails. There are people working extremely hard inside these companies to do the right thing.</p><p>I know Edward Ho who leads product at Twitter has been talking a lot about the issues, along with Jack, the issues Twitter is trying to deal with in this regard on the platform. So there are people inside these companies trying to do the right thing and I tend to not love it when people can sit on the sidelines and sort of lob in criticisms to them.</p><p>CHANG: Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview that perhaps tech should be regulated. It's not a question of if, but how. Do you think tech should be regulated, and if so, how?</p><p>COSTOLO: I think it probably will. There will end up being regulations here sort of it seems like that tied is in our direction is incoming, if you will. The challenge, particularly around in areas of technology, is it tends to be frequently areas and concepts and details that are difficult to understand, which make them very susceptible to lobbying. And you know, there are lobbyists on all sides of these equations.</p><p>So, and then finally, I worry that in most cases the regulations start to fight the last war, right? Well, in the past this happened so let's prevent that from happening again. And the technologies are changing so quickly, they don't anticipate the next issue or challenge that may be coming up, and they sort of -- so they cause you -- they cause these companies work and maybe aren't addressing what the companies have to deal with and what society has to deal with next.</p><p>CHANG: On that note, Zack also said he sure that version two of Russian meddling is happening on the platform, if (INAUDIBLE) is happening on Facebook, it's probably happening on Twitter as well. Can Facebook and Twitter actually stay ahead of this? Now that they know that it is happens, can they really keep up?</p><p>COSTOLO: It's an arms race, like spam was in the past, like phishing and these other kinds of challenges were in the past. The difference now is that there are state actors involved on the other side, not just, you know, a few people trying to hack into an account.</p><p>When you've got state actors who have enormous amounts of resources, it's going to be a real battle keeping up with them and going after their new attack vectors. They're never going to attack the same way they attacked in the past. They'll try new and different tactics, and keeping up with that is going to be a real challenge for these platforms.</p><p>CHANG: I want to talk to you about the founders for change movement, which you have committed to. This is a committed by --</p><p>COSTOLO: It always good to have a 54-year old white guy on a gender equity conversation.</p><p>CHANG: Founders committing to consider the diversity of a venture capital firm when taking money. So whether they have a woman or a person of color who can actually write a check, you know, the founders of Airbnb, the founders of Stitch Fix, the founders of Lyft have all said that they will do this. Why do you think this important?</p><p>COSTOLO: So I think the difference between this and then the sort of commitments or efforts like this in the past are that you have a new generation of founders. You know, you mentioned Katrina and Stitch Fix. But in this new generation of founders have women leaders to look up to.</p><p>You've got CEOs like Julia Hartz of Eventbrite and then Jackie (ph) at 23 in the end, sort of on and on and on these existing female leaders and CEOs who this new generation of female founders can look up to, and realize it doesn't have to be that way.</p><p>So you see folks like Alyssa at Hitcamp going and raising money from Sarah Tavel at Benchmark because she wants to be able to work with women investors. And I think that -- as that happens and as we see great companies making that demand, you'll see investors starts to be more gender balance firm.</p><p>CHANG: So you think it will really change?</p><p>COSTOLO: I do. And I think it is because of this new wave of founders if you will, who have existing women CEOs who they can look up to and trust, and who are there to tell them it doesn't have to be that way anymore.</p><p>CHANG: All right, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, always good to have you here on Bloomberg. Thank you for stopping by.</p><p>COSTOLO: Great to be here, thanks.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO, IS INTERVIEWED ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARCH 23, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: A former big tech CEO who had some unique perspective on this situation in particular, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo with me here. So obviously this Facebook story has been unfolding now for almost seven days and I'm curious what your take is on this, given the perspective you have from running Twitter for five years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO: Yes. I think I'll try to offer something that hasn't been discussed widely outside of that technology community. One of the concerns I have or questions I have is the impact it's going to have on the way think --people think about API and access to data in the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Obviously, Facebook had built out this platform approach that enable third parties to access this data and use them to interact and engage with people on Facebook and then turned that off some years ago now and are now sort of seeing the consequences of some of that.</p><p>I do think it will have an impact on the way technologists and company founders and CEOs going forward think about how that data will be used, how they can audit, how that data is disposed of, et cetera.</p><p>CHANG: How does Facebook use data in a way that's different than the way Twitter handles data, because as I understand it, Twitter is more protective of user data, though Twitter, of course, has its own issues which we can talk about. But do you think Facebook has been too permissive and too careless about user data</p><p>COSTOLO: Well, you know, just to be, you know, not to be an apologist for what's been going on, but this was -- this platform was public. The APIs were public, people knew what APIs were capable of, and they had been long, long disabled.</p><p>The big difference between Twitter and Facebook is that on Facebook, there are lots and lots of personally identifiable information and demographic information that turns out to be particularly helpful to advertisers. Advertisers want to be able to demographically target, micro target, and Twitter doesn't have a lot of that information.</p><p>To be, you know, so let's just go back a few years and when I was running Twitter, frequently that was thought of as a disadvantage. You know, Twitter doesn't know anything or enough about its users, so I can't target my advertisements as accurately as I can on Twitter -- on Facebook, rather.</p><p>So there are two sides to this coin. In some instances, it is a real benefit to the platform's business and in other areas like we're seeing now, it comes back to haunt you.</p><p>CHANG: We're seeing former Facebook, is increasingly speak out about Facebook what co-founder Brian Acton twitted, #deletefacebook. This is the guy who sold his company to Facebook for $20 billion. Do you think delete Facebook will take off? Do you think this will have a significant impact on users' desirability to use the platform?</p><p>COSTOLO: I'm sure these people will be returning all their ill-gotten gains any moment now. I don't think this is -- these things happen. They come up every now and then when there is a big news event around these platforms.</p><p>Facebook is such an important part of a lot of people's lives. It may be the case that a certain number of people here in Silicon Valley, inside the bubble, if you will, will delete it. I don't think it will be a big movement. It's too much -- it's too important a part of too many people's lives around the world.</p><p>CHANG: Is it disingenuous for people who made a lot of money on Facebook to now --</p><p>COSTOLO: I already made a joke about that, come on. That is my comment.</p><p>CHANG: Do you think it is? Do you think it is?</p><p>COSTOLO: Well, I just think that it's easier, certainly, when you're not a part of the company anymore to sort of sit back and lob in, you know, Molotov cocktails. There are people working extremely hard inside these companies to do the right thing.</p><p>I know Edward Ho who leads product at Twitter has been talking a lot about the issues, along with Jack, the issues Twitter is trying to deal with in this regard on the platform. So there are people inside these companies trying to do the right thing and I tend to not love it when people can sit on the sidelines and sort of lob in criticisms to them.</p><p>CHANG: Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview that perhaps tech should be regulated. It's not a question of if, but how. Do you think tech should be regulated, and if so, how?</p><p>COSTOLO: I think it probably will. There will end up being regulations here sort of it seems like that tied is in our direction is incoming, if you will. The challenge, particularly around in areas of technology, is it tends to be frequently areas and concepts and details that are difficult to understand, which make them very susceptible to lobbying. And you know, there are lobbyists on all sides of these equations.</p><p>So, and then finally, I worry that in most cases the regulations start to fight the last war, right? Well, in the past this happened so let's prevent that from happening again. And the technologies are changing so quickly, they don't anticipate the next issue or challenge that may be coming up, and they sort of -- so they cause you -- they cause these companies work and maybe aren't addressing what the companies have to deal with and what society has to deal with next.</p><p>CHANG: On that note, Zack also said he sure that version two of Russian meddling is happening on the platform, if (INAUDIBLE) is happening on Facebook, it's probably happening on Twitter as well. Can Facebook and Twitter actually stay ahead of this? Now that they know that it is happens, can they really keep up?</p><p>COSTOLO: It's an arms race, like spam was in the past, like phishing and these other kinds of challenges were in the past. The difference now is that there are state actors involved on the other side, not just, you know, a few people trying to hack into an account.</p><p>When you've got state actors who have enormous amounts of resources, it's going to be a real battle keeping up with them and going after their new attack vectors. They're never going to attack the same way they attacked in the past. They'll try new and different tactics, and keeping up with that is going to be a real challenge for these platforms.</p><p>CHANG: I want to talk to you about the founders for change movement, which you have committed to. This is a committed by --</p><p>COSTOLO: It always good to have a 54-year old white guy on a gender equity conversation.</p><p>CHANG: Founders committing to consider the diversity of a venture capital firm when taking money. So whether they have a woman or a person of color who can actually write a check, you know, the founders of Airbnb, the founders of Stitch Fix, the founders of Lyft have all said that they will do this. Why do you think this important?</p><p>COSTOLO: So I think the difference between this and then the sort of commitments or efforts like this in the past are that you have a new generation of founders. You know, you mentioned Katrina and Stitch Fix. But in this new generation of founders have women leaders to look up to.</p><p>You've got CEOs like Julia Hartz of Eventbrite and then Jackie (ph) at 23 in the end, sort of on and on and on these existing female leaders and CEOs who this new generation of female founders can look up to, and realize it doesn't have to be that way.</p><p>So you see folks like Alyssa at Hitcamp going and raising money from Sarah Tavel at Benchmark because she wants to be able to work with women investors. And I think that -- as that happens and as we see great companies making that demand, you'll see investors starts to be more gender balance firm.</p><p>CHANG: So you think it will really change?</p><p>COSTOLO: I do. And I think it is because of this new wave of founders if you will, who have existing women CEOs who they can look up to and trust, and who are there to tell them it doesn't have to be that way anymore.</p><p>CHANG: All right, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, always good to have you here on Bloomberg. Thank you for stopping by.</p><p>COSTOLO: Great to be here, thanks.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

That8217;s why I was taken aback by the recent mailer from my Senator, Dick Saslaw, declaring him 8220;Our Environmental Leader in the State Senate.8221; As I and others at BV have long documented, Senator Saslaw is rarely able to hide his contempt for anyone who dare raise an environmental issue to his face 8211; as shown in videos of his town halls like this one[1]. He often repeats fossil fuel industry talking points like 8220;this talk about the Green New Deal 8211; that8217;s fine if you don8217;t mind us being without electricity 16 hours a day8221; as he absurdly claimed at a recent debate[2] with his challenger, Yasmine Taeb[3]. On environmental issues, the League of Conservation Voters gives Saslaw the lowest lifetime score[4] of any Senate Democrat, while Sierra Club graded him a 8220;D8221;[5] in 2018.160; He is infamous for his relationship with Dominion Power, having received over $350,000[6] from them over the years as the company8217;s top individual recipient 8211; in return, consistently championing[7] Dominion8217;s anti-clean energy bills in the Senate. But being challenged by a compelling young progressive in a Democratic primary can make an old-school corporate crony pol suddenly want to portray himself as something he is not. </p><p>So in this mailer, he claims credit for 8220;Clean Energy and Grid Modernization8221;; 8220;New Solar Panels on more than 200 government buildings and schools here in Fairfax County8221;; 8220;More Solar and Wind energy sources to power our homes in clean and renewable ways8221; and a 8220;Modern Electric Grid8221; among other things. We can dismiss the claim about Fairfax County immediately, as the greening of our buildings and schools is the responsibility of the County Board of Supervisors and county government staff, and Saslaw has no business claiming credit for their work. The other clean energy claims relate to his co-sponsorship of last year8217;s electric utility regulation bill, SB 966/SB 967[8], the only reference provided in the mailer. 160;So, debunking Saslaw8217;s claims to be a great clean energy champion requires unpacking the sordid details and history of this bill. The short version is that, contrary to his claims, there are no clean energy mandates in this law 8211; and the clean energy provisions it contains are aimed at enriching Dominion, not helping consumers. A more detailed analysis follows. The Great Dominion Deregulation Disaster Over the past 23 years, Dominion has shelled out a staggering $16 million in donations[9] to Virginia politicians, demanding loyalty in return. This has allowed the utility to keep the Commonwealth far behind by most clean energy measures. As the longtime Democratic Leader of the State Senate, as well as a key member of major Committees like Commerce and Labor, Saslaw represents an important capture for Dominion. As Dominion has written more and more bills to deregulate itself, Saslaw has been one of the most willing to introduce and fight for such legislation. The 2018 law that he claims makes him an environmental champion was designed to fix the General Assembly8217;s last deregulatory disaster, the so-called 8220;rate freeze8221; bill of 2015 8211; which Saslaw also promoted. The 2015 bill removed the power of the State Corporation Commission (SCC) to review and adjust Dominion8217;s electricity rates for 5 years. The excuse for this gift to Dominion was that Obama8217;s Clean Power Plan was supposedly going to be too costly for the utility to handle 8211; as Saslaw put it[10] in the monopoly8217;s defense, Dominion will be forced to 8220;absorb $82 million in costs [from the] potential EPA regulations.8221; In fact, such Clean Power Plan compliance cost estimates were way overblown[11] 8211; and Dominion is estimated to have pocketed over $400 million[12] just in 2017 thanks to this bill. These realities, and that of Trump now working to gut Obama8217;s Clean Power Plan, led Dominion and its allies to find a way to put glossier lipstick on this pig. So Dominion wrote the 2018 fix and handed it to Saslaw to introduce. Except that this new bill was seen as a new disaster 8211; by nearly everyone, including environmentalists, conservative Republicans, Governor Northam, Attorney General Herring and numerous Senators and Delegates. As Ivy Main said of the original bill in Power to the People[13], it 8220;throws a small fraction of past overearnings back to customers, ignores 2017 overearnings altogether, and allows utilities to game the system so rates can only go up hereafter.8221; The bill revised the SCC8217;s former right to review rates every two years, now limiting the agency to reviews every three years. It allowed the utility to keep overearnings as long as they plow them into new energy projects 8211; but as the SCC confirmed when asked by 11 Senators to comment, Saslaw8217;s bill allowed a 8220;double dip8221;[14] entitling the utility to charge customers for the same projects twice. Saslaw8217;s fumbling of this ball forced others to pick it up. First, Governor Northam convened a group of stakeholders[15] to negotiate an improvement 8211; pointedly excluding legislators, perhaps a sign of how badly they8217;d muffed it up. The revised bill[16], with a few more bones tossed to consumers and environmental groups, passed the Senate. And then came a remarkable moment in the House of Delegates, as many Democrats 8211; including the newly elected progressive ones 8211; joined with a few Republicans to slap the bill down[17] with an amendment banning the double dip 8211; one of Dominion8217;s biggest defeats ever. So Saslaw is claiming credit here for a bill Dominion wrote, which he introduced, that turned out to be such an unmitigated disaster that dozens of people from all sides of the political spectrum had to work to fix it 8211; with the final version still problematic, i.e., SCC reviews still limited to every three years and refunds still not covering the full amount of Dominion8217;s overcharges. Saslaw8217;s Clean Energy Con Which brings us to the clean energy provisions added to the bill as sweeteners, upon which Saslaw stakes his environmental reputation. To put the discussion in context, whereas 29 states[18] have mandatory renewable portfolio standards requiring that utilities get a certain percentage of their electricity from renewables, and 20 states[19] have mandatory energy efficiency resource standards requiring utilities to achieve energy use reductions, Virginia has neither. Dominion and the politicians within its grip have never allowed them. Instead, this bill requires the SCC to consider the development of up to 5,000 MW of renewable energy generation to be 8220;in the public interest.8221; This means, essentially, that of all the boxes that the SCC is required to check in order to approve an energy project, the legislature has pre-checked one of them. That8217;s something, but it8217;s much less than Saslaw claims, for a few reasons. First, this legislative language puts the ball in Dominion8217;s court to propose new projects 8211; the kind of control our monopoly likes to have 8211; while diminishing the SCC8217;s power to judge such projects, rather than just giving regulators and the regulated clear and unequivocal renewable energy goals to meet. Second, the SCC has made clear that it retains the right to ensure that any projects proposed must check other required boxes 8211; as last year, when it rejected[20] a wind project from Virginia8217;s other electric utility, Appalachian Power, on the grounds that the investment was not necessary to meet its customers8217; power needs. As a lawyer for that utility put it, 8220;I don8217;t read the law as being a slam-dunk for anything.8221; The law and Dominion policies have also underlined that the focus of its renewable energy development will be to support big corporate entities 8211; NOT Virginia consumers. The law stipulates that a whopping 75% of the renewables developed are to be owned by the utilities 8211; leaving a measly 25%[21] for the rest of us. Importantly, when you read that there is a lot of solar development going on in Virginia right now, you should know that it is primarily the result of the major tech companies demanding it for their data centers. Fun fact[22] 8211; did you know that 8220;more than 70% of the world8217;s Internet traffic is thought to flow through Northern Virginia8221; 8211; i.e., our data centers?160; Well, the big tech companies demanding renewable energy for these power-hungry facilities to meet corporate clean energy goals 8211; Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. 8211; are the ones forcing Dominion to respond. Dominion, by meeting the demands of these big corporate clients, gets to claim credit for the outcome 8211; right along with Dick Saslaw. Meanwhile, consumers like me and you are no closer to getting solar panels on our homes or small businesses. And while 5,000 MW of renewables is a clear step forward, it remains a modest goal compared to many other states8217; mandated goals. Our smaller Southern Republican neighbor, North Carolina, already has installed[23] more solar energy than that. To build on the analysis Ivy Main did[24] of the first draft of the bill, this equals less than 5% of Virginia8217;s total electricity supply 8211; while other states have set goals for renewables to account for much higher percentages of their power, up to 100%. Finally, on energy efficiency 8211; for which Dominion has been ranked second to last[25] in the whole country 8211; the legislation called for the utility to devote $870 million over the next decade to such programs. Sad to say, Dominion tried to reduce that commitment[26] too by counting revenues lost to efficiency as 8220;spending8221; 8211; until Governor Northam and others called the monopoly out on that cheap trick. Another sign of the shakiness of the law on which Saslaw hangs his big green hat. Bottom Line The best leaders don8217;t try to present themselves as all things to all people. They stand on their principles and explain their stances so that even those with whom they disagree can appreciate and respect where they8217;re coming from. But that8217;s not the case here. Sen. Saslaw is grossly misrepresenting his record on the environment in order to mislead his own Democratic base. Why is this okay with so many of his fellow Democratic elected officials, who continue to stand by and support him? I don8217;t know 8211; but I do know that I will continue to support his opponent, Yasmine Taeb[27] who takes no money from Dominion, supports a Green New Deal and Solar Freedom Act for Virginia, and is fully transparent about her positions, to replace him as the Democratic nominee for SD-35 on June 11th.160; And I hope you do too.

That...7;s why I was taken aback by the recent mailer from my Senator, Dick Saslaw, declaring him ...0;Our Environmental Leader in the State Senate....1; As I and others at BV have long documented, Senator Saslaw is rarely able to hide his contempt for anyone who dare raise an environmental issue to his face ...1; as shown in videos of his town halls like this one[1]. He often repeats fossil fuel industry talking points like ...0;this talk about the Green New Deal ...1; that...7;s fine if you don...7;t mind us being without electricity 16 hours a day...1; as he absurdly claimed at a recent debate[2] with his challenger, Yasmine Taeb[3]. On environmental issues, the League of Conservation Voters gives Saslaw the lowest lifetime score[4] of any Senate Democrat, while Sierra Club graded him a ...0;D...1;[5] in 2018....; He is infamous for his relationship with Dominion Power, having received over $350,000[6] from them over the years as the company...7;s top individual recipient ...1; in return, consistently championing[7] Dominion...7;s anti-clean energy bills in the Senate. But being challenged by a compelling young progressive in a Democratic primary can make an old-school corporate crony pol suddenly want to portray himself as something he is not. </p><p>So in this mailer, he claims credit for ...0;Clean Energy and Grid Modernization...1;; ...0;New Solar Panels on more than 200 government buildings and schools here in Fairfax County...1;; ...0;More Solar and Wind energy sources to power our homes in clean and renewable ways...1; and a ...0;Modern Electric Grid...1; among other things. We can dismiss the claim about Fairfax County immediately, as the greening of our buildings and schools is the responsibility of the County Board of Supervisors and county government staff, and Saslaw has no business claiming credit for their work. The other clean energy claims relate to his co-sponsorship of last year...7;s electric utility regulation bill, SB 966/SB 967[8], the only reference provided in the mailer. ...;So, debunking Saslaw...7;s claims to be a great clean energy champion requires unpacking the sordid details and history of this bill. The short version is that, contrary to his claims, there are no clean energy mandates in this law ...1; and the clean energy provisions it contains are aimed at enriching Dominion, not helping consumers. A more detailed analysis follows. The Great Dominion Deregulation Disaster Over the past 23 years, Dominion has shelled out a staggering $16 million in donations[9] to Virginia politicians, demanding loyalty in return. This has allowed the utility to keep the Commonwealth far behind by most clean energy measures. As the longtime Democratic Leader of the State Senate, as well as a key member of major Committees like Commerce and Labor, Saslaw represents an important capture for Dominion. As Dominion has written more and more bills to deregulate itself, Saslaw has been one of the most willing to introduce and fight for such legislation. The 2018 law that he claims makes him an environmental champion was designed to fix the General Assembly...7;s last deregulatory disaster, the so-called ...0;rate freeze...1; bill of 2015 ...1; which Saslaw also promoted. The 2015 bill removed the power of the State Corporation Commission (SCC) to review and adjust Dominion...7;s electricity rates for 5 years. The excuse for this gift to Dominion was that Obama...7;s Clean Power Plan was supposedly going to be too costly for the utility to handle ...1; as Saslaw put it[10] in the monopoly...7;s defense, Dominion will be forced to ...0;absorb $82 million in costs [from the] potential EPA regulations....1; In fact, such Clean Power Plan compliance cost estimates were way overblown[11] ...1; and Dominion is estimated to have pocketed over $400 million[12] just in 2017 thanks to this bill. These realities, and that of Trump now working to gut Obama...7;s Clean Power Plan, led Dominion and its allies to find a way to put glossier lipstick on this pig. So Dominion wrote the 2018 fix and handed it to Saslaw to introduce. Except that this new bill was seen as a new disaster ...1; by nearly everyone, including environmentalists, conservative Republicans, Governor Northam, Attorney General Herring and numerous Senators and Delegates. As Ivy Main said of the original bill in Power to the People[13], it ...0;throws a small fraction of past overearnings back to customers, ignores 2017 overearnings altogether, and allows utilities to game the system so rates can only go up hereafter....1; The bill revised the SCC...7;s former right to review rates every two years, now limiting the agency to reviews every three years. It allowed the utility to keep overearnings as long as they plow them into new energy projects ...1; but as the SCC confirmed when asked by 11 Senators to comment, Saslaw...7;s bill allowed a ...0;double dip...1;[14] entitling the utility to charge customers for the same projects twice. Saslaw...7;s fumbling of this ball forced others to pick it up. First, Governor Northam convened a group of stakeholders[15] to negotiate an improvement ...1; pointedly excluding legislators, perhaps a sign of how badly they...7;d muffed it up. The revised bill[16], with a few more bones tossed to consumers and environmental groups, passed the Senate. And then came a remarkable moment in the House of Delegates, as many Democrats ...1; including the newly elected progressive ones ...1; joined with a few Republicans to slap the bill down[17] with an amendment banning the double dip ...1; one of Dominion...7;s biggest defeats ever. So Saslaw is claiming credit here for a bill Dominion wrote, which he introduced, that turned out to be such an unmitigated disaster that dozens of people from all sides of the political spectrum had to work to fix it ...1; with the final version still problematic, i.e., SCC reviews still limited to every three years and refunds still not covering the full amount of Dominion...7;s overcharges. Saslaw...7;s Clean Energy Con Which brings us to the clean energy provisions added to the bill as sweeteners, upon which Saslaw stakes his environmental reputation. To put the discussion in context, whereas 29 states[18] have mandatory renewable portfolio standards requiring that utilities get a certain percentage of their electricity from renewables, and 20 states[19] have mandatory energy efficiency resource standards requiring utilities to achieve energy use reductions, Virginia has neither. Dominion and the politicians within its grip have never allowed them. Instead, this bill requires the SCC to consider the development of up to 5,000 MW of renewable energy generation to be ...0;in the public interest....1; This means, essentially, that of all the boxes that the SCC is required to check in order to approve an energy project, the legislature has pre-checked one of them. That...7;s something, but it...7;s much less than Saslaw claims, for a few reasons. First, this legislative language puts the ball in Dominion...7;s court to propose new projects ...1; the kind of control our monopoly likes to have ...1; while diminishing the SCC...7;s power to judge such projects, rather than just giving regulators and the regulated clear and unequivocal renewable energy goals to meet. Second, the SCC has made clear that it retains the right to ensure that any projects proposed must check other required boxes ...1; as last year, when it rejected[20] a wind project from Virginia...7;s other electric utility, Appalachian Power, on the grounds that the investment was not necessary to meet its customers...7; power needs. As a lawyer for that utility put it, ...0;I don...7;t read the law as being a slam-dunk for anything....1; The law and Dominion policies have also underlined that the focus of its renewable energy development will be to support big corporate entities ...1; NOT Virginia consumers. The law stipulates that a whopping 75% of the renewables developed are to be owned by the utilities ...1; leaving a measly 25%[21] for the rest of us. Importantly, when you read that there is a lot of solar development going on in Virginia right now, you should know that it is primarily the result of the major tech companies demanding it for their data centers. Fun fact[22] ...1; did you know that ...0;more than 70% of the world...7;s Internet traffic is thought to flow through Northern Virginia...1; ...1; i.e., our data centers?...; Well, the big tech companies demanding renewable energy for these power-hungry facilities to meet corporate clean energy goals ...1; Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. ...1; are the ones forcing Dominion to respond. Dominion, by meeting the demands of these big corporate clients, gets to claim credit for the outcome ...1; right along with Dick Saslaw. Meanwhile, consumers like me and you are no closer to getting solar panels on our homes or small businesses. And while 5,000 MW of renewables is a clear step forward, it remains a modest goal compared to many other states...7; mandated goals. Our smaller Southern Republican neighbor, North Carolina, already has installed[23] more solar energy than that. To build on the analysis Ivy Main did[24] of the first draft of the bill, this equals less than 5% of Virginia...7;s total electricity supply ...1; while other states have set goals for renewables to account for much higher percentages of their power, up to 100%. Finally, on energy efficiency ...1; for which Dominion has been ranked second to last[25] in the whole country ...1; the legislation called for the utility to devote $870 million over the next decade to such programs. Sad to say, Dominion tried to reduce that commitment[26] too by counting revenues lost to efficiency as ...0;spending...1; ...1; until Governor Northam and others called the monopoly out on that cheap trick. Another sign of the shakiness of the law on which Saslaw hangs his big green hat. Bottom Line The best leaders don...7;t try to present themselves as all things to all people. They stand on their principles and explain their stances so that even those with whom they disagree can appreciate and respect where they...7;re coming from. But that...7;s not the case here. Sen. Saslaw is grossly misrepresenting his record on the environment in order to mislead his own Democratic base. Why is this okay with so many of his fellow Democratic elected officials, who continue to stand by and support him? I don...7;t know ...1; but I do know that I will continue to support his opponent, Yasmine Taeb[27] who takes no money from Dominion, supports a Green New Deal and Solar Freedom Act for Virginia, and is fully transparent about her positions, to replace him as the Democratic nominee for SD-35 on June 11th....; And I hope you do too.

Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter, tech is now accused of inflaming, radicalizing, dumbing down and squeezing the masses. Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it.</p><p>In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash - Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank - to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.</p><p>That is not the path the companies are taking.</p><p>\"The tech companies are not flinching,\" said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. \"Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They're going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.\"</p><p>There is so much of life that remains undisrupted. The companies are competing to own the cloud - to become, in essence, the internet's landlord.</p><p>When every home has an Amazon Echo, Google Home, an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker, the companies are already signaling, all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled. </p><p>For those who insist on venturing out, there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence, with consequences unclear even to them.</p><p>To accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. </p><p>This isn't a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.</p><p>Big Tech's push into New York City and the Washington area has been well-documented in recent months, with Google bulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both. </p><p>But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley, which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well-paid engineers can scarcely afford, there is a boom that, if anything, is accelerating.</p><p>Anyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown, a jumble of car washes and auto-body shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments. On a short street there is a house nearly a century old, a tiny thing with only one bath. Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for $4 million, according to county documents reviewed by the San Jose Mercury News.</p><p>Multiply that real estate transaction by dozens, big parcels and small, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date. Google is planning very long term here. The buses, light rail, Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth. The eventual result will be a new Google campus of 8 million square feet with offices for 20,000 workers, a figure that is more than the company's total employment in 2009.</p><p>But Diridon Station is just a part of Google's Silicon Valley expansion. A week before the company got the two houses, it bought a 100,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto, Calif., for $70 million.</p><p>Facebook keeps growing, too. In the spring, it leased 1 million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fast-growing community operations team. And it will soon move this year into 750,000 square feet in a San Francisco tower, making it the third-biggest tech tenant in the city, after Salesforce and Uber.</p><p>In total, Google's employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook's workforce rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.</p><p>Amazon's head count tripled over the last three years, thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods. It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than 500,000 people - and that is not counting its contractors.</p><p>The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.</p><p>\"For all intents and purposes, we're only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,\" said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. \"The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we, the consumers, are constantly voting for them.\"</p><p>\"Much as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,\" said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.</p><p>\"The government doesn't have a good clue,\" Bajarin said. \"They're not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.\"</p><p>Which leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-618684</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3W-GGR1-DY37-D3G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 3, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000DOUS</classCode><className>SMART SPEAKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEHO</classCode><className>TECHNICIANS &amp;

Now, some are revisiting their decision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON -- To combat the ills of the internet, federal lawmakers have increasingly focused on a decades-old law that shields tech companies like Facebook and YouTube from liability for content posted by their users. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Last year, lawmakers approved chipping away at the law, voting overwhelmingly to hold tech platforms accountable when people use their sites for sex-trafficking schemes. They have since floated other changes as well, like making Facebook or other platforms liable when opioids are sold on their sites. </p><p>  But now, as the real-world effects of the sex-trafficking change take hold, some experts and politicians say the results are not all positive. And even some lawmakers who have championed a crackdown on Big Tech are now calling to revisit the change. On Tuesday, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, two of the tech industry's loudest critics, joined 11 other lawmakers in backing a federal study of its effects.</p><p>  Law enforcement officials say that it is sometimes more difficult to track traffickers, because the law pushed them further underground. Advocates say that sex workers now face higher safety risks. The removal of sites advertising sex hinders their ability to vet their clients, the advocates say, and is pushing more of them onto the streets. </p><p>  The renewed focus on the 2018 measure illustrates the difficulty of regulating the internet, including changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the 1996 law that enshrined platforms' widespread immunity for what their users post. Even when lawmakers reach a consensus that a change is necessary -- as was the case with sex trafficking -- the ramifications can be wider than many expect. </p><p>  ''It's really a good test case as we're looking at other types of carve-outs to Section 230,'' said Jeff Kosseff, an expert on the Section 230 protections. Lawyers across the country have also fought to limit the protections, arguing they don't apply in cases where a digital product is defective. A set of anti-trafficking lawsuits in Texas threatens to chip away at the protections as well.</p><p>  When lawmakers approved the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act last year, it was hailed as a way to catch up to the reality that the bartering of children and adults had moved from the streets to the web. It came after alarming allegations emerged about how Backpage, a classifieds site, may have been playing a role in trafficking.</p><p>  Advocates for sex workers warned ahead of the vote in Washington about some of the potential downsides of the law. But they struggled to break through to lawmakers, who were hearing testimony from groups representing trafficking survivors. </p><p>  ''It misunderstands the way that trafficking works, if you think that making it less visible reduces the occurrence,'' said Kate D'Adamo, an advocate for sex workers' rights.</p><p>  Their concerns have found a broader audience in recent months, even bubbling up on the presidential campaign trail. During a CNN town hall with the Democratic candidates this fall, for example, a questioner asked Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who had voted for the bill,  what she would do to ''counteract the negative impact this law has had.''</p><p>  Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat of California who was one of the few votes against the bill last year, said he believed Congress should have heard more about those concerns. He helped write the new legislation to study the law after hearing more from sex worker advocates.</p><p>  ''They didn't hear the perspective of the impact it's having on sex workers,'' he said of his colleagues. ''This is a cautionary tale that we have to be very deliberate, thoughtful, inclusive in how we regulate the internet.''</p><p>  Mr. Khanna said that if a study of the law showed harm to sex workers, he hoped it would bolster the case for a repeal of the 2018 law. </p><p>  Many supporters of the 2018 law say it has had a positive effect on the internet, and has helped curb sex trafficking. They note that no site has cropped up to replace Backpage, which was taken down as part of a federal criminal case before the law passed. </p><p>  Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut who sponsored the 2018 law, said in a statement that the sex trafficking carve-out was written to ''change tech industry practices,'' and that it had succeeded. </p><p>  Any website that closed down because of the law, he said, ''did so because it was knowingly facilitating sex trafficking or it was misled by critics of the law.''</p><p>  But sex worker advocates point to changes on Craigslist, the classified site, and Reddit, the discussion board. Both sites removed swaths of content that referred to sex because the companies found it too difficult to tell whether people featured in the posts were being trafficked.

Congressional investigators believe he might have. Just one of several big developments on the Russia probe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVE BRIGGS, CNN ANCHOR: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>expected to withdraw from the Paris climate accord today.

We're live in Paris.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROMANS: And you're going to get another dose of covfefe. <person><nameText>Sean Spicer </nameText></person>says the president and a few key people know what he meant. But what does that mean?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BRIGGS: And can I get another cup of covfefe, please? I'm tired.</p><p>ROMANS: So, the president had this sort of cute tweet yesterday morning. He woke up, obviously --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- saw the tweet, blah, blah, blah, and I thought it was over, but it's not over.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>At 3:00 today, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>will announce whether we're staying in the climate agreement.</p><p>ROMANS: That's right.</p><p>BRIGGS: My question is, is it a bigger deal for United States leadership globally or for the environment and the impact?</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes. Perfect answer. We will get into that in just a moment.</p><p>But first, four new major developments on the Russia investigation this morning. New questions about whether Attorney General <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions </nameText></person>had another previously undisclosed meeting during the campaign with the Russian ambassador. The White House no longer taking questions about Russia, referring them instead to the president's lawyer.</p><p>ROMANS: Sources say former <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>Director <person><nameText>James Comey </nameText></person>plans to testify the president did, indeed, try to pressure him on the bureau's Russia probe and the House Intelligence Committee issuing its first subpoenas. The batch includes some signed by Chairman Devin Nunes, who promised to step aside from the Russia investigation.</p><p>BRIGGS: First on <person><nameText>Attorney General Sessions, </nameText></person>Capitol Hill and intelligence sources telling CNN investigators are focusing on a Trump campaign event. It came at Washington's Mayflower Hotel last April. Then-Senator Sessions and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak attended a small VIP reception. Among other things, the <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>wants to know if there was an additional private meeting between these two.</p><p>ROMANS: So, the sources say if there was such a meeting, it may have been just incidental. Sessions has previously failed to disclose meetings with Russian officials. He testified to Congress he had not had communications with the Russians, but in fact, he had met with Kislyak twice during the campaign. That was the gaffe that forced Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.</p><p>BRIGGS: Responding to the latest questions, the Department of Justice says Sessions did not have any private or side conversations with any Russian official at the Mayflower. The DOJ adds in part, the Department of Justice appointed special counsel to assume responsibility for this matter. We will allow him to do his job.</p><p>ROMANS: The Justice Department not alone in fending off inquiries about Russia. Press Secretary <person><nameText>Sean Spicer </nameText></person>saying at this audio-only press briefing that the White House will no longer take questions on the investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>SEAN SPICER, </nameText></person>WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Our job -- we are focused on the president's agenda and all -- going forward, all questions on these matters will be referred to outside counsel, Marc Kasowitz.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>[04:35:08] ROMANS: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>hired Kasowitz last week to head up a legal team aimed at guiding the president through all the investigations into Russian election meddling. The White House is also hoping that referring questions to outside counsel will allow West Wing staff to focus less on the Russia investigation.</p><p>BRIGGS: We have new info on the <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>director's appearance before the Senate Intel Committee, which may happen next week. Sources close to the issue say <person><nameText>James Comey </nameText></person>will testify publicly that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>did, indeed, pressure him to drop a key part of the <person><nameText>FBI's </nameText></person>Russia investigation.</p><p>CNN's Jessica Schneider has the latest from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Dave and Christine, <person><nameText>James Comey's </nameText></person>much-anticipated testimony could happen as soon as next week. That's according to sources. The details of this testimony, they're still being determined, but sources do say the fired <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>director will once again sit before the Senate Intelligence Committee and publicly recount his run-ins with the president.</p><p>As you'll remember, it was back on February 14th when Comey had that meeting with <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>and sources say the president urged Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Sources do say Comey documented the president's plea in this way, saying: I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.</p><p>The president once again invoked Comey's name in a tweet Wednesday morning, saying in part, quote: The false or misleading testimony of <person><nameText>James Comey, </nameText></person>John Brennan, witch hunt.</p><p>We know that <person><nameText>James Comey </nameText></person>has spoken with special counsel Robert Mueller to work out the parameters of his testimony to Congress, and we know that Comey will likely sit down with Mueller for a formal interview after that testimony -- Dave and Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right, Jessica, thank you.</p><p>On the other side of the Capitol, the embattled House Intelligence Committee issuing its first subpoena, as a source close to Michael Flynn says the former national security adviser will comply. <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, has said he would not cooperate with the panel voluntarily, but, Dave, will comply with a subpoena.</p><p>BRIGGS: A congressional source telling CNN that out of seven subpoenas in total, four related to the Russia probe. The other three, the so-called unmasking of American names from redacted foreign surveillance reports. Sources say those subpoenas came from Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, not from the committee's Russia investigation, and they were issued without the consent of Democrats on the panel.</p><p>ROMANS: The move raises questions about Nunes and his role in this Russia probe. He had said he was stepping aside temporarily from that investigation, but you know, he never officially recused himself. We also learned recently that Nunes was still reviewing intel on the Russia investigation.</p><p>BRIGGS: Later today, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is expected to announce the United States is pulling out of the Paris climate accord. White House officials caution, nothing is final until the president speaks this afternoon. It is not clear how a potential withdrawal would work, but pulling out of the climate agreement would be a major blow to the legacy of President Obama and a significant break from international partners in the fight against global warming.</p><p>So, how is this playing out with America's allies?</p><p>Let's go live to Paris and bring in CNN's Melissa Bell.</p><p>Good morning to you, Melissa. How are our allies in Europe taking this news?</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: With a great deal of concern, Dave, as you'd imagine. Much will depend on the detail of what is announced later today. Even assuming that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>does go ahead with this idea of withdrawing, how he chooses to do that will have far-reaching consequences not only for the deal itself but also for the nature, as you alluded to a second ago, between the United States and its allies going forward.</p><p>There are a number of options available to the American president. He can simply withdraw from the climate change deal, but that would take some time, probably wouldn't come into effect until 20. He could withdraw perhaps more radically from the entire framework, the framework that has provided the ability for the world to search for this climate change deal, which goes back to 1992 in Rio. That could be much more immediate, but also much more radical.</p><p>A final option would simply be to decide to stay inside the deal but review the commitments that were made. And, of course, there are those here in Europe, there are those who believe in the Paris climate deal who believe that, in a sense, for the deal itself, that could be the worst option, because it would show, Dave, its inherent weakness. Remember that this was a climate change deal that was struck on the basis not of binding commitments but of individually chosen targets.</p><p>If <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>later today decides to lower those targets that had been set by Barack Obama, in a sense, that will remind the world of how weak this deal was. It also has the advantage from the American point of view of leaving them with a seat at the negotiating table going ahead.</p><p>[04:40:00] The question is really whether the American administration today is sufficiently ideologically driven to withdraw entirely from the deal, or rather, to choose that lesser option. And much, as I say, will depend on which of those <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>chooses to head towards later today.</p><p>BRIGGS: And pulling out leaves the United States with Nicaragua and Syria as those not committing.</p><p>Melissa Bell live in Paris, thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: And, Dave, pulling out would mean he's not taking the advice of his daughter, Ivanka Trump, not taking the advice of Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, who used to run an energy company, not taking the advice, we presume, of Gary Cohn, his chief economic guy. BRIGGS: That's right.</p><p>ROMANS: And all the CEOs who have been coming there talking to him publicly and privately.</p><p>You know, when it comes to that climate deal, big business has one big question now for this president -- will America be a global leader or put itself first? Hundreds of companies say business will suffer if the U.S. withdraws.</p><p>Business leaders have lobbied the president with public campaigns. You've seen the newspaper ads. They've lobbied him with private phone calls and letters, including the Tesla founder, Elon Musk. Musk tweeted that he had done all he could to persuade <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to remain in this treaty, even threatening to quit as one of the president's advisers. You see Elon Musk there, second to the left.</p><p>Companies like the deal because they like predictability. This provides a framework. They can minimize the business risk of climate change while using clean technology to boost competitiveness and boost jobs. But jobs are said to alter the president's threat to withdraw, particularly coal jobs.</p><p>The White House promises lifting environmental rules will revive that industry, but market forces, not regulation, are killing coal. Natural gas is cheaper than coal, and despite the administration's claims, there hasn't been a boom in coal jobs. Only 1,300 have been added since the president took office.</p><p>BRIGGS: And not to glaze over what you said before, but can we dismiss with the notion that Ivanka Trump is the one that's going to moderate <person><nameText>President Trump? </nameText></person>Because look at the things that have come before him -- health care, no moderation. This now, no moderation. Where is she moderating her father?</p><p>ROMANS: That's a good point and I think, you know, maybe we'll know this afternoon if he pulls out completely or if he steps back at the United States' own targets. You know, this is a campaign promise and he wants to tick through the campaign promises.</p><p>BRIGGS: Sure.</p><p>ROMANS: And this would be a campaign promise met.</p><p>BRIGGS: Gets back to making America great again.</p><p>It's the tweet, though, that just won't quit. Just when the world was moving on from covfefe, White House spokesman <person><nameText>Sean Spicer </nameText></person>decided to raise 1,000 more questions. Spicer could have passed off this now- infamous post as a harmless typo. It happens to all of us. But that wouldn't have been nearly as dramatic as this.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER: Do you think people should be concerned that the president then posted somewhat of an incoherent tweet last night and that it then stayed up for hours?</p><p>SPICER: Uh, no.</p><p>REPORTER: Why did it stay up so long? Is no one watching this?</p><p>SPICER: No, I think the president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant. Blake?</p><p>REPORTER: Sean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REPORTER: What is covfefe?</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: I still don't know what he meant.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS: This is after the president -- I thought the president put this to bed himself. He seemed to laugh off the issue earlier in the day. He tweeted this \"Who can figure out the true meaning of covfefe? Enjoy!\" That's when we know the president was awake.</p><p>We figured he went to bed at 11:00, woke up at 5:00, left this dangling clause and then fixed it up with a little funny thing, but this triggered a nasty exchange between Hillary Clinton and the Trumps. Listen to this comment Secretary Clinton made at an event in California last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think we can get into covfefe right now, because it's a longer thing, but --</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I thought it was a hidden message to the Russians.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, you did?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: That's not all Hillary had to say.</p><p>She went on, taking on the \"The New York Times,\" the Democratic Party, the former <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>director, <person><nameText>James Comey, </nameText></person>for her loss in November.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>responding with this: \"Crooked Hillary now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate, hits Facebook and even Dems and the DNC.\"</p><p>ROMANS: It doesn't end there, folks. Clinton firing back, tweeting \"People in covfefe houses shouldn't throw covfefe.\" That's when <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>Jr. came to his father's defense, tweeting, \"What house is he in again?\"</p><p>BRIGGS: Solid, that's well played.</p><p>ROMANS: That's what I thought. You're trying too hard.</p><p>I thought covfefe would be dead by 9:00 yesterday morning --</p><p>BRIGGS: I hoped it would.</p><p>ROMANS: The covfefe gift that keeps on covfefing.</p><p>BRIGGS: It was a typo, correct? He fell asleep while tweeting.</p><p>ROMANS: A small group of people in the White House know.</p><p>BRIGGS: No, they don't.</p><p>All right.

Los Angeles Police investigating this incident as a possible hate crime.</p><p>Listen to LeBron delivering his assessment of American society on the eve of his seventh straight appearance in the NBA Finals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES: Hate, you know, in America, especially for an African- American, is living every day. And even though that it's concealed most of the time, even though people hide their faces and will say things about you and when they see you, they smile in your face, it's alive every single day.</p><p>And I think back to Emmett Till's mom, actually, it's kind of one of the first things I thought of, and the reason why she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and, you know, being black in America. [04:50:17] So, it's like, it doesn't -- no matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, you know, being black in America is -- it's tough.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Now, you heard James refer to Emmett Till's mother in those comments. Till was a black teenager lynched in Mississippi in 1955 at the age of 14. James and his Cleveland Cavaliers square off tonight against the Golden State Warriors in game one of the NBA Finals.</p><p>LeBron was eloquent. Mr. Met, not so much.</p><p>The New York Mets issuing a public apology to their fans, and it's not because of their mediocre play. It seems Mr. Met, the team's beloved mascot, was caught flipping the bird at Met fans. We should be clear -- Mr. Met doesn't technically have a middle finger --</p><p>ROMANS: He has four fingers.</p><p>BRIGGS: He only has four, right, Christine. But his intent was certainly clear. We're told several team employees take turns in the Mr. Met costume. The Met's front office says this staffer will no longer be working as the team mascot again.</p><p>But in 2012, Mr. Met was named the number one mascot in all of sports. He was just giving the number one sign, I believe.</p><p>ROMANS: The number one sign.</p><p>BRIGGS: Number one. Number one mascot in sports.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. I don't know how you can flip the middle finger if you only have four fingers. I don't know.</p><p>BRIGGS: Legally, I think that argument holds up in court.</p><p>ROMANS: You know, I don't think that matters.</p><p>BRIGGS: There is no middle in four.</p><p>ROMANS: I think poor Joe is not going to be in that suit again.</p><p>EpiPen maker Mylan became the face of corporate greed when it jacked up prices on these life-saving drugs.

And Angela Merkel saying they are happy about that, of course, and that the leadership between the E.U. and China on climate issues is the direction here of the future. As you know, this afternoon at 3:00 p.m., we are awaiting the president of the United States to announce whether the United States will stay in this very important climate agreement. There are some indications that he will not. He will fulfill a campaign pledge to pull out.</p><p>Again, this shows you China stepping into the fray, into the breach, right, and saying we will continue to be a leader on climate change.</p><p>BRIGGS: Well, and just the optics here that China, the world's worst polluter, is now the leader in environmental causes, that is a head- scratching development. But we shall stay on it.</p><p>Meanwhile, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>expected to renew a six-month waiver to keep the U.S. embassy in Israel in Tel Aviv. That's despite a campaign pledge to move it to Jerusalem. Senior officials say the president still supports the move but believes the timing isn't right.</p><p>For more, CNN's Oren Liebermann live in Jerusalem with the latest.</p><p>Good morning to you, Oren.</p><p>Was the realities of this situation, did <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>learn more about them on that recent foreign trip?</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it certainly seems it solidified his opinion. Remember, this was obviously one of his biggest campaign promises but also one of the first campaign promises he walked back right after his inauguration, and that's because some of the Arab leaders, specifically King Abdullah, who was the first Arab leader to meet with Trump, as well as King Salman, who he met with when Trump was here in the region just a couple of weeks ago, they both pointed out to him how sensitive the embassy move is.</p><p>If you were to move it from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and effectively recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. They pressured him on that, and it seems he realized the delicacy of this or how delicate this subject is, and that's because it would prejudge essentially the most sensitive area in the conflict, and that is the status of Jerusalem, which decades of U.S. foreign policy has said this will only be decided in final negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>As Trump tries to pursue a renewal of a peace process, it seems he's heeding caution to that. He will wait to see if a peace process can be restarted and where it goes. He certainly has more opportunities to move the embassy, if he wants. That opportunity comes up every six months.</p><p>The Israeli right, the Israeli leadership, that is, made one final push with Trump here to try to get him to move the embassy just a couple weeks ago. That, it seems, didn't work out. Trump in all of his statements here never talked about the embassy, never talked about recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, that as he tries to restart the peace process here. While the Israeli right won't openly criticize Trump for fear of any sort of retaliation or what may come of that, he does risk angering evangelical Christian voters, where one of his biggest voter bases who very much wanted him to follow through on this promise. So, we'll see how they react to this as well as what reaction comes out of the Israelis -- Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right. Oren Liebermann live for us in Jerusalem -- thank you, sir.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Let's get a check on \"CNN Money Stream\" this morning.</p><p>Global markets, U.S. futures mostly higher, Wall Street closed lower, weighed down by bank and energy stocks. Energy fell as oil prices dropped 2.7 percent. Still, all three indices finished the month with gains. That's right, the end of the month, the NASDAQ up 2.5 percent, the second straight month of gains.</p><p>2017 has been the year of big tech -- Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft are all trading at highs. Shares for Netflix and Facebook both up more than 30 percent this year.</p><p>Uber's finance chief quits as the company reports big losses. Uber reports -- that's the wrong video.

Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter, tech is now accused of inflaming, radicalizing, dumbing down and squeezing the masses. Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash -- Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank -- to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  That is not the path the companies are taking.</p><p>  ''The tech companies are not flinching,'' said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. ''Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They're going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.''</p><p>  There is so much of life that remains undisrupted. The companies are competing to own the cloud -- to become, in essence, the internet's landlord. They have designs on cities: Googlemade a deal in 2017 to reimagine a chunk of waterfront Toronto from the ground up. Amazon is reworking the definition of community from the inside, as warehouses in rural areas provide the urban middle class with everything they want to stay home all weekend.</p><p>  These changes are only beginning to redefine society. When every home has an Amazon Echo, GoogleHome, an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker, the companies are already signaling, all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled. For those who insist on venturing out, there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence, with consequences unclear even to them.</p><p>  To accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. This isn't a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.</p><p>  Big Tech's push into New York City and the Washington area has been well documented in recent months, with Googlebulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both. But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley, which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well-paid engineers can scarcely afford, there is a boom that, if anything, is accelerating.</p><p>  Anyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown, a jumble of carwashes and auto-body shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments. On a short street there is a house nearly a century old, a tiny thing with only one bath. Googlebought it and another house last month in a package deal for $4 million, according to county documents reviewed by The Mercury News.</p><p>  Multiply that real estate transaction by dozens, big parcels and small, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date. Googleis planning very long term here. The buses, light rail, Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth. The eventual result will be a new Googlecampus of eight million square feet with offices for 20,000 workers, a figure that is more than the company's total employment in 2009.</p><p>  But Diridon Station is just a part of Google's Silicon Valley expansion. A week before the company got the two houses, it bought a 100,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto, Calif., for $70 million.</p><p>Facebook keeps growing, too. In the spring, it leased one million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fast-growing community operations team, which deals with safety and security issues confronting Facebook users. And it will soon move this year into 750,000 square feet in a San Francisco tower, making it the third-biggest tech tenant in the city, after Salesforce and Uber.</p><p>  In total, Google's employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook's work force rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.</p><p>Amazon's head count tripled over the last three years, thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods. It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than 500,000 people -- and that is not counting its contractors.</p><p>  The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.</p><p>  ''For all intents and purposes, we're only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,'' said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. ''The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them.''</p><p>  That's evident in how robust Big Tech's businesses remain. Last March, the research firm eMarketer said Facebook, including its less controversial photo-sharing site, Instagram, would earn $21 billion this year from digital ads in the United States. In September, it raised that forecast to $22.87 billion.</p><p>EMarketer also revised up its forecasts of Google's digital ad revenues in the United States for 2018, 2019 and 2020. The third big digital advertising recipient is Amazon, which is far behind the leaders but gaining ground fast.</p><p>  The contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious. One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases, which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us. In a Pew Research Center survey in June, 42 percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site. But even as we say we trust tech less, we invite it deeper into our lives.</p><p>Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google's parent company, together generated $166.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone -- up 24 percent from a year earlier, when the four companies hauled in $134.4 billion.</p><p>  ''Much as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,'' said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>  Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.</p><p>  ''The government doesn't have a good clue,'' said Mr. Bajarin, the consultant. ''They're not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.''</p><p>  Which leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.</p><p>  ''For Facebook to have a better year in 2019, it needs to be more upfront and transparent,'' said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer. This was also the advice Facebook got for 2018, to little avail.</p><p>  All this could change if the anti-tech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch. On the other hand, the last recession tended to work in Big Tech's favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry about.</p><p>  During the 2008 financial crisis, Amazon's North American media sales increased 20 percent. Borders, one of its biggest book-selling competitors, saw revenue drop 9 percent, reported a record loss and was soon defunct.</p><p>  With so little to really worry about, Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any present-day turmoil. Google, which has 3,500 job openings, says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do. But Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, has a good idea: everything.</p><p>  ''They're in the transportation business, the medical business, every business,'' said Mr. Taplin, a frequent critic of how Big Tech took over a decentralized, independent internet. ''There is no aspect of your life that they will not be involved in.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: An empty lot in San Jose, Calif., that Googleis considering buying as it plans a vast new campus in the city.

The social media giant said this month it would prioritise posts that engage interactions among friends over content from businesses, including traditional media companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move comes amid mounting criticism that Facebook has enjoyed the rich perks of a media company, without having to measure up to the responsibilities in distributing information - or fake news - and the psychological impact it has on users.</p><p>But is Facebook really warming to human relations at the risk of profit'</p><p>The opposite seems likelier. Facebook may be wising up to business realities that would hurt profit further if it did not try to put people in greater control of their online revelations.</p><p>And rather than bringing \"friends\" closer, that algorithmic change may generate new social risks of louder echo chambers, and deeper social anxiety.</p><p>That Facebook is a domain that is easily dominated by interested parties has become perilously clear in the last few years. While earning advertising dollars from its control of two billion monthly users, Facebook also became a useful platform for Russians to influence the 2016 US elections. They used virulent content to drive a larger wedge in the ideological divide. The severity prompted a warning from no less than former US president Barack Obama.</p><p>What's more, the US now has a \"stable genius\" for president who is also unrelenting on another social media platform, and ironically made the term \"fake news\" a catchphrase for the ages.</p><p>One running prediction is that 2018 may be the year for greater Big Tech regulation, as authorities turn wary of how tech giants can engender strife, while taking an agnostic position on spreading misinformation. That agnostic view makes sense once their business model is taken into account: they make money from distributing as much as possible content they do not own, powered by users' data taken in exchange for a service that is in many cases, \"free\".</p><p>Facebook has said it expects users to spend less time on the platform - is it really just distancing itself from its responsibility (which is still fuzzy anyway)? Claiming that it has less influence reads like a form of self-regulation that keeps regulators off its backs. Its decision may also not help the larger challenge of promoting dialogue across ideological divides.</p><p>Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund, suggested that the proportion of the vote captured by populist candidates had risen from about 7 per cent in 2010 to 35 per cent in 2017, a Financial Times report said this month.</p><p>This is a first since the 1930s, then possibly reflecting tensions just before World War II.</p><p>The problem with Russian or online propaganda in general is not fake news in itself. The ones that cause more trouble are one-sided articles and videos, which are lapped up by online users already predisposed to clicking on those headlines. Facebook's distribution model sets off reverberations in echo chambers.</p><p>Granted, Facebook did not create such divides in the United States. But what it will have a hand in, is entrenching such views; among like-minded friends, highly commented posts would now take centre stage.</p><p>Facebook also expects greater interaction among friends to be more valuable. It has acknowledged research suggesting that the rabid scrolling affects mental health.</p><p>The status anxiety that comes with constant comparison through social media seems obvious. Does interaction improve this? Facebook certainly thinks so. It has also put in place a compassion team that debates, among other things, the merits of a \"dislike\" button.</p><p>But Facebook's fondness for tinkering with emotional appeal could lull users into false fulfilment. It brings to mind as well an episode from sci-fi TV series Black Mirror, where an office worker tries desperately to raise her star ratings that would take her to the upper echelons of society. The character turns into a Pollyanna in seeking validation from highly ranked users, but discriminates those of the one-star variety.</p><p>The show, in its extreme way, critiqued the like-for-likes manufacturing - our modern-day cottage industry - that has seeped into other social media such as Facebook's Instagram.</p><p>It also shares eerie similarities to the rating system now explored in China.</p><p>Author Alain de Botton wrote that envy does not fester from comparisons with inaccessible elites, say the Queen, but from peers. Just as well that de Botton's book on the topic of status anxiety was published in 2004, the year Facebook was born.</p><p>Facebook users struggling to cope should regard Facebook as a frenemy that sidles up when it suits its interests.</p><p>There is that option to disconnect, and news agencies are weighing out how a time-out is worthwhile.</p><p>Though, if columns suggesting we stop using Facebook were written but nobody saw them, did journalism make a sound'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook has said it expects users to spend less time on the platform - is it really just distancing itself from its responsibility (which is still fuzzy anyway)?</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-188849</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RFK-XYK1-DYX4-044F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 20, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Die beiden Orte rahmen die Grenze zwischen Hongkong und China, wo der neue Kalte Krieg seit einigen Tagen seine hei\u00dfe Front zu haben hat. Die Stra\u00dfe zwischen ihnen f\u00fchrt durch einige Hongkonger Felder, ein paar Flecken ehemaligen Sumpflandes und viele zu einem gro\u00dfen Siedlungsklumpen verwachsene D\u00f6rfer. Man muss auf dem Weg elf Mal abbiegen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Das alles kann man mit wenigen Klicks auf Googles Kartendienst Maps herausfinden. N\u00f6rdlich der Trennlinie geht das nur mit Einschr\u00e4nkungen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dort liegt das chinesische Shenzhen. Google gibt es in der Metropole mit rund 13 Millionen Einwohnern nur \u00fcber Umwege, einen sogenannten VPN-Zugang - der gelegentlich bei wichtigen politischen Ereignissen auch beschr\u00e4nkt wird. Ebenso verh\u00e4lt es sich mitFacebook, Twitter oder dem Messengerdienst Telegram. Das Internet in Shenzhen ist ein anderes als im Rest der Welt. Deshalb gilt die Stadt ihren s\u00fcdlichen Nachbarn in Hongkong als eine Art Mahnmal, als Symbol f\u00fcr das, was ihnen schlimmstenfalls drohen k\u00f6nnte. Denn Shenzhen liegt hinter der Great Firewall of China, dem gr\u00f6\u00dften Zensurapparat der Welt.</p><p>In der Nacht zum 1. Juli wurde diese Drohung real. P\u00fcnktlich um Mitternacht ist sie in Kraft getreten, Hongkong droht hinter die digitale Trennlinie von Chinas gro\u00dfer Firewall zu rutschen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt trat das neue \"Gesetz zum Schutz der nationalen Sicherheit\" der chinesischen Regierung in Kraft, das f\u00fcr die sieben Millionen Einwohner der Stadt drastische Ver\u00e4nderungen bedeutet. Das m\u00f6gliche Ende der Losung von einem Land mit zwei Systemen. Das m\u00f6gliche Ende von autonomen Gesetzen und einer von China unabh\u00e4ngigen Rechtsprechung. Das m\u00f6gliche Ende von Meinungsfreiheit.</p><p>Besonders einschneidend ist das neue Sicherheitsgesetz f\u00fcr die digitale Welt. Pl\u00f6tzlich sind auch in Hongkong Ma\u00dfnahmen m\u00f6glich, die man sonst nur vom chinesischen Festland kennt: die Zensur und L\u00f6schung von unerw\u00fcnschten Inhalten ohne Beschluss eines lokalen Gerichts, das weitreichende Tracking - das Nachverfolgen - von B\u00fcrgern, ihren zur\u00fcckgelegten Wegen, ihren Webseitenbesuchen, ihren Meinungs\u00e4u\u00dferungen in sozialen Netzwerken. Oder die Beschlagnahmung von gespeicherten Daten.</p><p>Das ist ein Schlag f\u00fcr Menschen in Hongkong, allen voran f\u00fcr die pro-demokratische Protestbewegung. Aber auch \u00fcber die Tore der Stadt hinaus besteht Grund zur Sorge. Anhand der Grenze zwischen freiem und unfreiem Internet droht gerade ein Konflikt zwischen den USA und China au\u00dfer Kontrolle zu geraten, bei dem es um mehr geht als um das Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis zweier Gro\u00dfm\u00e4chte. N\u00e4mlich um technologische Vorherrschaft. Und um einen gef\u00e4hrlichen Pr\u00e4zedenzfall, in dem China einstige Verabredungen bricht, seine Marktmacht nutzt, um Gegenrede zu unterdr\u00fccken und Firmen aus Kalifornien pl\u00f6tzlich Weltpolitik machen. Weil sie westlichen Interessen verpflichtet sind, aber nicht auf 1,4 Milliarden potenzielle Kunden verzichten k\u00f6nnen. Es geht um die Zukunft des Internets nahezu weltweit.</p><p>Hongkong galt lange Jahre als Bastion des freien Internets auf chinesischem Boden. Das hat Tradition, die Stadt am S\u00fcdchinesischen Meer ist neben dem kleinen, benachbarten Macau der einzige freie Markt im Reich der Mitte. Sie ist wirtschaftlicher Knotenpunkt f\u00fcr die gesamte Region und finanzieller Umschlagplatz f\u00fcr China. Und damit h\u00f6chst interessant f\u00fcr internationale Unternehmen.</p><p>Massenweise haben sich westliche Finanzfirmen auf dem kleinen St\u00fcck Land angesiedelt, sp\u00e4ter kamen fast alle US-amerikanischen Tech-Riesen dazu. Sie waren der Politik zun\u00e4chst willkommen, sie brachten massig Kapital und Prestige mit. Und auch f\u00fcr Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Google und Konsorten war Hongkong ein gutes Gesch\u00e4ft. Zwar sind deren Dienste auf dem chinesischen Festland schwer erreichbar, dennoch setzen diese Unternehmen dort Milliarden um. In Googles Fall etwa durch die Vermarktung von Werbefl\u00e4chen, Software und Hardware wie beispielsweise der Virtual-Reality-Brille \"Oculus\".</p><p>Nicht zuletzt ist Hongkong selbst ein guter Absatzmarkt f\u00fcr Big Tech. Knapp 80 Prozent der Einwohner hatten zuletzt ein Facebook-Konto.</p><p>Doch die gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils friedliche Koexistenz von US-Kapitalismus und Kapitalismus mit kommunistischer Unterf\u00fctterung wurde nun buchst\u00e4blich \u00fcber Nacht zerst\u00f6rt. Denn das neue Sicherheitsgesetz bedeutet nicht nur f\u00fcr Hongkonger eine ver\u00e4nderte Realit\u00e4t, sondern auch f\u00fcr jene, die dort Gesch\u00e4fte machen. Laut dem 59 Seiten umfassenden Dokument k\u00f6nnen in der Stadt ans\u00e4ssige Firmen nun dazu gezwungen werden, \"Identifikationsnachweise oder Hilfe bei der Entschl\u00fcsselung zur Verf\u00fcgung\" zu stellen.</p><p>Die Firmen sollen sensible Daten ihrer Nutzer an die Beh\u00f6rden \u00fcbergeben, um bei der Aufkl\u00e4rung von Aktivit\u00e4ten zu helfen, die vage als subversiv, separatistisch oder ausl\u00e4ndische Einmischung gelten k\u00f6nnten. Damit wird wahr, wovor Experten seit Jahren warnen: Das Freiheitsversprechen Internet entfaltet sein Potenzial als Unterdr\u00fcckungsinstrument. Ein Like an der falschen Stelle kann zur Verhaftung f\u00fchren, die Bereitschaft vieler, ihr Leben mit anderen zu teilen, wird gegen sie verwendet. Doch nicht nur die Nutzer, auch die Plattformen geraten mit dem Sicherheitsgesetz in Konflikt: Sollten sie dem Gesuch nicht nachkommen, m\u00fcssen die Konzerne mit Strafen rechnen - auch ausl\u00e4ndische. Dazu z\u00e4hlen Geldbu\u00dfen von bis zu 100 000 Hongkong-Dollar - rund 11 400 Euro - oder Gef\u00e4ngnisstrafen f\u00fcr Mitarbeiter.</p><p>Es steht also viel auf dem Spiel f\u00fcr die Tech-Giganten. Einerseits k\u00f6nnen sie und ihre Mitarbeiter daf\u00fcr belangt werden, wenn eine Person auf ihren Netzwerken k\u00fcnftig preisgibt, die chinesische Regierung zu hassen. Ganz egal, ob diese Person in Hongkong sitzt oder in den USA. Andererseits w\u00fcrde es zu einem immensen Vertrauensverlust f\u00fchren, w\u00fcrden die Konzerne sich den chinesischen Restriktionen einfach beugen. In Zeiten, in denen Firmen wie Facebook ohnehin mit harscher Kritik ihres Umgangs mit Hate Speech und ihrer Interpretation von politischer Neutralit\u00e4t zu k\u00e4mpfen haben, w\u00e4re das keine gute Idee.</p><p>Wie ernst Big Tech die Lage nimmt, zeigten die Reaktionen aus dem Silicon Valley. Erstaunlich unisono brandmarkten sie das Sicherheitsgesetz und k\u00fcndigten mehr oder weniger dieselben Vorgehensweisen an: Man wolle die Weitergabe von Daten bis auf Weiteres aussetzen und sich zudem mit Menschenrechtsorganisationen zum Thema beraten, hie\u00df es in Statements von Facebook, Google, Twitter und anderen.</p><p>Die Video-App TikTok, die zum chinesischen Internetriesen Byte-Dance geh\u00f6rt, aber auf dem chinesischen Festland nicht erreichbar ist, ging noch weiter und k\u00fcndigte an, nicht mehr in Hongkong operieren zu wollen. Ein Affront f\u00fcr Peking.</p><p>Ein Sieg f\u00fcr die Freiheit und Menschlichkeit also? Wohl kaum. Die Reaktion der Konzerne auf eine neue Sensibilit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Menschenrechte zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren, w\u00e4re falsch. Vielmehr finden sich die Tech-Firmen unfreiwillig an vorderster Front des Kalten Krieges zwischen China und den USA, der seit einigen Jahren schwelt. Und damit zwischen zwei dr\u00fcckenden Sachzw\u00e4ngen.</p><p>Die meisten der gr\u00f6\u00dften Tech-Unternehmen haben ihre Zentralen im kalifornischen Silicon Valley. Und sind damit automatisch der Gesetzestreue und einer gewissen Loyalit\u00e4t gegen\u00fcber der US-Regierung verpflichtet, sofern sie keine strengere Regulation riskieren wollen. Washington hingegen befindet sich seit dem Amtsantritt von Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump zumindest \u00f6ffentlich auf einem Kurs der maximalen Konfrontation gegen\u00fcber Peking. Die seit 2018 verh\u00e4ngten Strafz\u00f6lle und der Streit um die chinesischen Firmen Huawei und ZTE sind dabei nur der Gipfel.</p><p>Doch die Auseinandersetzung zwischen den USA und China nimmt gerade erst Fahrt auf. Ende Mai warf Washington der Kommunistischen Partei Chinas vor, dass sie mit ihrer Politik nicht nur US-Interessen gef\u00e4hrde, sondern \"die Freiheit und W\u00fcrde von Staaten und Individuen auf der ganzen Welt\" angreife.</p><p>So beschreibt man Erzfeinde. In dieser Stimmung w\u00e4re ein kooperatives Verhalten gegen\u00fcber China f\u00fcr die Tech-Unternehmen gleichbedeutend mit einer Menge \u00c4rger zu Hause.</p><p>Auf der anderen Seite steht mit China ein Staat, der unter seinem Pr\u00e4sidenten Xi Jinping eine aggressive und ultra-nationalistische Politik betreibt. Diese dient dazu, im Inland jeden Anflug von Dissens zu unterdr\u00fccken und die Macht des Landes im Ausland zu erweitern, unter anderem mit einer maximal parteiischen Industriepolitik.</p><p>Heimische Unternehmen werden in China bevorzugt und im Rest der Welt subventioniert. Ausl\u00e4ndische Firmen hingegen m\u00fcssen sich in China strengen Kontrollen unterziehen und haben bei Verst\u00f6\u00dfen mit Sanktionen zu rechnen. Es ist gut m\u00f6glich also, dass China den Tech-Riesen und ihren Diensten den Zugang zum Hongkonger Markt verwehrt, sollten sich diese langfristig gegen die neuen Gesetze stemmen.</p><p>Das w\u00e4re eine Katastrophe, auch mit Blick auf die Gesch\u00e4fte auf dem Festland. Googles Einnahmen in China sind beispielsweise allein im Jahr 2018 um 60 Prozent auf drei Milliarden US-Dollar gewachsen. Die Tech-Riesen sehen sich also einer unl\u00f6sbaren Aufgabe gegen\u00fcber, bei der es auch nicht hilft, die betreffenden Datens\u00e4tze aus Hongkong in ein anderes Land zu verlegen.</p><p>Dass sich der Konflikt zwischen Washington und Peking anhand von Technologie-Unternehmen erhitzt, ist kein Zufall. Beide Staaten haben l\u00e4ngst erkannt, dass sich in der Branche die geopolitischen Kr\u00e4fteverh\u00e4ltnisse der Zukunft entscheiden. Die USA f\u00fchlen sich dabei von China bedroht, das dank einer geschickten Subventionspolitik mit Innovationen und deren rascher Umsetzung gl\u00e4nzt. Automatische Gesichtserkennung ist f\u00fcr Chinesen Alltag, mit WeChat - urspr\u00fcnglich als reine Gespr\u00e4chsplattform f\u00fcr Smartphones betrieben, die Daten an chinesische Beh\u00f6rden weitergibt - wird kommuniziert, bezahlt und die pers\u00f6nliche Gesundheit dokumentiert.</p><p>Dass das so ist, liegt an einem systemischen Vorteil. Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsrechte und andere juristische H\u00fcrden gibt es faktisch nicht. In einem solchen Umfeld lassen sich neue und umstrittene Technologien wie k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz schneller und effektiver in den Alltag der Menschen einf\u00fchren.</p><p>Doch Washington geht es weder um die Verhinderung eines weltumspannenden \u00dcberwachungssystems noch allein um Geopolitik. Sondern auch um einen seiner potentesten Wirtschaftszweige, den es zu sch\u00fctzen gilt. Allein die Firma Apple ist mehr wert als alle DAX-Unternehmen zusammen. Die Tech-Branche erwirtschaftet mittlerweile 32 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsprodukts der USA, rund 1,7 Billionen US-Dollar.</p><p>In China sieht die Sache \u00e4hnlich aus, dort warf der Sektor 2018 rund 3,9 Billionen US-Dollar ab. Also ebenfalls knapp 30 Prozent des BIP.</p><p>Menschen in Hongkong d\u00fcrfte das aktuell egal sein. Noch ist nicht klar, wie nachdr\u00fccklich die Beh\u00f6rden die neuen Befugnisse durchsetzen werden. Facebook, Twitter und WhatsApp funktionieren f\u00fcr den Moment noch, GoogleMaps gibt noch verl\u00e4sslich Auskunft. Dennoch sind die ersten Auswirkungen zu sp\u00fcren. In der Stadt wurden seit Jahren politische Debatten gef\u00fchrt, im Zuge der Protestbewegung mit zunehmender Vehemenz auch online. Nun versuchen die daran Beteiligten ihre Spuren zu verwischen, weil sie sich um ihre Sicherheit sorgen. Likes auf pro-demokratischen Facebook-Seiten werden entfernt, Gruppen- und Twitter-Accounts geschlossen. Ein Service, der auf GoogleMaps Gesch\u00e4fte nach ihrer politischen Einstellung kennzeichnete, wurde eingestellt.</p><p>Es gibt auch Hoffnung. Er sei sich sicher, dass die Menschen in Hongkong neue Wege finden w\u00fcrden, um frei miteinander zu sprechen, sagte der Hongkonger Internetaktivist Edmond Chung der \"New York Times\". Davon h\u00e4nge ab, ob die Verh\u00e4ltnisse wirklich so w\u00fcrden wie auf dem chinesischen Festland.</p><p>Tats\u00e4chlich h\u00e4ngt noch mehr davon ab. Ob die Trennlinie zwischen Sumpf, Feldern und Siedlungsklumpen in absehbarer Zeit dramatisch l\u00e4nger wird beispielsweise. Denn Chinas Einflussgebiet w\u00e4chst. Im Kalten Krieg an der Grenze Hongkongs geht es l\u00e4ngst um zwei grunds\u00e4tzlich verschiedene Formen des Internets. Das freie, das seine Fehler hat, aber gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils demokratischen Prozessen verpflichtet ist. Und das unfreie, das vielleicht besser, schneller und effektiver funktionieren mag. In dem Grundrechte aber ein Fremdwort sind.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>R</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TAGSPL-2020072112819244</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TAGSPL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D7-0DB1-JCR4-R0PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">330091</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2034\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Verlag Der Tagesspiegel GmbH Alle Rechte Vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>Der Tagesspiegel</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"39957\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>Ausg.

Das Banking tritt dabei - zumindest symbolisch - in den Hintergrund.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Von Tobias Fischer, Frankfurt</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung, 10.8.2019</p><p>Eine Bank, die sich als ein weltweiter Vorreiter in der digitalen Transformation des Finanzwesens gibt, als Partner f\u00fcr alle Lebenslagen verkauft und das Bankgesch\u00e4ft fast beil\u00e4ufig anbietet: Wie weit sich die singapurische DBS symbolisch von ihrem Kerngesch\u00e4ft distanziert, zeigt der Slogan, mit dem sie um Kundschaft wirbt: \"Live more, Bank less.\" Banking solle die Menschen in ihrem Leben begleiten und sie nicht davon ablenken. Weniger Bank, um mehr Leben genie\u00dfen zu k\u00f6nnen, erkl\u00e4rt sie pathetisch auf ihrer Homepage.</p><p>Teil der \"Gandalf\"-Techfirmen</p><p>Was klingt wie hippe Auslassungen der Gr\u00fcnder eines Fintechs oder Big Techs, entstammt angeblich den 2014 geborenen Ideen des Chief Information Officer einer damals 45 Jahre alten Bank. Der habe zu jener Zeit eine Reihe von Technologieunternehmen abgeklappert, berichtete einmal Vorstandschef Piyush Gupta. Auf seiner Inspirationsreise soll in CIO Dave Gledhill der Wunsch gereift sein, zu den Tech-Unternehmen Google, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Linkedin und Facebook aufzuschlie\u00dfen. DBS k\u00f6nne das noch fehlende d in dem Akronym \"Gandalf\" bilden, das den Namen des m\u00e4chtigen Zauberers aus \"Herr der Ringe\" tr\u00e4gt. Daraufhin habe das Management begonnen, weniger wie eine Bank und mehr wie ein Big Tech zu agieren und sich an der Leitfrage zu orientieren, was Amazon-Chef Jeff Bezos tun w\u00fcrde. Ob Legende oder Wahrheit, fest steht, dass DBS seitdem einen rigorosen digitalen Transformationsprozess durchl\u00e4uft. Die F\u00fchrungsriege bem\u00fcht gern den Begriff der Start-up-Kultur in einem Konzern mit gut 26 000 Mitarbeitern.</p><p>1968 vom Staat zur Begleitung der Industrialisierung als Development Bank of Singapore gegr\u00fcndet, hat sich DBS l\u00e4ngst zur Regionalbank entwickelt, die in 18 asiatischen Staaten, aber auch in Gro\u00dfbritannien pr\u00e4sent ist. Der Gro\u00dfteil der mehr als zehn Millionen Kunden ist neben dem Heimatmarkt Singapur in China, Indien, Indonesien und Taiwan zu Hause. Fast zwei Drittel der Ertr\u00e4ge von im Jahr 2018 umgerechnet knapp 9 Mrd. Euro erwirtschaftet die Bank im Stadtstaat, 29 % in China und 9 % in den restlichen 17 L\u00e4ndern.</p><p>Name als Online-Plattform</p><p>Mittlerweile hat sie sich einen Namen als Online-Plattform mit eigenem \u00d6kosystem f\u00fcr viele Lebensbereiche gemacht. Ob Autoh\u00e4ndler oder Werkst\u00e4tten, Immobilienmakler oder Gesundheitsdienstleister, ob Rechtsberater, Energieversorger oder Architekten - \u00fcber mittlerweile gut 350 offene Schnittstellen (API) l\u00e4sst die Bank Partner andocken, die oft so gar nichts mit Finanzen zu tun haben. Sie f\u00fchren DBS neue Kundschaft zu, die wiederum streicht Vermittlungsgeb\u00fchren ein und kann ein umfangreicheres Angebot offerieren.</p><p>Dass Singapurs gr\u00f6\u00dfte Bank vieles anders und vielleicht tats\u00e4chlich besser macht als andere Institute dieser Welt, zeigt die Palette der Auszeichnungen mehrerer Magazine, mit der sie sich schm\u00fccken kann. In diesem Jahr k\u00fcrte \"Euromoney\" DBS zu \"World's Best Bank\", im vergangenen Jahr \"The Banker\" zur \"Global Bank of the Year\" und \"Global Finance\" zur \"Best Bank in the World\".</p><p>Klare Linie</p><p>Laura Pfannem\u00fcller und Axel Sarnitz, Managerin sowie Partner bei der Beratungsgesellschaft ZEB, haben sich in Singapur selbst ein Bild von der DBS verschafft. Beeindruckt zeigen sie sich von der Effizienz, mit der Prozesse ablaufen und der Hartn\u00e4ckigkeit, mit der Neuerungen umgesetzt werden. Stete Analysen des Nutzerverhaltens und Kundenfeedback w\u00fcrden zudem f\u00fcr Verbesserungen genutzt. \"Dort herrscht eine ausnehmende Klarheit, die es in vielen europ\u00e4ischen Banken so nicht gibt\", hat Sarnitz festgestellt. So seien Back Office und Filialen weitgehend unerw\u00fcnscht, und das werde auch klar kommuniziert. Dass es keine Filialen gibt, die diesen Namen verdienen, sondern 280 Anlaufpunkte, wo kleinere Bankgesch\u00e4fte erledigt werden k\u00f6nnten, st\u00f6re aber auch niemanden. \"Die Erwartung des Bankmanagements ist: Alles, was sich automatisieren l\u00e4sst, wird automatisiert.\" Das sei zwar kurzfristig teuer, zahle sich aber langfristig aus.</p><p>Die Cost-Income-Ratio betrug 2018 nach dem j\u00fcngsten Anstieg um einen Prozentpunkt wegen der Integrationskosten eines Zukaufs in S\u00fcdostasien 44 %. Bleibt der Sonderfaktor unber\u00fccksichtigt, f\u00fchrt die fortschreitende Digitalisierung nach Angaben der DBS \u00fcblicherweise unter dem Strich zu einer Senkung des Aufwand-Ertrag-Verh\u00e4ltnisses der Bank um etwa einen halben Prozentpunkt pro Jahr.</p><p>Angesichts der beschleunigten Digitalisierung ist der Anteil von Digitalkunden im Privat- und Firmenkundensektor in Singapur und Hongkong von 33 % im Jahr 2015 auf 48 % drei Jahre sp\u00e4ter gewachsen. Als Digitalkunden definiert die Bank jene Kunden, die in den vergangenen zw\u00f6lf Monaten \u00fcber einen digitalen Kanal entweder ein Produkt gekauft oder mehr als die H\u00e4lfte ihrer Transaktionen get\u00e4tigt haben. Da sie weniger Kosten als klassische Kunden verursachen, aber doppelt so hohe Ertr\u00e4ge einbringen, ist die Cost-Income-Ratio im Privat- und Firmenkundensektor in Singapur und Hongkong, das etwa f\u00fcr die H\u00e4lfte der DBS-Ertr\u00e4ge steht, seit 2015 stetig gesunken (s. Grafik). Weil die Cost-Income-Ratio eines traditionellen Retail- oder Firmenkunden 54 % betr\u00e4gt, jene eines Digitalkunden aber nur 34 %, ist es erkl\u00e4rtes Ziel der DBS, mehr Digitalkunden zu gewinnen.</p><p>Die Klarheit in der Formulierung und Umsetzung der Ziele, Datenanalysen, die konsequente Digitalisierung und keine IT-Altlasten, mit denen sie sich rumzuschlagen hat: Das unterscheide die DBS von anderen Instituten und mache sie durchaus zum Vorbild, sagt Sarnitz. \"Die DBS kann als Modell f\u00fcr europ\u00e4ische Banken herhalten - daf\u00fcr, was m\u00f6glich ist, wenn man keine Ausreden akzeptiert.\" Regulatorik etwa oder tradiertes Verst\u00e4ndnis von Kundenw\u00fcnschen, die oft genug als Argument dienen m\u00fcssten, um Digitalisierung nur halbherzig zu betreiben oder zu unterlassen. Einen weiteren Unterschied zur europ\u00e4ischen Finanzwelt hebt Pfannem\u00fcller hervor: \"DBS begreift Digitalisierung als nie endenden Prozess und investiert kontinuierlich darin.\"</p><p>Was die Kunden w\u00fcnschen</p><p>Das Institut habe verstanden, dass die Distanzierung vom Banking dem entspricht, was die Kunden w\u00fcnschen: l\u00e4stige Bankgesch\u00e4fte m\u00f6glichst simpel und zeitsparend zu halten. \"Niemand m\u00f6chte Bankgesch\u00e4ften nachgehen\", sagt Pfannem\u00fcller. \"Wer will schon einen Ratenkredit? Die Leute wollen etwas kaufen, sich f\u00fcrs Alter absichern, ein Eigenheim besitzen - das ist das Motiv, sich einer Retailbank zuzuwenden. Deshalb kann man den Ratenkredit auch \u00fcberall ,kaufen', wo es gerade passt.\" DBS binde das Banking in den Lebensstil der Kunden ein, es finde im Kontext, quasi beil\u00e4ufig, statt.</p><p>F\u00fcr ann\u00e4hernd mit der DBS vergleichbar h\u00e4lt Sarnitz lediglich die spanische BBVA und - \u00fcberraschenderweise - den russischen Branchenprimus Sberbank, welche die Digitalisierung entsprechend weit vorangetrieben h\u00e4tten und eigene Online-\u00d6kosysteme zur Verf\u00fcgung stellten.</p><p>----</p><p>Zuletzt erschienen:</p><p>- Apo-Bank fischt mit B2B-Plattform Univiva in fremden Gew\u00e4ssern (7.

Doch an den Firmenkunden bei\u00dfen sich die Fintechs vielfach noch die Z\u00e4hne aus. Woran liegt das? Text: Markus Dentz</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Keine zw\u00f6lf Monate sind vergangen, seit die Deutsche Telekom Beobachter mit einer ungew\u00f6hnlichen Transaktion \u00fcberraschte. Die Bonner platzierten einen zehnj\u00e4hrigen Schuldschein \u00fcber 50 Millionen Euro bei Versicherungsgesellschaften des Axa-Konzerns. Der Clou dabei: Die Telekom nutzte daf\u00fcr eine bis dahin kaum bekannte Fintech-Plattform. \"Credx hat die Emission von Schuldscheindarlehen endlich vereinfacht\", freute sich damals Markus Sch\u00e4fer, Leiter Kapitalmarkt der Telekom. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Das Fintech will die Banken aus dem Schuldscheinprozess rausnehmen - da sie als Intermedi\u00e4re wegfallen, k\u00f6nnten Emittenten im Vergleich zum traditionellen Emissionsweg typischerweise etwa 50 Prozent der Kosten sparen, hei\u00dft es bei dem Anbieter. \"Erfahrene Emittenten begeben Anleihen oder Schuldscheine und wenden sich damit an institutionelle Investoren\", sagt Credx-CEO Ralf Kauter. \"Da auf beiden Seiten Expertise vorhanden ist, braucht es eigentlich keine Bank.\" </p><p>Doch so einfach wollen die Banken ihr angestammtes Terrain der Schuldscheinplatzierung nicht den Fintechs \u00fcberlassen. Einige Wochen nach der Telekom-Transaktion, im Juni 2018, meldete sich der Stuttgarter Schuldschein-Platzhirsch LBBW zu Wort. Gemeinsam mit der B\u00f6rse Stuttgart initiierte die Landesbank (Marktanteil 2018 am Schuldscheingesch\u00e4ft laut Bloomberg fast 21 Prozent) die digitale Plattform Debtvision. Der erste Emittent hier war die M\u00fcnchener Baywa. CFO Andreas Helber versprach sich davon \"den Zugang zu einer neuen und innovativen Finanzierungsoption\". Denkbar sind auf Debtvision Transaktionen auch ohne arrangierende Bank. Beratung und Strukturierung seien Themen, die auch weiterhin bei vielen Transaktionen Bestand h\u00e4tten und nicht digitalisiert werden k\u00f6nnten, glaubt LBBW-Banker und Corporate-Finance-Leiter Joachim Erdle. </p><p>Um ihr Gesch\u00e4ft nicht an die Fintechs zu verlieren, loten auch andere Banken neue Formen der Zusammenarbeit aus: Nach der LBBW und der B\u00f6rse Stuttgart lancierte wenig sp\u00e4ter die D\u00fcsseldorfer HSBC eine eigene Plattform. \u00dcber den Marktplatz Synd-X wurden inzwischen bereits mehrere Schuldscheindarlehen platziert. Auch die NordLB ist neuerdings im Markt f\u00fcr Schuldschein-Plattformen aktiv: \u00dcber die Plattform Finpair haben ebenfalls mehrere Emittenten Schuldscheine platziert. </p><p>Neben Banken und unabh\u00e4ngigen Fintechs positioniert sich schon seit M\u00e4rz 2018 ein weiterer Anbieter mit einem dritten Ansatz: VC Trade ist ein Fintech, das sich als Kooperationspartner von Banken sieht. \"Unser Ziel ist es, durch die Digitalisierung der Emission f\u00fcr alle Beteiligten im Markt einen Vorteil zu generieren\", sagt Mitgr\u00fcnder und Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer Stefan Fromme. Die Abwicklung von Schuldscheinen sei heute schon \"sehr standardisiert\", erfordere aber noch viel manuelle Arbeit bei Verhandlungen, dem Austausch von Dokumenten und der Investorenansprache. \"Vor allem diesen vorgelagerten Teil wollen wir mit unserer Plattform digitalisieren\", erg\u00e4nzt Fromme. </p><p>Dieses banknahe Fintech-Modell findet bei zwei der wichtigsten Schuldschein-Player Anklang: Mit der BayernLB (Marktanteil 2018 laut Bloomberg 13 Prozent) und der Helaba (Marktanteil knapp 11 Prozent) kooperieren die Nummern 2 und 3 im Schuldscheinmarkt mit VC Trade. Hinzu kommen weitere Geldh\u00e4user wie die SEB und die HSH Nordbank. Transaktionen einer niedrigen zweistelligen Emittentenzahl, zu der der Autovermieter Sixt und der Stromkonzern Verbund geh\u00f6ren, wurden bereits \u00fcber VC Trade abgewickelt. </p><p>Wer macht das Rennen? </p><p>Klar ist: Schneller, g\u00fcnstiger und digitaler wird die Platzierung von Schuldscheinen in Zukunft wohl sein. \"Den Vormarsch des Marktplatz-Gedankens in der Finanzierung und im Corporate Banking insgesamt sehen wir als unausweichlich\", glaubt Christopher Schmitz, Fintech-Spezialist bei der Beratungsgesellschaft EY. </p><p>Doch welcher Anbieter und welcher Ansatz das Rennen machen wird, ist derzeit noch v\u00f6llig offen. In dem relativ \u00fcberschaubaren Schuldscheinmarkt (Volumen 2018: 25,3 Milliarden Euro) konkurrieren inzwischen schon ein halbes Dutzend Plattformen um Kunden. Die LBBW-Plattform Debtvision meldete im Januar, dass \"elf Darlehensnehmer und \u00fcber 100 Investoren ongeboardet\" seien. Im Dezember berichtete die HSBC, dass sechs Emittenten die HSBC-Schuldscheinplattform Synd-X nutzen. </p><p>In kaum einem Bereich ist das Dilemma der Fintechs damit so offensichtlich wie beim Beispiel Schuldschein: Ohne Banken l\u00e4uft derzeit kaum etwas. Das bekommen insbesondere diejenigen zu sp\u00fcren, die wie etwa Credx oder auch Firstwire auf einen komplett unabh\u00e4ngigen Ansatz spekulieren. </p><p>Damit sind Fintechs - zumindest im B2B-Segment - ein St\u00fcck weit entzaubert. Wurde den Finanz-Start-ups zwischenzeitlich die komplette Abl\u00f6sung der Banken zugetraut, haben sich die Erwartungen nun normalisiert. Inzwischen ist klar, dass viele Fintechs die Banken nicht ersetzen, sondern wie VC Trade bei den Schuldscheinen eher als deren Kooperationspartner auftreten werden. Das ist auch ein zentrales Ergebnis der Studie \"Liebe auf den dritten Blick\", die FINANCE gemeinsam mit den Kooperationspartnern ING und CMS Deutschland herausgibt. Sie beruht auf rund 20 Tiefeninterviews mit Vertretern von Fintechs, Banken und einschl\u00e4gigen Beratungen. Nachdem FINANCE im Jahr zuvor den Markt f\u00fcr B2B-Fintechs in einer Studie quantitativ vermessen hatte, stand dieses Mal die Frage nach dessen Weiterentwicklung im Vordergrund. </p><p>Dabei zeigt sich: Im Firmenkundenbereich hat noch kein Fintech den gro\u00dfen Durchbruch geschafft. Im vergangenen Jahr ist es deutschen Finanz-Start-ups laut Barkow Consult zwar gelungen, 1,1 Milliarden Euro einzusammeln - ein Wachstum von 55 Prozent gegen\u00fcber 2017. Allerdings verteilen sich die Investorengelder auf sehr wenige Technologieunternehmen, vorwiegend aus dem Privatkundenbereich. Allein 130 Millionen Euro warb etwa N26 ein. Anfang Januar folgte eine weitere \u00fcberraschende Meldung der Berliner Online-Bank: Mit einer neuen Finanzierungsrunde im Volumen von 300 Millionen US-Dollar werde N26 nun mit 2,3 Milliarden Euro bewertet - und sei das erste deutsche \"Einhorn\". Mit einem Unternehmenswert von mehr als 1 Milliarde US-Dollar, wie sie die sogenannten Unicorns unter den Technologieanbietern erreichen, wird derzeit aber kein deutsches Firmenkunden-Fintech bewertet. </p><p>Das Problem der Firmenkunden-Fintechs: Selbst in den Nischenbereichen wie Lieferantenfinanzierung, Schuldschein und Zahlungsverkehr konkurrieren derzeit zu viele Plattformen um Kunden. Dort haben sich nach FINANCE-Recherchen neun Fintechs positioniert. Manche haben wie CRX Markets und Traxpay deutschen Gr\u00fcnderhintergrund. Hinter anderen wie Taulia oder C2FO stehen internationale Gesellschafter und Finanzinvestoren. Trotz spannender Ans\u00e4tze ist es bisher keinem der Anbieter gelungen, Unternehmen in gro\u00dfer Menge auf seine Plattform zu ziehen. </p><p>Online-Marketing wirkt nicht </p><p>Hinzu kommt: Im Gegensatz zu den Nutzern der reinen Privatkunden-Fintechs sto\u00dfen CFOs nicht einfach \u00fcber Online-Marketing auf die Plattformen. Die personell meist d\u00fcnn aufgestellten Technologieanbieter m\u00fcssen bei Unternehmen erst einmal Klinken putzen. Beim Kundenzugang k\u00f6nnen die Start-ups bislang nicht mit den eingespielten Vertriebsorganisationen der Banken mithalten. </p><p>Trotz der Banken- und Finanzkrise haben viele Kreditinstitute weiterhin das Vertrauen vieler Kunden. \"Zwischen Kunden und Banken bestehen lange Gesch\u00e4ftsbeziehungen\", sagt Andreas Becker, Head of Corporate &amp; Public Clients, ING Wholesale Banking Germany &amp; Austria. \"Bei aller Kritik geben die Unternehmen nicht so schnell die Beziehung zur Hausbank auf.\" Selbst wenn Fintech-Anbieter technisch \u00fcberlegene L\u00f6sungen pr\u00e4sentieren, sei der Aufwand f\u00fcr die ersten Kunden noch sehr hoch, weil sie auch mit Entwicklungsarbeit leisten. Und: Welcher der Anbieter setzt sich durch? Legt man sich jetzt auf den falschen fest, war der Implementierungsaufwand umsonst. Deshalb halten sich viele CFOs und Treasurer noch zur\u00fcck, sich an ein spezielles Fintech zu binden. </p><p>Wie mehrere Befragungen von FINANCE zeigen, sind Unternehmen durchaus aufgeschlossen, spannende Technologieanbieter einzubinden. Und haben dies bereits getan, wenn sie wie 360T einen neuen Marktstandard setzen konnten. Die Derivatehandelsplattform wurde vor einigen Jahren f\u00fcr den stolzen Preis von \u00fcber 725 Millionen Euro von Gr\u00fcndern und Venture Capitalists an die Deutsche B\u00f6rse verkauft - damit kam die deutsche Plattform fast auf die f\u00fcr Unicorns angelegte Benchmark von 1 Milliarde US-Dollar. 360T steht damit aber allein in der deutschen B2B-Fintech-Landschaft. </p><p>Um bei Firmenkunden erfolgreich zu sein, ist die Kooperation mit einer Bank f\u00fcr viele Fintechs inzwischen deutlich interessanter geworden als noch vor einigen Jahren. Die Zusammenarbeit folgt allerdings keinem gefestigten Schema, hat die FINANCE-Studie erbracht. Verbreitet sind drei Modelle: Produktpartnerschaften, bei denen das Fintech unter eigener Marke auftritt, mit der Bank aber die Ertr\u00e4ge teilt. Relativ unsichtbar wird das Fintech beim sogenannten White Labeling - dabei stellt es der Bank seine Technologie etwa gegen eine Lizenzgeb\u00fchr zur Verf\u00fcgung. Bei Plattformkooperationen tritt die Bank nach au\u00dfen als Vermittler auf und erh\u00e4lt daf\u00fcr eine Provision. </p><p>F\u00fcr das Fintech liegt die Hauptmotivation f\u00fcr eine Zusammenarbeit in der Vertriebsunterst\u00fctzung. Die Bank hingegen kann mit der Fintech-L\u00f6sung ihr eigenes Produktangebot erweitern, ohne die Produktentwicklung zu bezahlen, und zus\u00e4tzliche Ertr\u00e4ge erwirtschaften. </p><p>Ein Feld, in dem Kooperationen zunehmend in Mode kommen, ist die Lieferkettenfinanzierung (\"Supply Chain Finance\"). Auch hier wollen einige Anbieter engere Partnerschaften mit Banken eingehen. Beispiel Traxpay: Das Frankfurter Fintech, das unweit des Frankfurter Bahnhofs sitzt, sucht inzwischen die N\u00e4he zu Banken. \"Wir haben erkannt, dass man im B2B nicht gegen sie arbeiten kann\", sagt CEO und Gr\u00fcnder Markus Rupprecht im Gespr\u00e4ch mit FINANCE. \"Erstens geben sie uns Zugang zu gro\u00dfvolumigem Gesch\u00e4ft und wissen genau, welche Kunden sich eignen. Zweitens nutzen wir ihr Vertrauen im Markt.\" Und drittens habe Traxpay einen Marketingvorteil, weil die Banken im Markt nicht gegen, sondern mit dem Fintech agierten. \"Disintermediation sch\u00e4tzen die H\u00e4user gar nicht\", so Rupprechts Fazit. </p><p>Ein weiteres Gebiet, in dem Firmenkunden direkt angesprochen werden, sind Kreditplattformen. Doch wer kreditw\u00fcrdig ist, m\u00fcssen auch die Fintechs genau pr\u00fcfen. Kreditanfragen \u00fcber 1 Milliarde Euro vermeldete etwa die Plattform Creditshelf im Jahr 2018. Wie w\u00e4hlerisch die Plattform sein muss, zeigt sich daran, dass mit 100 Millionen Euro letztlich nur 10 Prozent der angefragten Summe tats\u00e4chlich an Mittelst\u00e4ndler ausgereicht wurden. Auch das seit dem vergangenen Jahr b\u00f6rsennotierte Unternehmen Creditshelf stellt sich nicht direkt gegen die Banken. \"Wir setzen insgesamt auf Kooperation mit den Banken und sehen hier sehr interessante Ans\u00e4tze\", sagt Creditshelf-Gr\u00fcnder Daniel Bartsch. \"Wir sind insbesondere dann ein interessanter Partner f\u00fcr Banken, wenn diese Kundenanfragen mangels eigenen Produktangebots oder aus anderen Gr\u00fcnden nicht bedienen k\u00f6nnen.\" </p><p>Einen besonders ungew\u00f6hnlichen Weg gehen inzwischen die Kreditplattform Lendico und die ING gemeinsam - die niederl\u00e4ndische Bank hat das Fintech komplett erworben. Mit Hilfe von Lendico will die niederl\u00e4ndische Bank im Gesch\u00e4ft mit deutschen KMU angreifen: Hierzulande ist sie bereits im Privatkundengesch\u00e4ft und im Wholesale Banking (Kunden mit Ums\u00e4tzen von \u00fcber 250 Millionen Euro) aktiv. \"Wir k\u00f6nnen diese L\u00fccke mit Hilfe von Lendico schlie\u00dfen\", sagt Andreas Becker. Es sei eine \"Make or Buy\"-Entscheidung gewesen. \u00dcber den gemeinsamen Auftritt von Bank und Fintech wird man vermutlich Anfang Februar mehr h\u00f6ren, wenn die ING auch ihre Zahlen f\u00fcr den deutschen Markt vorstellt. </p><p>Allerdings funktioniert die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Fintech und Bank naturgem\u00e4\u00df nicht immer so reibungslos wie anfangs angenommen. Eine besondere Rolle spielen die rechtlichen H\u00fcrden: Je n\u00e4her die Finanztechnologieanbieter an die Bank heranr\u00fccken, desto gr\u00f6\u00dfer werden die aufsichtsrechtlichen Vorschriften. \"Bei Vertriebskooperationen kommt es auf die Details an\", warnt Barbara Bayer, Senior Associate bei CMS Deutschland. Dabei spiele eine Rolle, wer den Kunden anspreche, wie genau das Produkt ausgestaltet sei und ob die Zusammenarbeit vielleicht als Outsourcing gesehen werden k\u00f6nne. \"Je nachdem, k\u00f6nnen die Aufzeichnungs- und Beratungspflichten schon ein Hemmschuh f\u00fcr den Kundenbetreuer sein\", sagt Bayer. Sind die regulatorischen H\u00fcrden zu hoch, vertreibt der Betreuer m\u00f6glicherweise lieber ein anderes Produkt als das des Fintechs. </p><p>Noch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Herausforderungen gibt es bei einer Komplett\u00fcbernahme des Fintechs. \"Dann kommen relativ umfassende Gruppenpflichten wie die Institutsverg\u00fctungsordnung oder die Sorgfaltspflichten auf das Start-up zu\", sagt Anw\u00e4ltin Bayer. Von der einstigen Freiheit sei dann oft nur noch wenig \u00fcbrig. Es kann durchaus der richtige Weg sein, wenn sich ein Geldhaus eine innovative Technologie hinzukauft - dies kann aber auch die agilen und unternehmerischen Bestrebungen eines Fintechs beschneiden. </p><p>Big Tech im Anmarsch </p><p>Klar ist: Auch die Banken stehen unter Druck, beweglicher zu werden - dabei k\u00f6nnen Fintechs wertvolle Hilfe leisten. \"Die Bank der Zukunft ist kein eindimensionaler Produktanbieter mehr, sondern wird eine Plattform mit internen und externen Angeboten sein\", sagt Gerhard Kebbel, Bereichsleiter Strategieprojekt Digitalisierung bei der Helaba. \"Da kommen die Fintechs ins Spiel, die eine Vielzahl von Angeboten in den Markt geben, aber kaum Zugang zu den Kunden haben.\" </p><p>Eine latente Bedrohung f\u00fcr Banken und Fintechs kommt aber noch aus einer ganz anderen Richtung, n\u00e4mlich von den sogenannten Big Techs wie Apple, Amazon, Paypal oder Google. Besonders das Beispiel Apple Pay zeigt, wie es dem Tech-Giganten gelungen ist, ein eigenes Bezahlsystem in kurzer Zeit einzuf\u00fchren - in Deutschland l\u00e4uft es seit Dezember 2018. Hingegen scheint die Paydirekt-Initiative deutscher Banken gescheitert, nachdem namhafte Banken ihren Ausstieg erkl\u00e4rt haben. </p><p>Im Gegensatz zu den Fintechs verf\u00fcgen die gro\u00dfen Big-Tech-Firmen \u00fcber wichtige Vorteile: Sie haben den Zugang zu Kunden und deren Vertrauen, Innovationskraft - und nahezu unermessliche finanzielle Spielr\u00e4ume. Gerade im Feld Supply Chain Finance, in dem sich zahlreiche Banken und Fintechs tummeln, k\u00f6nnten die Big Techs ohne Weiteres angreifen. Zwischen Banken und Big-Tech-Konzernen s\u00e4\u00dfen viele Fintechs dann wirklich in der Falle. </p><p>Fintech-Studie <br/><br/>Harte Konkurrenz, friedvolles Miteinander oder eine ganz <br/>neue Form der Kooperation? Noch sind die Beziehungen <br/>zwischen Firmenkunden-Fintechs und Banken im Fluss. Die <br/>Studie \"Liebe auf den dritten Blick: Wie <br/>Firmenkunden-Fintechs und Banken zusammenfinden\" zeigt, wie <br/>beide Seiten zueinander stehen und wo sie voneinander <br/>profitieren k\u00f6nnen. Sie kann \u00fcber den Shop bei <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.financemagazin.de\">www.financemagazin.de</url> bezogen werden. <br/><br/>Fintechs <br/><br/>Unter Fintechs sind junge Unternehmen zu verstehen, die mit<br/>neuen Technologien den Finanzsektor aufrollen wollen. Nach <br/>Recherchen von FINANCE sind in Deutschland fast 300 im <br/>B2B-Bereich aktiv. Fintech-Standort Nummer 1 ist Berlin, <br/>gefolgt von Frankfurt am Main und M\u00fcnchen. <br/><br/>Einhorn <br/><br/>Als Einhorn oder auch \"Unicorn\" werden junge <br/>Technologieanbieter bezeichnet, die Bewertungen von mehr <br/>als 1 Milliarde US-Dollar erreichen. Die Fabelwesen unter <br/>den Fintechs sind selten: In Deutschland hat lediglich die <br/>Online-Bank N26 diesen Status erreicht. <br/><br/>Big Tech <br/><br/>Disruptives Potential wird den gro\u00dfen Tech-Unternehmen <br/>zugetraut. Falls die GAFAs - Google, Amazon, Facebook und <br/>Apple - ihre Macht im Finanzbereich ausspielen w\u00fcrden, <br/>k\u00f6nnten sie auf viele Vorteile bauen: gro\u00dfe Finanzkraft, <br/>Kundenzugang und Vertrauen sowie ihren meist globalen <br/>Auftritt. <br/></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Text und Bild als PDF (1)</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"190128finFinance01201910\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"41464\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Text und Bild als PDF (2)</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"190128finFinance01201911\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"41464\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Text und Bild als PDF (3)</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"190128finFinance01201912\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"41464\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Text und Bild als PDF (4)</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"190128finFinance01201913\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"41464\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Text und Bild als PDF (5)</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"190128finFinance01201914\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"41464\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINNCE-fin011928012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINNCE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V98-SBS1-DXRH-G00C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Gates GmbH Alle Rechte vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>Finance - Der Markt f\u00fcr Unternehmen und Finanzen</publicationName><volume>Band Januar</volume><issueNumber>Ausg.

For 16 years at Amazon, now in charge of the digital transformation of the Italian economy and, of course, he was appointed by the previous Prime Minister, the one of the only people that is still there now. So, Mr. Piacentini, thank you for joining Bloomberg. Do you worry that this government will take a back step when it comes to the transformation of the Italian economy digitally?</p><p>DIEGO PIACENTINI, COMMISSIONER OF ITALIAN DIGITAL AGENDA, ITALY: Well, based on the facts so far and based on the, well, coming activity they are heading towards our job, I would say, no. I mean, they are -- by the way, my job is focused on digital transmission of the government, which is a big piece of the economy. But they obviously come to the recognition that nobody doesn't want a digitalized government. It doesn't matter what political color. Do we want government as a service, government (inaudible) property, do you want a government that is efficient, do you want government policies that are measurable? Well, then you have to digitalized.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes, but this is also tough because I imagine that it's against the bureaucracy that you've seen for many years in Italy. You've been there for two years. Has it been harder than you taught it was?</p><p>PIACENTINI: It wasn't. And if you say against the bureaucracy, the point is bureaucracy has no political color, and it's always been there and it will always be there, it's a huge legacy, it's fighting that legacies, it's educating that legacy, it's changing the processes, it's a massive work, it's not a work of one person. I mean, there needs to be continues plans for many years, otherwise, you're not going to go anywhere. And this is why, if there is one thing that needs to be passed from one government to another, no matter what color it is, it's digital transformation. If a government decides that the digital transformation activity should be established and it was appointed by the other government, that's totally crazy. It's not the case. We are actually work --</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. But what worries you about Italy at the moment? I imagine you're here, I mean, you spend previously to Amazon at ten or even more years at Apple, so you're one of the only employees that did both $1 trillion companies, right? And so is there anything that Italy should learn from that?</p><p>PIACENTINI: Well, then again, the point I am going to make is about Italy structurally. The basic problems of Italy are not linked to any political government of any color in that space. There are structural problems. The thing that worries me the most is that in this era of digital transformation where new technology needs to be adopted quickly, although Italy is full of incredibly smart people, the average of population is not, I'm sorry to be straight, educated enough. If you look at all the rankings, we are among the lowest ranking of STEM, science, tech, engineering and mathematics graduates in Europe. That's the trend that needs to change. And that is the structural change because it changes (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: How do you change that?</p><p>PIACENTINI: Well it's -- that's where politics come in, right? That's where a good politics come in. That's were good investments in education, in training, in school system, in hiring more teachers, in more qualified teachers, in getting also the private world happening to help the public world. I mean, there is -- there will have to be a different way for private companies to interact with governments and governments need to interact with every private companies, and not just lobbying for its own profit.</p><p>LACQUA: Diego, of course, we talk a lot about of course regulation of big tech companies, Amazon, Apple. Do you ever regret leaving there at such an important time for these tech giants?</p><p>PIACENTINI: I always try to have the non-regret approach. I actually would have regretted more in not trying this and staying there, because this is something completely new. Do I miss it? Yes. I miss it. Do I regret leaving it? No.</p><p>LACQUA: What do you miss about it?</p><p>PIACENTINI: Speed, dynamics, not being this smartest guy there actually oftentimes and like in the middle. And here, unfortunately, I'm on the top. And I like to be in places where I'm not the smartest guy.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you think you'll go back on (inaudible) finishes?</p><p>PIACENTINI: I think I will definitely go back to the U.S. What I'm going to be doing, I don't know. And that, again, is going to be moving back from the U.S. and Europe, just never been steady in one place.</p><p>LACQUA: Diego, thank you so much for joining us today.

For 16 years at Amazon, now in charge of the digital transformation of the Italian economy and, of course, he was appointed by the previous Prime Minister, the one of the only people that is still there now. So, Mr. Piacentini, thank you for joining Bloomberg. Do you worry that this government will take a back step when it comes to the transformation of the Italian economy digitally?</p><p>DIEGO PIACENTINI, COMMISSIONER OF ITALIAN DIGITAL AGENDA, ITALY: Well, based on the facts so far and based on the, well, coming activity they are heading towards our job, I would say, no. I mean, they are -- by the way, my job is focused on digital transmission of the government, which is a big piece of the economy. But they obviously come to the recognition that nobody doesn't want a digitalized government. It doesn't matter what political color. Do we want government as a service, government (inaudible) property, do you want a government that is efficient, do you want government policies that are measurable? Well, then you have to digitalized.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes, but this is also tough because I imagine that it's against the bureaucracy that you've seen for many years in Italy. You've been there for two years. Has it been harder than you taught it was?</p><p>PIACENTINI: It wasn't. And if you say against the bureaucracy, the point is bureaucracy has no political color, and it's always been there and it will always be there, it's a huge legacy, it's fighting that legacies, it's educating that legacy, it's changing the processes, it's a massive work, it's not a work of one person. I mean, there needs to be continues plans for many years, otherwise, you're not going to go anywhere. And this is why, if there is one thing that needs to be passed from one government to another, no matter what color it is, it's digital transformation. If a government decides that the digital transformation activity should be established and it was appointed by the other government, that's totally crazy. It's not the case. We are actually work --</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. But what worries you about Italy at the moment? I imagine you're here, I mean, you spend previously to Amazon at ten or even more years at Apple, so you're one of the only employees that did both $1 trillion companies, right? And so is there anything that Italy should learn from that?</p><p>PIACENTINI: Well, then again, the point I am going to make is about Italy structurally. The basic problems of Italy are not linked to any political government of any color in that space. There are structural problems. The thing that worries me the most is that in this era of digital transformation where new technology needs to be adopted quickly, although Italy is full of incredibly smart people, the average of population is not, I'm sorry to be straight, educated enough. If you look at all the rankings, we are among the lowest ranking of STEM, science, tech, engineering and mathematics graduates in Europe. That's the trend that needs to change. And that is the structural change because it changes (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: How do you change that?</p><p>PIACENTINI: Well it's -- that's where politics come in, right? That's where a good politics come in. That's were good investments in education, in training, in school system, in hiring more teachers, in more qualified teachers, in getting also the private world happening to help the public world. I mean, there is -- there will have to be a different way for private companies to interact with governments and governments need to interact with every private companies, and not just lobbying for its own profit.</p><p>LACQUA: Diego, of course, we talk a lot about of course regulation of big tech companies, Amazon, Apple. Do you ever regret leaving there at such an important time for these tech giants?</p><p>PIACENTINI: I always try to have the non-regret approach. I actually would have regretted more in not trying this and staying there, because this is something completely new. Do I miss it? Yes. I miss it. Do I regret leaving it? No.</p><p>LACQUA: What do you miss about it?</p><p>PIACENTINI: Speed, dynamics, not being this smartest guy there actually oftentimes and like in the middle. And here, unfortunately, I'm on the top. And I like to be in places where I'm not the smartest guy.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you think you'll go back on (inaudible) finishes?</p><p>PIACENTINI: I think I will definitely go back to the U.S. What I'm going to be doing, I don't know. And that, again, is going to be moving back from the U.S. and Europe, just never been steady in one place.</p><p>LACQUA: Diego, thank you so much for joining us today.

Fischer</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">F\u00fcr den Bekannten von Donald Trump und einstigen Unternehmer, der heute als Botschafter die Interessen der USA in der Schweiz wahrnimmt, ist generell klar: \u00abJedes Business zwischen den USA und der Schweiz, das legal und transparent ist, ist eine gute Sache.\u00bb Ob dazu k\u00fcnftig auch das von Facebook zusammen mit 27 weiteren Konzernen geplante Blockchain-basierte Zahlungssystem Libra mit seiner gleichnamigen Kryptow\u00e4hrung geh\u00f6ren wird, ist f\u00fcr Edward T. McMullen indes noch offen. Seine Regierung sei gegen\u00fcber neuen Gesch\u00e4ftsideen und Innovationen aufgeschlossen, betonte der US-Botschafter im Gespr\u00e4ch mit der NZZ. Aber gerade im Finanzbereich m\u00fcssten die Konsumenten vor Missbrauch gesch\u00fctzt, die Datensicherheit gewahrt und Geldw\u00e4scherei wirksam bek\u00e4mpft werden. Bei dem Libra-Projekt sei bis jetzt noch sehr vieles unklar. </p><p>Der Diplomat best\u00e4tigte, dass seine Botschaft am Wochenende eine parlamentarische Delegation unter Leitung von Maxine Waters, der Vorsitzenden des Finanzdienstleistungsausschusses des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses, betreut hat. Parlamentarische Delegationen begeben sich gelegentlich zu \u00abfact-finding missions\u00bb ins Ausland. Die sechsk\u00f6pfige Delegation von Vertretern des Finanzausschusses hatte sich mit Vertretern des Staatssekretariats f\u00fcr Finanzfragen, der Finanzmarktaufsicht (Finma) und mit dem Datenschutzbeauftragten getroffen, wie Waters in einem Statement best\u00e4tigte. Die Parlamentarierin erkl\u00e4rte nach den Treffen, sie sei dankbar f\u00fcr die Informationen aus der Schweiz, aber nach wie vor beunruhigt dar\u00fcber, dass eine grosse Techfirma eine eigene Weltw\u00e4hrung lancieren wolle. Die Vertreterin der Demokratischen Partei hat einen Gesetzesentwurf (die \u00abKeep Big Tech out of Finance Act\u00bb) lanciert, mit dem Firmen der Plattformwirtschaft wie Facebook oder Alphabet generell das Betreiben von bank\u00e4hnlichen Gesch\u00e4ften verboten werden soll.</p><h>Mehr Fragen als Antworten</h><p>Der amerikanische Botschafter in der Schweiz will sich zu den Ergebnissen der Informationsreise nicht \u00e4ussern; dies sei Sache der Delegation. Er habe aber den Eindruck, dass sowohl die Schweizer Regulatoren wie auch die US-Seite zu vielen technischen Details des ambiti\u00f6sen Libra-Projekts bis anhin mehr Fragen als Antworten haben. Dabei sieht er die Interessen der USA und der Schweiz gleichgerichtet: Es gelte, eine solide Regulierung sicherzustellen. </p><p>McMullen glaubt deshalb nicht, dass das Facebook-Projekt einen neuen Schatten auf die bilateralen Beziehungen wirft. Mit Blick zur\u00fcck auf die turbulenten Zeiten des Steuerstreits zeigt sich McMullen \u00fcberzeugt, dass die einstigen Probleme weitgehend aus dem Weg ger\u00e4umt sind und der Schweizer Finanzplatz heute den US-Vorstellungen von integrem Wirtschaften entspricht. Zudem arbeite man heute im Bereich der Cybersicherheit intensiv und produktiv zusammen.</p><p>McMullen gibt sich gerne als Fan der Schweiz zu erkennen. Ger\u00fcchte um eine baldige R\u00fcckkehr in die USA dementiert er. Er wolle noch zahlreiche Projekte vollenden und f\u00fclle seinen Posten im Auftrag von Pr\u00e4sident Trump aus. Er und seine Frau h\u00e4tten sich diesem gegen\u00fcber verpflichtet. Sie  w\u00fcrden die Schweiz ausgesprochen sch\u00e4tzen, erkl\u00e4rt er glaubhaft. McMullen streicht immer wieder die wirtschaftlichen Gemeinsamkeiten der Schweiz mit den USA heraus, und er geh\u00f6rt zu den engagierten Unterst\u00fctzern der Sondierungsgespr\u00e4che zu einem m\u00f6glichen Freihandelsabkommen zwischen den USA und der Schweiz.</p><h>Abkommen mit Potenzial</h><p>Die neue Studie von Avenir Suisse zu den m\u00f6glichen Auswirkungen eines Freihandelsabkommens rechne wohl eher konservativ, sagt der US-Botschafter, sie zeige aber gleichwohl das grosse Potenzial, das in so einem Abkommen stecken w\u00fcrde. Zu kl\u00e4ren g\u00e4lte es nun, ob man \u00fcber die Konturen eines m\u00f6glichst einfach machbaren bilateralen Vertrags so weit \u00dcbereinstimmung erzielen k\u00f6nne, dass beide Seiten von den Erfolgsaussichten \u00fcberzeugt seien. McMullen h\u00e4lt eine Einigung noch in dieser Amtszeit Trumps weiter f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich. Die US-Seite werde nun sicher auch beobachten, wie bei den interessierten Kreisen in der Schweiz das gerade mit den Mercosur-Staaten erzielte Abkommen aufgenommen werde.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF-Dokument</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"issueINZZ20190829page0008978963\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"2360\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZZ-issueINZZ20190829article0249646671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXK-47R1-F16T-226K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">12122</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 AG f\u00fcr Die Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung NZZ Alle Rechte vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (Internationale Ausgabe) &amp;

Parlamentarische Delegationen begeben sich gelegentlich zu \u00abfact-finding missions\u00bb ins Ausland. Die sechsk\u00f6pfige Delegation von Vertretern des Finanzausschusses hatte sich mit Vertretern des Staatssekretariats f\u00fcr Finanzfragen, der Finanzmarktaufsicht (Finma) und mit dem Datenschutzbeauftragten getroffen, wie Waters in einem Statement best\u00e4tigte. Die Parlamentarierin erkl\u00e4rte nach den Treffen, sie sei dankbar f\u00fcr die Informationen aus der Schweiz, aber nach wie vor beunruhigt dar\u00fcber, dass eine grosse Techfirma eine eigene Weltw\u00e4hrung lancieren wolle. Die Vertreterin der Demokratischen Partei hat einen Gesetzesentwurf (die \u00abKeep Big Tech out of Finance Act\u00bb) lanciert, mit dem Firmen der Plattformwirtschaft wie Facebook oder Alphabet generell das Betreiben von bank\u00e4hnlichen Gesch\u00e4ften verboten werden soll.</p><h>Mehr Fragen als Antworten</h><p>Der amerikanische Botschafter in der Schweiz will sich zu den Ergebnissen der Informationsreise nicht \u00e4ussern; dies sei Sache der Delegation. Er habe aber den Eindruck, dass sowohl die Schweizer Regulatoren wie auch die US-Seite zu vielen technischen Details des ambiti\u00f6sen Libra-Projekts bis anhin mehr Fragen als Antworten haben. Dabei sieht er die Interessen der USA und der Schweiz gleichgerichtet: Es gelte, eine solide Regulierung sicherzustellen. </p><p>McMullen glaubt deshalb nicht, dass das Facebook-Projekt einen neuen Schatten auf die bilateralen Beziehungen wirft. Mit Blick zur\u00fcck auf die turbulenten Zeiten des Steuerstreits zeigt sich McMullen \u00fcberzeugt, dass die einstigen Probleme weitgehend aus dem Weg ger\u00e4umt sind und der Schweizer Finanzplatz heute den US-Vorstellungen von integrem Wirtschaften entspricht. Zudem arbeite man heute im Bereich der Cybersicherheit intensiv und produktiv zusammen.</p><p>McMullen gibt sich gerne als Fan der Schweiz zu erkennen. Ger\u00fcchte um eine baldige R\u00fcckkehr in die USA dementiert er. Er wolle noch zahlreiche Projekte vollenden und f\u00fclle seinen Posten im Auftrag von Pr\u00e4sident Trump aus. Er und seine Frau h\u00e4tten sich diesem gegen\u00fcber verpflichtet. Sie  w\u00fcrden die Schweiz ausgesprochen sch\u00e4tzen, erkl\u00e4rt er glaubhaft. McMullen streicht immer wieder die wirtschaftlichen Gemeinsamkeiten der Schweiz mit den USA heraus, und er geh\u00f6rt zu den engagierten Unterst\u00fctzern der Sondierungsgespr\u00e4che zu einem m\u00f6glichen Freihandelsabkommen zwischen den USA und der Schweiz.</p><h>Abkommen mit Potenzial</h><p>Die neue Studie von Avenir Suisse zu den m\u00f6glichen Auswirkungen eines Freihandelsabkommens rechne wohl eher konservativ, sagt der US-Botschafter, sie zeige aber gleichwohl das grosse Potenzial, das in so einem Abkommen stecken w\u00fcrde. Zu kl\u00e4ren g\u00e4lte es nun, ob man \u00fcber die Konturen eines m\u00f6glichst einfach machbaren bilateralen Vertrags so weit \u00dcbereinstimmung erzielen k\u00f6nne, dass beide Seiten von den Erfolgsaussichten \u00fcberzeugt seien. McMullen h\u00e4lt eine Einigung noch in dieser Amtszeit Trumps weiter f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich. Die US-Seite werde nun sicher auch beobachten, wie bei den interessierten Kreisen in der Schweiz das gerade mit den Mercosur-Staaten erzielte Abkommen aufgenommen werde.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF-Dokument</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"issueNZZ20190828page0008972720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"2360\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZZ-issueNZZ20190828article0249635003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXC-50T1-F16T-23WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">12122</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 AG f\u00fcr Die Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung NZZ Alle Rechte vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (Internationale Ausgabe) &amp;

M\u00e4rz \u00fcber die Finanzm\u00e4rkte wissen m\u00fcssen:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1) Globale Aktien wechseln zur\u00fcck zu Handelskriegs-\u00c4ngste</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Die globalen Aktien fielen am Mittwoch, nachdem die Wall Street durch Bef\u00fcrchtungen \u00fcber strengere Kontrollen der Tech-Industrie hart getroffen worden war und eine kurze Erholung der weltweiten Aktienm\u00e4rkte d\u00e4mpfte, die auf der Hoffnung auf eine Entspannung des Handelskrieges zwischen den USA und China zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Der Technologiesektor wurde hart getroffen, als die Marktteilnehmer mit einer erh\u00f6hten Regulierung \u00fcber das Debakel von Facebook (NASDAQ:  FB) spekulierten, das den Schutz der Privatsph\u00e4re der Nutzer vorsah.</p><p>Aktien dehnten ihre Verluste weiter aus, nachdem Chinas staatliche Global Times berichtete, dass die zweitgr\u00f6\u00dfte Volkswirtschaft der Welt bald eine Liste von Vergeltungsz\u00f6llen f\u00fcr US-Exporte nach China ver\u00f6ffentlichen wird.</p><p>Die Nachrichten entt\u00e4uschten die Hoffnungen der H\u00e4ndler, dass die Handelsspannungen zwischen den beiden gr\u00f6\u00dften Volkswirtschaften der Welt nachlie\u00dfen. Nachdem der  Dow am Vortag um mehr als 300 Punkte gefallen war, deuteten US-Futures auf eine Fortsetzung des Ausverkaufs hin. Um 5:54 Uhr ET (9: 54GMT) fiel der Blue-Chip  Dow-Future um 45 Punkte oder 0,19%,  S&amp;P 500-Futures verloren 6 Punkte oder 0,22%, w\u00e4hrend der  Nasdaq 100 Futures 39 Punkte oder 0,60% Verlor.</p><p>Anderswo waren asiatische Aktien vom Ausverkauf der Technologie und der Wiederbelebung von Handelssorgen betroffen. Japans  Nikkei 225 verlor 1,2%, w\u00e4hrend Chinas  Shanghai Composite 1,4% verlor.</p><p>Tech-Unternehmen haben auch europ\u00e4ische Aktien im Mittagshandel nach unten gedr\u00fcckt, da die anhaltenden Bedenken hinsichtlich eines regulatorischen Vorgehens gegen Big-Tech und eine Reihe negativer Schlagzeilen \u00fcber Nacht, die Stimmung gegen\u00fcber dem Sektor belasteten, der einen langen Bullenmarkt antrieb.</p><p>2) China bereitet Vergeltungsz\u00f6lle gegen US-Importe vor</p><p>Erst am vergangenen Montag hatte sich gezeigt, dass die Handelsspannungen zwischen China und den USA gesunken waren und die globalen Aktien sich erholten.</p><p>Die Bedenken, die die chinesische Staatliche Global Times beibrachte, k\u00fcndigten jedoch an, dass Peking bald eine vollst\u00e4ndige Liste der Z\u00f6lle auf US-Importe bekannt geben w\u00fcrde, um sich gegen geplante US-Abgaben zu r\u00e4chen.</p><p>Die Warnung vor einem m\u00f6glichen Handelskrieg zwischen den beiden gr\u00f6\u00dften Volkswirtschaften der Welt hat die Risikobereitschaft ged\u00e4mpft, da die Finanzm\u00e4rkte schlimme Folgen erwarteten, sollten die Handelsbarrieren aufgrund Trumps Versuch, das US-Defizit mit China zu verringern, steigen.</p><p>Die M\u00e4rkte warten nun darauf, dass die USA eine Liste chinesischer Produkte ver\u00f6ffentlichen, auf die mit zus\u00e4tzlichen Tarifen reagiert werden k\u00f6nnte, nachdem eine Untersuchung in den USA China wegen Diebstahls geistigen Eigentums und unlauterem Handel f\u00fcr schuldig befunden hat.</p><p>3) Das BIP soll die Aufmerksamkeit auf die wirtschaftliche Front lenken</p><p>Die USA werden die endg\u00fcltigen Zahlen f\u00fcr das Wirtschaftswachstum im vierten Quartal um 8:30 Uhr ET (12:30 GMT) bekannt geben.</p><p>Die Daten werden voraussichtlich zeigen, dass die Wirtschaft in den letzten drei Monaten des Jahres 2017 mit einer gesunden Jahresrate von  2,7% expandierte, nach einer vorl\u00e4ufigen Sch\u00e4tzung von 2,5% nach oben revidiert. Es ist im dritten Quartal um 3,2% gewachsen.</p><p>Bemerkenswert ist, dass diese dritte Lesung aus dem Zeitraum Oktober bis Dezember 2017 stammt und nicht erwartet wird, dass die Auswirkungen der Steuersenkungen von Trump ber\u00fccksichtigt werden.</p><p>Die Anleger werden sich auch am Mittwoch auf die Immobilienmarktdaten konzentrieren, da die National Association of Realtors ihre  ausstehenden Hausverk\u00e4ufe f\u00fcr den Monat Februar um 10:00 Uhr ET (14: 00GMT) ver\u00f6ffentlicht.</p><p>4) \u00d6lpreise sinken wegen Wetten auf steigende US-Lagerbest\u00e4nde</p><p>Die Roh\u00f6lpreise sind am Mittwoch weiter zur\u00fcckgegangen, w\u00e4hrend die spekulativen w\u00f6chentlichen Angebotsdaten, die sp\u00e4ter am Tag f\u00e4llig werden, einen starken Anstieg der \u00d6llieferungen in den USA zeigen werden.</p><p>Die US-amerikanische Energieinformationsverwaltung ver\u00f6ffentlicht ihren  offiziellen w\u00f6chentlichen \u00d6llieferungsbericht f\u00fcr die Woche, die am 23.

We'd cry at the news of another closure - \"Oh no! I saw ______ there! My past is being obliterated!\" - but ultimately, we'd just end up shrugging our shoulders as the Sidetrack Cafe, Seedy's, kHz, Elevation Room, New City, and yes, even Red's/Edmonton Event Centre disappeared from our lives.</p><p>In 2015, however, our vanishing venues finally got top billing. We lost five more rooms - the Roxy, The ARTery, The Pawn Shop, Wunderbar, and SPACE. Two filmmakers unveiled their documentary, Dead Venues, about some of Edmonton's former hallowed halls. And one ambitious musician, Thom Bennett, decided to put an end to the phenomenon, or at the very least, slow it down.</p><p>He's the chief gardener behind ELM, or the Edmonton Live Music Initiative, a partnership between the City of Edmonton, Edmonton Arts Council and Alberta Music.</p><p>Bennett wants to grow a vibrant and stable music scene by making it easier for venues to operate, and therefore, nurture the city's performers. He proposes to do so with a series of financial incentives and zoning/licensing changes - perhaps even creating a live music district on par with the world-famous Sixth Street in Austin, Texas.</p><p>\"Frankly, it took me a long time to realize that, in the arts industry, you need to be your own boss,\" he says. \"You have to have the chutzpah or the fire to make something happen instead of waiting around for it to happen. I think I spent a large part of my career waiting and complaining instead of doing something about it. So I just decided to do something about it.\"</p><p>Bennett, 37, was also a bit of a late bloomer as a musician. He was 17 when he got his first drum kit, then enrolled in MacEwan's music program after a two-year stint in the University of Alberta's environmental sciences program.</p><p>Nowadays, he plays with one of Edmonton's most successful jazz acts, AB/Trio, and performs/records with dozens of musicians - from soul-pop vocalist Ann Vriend to Kubasonics, an Ukrainian folk band.</p><p>Bennett pitched the ELM Initiative to Coun. Scott McKeen in January - weeks before the City of Edmonton bought The ARTery's dilapidated building and forced the venue to leave due to structural issues. (The city plans to tear down the building and use the site as storage during construction of the Valley Line LRT.)</p><p>\"Thom's an astute guy with a comprehensive view of live music and the issues around it,\" says McKeen. \"So he didn't just shill for musicians, or venues, but talked about the state of affairs and how government could be a force for good. Instantly, we started brainstorming ideas and he ran with them.\"</p><p>In October, ELM held its first brainstorming session with more than 40 venue owners, gig promoters, musicians, journalists, publicists, festival directors, politicians and city bureaucrats. They talked about a range of issues - from permits to marketing to audience behaviour. (Do people even care about live music anymore?)</p><p>Bennett also introduced two of his main ideas - extending alcohol sales and offering grants for venues. As part of a pilot project, three venues will receive grants to cover half of their musicians' fees for six months. (For every $1 invested in the arts, there's a return of $12, according to some economic impact studies.)</p><p>\"If musicians are getting paid less, they don't have as much time to work on their craft, and then the quality goes down and people don't want to come out and then musicians get paid even less,\" says Bennett. \"It's a downward spiral. You need to invest more money to get more quality.\"</p><p>As fruitful as the session was, Bennett still has to iron out some of the adversarial relationships within Edmonton's music scene. Artists don't always think venues have their best interests at heart. Some venue owners don't think it's fair for their competitors to get grants. And some owners, present and potential, think the city itself is hindering progress. The Aviary, most recently, was denied a development permit because it didn't have any parking stalls.</p><p>Bennett is now planning to work with the city to devise a business licence for live music venues, which might also end up solving some of the current zoning issues. (At the moment, there is no category exclusively for live music venues. The Mercury Room, for example, is classified as a restaurant. Other available licences include spectator entertainment establishment, after-hours dance club, and premises offering alcohol sales.)</p><p>ELM is also making headway on changing Alberta liquor regulations to benefit venues. Earlier this month, the legislature passed a motion to allow MLA David Shepherd to explore some possibilities, including extending alcohol sales by an hour to 3 a.m., or giving venues a price reduction on their booze.</p><p>Licensing, grants and zoning are definitely not part of the glamorous side of music, but Bennett knows those subjects are essential - to musicians and Edmonton as a whole.</p><p>\"I didn't get into music for the money. I love what I do and I want to keep doing what I love every day. But at the same time, there's a huge economic benefit to having a healthy music scene - it attracts people here, it keeps people here, both artists and people who want to live in a vibrant community. That's why Austin has such a big tech community - it's a young population that works in tech and they want to go out and they want to do stuff. I think (Edmonton) is starting to wake up in that respect.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ssperounes@postmedia.com\">ssperounes@postmedia.com</email>( <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ssperounes@postmedia.com\">ssperounes@postmedia.com</email> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

We'd cry at the news of another closure - \"Oh no! I saw ______ there! My past is being obliterated!\" - but ultimately, we'd just end up shrugging our shoulders as the Sidetrack Cafe, Seedy's, kHz, Elevation Room, New City, and yes, even Red's/Edmonton Event Centre disappeared from our lives.</p><p>In 2015, however, our vanishing venues finally got top billing. We lost five more rooms - the Roxy, The ARTery, The Pawn Shop, Wunderbar, and SPACE. Two filmmakers unveiled their documentary, Dead Venues, about some of Edmonton's former hallowed halls. And one ambitious musician, Thom Bennett, decided to put an end to the phenomenon, or at the very least, slow it down.</p><p>He's the chief gardener behind ELM, or the Edmonton Live Music Initiative, a partnership between the City of Edmonton, Edmonton Arts Council and Alberta Music.</p><p>Bennett wants to grow a vibrant and stable music scene by making it easier for venues to operate, and therefore, nurture the city's performers. He proposes to do so with a series of financial incentives and zoning/licensing changes - perhaps even creating a live music district on par with the world-famous Sixth Street in Austin, Texas.</p><p>\"Frankly, it took me a long time to realize that, in the arts industry, you need to be your own boss,\" he says. \"You have to have the chutzpah or the fire to make something happen instead of waiting around for it to happen. I think I spent a large part of my career waiting and complaining instead of doing something about it. So I just decided to do something about it.\"</p><p>Bennett, 37, was also a bit of a late bloomer as a musician. He was 17 when he got his first drum kit, then enrolled in MacEwan's music program after a two-year stint in the University of Alberta's environmental sciences program.</p><p>Nowadays, he plays with one of Edmonton's most successful jazz acts, AB/Trio, and performs/records with dozens of musicians - from soul-pop vocalist Ann Vriend to Kubasonics, an Ukrainian folk band.</p><p>Bennett pitched the ELM Initiative to Coun. Scott McKeen in January - weeks before the City of Edmonton bought The ARTery's dilapidated building and forced the venue to leave due to structural issues. (The city plans to tear down the building and use the site as storage during construction of the Valley Line LRT.)</p><p>\"Thom's an astute guy with a comprehensive view of live music and the issues around it,\" says McKeen. \"So he didn't just shill for musicians, or venues, but talked about the state of affairs and how government could be a force for good. Instantly, we started brainstorming ideas and he ran with them.\"</p><p>In October, ELM held its first brainstorming session with more than 40 venue owners, gig promoters, musicians, journalists, publicists, festival directors, politicians and city bureaucrats. They talked about a range of issues - from permits to marketing to audience behaviour. (Do people even care about live music anymore?)</p><p>Bennett also introduced two of his main ideas - extending alcohol sales and offering grants for venues. As part of a pilot project, three venues will receive grants to cover half of their musicians' fees for six months. (For every $1 invested in the arts, there's a return of $12, according to some economic impact studies.)</p><p>\"If musicians are getting paid less, they don't have as much time to work on their craft, and then the quality goes down and people don't want to come out and then musicians get paid even less,\" says Bennett. \"It's a downward spiral. You need to invest more money to get more quality.\"</p><p>As fruitful as the session was, Bennett still has to iron out some of the adversarial relationships within Edmonton's music scene. Artists don't always think venues have their best interests at heart. Some venue owners don't think it's fair for their competitors to get grants. And some owners, present and potential, think the city itself is hindering progress. The Aviary, most recently, was denied a development permit because it didn't have any parking stalls.</p><p>Bennett is now planning to work with the city to devise a business licence for live music venues, which might also end up solving some of the current zoning issues. (At the moment, there is no category exclusively for live music venues. The Mercury Room, for example, is classified as a restaurant. Other available licences include spectator entertainment establishment, after-hours dance club, and premises offering alcohol sales.)</p><p>ELM is also making headway on changing Alberta liquor regulations to benefit venues. Earlier this month, the legislature passed a motion to allow MLA David Shepherd to explore some possibilities, including extending alcohol sales by an hour to 3 a.m., or giving venues a price reduction on their booze.</p><p>Licensing, grants and zoning are definitely not part of the glamorous side of music, but Bennett knows those subjects are essential - to musicians and Edmonton as a whole.</p><p>\"I didn't get into music for the money. I love what I do and I want to keep doing what I love every day. But at the same time, there's a huge economic benefit to having a healthy music scene - it attracts people here, it keeps people here, both artists and people who want to live in a vibrant community. That's why Austin has such a big tech community - it's a young population that works in tech and they want to go out and they want to do stuff. I think (Edmonton) is starting to wake up in that respect.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ssperounes@postmedia.com\">ssperounes@postmedia.com</email>( <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ssperounes@postmedia.com\">ssperounes@postmedia.com</email> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

Warren Buffett or his mentor, Benjamin Graham, nearly always top the rankings, followed by more recent entrants such as David Tepper who took home $4 billion in 2009 after betting big on the survival of some of Wall Street\u2019s largest banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What such lists accurately represent is the rise of American wealth and power during the twentieth century \u2013 as well as its most hubristic moments such as the global financial crisis in 2008 when fortunes were won and lost. What they do not accurately portray is the rise of Chinese wealth and power during this century.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For arguably, some of the greatest ever stock market trades are being made now by Chinese entrepreneurs by delisting their companies in the US and relisting them in China at much higher valuations. This equity arbitrage was on display again at the end of last month, when Qihoo, now renamed 360 Security Technology, was floated in Shanghai.</p><p>The anti-virus software provider originally floated on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2011 before founder Zhou Hongyi took the company private in July 2016. At that point, it had an $9.3 billion valuation.</p><p>When 360 made its Shanghai debut on February 28, it was worth nearly Rmb380 billion ($59 billion) after investors ramped up the stock price of the shell company (previously known as Jiangnan Jiajie, an obscure elevator parts maker) prior to its backdoor listing. Zhou\u2019s wealth instantly soared from $2.1 billion to $13.6 billion thanks to his 23% effective holding in 360.</p><p>Having rung the opening bell, Zhou said the return to the A-share market marks a new chapter for his company as it broadens its scope from internet security to national security (it can now bid for military contracts). He also declared that China should have capital markets commensurate with its economic strength.</p><p>However, the stock has failed to live up to its fanfare. It went limit-down \u2013 that is, 10% per day \u2013 on its first trading session and has continued falling since. Yet even at current levels, it is still valued at 117.5 times forecast 2018 earnings (Rmb2.9 billion), compared to the 14 times forward level it commanded when it was trading in New York.</p><p>But if Shanghai-based Focus Media\u2019s history is anything to go by, investors who have bought 360 Security\u2019s shares in the past week might have something to worry about. The outdoor advertising company also made its founder, Jason Jiang, a paper fortune when it delisted from NASDAQ in 2013 for about $7.4 billion and then went public on the Shenzhen bourse two years later.</p><p>But Focus Media\u2019s A-share trading debut also marked its peak value and its share price subsequently fell from a high of Rmb20.24 to a low of Rmb7.96 in March 2017. Today, it is trading around Rmb15, giving it a $28.6 billion valuation.</p><p>In finance-focused social media chat rooms, critics were dismissive of the idea that 360\u2019s move represents a coming of age for China\u2019s stock markets. \u201cThe reason for the valuation difference between America and China is because Chinese people are very stupid,\u201d was one verdict. Or as another put it, \u201cThese companies are only coming back for the money.\u201d</p><p>But does 360\u2019s homecoming mark the beginning of a new trend? Many US-listed Chinese firms and a few Hong Kong-listed ones went private during 2015 and 2016 after private equity investors detected a means to make a quick buck.</p><p>However, their plans were stymied when the China Securities Regulatory Commission abruptly shut the door on backdoor listings. A host of companies including Shanda Interactive, Dalian Wanda Commercial, Wuxi PharmaTech and Mindray Medical are stuck in a long queue alongside other listing hopefuls.</p><p>There have recently been signs of movement. The CSRC has proposed waivers for certain start-up companies which are currently unable to meet its listing criteria and fast-tracking IPOs across four main industries \u2013 biotech, internet, smart manufacturing and environmental protection. Wuxi PharmaTech, which was delisted in New York in a $3.3 billion buyout deal, may be one of the first beneficiaries.</p><p>One of the major reasons why so many Chinese tech firms opt for the US rather than China \u2013 including Hong Kong \u2013 is because US regulations allow them to use dual class structures, which enable founders to retain control while only holding a minority stake in their companies.</p><p>That was also the main reason why HKEx, which operates Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange, lost out on Alibaba\u2019s mega IPO in 2014.\u2008Hong Kong regulators have since made amends (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weekinchina.com/2018/01/luring-the-next-alibaba/\">see WiC392</url>). Starting late April, \u201cnew-economy companies\u201d with dual-class share structures and even biotech firms without revenue will be allowed to go public on the Hong Kong bourse \u2013 permitting founders to retain control even if they have minority stakes.</p><p>According to Hong\u2008Kong media, smartphone maker Xiaomi and payment system operator Ant Financial, Alibaba\u2019s sister firm, are two listing candidates that HKEx has been trying to lure.</p><p>HKEx has made clear it needs to stay competitive in the face of growing competition from mainland bourses.</p><p>There are reports too on plans for Chinese Depository Receipts (CDRs), which would trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses. According to Caixin Weekly, eight companies, including the BAT troika and Ctrip, China\u2019s biggest online travel agency, are part of a \u201cfirst wave\u201d of firms set to be allowed to issue CDRs \u2013 which would enable local investors access to these popular stocks.</p><p>Zhou\u2019s 360 seems to have got the regulator\u2019s nod thanks to its national security component (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weekinchina.com/2017/11/homeward-bound/\">see WiC388</url>). But many tech tycoons at the ongoing Two Sessions (the annual gathering of Chinese lawmakers and advisors) said they were ready to answer their nation\u2019s call to list at home.</p><p>\u201cWhenever the regulations are ready, we can list straight away,\u201d Ding Lei, NetEase\u2019s boss told state media this week.</p><p>Issuing CDRs is likely to be a given for the big tech companies, not least because they know it is a clear policy directive. But the desire for a primary listing in Hong Kong or the US is unlikely to diminish over the short term. Company founders still want to retain hard currency offshore and maintain some independence from domestic politics.</p><p>That\u2019s why for the moment, Chinese companies have carried on adopting a mixed approach to their listing venue.</p><p>Tencent-backed firms remain fairly wedded to Hong Kong, for example: China Literature was the most recent to list there.</p><p>One of Baidu\u2019s crown jewels, iQiyi, China\u2019s largest streaming service, is also working on a $1.5 billion IPO on NASDAQ.</p><p>Yet nothing illustrates the change in the CSRC\u2019s policies more than its handling of Terry Gou\u2019s decision to list a Foxconn unit on a mainland bourse. Foxconn Industrial Internet (FII), which makes equipment for cloud computing services and 5G solutions, said last month it applied for a listing in Shanghai.</p><p>The CSRC\u2008gave the green light on Thursday, which Xinhua suggested, illustrates the regulator's resolve to overhaul the IPO approval system. \u201cFoxconn will become the first overseas-funded company to go public in the A-share market,\u201d the news agency noted, adding that FII got through the review procedure in record time.</p><p>FII\u2008will be a monster by domestic standards too. The Foxconn unit is planning to raise up to Rmb28 billion and local brokerages give it a target valuation of more than Rmb640 billion, based on the sector average of 40.9 times trailing earnings.</p><p>Some remain unimpressed. \u201cIs our stock market so bad that we have to let an indebted Taiwanese company in,\u201d asked an internet user. That jaundiced view may reflect something else: that tech stocks only account for 9.5% of the CSI 300 compared to nearly 50% of the Taiwan Weighted Index, although CICC said in a recent research report that new economy stocks will account for more than 50% of the A-share market within the next five years.</p><p>Retail investors have yet to learn how to play tech hardware companies with their thin margins and volatile cycles, as their Taiwanese counterparts have done. That too will almost certainly change over the coming decade.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKINCH-37655</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKINCH2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-JTK1-DXD6-34N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472880</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1356\"/><timeReceived>6:52 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ChinTell Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Week in China</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 9, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>400</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet &amp;

Los principales puntos de contraste en dichos auges del Nasdaq pueden resumirse as\u00ed: i) aceleraciones en la productividad (Laboral y Total de Factores) durante 1995-2005 vs. los consabidos colapsos evidenciados durante la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada; e ii) incrementos en la inversi\u00f3n empresarial en los 90s vs. colapsos durante los 2010s.     M\u00faltiples hip\u00f3tesis se han planteado para explicar esas divergencias, destac\u00e1ndose temas demogr\u00e1ficos, frontera tecnol\u00f3gica y estancamiento secular. Una arista complementaria clave es la referente a las tendencias de mayor concentraci\u00f3n empresarial y menor contestabilidad de mercados, seg\u00fan lo esgrimido recientemente por Phillipon (The Great Reversal, 2019). Ello ha venido ocurriendo en m\u00faltiples sectores de la econom\u00eda americana durante las dos \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas (salud, financiero, aeron\u00e1utico), pero es crucial en el llamado Big-Tech (FAANGs+: originalmente Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix y Google, a\u00f1adi\u00e9ndose despu\u00e9s Microsoft). All\u00ed juegan la r\u00e1pida escalabilidad basada en la inexorable econom\u00eda de redes y el capital intangible (ver Galloway, 2017).    Es cierto que el Big-Tech est\u00e1 en la frontera de la innovaci\u00f3n-productividad, \u00bfpero ser\u00e1 que merecen ese enfoque regulatorio light que se ha adoptado vs. las \u201cFirmas Estrellas\u201d de d\u00e9cadas pasadas (FEPs)? Sobre esto, el an\u00e1lisis de Phillipon da importantes luces.    El cuadro adjunto muestra c\u00f3mo, hist\u00f3ricamente, las cinco firmas m\u00e1s grandes (cap. burs\u00e1til) han explicado cerca de 10% del valor del S&amp;P 500 (promedios decenales). Lo primero que salta a la vista es que, contrario a la percepci\u00f3n de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica, el Big-Tech s\u00ed tiene equivalentes hist\u00f3ricos en su tama\u00f1o. Las FEPs de los 50s (27% de la cap. burs\u00e1til) y 60s (20%) igualan las participaciones del Megacap de tecnol\u00f3gicas actual. Y en este \u00faltimo caso, esas FAANGs solo han logrado los picos de 22% del S&amp;P500 durante la desbordada valorizaci\u00f3n de 2020, rondando su participaci\u00f3n promedio quinquenal niveles cercanos a 12-15%. Tampoco se observan diferencias sustanciales en las rentabilidades ANTES de impuestos, evidenci\u00e1ndose m\u00e1rgenes en el rango 20-25% tanto para FAANGs como para sus antecesores FEPs.    La caracter\u00edstica diferencial de las FAANGs (vs. FEPs) radica en sus bajos niveles de encadenamientos con el grueso de la econom\u00eda, tanto en los frentes de compras de bienes-servicios intermedios (incluyendo salarios) como en su contrataci\u00f3n de mano de obra (porcentaje de poblaci\u00f3n ocupada).    N\u00f3tese c\u00f3mo las FEPs de los 60-80s (participaci\u00f3n de 2,5% en ocupados y compras de bienes intermedios de 3% del PIB) superan en \u00f3rdenes de magnitud las cifras del Big-Tech (0,5% de ocupados y compras-intermedias del 1,8% del PIB). En particular, la participaci\u00f3n en la contrataci\u00f3n de Facebook (0,016% de ocupados), Apple (0,08%) y Google-Alphabet (0,052%) palidecen ante lo observado en AT&amp;T (1%), GM (1%) e IBM (0,4%) durante d\u00e9cadas pasadas. La excepci\u00f3n de las FAANGs en esa baja participaci\u00f3n laboral es Amazon (0,4%), explicando, adicionalmente, el grueso de la inversi\u00f3n en el sector de comercio-minorista durante el \u00faltimo quinquenio.    Ese bajo nivel de interconexi\u00f3n explica parte de la baja difusi\u00f3n de la productividad de las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas al grueso de la econom\u00eda. En d\u00e9cadas pasadas, mejoras en la cadena productiva de GM (por ejemplo) r\u00e1pidamente se difund\u00edan v\u00eda sus m\u00faltiples vasos comunicantes. Hoy en d\u00eda, a pesar de la euforia de la Inteligencia Artificial, C\u00f3mputo-almacenamiento en la Nube y el (trasnochado) Blockchain\u2026 poco se ha logrado su masificaci\u00f3n y distribuci\u00f3n hacia la operatividad econ\u00f3mica-general.    Lo anterior no quiere decir que dicha difusi\u00f3n no se acelere a futuro (como parece estar ocurriendo en pandemia). Pero todas estas cifras arrojan luces en el debate entre los \u201ctecno-pesimistas\u201d (Gordon-Northwestern) y optimistas (Brynjolfsson-McAffe de MIT). Las Firmas estrellas de hoy merecen el respeto y admiraci\u00f3n dadas a las antiguas FEPs. Lo que no luce prudente es el actual rezago regulatorio en libre competencia-medidas antimonopolio.    Todo ello con los consabidos agravantes de erosi\u00f3n democr\u00e1tica generado por las redes sociales (ver Ferguson, 2017). No solo por los fen\u00f3menos de polarizaci\u00f3n, cajas de resonancia-manipulaci\u00f3n, sino por la propia incapacidad de discusi\u00f3n social de los temas complejos-espinosos de reformas estructurales requeridas en varios frentes (incluida la esfera econ\u00f3mica).    Ahora bien, mal har\u00edamos en caer en el extremo de la ret\u00f3rica de excesiva \u201cvictimizaci\u00f3n\u201d de los clientes porque los algoritmos hacen las redes sociales muy atractivas (siempre est\u00e1 la opci\u00f3n de no \u201cestar pegado\u201d a Twitter-Facebook). Es el mismo cuento de la gente con sobrepeso\u2026 culpando a McDonald\u2019s por hacer hamburguesas \u201cmuy ricas\u201d (\u00bfadictivas las llaman?). Se requiere tambi\u00e9n mayor responsabilidad INDIVIDUAL en la forma de consumir\u2026 Tanto hamburguesas\u2026 como el c\u00e1ncer de las redes sociales.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Boeing's costs to produce the airplane were also $1.7 billion higher in the second quarter because of changes in production rates, the company said.</p><p>The financial toll of the 737 Max grounding is starting to add up for Boeing, which has frozen sales of its flagship jetliner since regulators issued a global grounding of the plane in March. Airlines have canceled thousands of flights late into the fall of this year - incurring losses of hundreds of millions of dollars - while a timeline for the jet's return remains uncertain.</p><p>Boeing said Thursday it is basing its financial projections on the assumption regulators will approve safety fixes to the 737 Max and clear the planes for commercial travel early in the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p>Boeing is expected to report second-quarter revenue of $20.4 billion when it reports earnings on July 24. The company said it will discuss the financial impact of the 737 Max grounding on a conference call with analysts that day.</p><p>- Douglas MacMillan</p><p>          INTERNATIONAL FINANCE          G-7: Digital currency needs tight regulation          </p><p>Digital currencies such as Facebook's planned Libra raise serious concerns and must be regulated as tightly as possible to ensure they do not upset the world's financial system, Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers said Thursday.</p><p>Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire of France, which holds the rotating presidency of the G-7 top world economies, told a news conference the group opposed the idea that companies could have the same privilege as nations in creating means of payment - but without the control and obligations that go with it.</p><p>\"We cannot accept private companies issuing their own currencies without democratic control,\" Le Maire said.</p><p>In a summary of the informal G-7 talks in Chantilly, north of Paris, the French presidency said the ministers and governors had agreed that \"stablecoins and other various new products being developed, including projects with global and potentially systemic footprint such as Libra, raise serious regulatory and systemic concerns.\"</p><p>Governments are starting to worry that big tech companies are encroaching on areas that belong to governments, such as issuing currency. Facebook's June 18 announcement of Libra heralded an effort to expand beyond social networking and move into e-commerce and global payments.</p><p>- Reuters</p><p>          TECHNOLOGY          E.U. fines Qualcomm for 'predatory' pricing          </p><p>In yet another European Union move against a U.S. tech company, the bloc's antitrust chief on Thursday fined chipmaker Qualcomm $271 million, accusing it of \"predatory pricing\" to drive a competitor out of the market.</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, the E.U. antitrust commissioner, said Qualcomm was abusing its market dominance in 3G baseband chipsets. She said it sold them below the cost of production to force start-up Icera out of the market almost a decade ago.</p><p>Qualcomm is facing antitrust battles on multiple fronts. In the United States, a federal judge ruled in May that Qualcomm unlawfully squeezed out cellphone chip rivals and charged excessive royalties to manufacturers such as Apple.</p><p>The Justice Department, however, has backed Qualcomm because of national security concerns; it sees Qualcomm as instrumental to a politically sensitive \"race to 5G,\" a mobile network upgrade that could mean big technological changes.</p><p>The E.U. had already fined Qualcomm $1.23 billion last year after concluding it bribed Apple to stifle competition.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>          ALSO IN BUSINESS           </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> on Thursday reported fourth-quarter revenue that beat analysts' estimates, powered by growth in its flagship cloud product Azure.

Boeing's costs to produce the airplane were also $1.7 billion higher in the second quarter because of changes in production rates, the company said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The financial toll of the 737 Max grounding is starting to add up for Boeing, which has frozen sales of its flagship jetliner since regulators issued a global grounding of the plane in March. Airlines have canceled thousands of flights late into the fall of this year - incurring losses of hundreds of millions of dollars - while a timeline for the jet's return remains uncertain.</p><p>Boeing said Thursday it is basing its financial projections on the assumption regulators will approve safety fixes to the 737 Max and clear the planes for commercial travel early in the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p>Boeing is expected to report second-quarter revenue of $20.4 billion when it reports earnings on July 24. The company said it will discuss the financial impact of the 737 Max grounding on a conference call with analysts that day.</p><p>- Douglas MacMillan</p><h>INTERNATIONAL FINANCE</h><h>G-7: Digital currency needs tight regulation</h><p>Digital currencies such as Facebook's planned Libra raise serious concerns and must be regulated as tightly as possible to ensure they do not upset the world's financial system, Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers said Thursday.</p><p>Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire of France, which holds the rotating presidency of the G-7 top world economies, told a news conference the group opposed the idea that companies could have the same privilege as nations in creating means of payment - but without the control and obligations that go with it.</p><p>\"We cannot accept private companies issuing their own currencies without democratic control,\" Le Maire said.</p><p>In a summary of the informal G-7 talks in Chantilly, north of Paris, the French presidency said the ministers and governors had agreed that \"stablecoins and other various new products being developed, including projects with global and potentially systemic footprint such as Libra, raise serious regulatory and systemic concerns.\"</p><p>Governments are starting to worry that big tech companies are encroaching on areas that belong to governments, such as issuing currency. Facebook's June 18 announcement of Libra heralded an effort to expand beyond social networking and move into e-commerce and global payments.</p><p>- Reuters</p><h>TECHNOLOGY</h><h>E.U. fines Qualcomm for 'predatory' pricing</h><p>In yet another European Union move against a U.S. tech company, the bloc's antitrust chief on Thursday fined chipmaker Qualcomm $271 million, accusing it of \"predatory pricing\" to drive a competitor out of the market.</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, the E.U. antitrust commissioner, said Qualcomm was abusing its market dominance in 3G baseband chipsets. She said it sold them below the cost of production to force start-up Icera out of the market almost a decade ago.</p><p>Qualcomm is facing antitrust battles on multiple fronts. In the United States, a federal judge ruled in May that Qualcomm unlawfully squeezed out cellphone chip rivals and charged excessive royalties to manufacturers such as Apple.</p><p>The Justice Department, however, has backed Qualcomm because of national security concerns; it sees Qualcomm as instrumental to a politically sensitive \"race to 5G,\" a mobile network upgrade that could mean big technological changes.</p><p>The E.U. had already fined Qualcomm $1.23 billion last year after concluding it bribed Apple to stifle competition.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><h>ALSO IN BUSINESS </h><p>Microsoft  on Thursday reported fourth-quarter revenue that beat analysts' estimates, powered by growth in its flagship cloud product Azure.

Instead of the boost to GDP growth this year of about 1.3 percentage points estimated by the Congressional Budget Office and other forecasters, they wrote, \"the true boost is more likely to be less than 1 percentage point,\" with some studies pointing to as little as zero.

It also accused Motel 6 of providing such information without requiring authorities to get a warrant or without having a reasonable suspicion that crimes were being committed.</p><p>Details of the tentative deal haven't been publicly released. Lawyers said they need until mid-August to turn in the paperwork.  </p><p>The lawsuit was filed in federal court on behalf of eight unnamed Latinos who stayed at two Motel 6 locations in the city during June and July 2017. All but one of the eight were arrested. ICE agents visited some of the guests at their motel rooms a day after they showed passports, driver's licenses or identification cards issued by the Mexican government to Motel 6 employees, the lawsuit said.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>          AUTO SAFETY          U.S. court approves VW settlement          </p><p>A federal appeals court on Monday approved a $10 billion settlement between Volkswagen and car owners caught up in the company's emissions scandal.</p><p>The deal delivered \"tangible, substantial benefits,\" and the federal judge who approved it did more than enough to ensure it was fair, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled unanimously.</p><p>Volkswagen agreed to spend up to $10 billion compensating owners of roughly 475,000 Volkswagens and Audi vehicles with 2-liter diesel engines. </p><p>The automaker acknowledged that the cars were programmed to cheat on emissions tests. Under the terms of the deal, VW agreed to buy back the cars or fix them and to pay each owner thousands of dollars.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>          ECONOMY          Consumer borrowing increased in May          </p><p> Americans increased their borrowing in May at the fastest pace in 18 months, boosted by a jump in credit card borrowing.</p><p>Consumer debt rose $24.5 billion in May after an increase of $10 billion in April, the Federal Reserve reported Monday. It was the biggest monthly increase since a rise of $24.8 billion in November 2016.</p><p>Consumer borrowing is closely monitored for clues about the willingness of consumers to borrow more to support their spending. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of U.S. economic activity.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>          Also in Business          </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The economic boost</emphasis> from President Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut will probably fall well short of analysts' \"overly optimistic\" expectations, two economists wrote Monday in the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank's latest Economic Letter. Instead of the boost to GDP growth this year of about 1.3 percentage points estimated by the Congressional Budget Office and other forecasters, they wrote, \"the true boost is more likely to be less than 1 percentage point,\" with some studies pointing to as little as zero. That is because fiscal stimulus has a large effect on economic activity when unemployment is high and personal finances are constrained, but it delivers much less of a jolt when the economy is strong, wrote Tim Mahedy and Daniel Wilson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet and Apple</emphasis> are facing questions about their privacy practices from four top Republican members of Congress. In letters released Monday, the chairmen of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and three of its subcommittees asked Alphabet chief executive Larry Page about reports that Google's parent \"permitted third parties to access the contents of users' emails.\" The lawmakers asked Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has touted his company's commitment to user privacy, about the safety of device data, particularly through its app store.

The immediate source of the water was Creve Coeur Lake, which had overtopped its banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Howard Bend Levee District and the city of Maryland Heights pumped some of the water across the road and it was reopened by about 2 p.m. Thursday. All lanes of 141 are expected to be open at some point Friday.</p><p>MoDOT said crews will continue to monitor the area for flooding, and if floodwaters rise back onto the road it may need to be closed again.</p><p>JEFFERSON CITY - Pot lobbyist quits lobbying after charges: A Columbia man facing federal drug charges has stopped lobbying Missouri lawmakers, according to records filed with the Missouri Ethics Commission.</p><p>According to the ethics regulator, Eapen Thampy, 35, terminated his state lobbyist registration Sunday.</p><p>Thampy was indicted earlier this month on a felony marijuana distribution conspiracy charge and a felony marijuana possession charge. If convicted, he would face 10 years to life in prison for the distribution charge alone.</p><p>Thampy has had a presence in the Missouri Capitol since at least 2015, the year he first registered as a lobbyist. Since then, he has donated $26,507 to Missouri candidates and causes, according to MEC records.</p><p>He pleaded not guilty to the drug charges June 6 in U.S. District Court and was later released from the Cole County Jail after federal prosecutors withdrew their motion to hold him without bail.</p><p>Shawn Lee, Thampy's attorney, declined to comment on Thampy terminating his lobbyist registration.</p><p>Before Sunday, Thampy lobbied for 14 entities, some of which are players in Missouri's burgeoning cannabis industry. Among his clients were the Missouri Hemp Association, Mo Cann Pharma LLC, Pharm Labs LLC and Students for Cannabis Agriculture.</p><p>JEFFERSON CITY - Special Olympics assesses tornado-related losses: The leader of Special Olympics Missouri says engineers have determined that the organization's main campus was not a total loss after it was damaged by a tornado in May.</p><p>The center in Jefferson City sustained significant damage when a tornado hit the city May 22. The $18.5 million campus was damaged just six months after it had been dedicated.</p><p>Damages to the campus include a roof being ripped off a gymnasium and several windows and doors being blown out.</p><p>The damage prompted the organization to cancel its summer games. Special Olympics employees have moved into temporary office space.</p><p>ELLISVILLE - City honors Blues: To honor the Blues for winning the Stanley Cup, Mayor Mike Roemerman and the City Council unanimously approved legislation Wednesday to temporarily rename the city's Bluebird Park as \"Blue(s)bird Park\" effective immediately and for as long as the Blues retain the Cup.</p><p>The park was developed in 1974 and is at 225 Kiefer Creek Road.</p><p>With half the council dressed in Blues jerseys or T-shirts for the meeting, Roemerman said Councilman Dan Duffy had suggested the name change for the park.</p><p>Duffy read the entire resolution language, which states that Ellisville \"is home to thousands of dedicated fans\" of the Blues who have been supporting the team \"throughout their storied 52-year journey to the Stanley Cup.\"</p><p>It says city residents and visitors to the park are encouraged to \"celebrate, honor and recognize\" the team, and those opportunities will start with the city's July 4 celebration at the park, Roemerman said.</p><p>Festivities for that event will start at 6 p.m. and will include a salute to the Blues, as well as a band concert, children's activities, a display of photo contest entries and refreshments for sale, with fireworks taking place at dusk.</p><p>\"There will not be much of an expense to the city for the name change since we'll be putting up a temporary signage over the existing sign and we have our own banner maker,\" Roemerman said.</p><p>JEFFERSON CITY - Hawley targets tech companies: U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley is doubling down on efforts to rein in big tech companies by proposing that Facebook, Twitter and other online behemoths be required to prove they're not using political bias to filter content.</p><p>The bill follows repeated assertions by President Donald Trump and other Republicans that big tech companies have an anti-conservative bias. Tech companies have denied any bias, either left or right.</p><p>The freshman lawmaker's legislation, introduced Wednesday, would require companies to prove to the Federal Trade Commission that their algorithms and other ways of filtering content are not biased against a particular party or candidate. If companies don't do that, they would face losing protections in current law that shield them from being sued over user posts on their sites.</p><p>Internet lobbying groups swiftly slammed Hawley's bill, arguing it would discourage websites from self-filtering content, including hate speech or extremism, by opening them up to lawsuits from blocked or censored users.</p><p>KANSAS CITY - Two more indicted in duck boat disaster: A federal grand jury has indicted two more employees of a company that owns a duck boat that sank on a Missouri lake last summer, killing 17 people.</p><p>Curtis Lanham, the general manager at Ride the Ducks Branson, and Charles Baltzell, the operations supervisor, were charged with misconduct and neglect in a 47-count indictment that was unsealed and made public Thursday following their initial court appearances, the U.S. attorney's office said.</p><p>The boat's captain, Kenneth Scott McKee, was indicted previously on charges alleging that he failed to properly assess the weather and failed to tell passengers to don flotation devices as conditions worsened. The amphibious vehicle he was piloting sank at Table Rock Lake near Branson after it entered the lake despite severe weather warnings. Fourteen people survived.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Colter Peterson, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cpeterson@post-dispatch.comPeggy\">cpeterson@post-dispatch.comPeggy</email> Hargarten reacts as Sweden nearly scores against the U.S. team on Thursday at a watch party for the Women's World Cup at Amsterdam Tavern in St. Louis.\u00a0The Americans dominated in a 2-0 victory over Sweden, the rivals that stunned them in the last Olympics.
