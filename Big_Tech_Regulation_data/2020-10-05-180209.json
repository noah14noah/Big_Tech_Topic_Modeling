The latter has come to be referred to as insurtech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class. At the same time, many lower- and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony, as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. </p><p>In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. Kenya's mobile payment system is in fact on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, insurtech is used to describe \"new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". Compared to financial technology (fintech), insurtech is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"insurtech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premium in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as a percentage of premium to GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia had rates of less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. The most potential for growth is in Africa, with a rate of 3.06%, and Latin America and the Caribbean, with 2.96%.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premium were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was at a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is almost universal in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. In sub-Saharan Africa there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access an account with a financial institution in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>With regard to the insurtech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017, following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 63 insurtech deals were announced, with a total value of $1.59bn, while funding volume also increased by 155% relative to the same quarter in 2017. The capital invested in insurtech start-ups and scale-ups reached a total of $3.18bn worldwide in 2018, according to data from the FinTech Global database. The bulk of insurtech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% of deals made in that year. While leading emerging markets China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets' share of global insurtech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new and sometimes disruptive market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those sales made between 2012 and 2017 involved the participation of an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>Even if much of insurtech investment has thus far been complementary rather than disruptive to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes called the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another China-based technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its fast-expanding insurance sector, it is unsurprising that China is the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth. It has also been a key driver of overall growth in recent years when many advanced economies saw relatively lacklustre performances. In 2017 Chinese insurance premium adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. According to Swiss Re, \"China will remain the biggest contributor to global insurance market growth among emerging markets for the next decade at least\". However, given the extent of convergence with the insurance penetration rate in more advanced economies by 2030, the increase in Chinese premium is expected to moderate thereafter, with other emerging markets driving the expansion of global premium.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of insurtech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term.\" By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the most-developed insurance markets in South-east Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. Meanwhile, lower rates can be found in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that insurtech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets.</p><h>Latin America &amp; the Carribean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets, with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest-income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate, at 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premium at $83.3bn. Mexico, the region's second-largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, which suggests that it has significant potential for premium growth.</p><p>Insurtech adoption varies across the region. A notable success in Brazil is Bidu, established in 2011, which has been a pioneer in selling online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. It has built a strong market position by combining savvy use of technology with offline consultations to maximise the quality of the consumer experience.</p><p>By comparison, adoption is somewhat slower in Mexico though market players anticipate that uptake will increase. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems - such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals - will have a dual effect: it will provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire value chain.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter region, some countries have started tapping into insurtech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts firms have with their customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sectors remains very much in its infancy, although a certain degree of progress has been made. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premium, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\".</p><p>Some Algerian insurers also use social media to contact clients, but digitisation efforts in the country are still relatively unsophisticated and insurance penetration is much lower compared to the rest of the region. For example, in 2017 the penetration rate in Algeria was 0.7%, compared to 3.5% in Morocco.</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% while Kenya ranked third at 2.6%, demonstrating that there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premium in West and East Africa. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example. \"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, a local insurance company, added that premium are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping to increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>With the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 - one of Africa's lowest - Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. WhatsApp Insure, for example, has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending data, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links, via messaging. Eventually, artificial intelligence will be employed to handle enquires and claims, and build better risk profiles. Independent firms will continue to drive insurtech in Nigeria and more established incumbents will have no choice than to join the prevailing trend.\"</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that insurtech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets.</p><p>As has happened in the case of mobile banking, the scope for technology-driven, catch-up growth is particularly significant in markets where mobile phone penetration greatly exceeds that of financial services. While technology might drive premium growth in emerging markets, this trend is likely to lag in less-developed markets. Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the potential benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also be crucial. Lastly, it will be important for products to be tailored to specific markets to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-954248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXH-NS21-DXYV-718B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as insurtech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class. At the same time, many lower- and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony, as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. </p><p>In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. Kenya's mobile payment system is in fact on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, insurtech is used to describe \"new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". Compared to financial technology (fintech), insurtech is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"insurtech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premium in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as a percentage of premium to GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia had rates of less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. The most potential for growth is in Africa, with a rate of 3.06%, and Latin America and the Caribbean, with 2.96%.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premium were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was at a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is almost universal in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. In sub-Saharan Africa there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access an account with a financial institution in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>With regard to the insurtech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017, following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 63 insurtech deals were announced, with a total value of $1.59bn, while funding volume also increased by 155% relative to the same quarter in 2017. The capital invested in insurtech start-ups and scale-ups reached a total of $3.18bn worldwide in 2018, according to data from the FinTech Global database. The bulk of insurtech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% of deals made in that year. While leading emerging markets China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets' share of global insurtech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new and sometimes disruptive market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those sales made between 2012 and 2017 involved the participation of an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>Even if much of insurtech investment has thus far been complementary rather than disruptive to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes called the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another China-based technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its fast-expanding insurance sector, it is unsurprising that China is the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth. It has also been a key driver of overall growth in recent years when many advanced economies saw relatively lacklustre performances. In 2017 Chinese insurance premium adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. According to Swiss Re, \"China will remain the biggest contributor to global insurance market growth among emerging markets for the next decade at least\". However, given the extent of convergence with the insurance penetration rate in more advanced economies by 2030, the increase in Chinese premium is expected to moderate thereafter, with other emerging markets driving the expansion of global premium.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of insurtech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term.\" By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the most-developed insurance markets in South-east Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. Meanwhile, lower rates can be found in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that insurtech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets.</p><h>Latin America &amp; The Caribbean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets, with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest-income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate, at 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premium at $83.3bn. Mexico, the region's second-largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, which suggests that it has significant potential for premium growth.</p><p>Insurtech adoption varies across the region. A notable success in Brazil is Bidu, established in 2011, which has been a pioneer in selling online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. It has built a strong market position by combining savvy use of technology with offline consultations to maximise the quality of the consumer experience.</p><p>By comparison, adoption is somewhat slower in Mexico though market players anticipate that uptake will increase. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems - such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals - will have a dual effect: it will provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire value chain.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter region, some countries have started tapping into insurtech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts firms have with their customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sectors remains very much in its infancy, although a certain degree of progress has been made. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premium, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\".</p><p>Some Algerian insurers also use social media to contact clients, but digitisation efforts in the country are still relatively unsophisticated and insurance penetration is much lower compared to the rest of the region. For example, in 2017 the penetration rate in Algeria was 0.7%, compared to 3.5% in Morocco.</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% while Kenya ranked third at 2.6%, demonstrating that there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premium in West and East Africa. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example. \"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, a local insurance company, added that premium are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping to increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>With the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 - one of Africa's lowest - Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. WhatsApp Insure, for example, has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending data, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links, via messaging. Eventually, artificial intelligence will be employed to handle enquires and claims, and build better risk profiles. Independent firms will continue to drive insurtech in Nigeria and more established incumbents will have no choice than to join the prevailing trend.\"</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that insurtech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets.</p><p>As has happened in the case of mobile banking, the scope for technology-driven, catch-up growth is particularly significant in markets where mobile phone penetration greatly exceeds that of financial services. While technology might drive premium growth in emerging markets, this trend is likely to lag in less-developed markets. Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also be essential. Lastly, it will be important for products to be tailored to specific markets in order to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-949647</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS6-C4W1-JBGS-H2X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as insurtech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class. At the same time, many lower- and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony, as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. </p><p>In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. Kenya's mobile payment system is in fact on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, insurtech is used to describe \"new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". Compared to financial technology (fintech), insurtech is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"insurtech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premium in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as a percentage of premium to GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia had rates of less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. The most potential for growth is in Africa, with a rate of 3.06%, and Latin America and the Caribbean, with 2.96%.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premium were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was at a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is almost universal in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. In sub-Saharan Africa there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access an account with a financial institution in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>With regard to the insurtech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017, following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 63 insurtech deals were announced, with a total value of $1.59bn, while funding volume also increased by 155% relative to the same quarter in 2017. The capital invested in insurtech start-ups and scale-ups reached a total of $3.18bn worldwide in 2018, according to data from the FinTech Global database. The bulk of insurtech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% of deals made in that year. While leading emerging markets China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets' share of global insurtech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new and sometimes disruptive market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those sales made between 2012 and 2017 involved the participation of an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>Even if much of insurtech investment has thus far been complementary rather than disruptive to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes called the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another China-based technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its fast-expanding insurance sector, it is unsurprising that China is the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth. It has also been a key driver of overall growth in recent years when many advanced economies saw relatively lacklustre performances. In 2017 Chinese insurance premium adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. According to Swiss Re, \"China will remain the biggest contributor to global insurance market growth among emerging markets for the next decade at least\". However, given the extent of convergence with the insurance penetration rate in more advanced economies by 2030, the increase in Chinese premium is expected to moderate thereafter, with other emerging markets driving the expansion of global premium.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of insurtech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term.\" By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the most-developed insurance markets in South-east Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. Meanwhile, lower rates can be found in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that insurtech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets.</p><h>Latin America &amp; The Carribean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets, with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest-income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate, at 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premium at $83.3bn. Mexico, the region's second-largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, which suggests that it has significant potential for premium growth.</p><p>Insurtech adoption varies across the region. A notable success in Brazil is Bidu, established in 2011, which has been a pioneer in selling online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. It has built a strong market position by combining savvy use of technology with offline consultations to maximise the quality of the consumer experience.</p><p>By comparison, adoption is somewhat slower in Mexico though market players anticipate that uptake will increase. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems - such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals - will have a dual effect: it will provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire value chain.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter region, some countries have started tapping into insurtech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts firms have with their customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sectors remains very much in its infancy, although a certain degree of progress has been made. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premium, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\".</p><p>Some Algerian insurers also use social media to contact clients, but digitisation efforts in the country are still relatively unsophisticated and insurance penetration is much lower compared to the rest of the region. For example, in 2017 the penetration rate in Algeria was 0.7%, compared to 3.5% in Morocco.</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% while Kenya ranked third at 2.6%, demonstrating that there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premium in West and East Africa. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example. \"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, a local insurance company, added that premium are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping to increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>With the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 - one of Africa's lowest - Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. WhatsApp Insure, for example, has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending data, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links, via messaging. Eventually, artificial intelligence will be employed to handle enquires and claims, and build better risk profiles. Independent firms will continue to drive insurtech in Nigeria and more established incumbents will have no choice than to join the prevailing trend.\"</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that insurtech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets.</p><p>As has happened in the case of mobile banking, the scope for technology-driven, catch-up growth is particularly significant in markets where mobile phone penetration greatly exceeds that of financial services. While technology might drive premium growth in emerging markets, this trend is likely to lag in less-developed markets. Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the potential benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also be essential. Lastly, it will be important for products to be tailored to specific markets to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-949265</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS6-C4W1-JBGS-H2T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as insurtech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class. At the same time, many lower- and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony, as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. </p><p>In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. Kenya's mobile payment system is in fact on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech\u00a0</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, insurtech is used to describe \"new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". Compared to financial technology (fintech), insurtech is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"insurtech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premium in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as a percentage of premium to GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia had rates of less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. The most potential for growth is in Africa, with a rate of 3.06%, and Latin America and the Caribbean, with 2.96%.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premium were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was at a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is almost universal in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. In sub-Saharan Africa there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access an account with a financial institution in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>With regard to the insurtech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017, following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 63 insurtech deals were announced, with a total value of $1.59bn, while funding volume also increased by 155% relative to the same quarter in 2017. The capital invested in insurtech start-ups and scale-ups reached a total of $3.2bn worldwide in 2018, according to data from the FinTech Global database. The bulk of insurtech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% of deals made in that year. While leading emerging markets China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets' share of global insurtech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new and sometimes disruptive market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those sales made between 2012 and 2017 involved the participation of an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>Even if much of insurtech investment has thus far been complementary rather than disruptive to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes called the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another China-based technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its fast-expanding insurance sector, it is unsurprising that China is the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth. It has also been a key driver of overall growth in recent years when many advanced economies saw relatively lacklustre performances. In 2017 Chinese insurance premium adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. According to Swiss Re, \"China will remain the biggest contributor to global insurance market growth among emerging markets for the next decade at least\". However, given the extent of convergence with the insurance penetration rate in more advanced economies by 2030, the increase in Chinese premium is expected to moderate thereafter, with other emerging markets driving the expansion of global premium.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of insurtech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term.\" By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the most-developed insurance markets in South-east Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. Meanwhile, lower rates can be found in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that insurtech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets.</p><h>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets, with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest-income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate, at 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premium at $83.3bn. Mexico, the region's second-largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, which suggests that it has significant potential for premium growth.</p><p>Insurtech adoption varies across the region. A notable success in Brazil is Bidu, established in 2011, which has been a pioneer in selling online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. It has built a strong market position by combining savvy use of technology with offline consultations to maximise the quality of the consumer experience.</p><p>By comparison, adoption is somewhat slower in Mexico though market players anticipate that uptake will increase. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems - such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals - will have a dual effect: it will provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire value chain.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter region, some countries have started tapping into insurtech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts firms have with their customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sectors remains very much in its infancy, although a certain degree of progress has been made. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premium, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\".</p><p>Some Algerian insurers also use social media to contact clients, but digitisation efforts in the country are still relatively unsophisticated and insurance penetration is much lower compared to the rest of the region. For example, in 2017 the penetration rate in Algeria was 0.7%, compared to 3.5% in Morocco.</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% while Kenya ranked third at 2.6%, demonstrating that there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premium in West and East Africa. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example. \"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, a local insurance company, added that premium are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping to increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>With the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 - one of Africa's lowest - Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. WhatsApp Insure, for example, has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending data, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links, via messaging. Eventually, artificial intelligence will be employed to handle enquires and claims, and build better risk profiles. Independent firms will continue to drive insurtech in Nigeria and more established incumbents will have no choice than to join the prevailing trend.\"</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that insurtech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets.</p><p>As has happened in the case of mobile banking, the scope for technology-driven, catch-up growth is particularly significant in markets where mobile phone penetration greatly exceeds that of financial services. While technology might drive premium growth in emerging markets, this trend is likely to lag in less-developed markets. Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the potential benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also be essential. Lastly, it will be important for products to be tailored to specific markets to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-956519</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXH-NS21-DXYV-71R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as insurtech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class. At the same time, many lower- and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony, as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. </p><p>In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. Kenya's mobile payment system is in fact on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, insurtech is used to describe \"new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". Compared to financial technology (fintech), insurtech is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"insurtech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premium in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as a percentage of premium to GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia had rates of less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. The most potential for growth is in Africa, with a rate of 3.06%, and Latin America and the Caribbean, with 2.96%.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premium were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was at a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is almost universal in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. In sub-Saharan Africa there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access an account with a financial institution in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>With regard to the insurtech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017, following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 63 insurtech deals were announced, with a total value of $1.59bn, while funding volume also increased by 155% relative to the same quarter in 2017. The capital invested in insurtech start-ups and scale-ups reached a total of $3.18bn worldwide in 2018, according to data from the FinTech Global database. The bulk of insurtech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% of deals made in that year. While leading emerging markets China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets' share of global insurtech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new and sometimes disruptive market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those sales made between 2012 and 2017 involved the participation of an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>Even if much of insurtech investment has thus far been complementary rather than disruptive to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes called the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another China-based technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its fast-expanding insurance sector, it is unsurprising that China is the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth. It has also been a key driver of overall growth in recent years when many advanced economies saw relatively lacklustre performances. In 2017 Chinese insurance premium adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. According to Swiss Re, \"China will remain the biggest contributor to global insurance market growth among emerging markets for the next decade at least\". However, given the extent of convergence with the insurance penetration rate in more advanced economies by 2030, the increase in Chinese premium is expected to moderate thereafter, with other emerging markets driving the expansion of global premium.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of insurtech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term.\" By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the most-developed insurance markets in South-east Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. Meanwhile, lower rates can be found in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that insurtech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets.</p><h>Latin America &amp; The Caribbean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets, with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest-income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate, at 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premium at $83.3bn. Mexico, the region's second-largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, which suggests that it has significant potential for premium growth.</p><p>Insurtech adoption varies across the region. A notable success in Brazil is Bidu, established in 2011, which has been a pioneer in selling online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. It has built a strong market position by combining savvy use of technology with offline consultations to maximise the quality of the consumer experience.</p><p>By comparison, adoption is somewhat slower in Mexico though market players anticipate that uptake will increase. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems - such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals - will have a dual effect: it will provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire value chain.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter region, some countries have started tapping into insurtech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts firms have with their customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sectors remains very much in its infancy, although a certain degree of progress has been made. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premium, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\".</p><p>Some Algerian insurers also use social media to contact clients, but digitisation efforts in the country are still relatively unsophisticated and insurance penetration is much lower compared to the rest of the region. For example, in 2017 the penetration rate in Algeria was 0.7%, compared to 3.5% in Morocco.</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% while Kenya ranked third at 2.6%, demonstrating that there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premium in West and East Africa. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example. \"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, a local insurance company, added that premium are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping to increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>With the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 - one of Africa's lowest - Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. WhatsApp Insure, for example, has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending data, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links, via messaging. Eventually, artificial intelligence will be employed to handle enquires and claims, and build better risk profiles. Independent firms will continue to drive insurtech in Nigeria and more established incumbents will have no choice than to join the prevailing trend.\"</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that insurtech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets.</p><p>As has happened in the case of mobile banking, the scope for technology-driven, catch-up growth is particularly significant in markets where mobile phone penetration greatly exceeds that of financial services. While technology might drive premium growth in emerging markets, this trend is likely to lag in less-developed markets. Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the potential benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also be essential. Lastly, it will be crucial for products to be tailored to specific markets to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-954539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXH-NS21-DXYV-71BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as insurtech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class. At the same time, many lower- and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony, as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. </p><p>In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. Kenya's mobile payment system is in fact on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, insurtech is used to describe \"new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". Compared to financial technology (fintech), insurtech is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"insurtech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premium in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as a percentage of premium to GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia had rates of less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. The most potential for growth is in Africa, with a rate of 3.06%, and Latin America and the Caribbean, with 2.96%.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premium were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was at a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is almost universal in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. In sub-Saharan Africa there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access an account with a financial institution in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>With regard to the insurtech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017, following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 63 insurtech deals were announced, with a total value of $1.59bn, while funding volume also increased by 155% relative to the same quarter in 2017. The capital invested in insurtech start-ups and scale-ups reached a total of $3.18bn worldwide in 2018, according to data from the FinTech Global database. The bulk of insurtech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% of deals made in that year. While leading emerging markets China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets' share of global insurtech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new and sometimes disruptive market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those sales made between 2012 and 2017 involved the participation of an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>Even if much of insurtech investment has thus far been complementary rather than disruptive to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes called the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another China-based technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its fast-expanding insurance sector, it is unsurprising that China is the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth. It has also been a key driver of overall growth in recent years when many advanced economies saw relatively lacklustre performances. In 2017 Chinese insurance premium adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. According to Swiss Re, \"China will remain the biggest contributor to global insurance market growth among emerging markets for the next decade at least\". However, given the extent of convergence with the insurance penetration rate in more advanced economies by 2030, the increase in Chinese premium is expected to moderate thereafter, with other emerging markets driving the expansion of global premium.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of insurtech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term.\" By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the most-developed insurance markets in South-east Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. Meanwhile, lower rates can be found in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that insurtech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets.</p><h>Latin America &amp; The Caribbean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets, with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest-income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate, at 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premium at $83.3bn. Mexico, the region's second-largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, which suggests that it has significant potential for premium growth.</p><p>Insurtech adoption varies across the region. A notable success in Brazil is Bidu, established in 2011, which has been a pioneer in selling online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. It has built a strong market position by combining savvy use of technology with offline consultations to maximise the quality of the consumer experience.</p><p>By comparison, adoption is somewhat slower in Mexico though market players anticipate that uptake will increase. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems - such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals - will have a dual effect: it will provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire value chain.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter region, some countries have started tapping into insurtech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts firms have with their customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sectors remains very much in its infancy, although a certain degree of progress has been made. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premium, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\".</p><p>Some Algerian insurers also use social media to contact clients, but digitisation efforts in the country are still relatively unsophisticated and insurance penetration is much lower compared to the rest of the region. For example, in 2017 the penetration rate in Algeria was 0.7%, compared to 3.5% in Morocco.</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% while Kenya ranked third at 2.6%, demonstrating that there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premium in West and East Africa. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example. \"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, a local insurance company, added that premium are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping to increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>With the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 - one of Africa's lowest - Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. WhatsApp Insure, for example, has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending data, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links, via messaging. Eventually, artificial intelligence will be employed to handle enquires and claims, and build better risk profiles. Independent firms will continue to drive insurtech in Nigeria and more established incumbents will have no choice than to join the prevailing trend.\"</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that insurtech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets.</p><p>As has happened in the case of mobile banking, the scope for technology-driven, catch-up growth is particularly significant in markets where mobile phone penetration greatly exceeds that of financial services. While technology might drive premium growth in emerging markets, this trend is likely to lag in less-developed markets. Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the potential benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also be essential. Lastly, it will be important for products to be tailored to specific markets to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-952018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBK-C5H1-DXYV-71B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as insurtech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class.</p><p>At the same time, many lower- and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony, as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. Kenya's mobile payment system is in fact on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech\u00a0</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, insurtech is used to describe \"new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". Compared to financial technology (fintech), insurtech is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"insurtech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration\u00a0</h><p>The share of insurance premium in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to figures published in June 2019 by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, Europe and North America had the highest insurance penetration rates in 2018, measured as a percentage of premium to GDP, with 7.6% and 7.2% of GDP, respectively. Asia Pacific - including both advanced and emerging economies - came third with 6.8%. While Taiwan (20.9%), Hong Kong (18.2%), South Korea (11.2%), Japan (8.9%) and Singapore (7.8%) recorded rates above those seen in North America and Europe, about half of the countries in Asia Pacific had rates below 5% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. The most potential for growth is in Africa, with a rate of 3%, and Latin America and the Caribbean, with 2.8%.</p><h>Premium Growth\u00a0</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2018 premium were flat in Europe, but grew 2.6% in North America. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia Pacific registered 2.2%, but differed markedly between its sub-regions. Advanced Asia Pacific economies grew only by 1.1%, while emerging Asia Pacific markets grew 3.1%. Meanwhile, premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean contracted 1.7%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.9%, dragged down by the 0.2% performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, although the Nigerian premium market expanded 6.4%, driven by a recovery in services and industry growth.</p><h>Mobile Internet\u00a0</h><p>Mobile broadband penetration is high in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to figures from the global telecoms industry association GSMA Intelligence, the average number of broadband mobile phone connections per 100 people stood at 103 in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2018. This was followed by North America with 80, Latin America and the Caribbean with 78, MENA (74), Asia Pacific (71) and sub-Saharan Africa (38). A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access an account with a financial institution in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><h>Key Figures\u00a0</h><p>With regard to the insurtech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017, following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 63 insurtech deals were announced, with a total value of $1.59bn, while funding volume also increased by 155% relative to the same quarter in 2017. The capital invested in insurtech start-ups and scale-ups reached a total of $3.18bn worldwide in 2018, according to data from the FinTech Global database. The bulk of insurtech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% of deals made in that year. While leading emerging markets China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets' share of global insurtech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new and sometimes disruptive market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those sales made between 2012 and 2017 involved the participation of an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech\u00a0</h><p>Even if much of insurtech investment has thus far been complementary rather than disruptive to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes called the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another China-based technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia\u00a0</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its fast-expanding insurance sector, it is unsurprising that China is second only to the US in terms of the volume of total premiums, with an 11.1% share of the global market in 2018. Nevertheless, the growth of Chinese insurance premium has moderated, falling to 1.8% in 2018, down from 16.2% in the previous year, to reach a 4.2% share of GDP.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of insurtech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term.\" By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the most-developed insurance markets in South-east Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2018. Meanwhile, lower rates can be found in Malaysia (4.8%), Vietnam (2.4%), Indonesia (2%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that insurtech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets.</p><h>Latin America &amp; The Caribbean\u00a0</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets, with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest-income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate, at 4.6% of GDP in 2018. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 3.9%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premium at $72.8bn.</p><p>Mexico, the region's second-largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, which suggests that it has significant potential for premium growth. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems - such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals - will have a dual effect: it will provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire value chain.</p><p>A notable success in Brazil is Bidu - established in 2011 - which has pioneered the selling of online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. It has built a strong market position by combining a specialised use of technology with offline consultations to maximise the quality of the consumer experience.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa\u00a0</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter region, some countries have started tapping into insurtech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts firms have with their customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sectors remains in its infancy, although some progress has been made. For example, in 2018 the penetration rate in Algeria was 0.7%, compared to 3.9% in Morocco. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premium, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\".</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa\u00a0</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 12.9% of GDP in 2018, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.3% while Zimbabwe ranked third at 3.9%, followed by Kenya with 2.4% demonstrating that there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premium in the region. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example. \"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, a local insurance company, added that premium are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping to increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>With the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2018 - one of Africa's lowest - Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. WhatsApp Insure, for example, has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending data, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links, via messaging. Eventually, artificial intelligence will be employed to handle enquires and claims, and build better risk profiles. Independent firms will continue to drive insurtech in Nigeria and more established incumbents will have no choice than to join the prevailing trend.\"</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that insurtech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets. The scope for technology-driven, catch-up growth is particularly significant in markets where mobile phone penetration greatly exceeds that of financial services. While technology might drive premium growth in emerging markets, this trend is likely to lag in less-developed markets. Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the potential benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also prove to be essential. Lastly, it will be important for firms to tailor products to specific markets in order to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-951299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBK-C5K1-DXYV-74KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2562\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as insurtech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class. At the same time, many lower- and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony, as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. </p><p>In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. Kenya's mobile payment system is in fact on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, insurtech is used to describe \"new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". Compared to financial technology (fintech), insurtech is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"insurtech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premium in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as a percentage of premium to GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia had rates of less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. The most potential for growth is in Africa, with a rate of 3.06%, and Latin America and the Caribbean, with 2.96%.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premium were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was at a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is almost universal in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. In sub-Saharan Africa there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access an account with a financial institution in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>With regard to the insurtech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017, following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 63 insurtech deals were announced, with a total value of $1.59bn, while funding volume also increased by 155% relative to the same quarter in 2017. The capital invested in insurtech start-ups and scale-ups reached a total of $3.18bn worldwide in 2018, according to data from the FinTech Global database. The bulk of insurtech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% of deals made in that year. While leading emerging markets China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets' share of global insurtech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new and sometimes disruptive market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those sales made between 2012 and 2017 involved the participation of an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>Even if much of insurtech investment has thus far been complementary rather than disruptive to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes called the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another China-based technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its fast-expanding insurance sector, it is unsurprising that China is the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth. It has also been a key driver of overall growth in recent years when many advanced economies saw relatively lacklustre performances. In 2017 Chinese insurance premium adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. According to Swiss Re, \"China will remain the biggest contributor to global insurance market growth among emerging markets for the next decade at least\". However, given the extent of convergence with the insurance penetration rate in more advanced economies by 2030, the increase in Chinese premium is expected to moderate thereafter, with other emerging markets driving the expansion of global premium.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of insurtech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term.\" By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the most-developed insurance markets in South-east Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. Meanwhile, lower rates can be found in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that insurtech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets.</p><h>Latin America &amp; The Caribbean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets, with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest-income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate, at 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premium at $83.3bn. Mexico, the region's second-largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, which suggests that it has significant potential for premium growth.</p><p>Insurtech adoption varies across the region. A notable success in Brazil is Bidu, established in 2011, which has been a pioneer in selling online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. It has built a strong market position by combining savvy use of technology with offline consultations to maximise the quality of the consumer experience.</p><p>By comparison, adoption is somewhat slower in Mexico though market players anticipate that uptake will increase. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems - such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals - will have a dual effect: it will provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire value chain.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter region, some countries have started tapping into insurtech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts firms have with their customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sectors remains very much in its infancy, although a certain degree of progress has been made. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premium, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\".</p><p>Some Algerian insurers also use social media to contact clients, but digitisation efforts in the country are still relatively unsophisticated and insurance penetration is much lower compared to the rest of the region. For example, in 2017 the penetration rate in Algeria was 0.7%, compared to 3.5% in Morocco.</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% while Kenya ranked third at 2.6%, demonstrating that there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premium in West and East Africa. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example. \"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, a local insurance company, added that premium are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping to increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>With the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 - one of Africa's lowest - Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. WhatsApp Insure, for example, has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending data, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links, via messaging. Eventually, artificial intelligence will be employed to handle enquires and claims, and build better risk profiles. Independent firms will continue to drive insurtech in Nigeria and more established incumbents will have no choice than to join the prevailing trend.\"</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that insurtech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets.</p><p>As has happened in the case of mobile banking, the scope for technology-driven, catch-up growth is particularly significant in markets where mobile phone penetration greatly exceeds that of financial services. While technology might drive premium growth in emerging markets, this trend is likely to lag in less-developed markets. Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the potential benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also be essential. Lastly, it will be important for products to be tailored to specific markets to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-950978</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBK-C5K1-DXYV-74H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Traditionally, the health industry lacked transparency, which has resulted in weak brand loyalty,\" he said.<br/>He added that consumers are looking for detailed information about health care services that includes insurance coverage, or whether their plan covers any medications or tests that could ultimately translate into out-of-pocket expenses.<br/>Out-of-pocket health spending is the expenditure that families spend, through direct expenditures, to meet the different requirements of health care, once their food needs have been met. On average, OECD member countries have out-of-pocket health spending of about 20 percent.<br/>\"Rising health care costs and emerging new health risks are driving customers to review health care plans before making a purchase,\" the consultancy said.<br/>Capgemini detailed that, in some countries such as the United States, stricter regulations are beginning to emerge to improve the transparency and quality of insurance, which directly impacts the industry.<br/>In addition, the entry of new players such as the big techs - Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple - forces insurers to strengthen their relationships with customers so as not to be left behind.<br/>In a previous report, of the 10,500 customers consulted in 26 countries, 29.5% of them indicated that they would be willing to buy insurance through some big tech.<br/>New technologies<br/>The report also details that it is very important that the insurance industry continues to rely on new technologies, as these have changed the behaviour and consumption of policyholders, so their demands and needs change.<br/>In this regard, Capgemini said that customers now want value-added products, i.e. more personalized, as well as facilitating contact with them through digital platforms or portable devices such as mobile devices.<br/>Trends for health insurance in 2020<br/>\u2022 Greater transparency to strengthen customer confidence<br/>\u2022 Value-added products<br/>\u2022 Using chatbots<br/>\u2022 Use of portable devices and digital platforms<br/>\u2022 Predictive analysis to develop risk profiles<br/>\u2022 Exchange of information within the industry<br/>\u2022 Automation for claims processing<br/>[email protected]<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10376601</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0X-71K1-DY1R-B2GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0008ZIE</classCode><className>CAPGEMINI SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as InsurTech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class. At the same time, many lower and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. </p><p>In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. In fact, Kenya's mobile payment system is on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>InsurTech</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, InsurTech is used to describe \"the new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". InsurTech, as compared to financial technology (fintech), is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"InsurTech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premiums in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as premiums as a percentage of GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia have rates less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa hold the most potential for catch-up growth, with penetration rates of 3.06% and 2.96%, respectively.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premiums were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is almost universal in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. Even in sub-Saharan Africa, there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access a financial institution account in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone and smartphone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>As for the InsurTech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017 following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the first half of 2018 there were $1.3bn worth of InsurTech deals, putting the year in a good position to top the annual record of $2.7bn in 2015. Despite growth in emerging markets, the bulk of InsurTech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% that year.</p><p>While leading emerging markets, such as China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets share of global InsurTech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new, sometimes disruptive, market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those made between 2012 and 2017 involved an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>Even if much of InsurTech investment has thus far been complementary, rather than disruptive, to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes labelled as the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another Chinese technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its even faster expanding insurance sector, it is hardly surprising that China is not only the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth, but has been a key driver of overall global premium growth in recent years in light of a relatively lacklustre performance in many advanced economies. In 2017 Chinese insurance premiums adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. According to Swiss Re, \"China will remain the biggest contributor to global insurance market growth among emerging markets for the next decade at least\". However, given the extent of convergence with the insurance penetration rate in more advanced economies by 2030, the increase in Chinese premiums is expected to moderate thereafter, with other emerging markets taking up the mantle to drive the expansion of global premiums.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of InsurTech's impact varies. Thailand is one of the more developed insurance markets in South-east Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. This compares favourably to rates in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that InsurTech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets.</p><h>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate at 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premiums at $83.3bn. Mexico, the region's second largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, suggesting it has significant catch-up potential.</p><p>Adoption is somewhat slower in Mexico, however, though market players expect uptake to increase. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals will have a dual effect: to provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and to boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire insurance value chain.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter, some countries are tapping into InsurTech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts that they have with customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sector is very much in its infancy, though it has broken some ground. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premiums, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\". Some Algerian insurers also use social media to contact clients, but digitisation efforts in the country are still relatively unsophisticated and insurance penetration is much lower compared to the rest of the region. For example, the penetration rate in Algeria in 2017 was 0.7% compared to 3.5% in Morocco.</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, while Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% and Kenya third at 2.6%. However, there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premiums in West and East Africa. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example.</p><p>\"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, a local insurance company, added that premiums are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas. Premiums are already advertised, sold, and collected by telecoms companies,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>With the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017, one of Africa's lowest, Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. WhatsApp Insure has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending messages, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links,\" he said.</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that InsurTech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets. As has been the case with mobile banking, in markets where mobile phone penetration greatly exceeds that of financial services, the scope for technology-driven, catch-up growth is particularly large. While technology may drive premium growth in emerging markets, this trend is likely to lag behind in some less-developed markets. Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the potential benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also be essential. Finally, it will be important for products to become tailored to the needs of specific markets to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-948561</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS6-C4W1-JBGS-H2PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as InsurTech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class. At the same time, many lower and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. </p><p>In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. In fact, Kenya's mobile payment system is on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, InsurTech is used to describe \"the new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". InsurTech, as compared to financial technology (fintech), is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"InsurTech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premiums in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as premiums as a percentage of GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia have rates less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa hold the most potential for catch-up growth, with penetration rates of 3.06% and 2.96%, respectively.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premiums were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is almost universal in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. Even in sub-Saharan Africa, there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access a financial institution account in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>As for the InsurTech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017, following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the first half of 2018 there were $1.3bn worth of InsurTech deals, putting the year in a good position to top the annual record of $2.7bn in 2015. The bulk of InsurTech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% that year. While leading emerging markets, such as China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets share of global InsurTech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new, sometimes disruptive, market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those made between 2012 and 2017 involved an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>Even if much of InsurTech investment has thus far been complementary, rather than disruptive, to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes labelled as the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another Chinese technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by US-based marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its even faster expanding insurance sector, it is hardly surprising that China is not only the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth, but has been a key driver of overall global premium growth in recent years in light of a relatively lacklustre performance in many advanced economies. In 2017 Chinese insurance premiums adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. However, given the extent of convergence with the insurance penetration rate in more advanced economies by 2030, the increase in Chinese premiums is expected to moderate thereafter, with other emerging markets taking up the mantle to drive the expansion of global premiums.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of InsurTech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term\". By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the more developed insurance markets in Southeast Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. This compares favourably to rates in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that InsurTech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets such as the Philippines.</p><h>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets with penetration rates that are comparable to advanced economies. As the highest income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate at some 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premiums at around $83.3bn. Meanwhile, Mexico, which is the region's second largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, suggesting it has significant catch-up potential.</p><p>InsurTech adoption varies across the region. A notable success in Brazil is Bidu, established in 2011, which has been a pioneer in selling online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. It has built a strong market position by combining savvy use of technology with offline consultations to maximise the quality of the consumer experience.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter, some countries are tapping into InsurTech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts that they have with customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sector is in its infancy, though it has broken some ground. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premiums, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\".</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, while Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% and Kenya third at 2.6%. However, there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premiums in West and East Africa. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example. \"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" With Africa's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017, Nigeria has the most potential for catch-up premium growth. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-947493</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS6-C4W1-JBGS-H2GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2259\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

It would serve to catalyze the entire process of technological and digital transformation that is necessary in our market, \"analyzes Miguel Mamede, account manager of the baseline. </p><p><br/> That is why Miguel Mamede considered that the announcement that Lemonade is preparing to enter the European market would be \"a breath of fresh air. We do not know if it comes to Portugal, but the prizes can be a barrier to entry.\" <br/> \"Insurtechs are welcome to the market, but we do not see Lemonade-type insurtechs appearing in Europe. I believe one problem is European regulation, such as Solvency II or distribution policy, which is much heavier and has higher than the United States, \"said Jos\u00e9 Galamba de Oliveira, president of the Portuguese Association of Insurance Companies. <br/> It is also necessary to take into account \"the capital requirements that are a barrier\", added Jos\u00e9 Galamba de Oliveira, which helps to explain the fact that almost all the insurtechs appearing in Europe approach certain points in the value chain where they develop ideas very innovative. <br/> On the other hand, Nuno Lu\u00eds Sapateiro, associate coordinator of PLMJ Insurance, says that one of the things that appeals to him in the single market \"is the issue of not needing a passport and having a directive base that unifies legislation, but regrets to please this process of standardization, when I look at the distribution directive I do not find the word telematics, for example \". He adds that \"an American insurer does not have to wait for this whole evolution, that someone initiates a directive, to take steps forward. We have the RGPD and when they talk about wearable I soon remember the RGPD.\" <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Optics of cooperation</emphasis><br/> \"What has been interesting is that the more traditional insurance industry or legacy or incumbents looks at these insurtechs in a cooperative perspective, it is a way of bringing innovation into the home, and for insurtechs it is interesting because they soon acquire a market or a critical mass that would be hardest for them to achieve, \"says Jos\u00e9 Galamba de Oliveira. <br/> In Europe many of the insurtechs are making cooperation agreements, which even go through acquisitions and end up acting as hubs of the insurance industry. In Portugal there are already some experiences and there are insurance companies that have specific programs to identify these insurtechs and even to participate in the capital, attracting them into their own value chain. <br/> In turn, Gaston Taveira, CEO of i2S, stated that the great innovation of insurtechs happened \"in the relationship with the customer, not in the issue of risk management\", as happened with Lemonade with peer behavior. But as the manager pointed out, Lemonade and other companies make the front end a lot, but they re-insure 60% or 70% of the risks, so insurers are not out of the way, even through their extensive experience in risk management, diversification of risk. <br/> \"It places more emphasis on the role of some brokers or mediators than on solid insurers. I do not think insurtechs respond to this, they are essentially complementary to insurers if they are smart and knowuse them. \" <br/> Big Techs are the real threat <br/>Amazon entered the capital of an insurer in India, Apple announced the entry into financial services. The role of big techs can be menacing, but it can also play a transformative role. <br/> \"The big techs are the great threat of the insurance sector, because it has a great financial capacity, information about the clients that they themselves do not have,\" says Jos\u00e9 Galamba de Oliveira. In addition, \"they have an experience in the distribution and ability to reach consumers that the insurance industry does not have, even through the mediation channel, that in theory would be the channel that best knows the customers.\" <br/>Amazon entered the capital of an insurer in India and is \"an experience that is being monitored a lot\". But Jos\u00e9 Galamba de Oliveira believes that the Big Techs have been delayed in entering the insurance market because of \"their complexity. It is more complicated than payments, and because of business models, with risk analysis and underwriting , and by the great regulatory weight \". <br/> But the Big Techs \"have deep pockets, even more than the insurers themselves,\" as Gast\u00e3o Taveira says, and so will enter into this business. That is why the industry must be aware of this threat. In some cases it may be an opportunity for large international insurers to partner with these Big Techs, maintaining the product factory and delivering the distribution. <br/> But the Big Tech issue has also led Jos\u00e9 Galamba de Oliveira to talk about data processing ethics, \"which may be an opportunity for the insurance industry to differentiate itself from the end consumers, from the customers, because insurers treat information from a ethical, neat way, and Big Techs are not known for such, \"as the various cases that have affected Facebook have shown. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-6586033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVV-37X1-F03R-W03K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Seguros</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as InsurTech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. At the same time, many lower and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates. In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. In fact, Kenya's mobile payment system is on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech</h><p>According to the OECD, InsurTech is used to describe \"the new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". InsurTech, as compared to financial technology (fintech), is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"InsurTech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needsbased products digitally\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premiums in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as premiums as a percentage of GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia have rates less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa hold the most potential for catch-up growth, with penetration rates of 3.06% and 2.96%, respectively.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premiums were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. Even in sub-Saharan Africa, there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access a financial institution account in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>As for the InsurTech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017 following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the first half of 2018 there were $1.3bn worth of InsurTech deals, putting the year in a good position to top the annual record of $2.7bn in 2015. The bulk of InsurTech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% that year. While leading emerging markets, such as China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets share of global InsurTech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new, sometimes disruptive, market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those made between 2012 and 2017 involved an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>]Even if much of InsurTech investment has thus far been complementary, rather than disruptive, to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes labelled as the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another Chinese technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by US-based marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its even faster expanding insurance sector, it is hardly surprising that China is the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth. In 2017 Chinese insurance premiums adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. According to Swiss Re, \"China will remain the biggest contributor to global insurance market growth among emerging markets for the next decade at least\".</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of InsurTech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term\". By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the more developed insurance markets in Southeast Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. This compares favourably to rates in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that InsurTech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets such as the Philippines.</p><h>Latin America &amp; The Caribbean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate at 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premiums at $83.3bn. Mexico, the region's second largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, suggesting it has significant catch-up potential.</p><p>InsurTech adoption varies across the region. A notable success in Brazil is Bidu, established in 2011, which has been a pioneer in selling online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. Adoption is somewhat slower in Mexico, however, though market players expect uptake to increase. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals will have a dual effect: to provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and to boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire value chain.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter, some countries are tapping into InsurTech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts that they have with customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sector is very much in its infancy. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premiums, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\". Some Algerian insurers also use social media to contact clients, but digitisation efforts in the country are still relatively unsophisticated and insurance penetration is much lower compared to the rest of the region. For example, the penetration rate in Algeria in 2017 was 0.7% compared to 3.5% in Morocco.</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, while Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% and Kenya third at 2.6%. However, there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premiums in Ghana. \"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, an insurance company, added that premiums are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas. Premiums are already advertised, sold, and collected by telecoms companies,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead, with the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. \"WhatsApp Insure\", for example, has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending messages, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links,\" he said. \"Independent firms will continue to drive InsurTech in Nigeria and the more established incumbents will have no choice than to join the prevailing trend.\" On increasing insurance penetration, he noted that \"the key to expanding outside the major cities is to localise content and communication while riding on established telecoms and mobile money infrastructure\".</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that InsurTech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets.</p><p>Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the potential benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also be essential. Finally, it will be important for products to become tailored to specific markets to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-944946</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS6-C4W1-JBGS-H1SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The latter has come to be referred to as InsurTech, a potentially disruptive trend that heralds both threats to and opportunities for incumbents and newcomers alike. While technological solutions are being applied along the length of the insurance supply chain in advanced markets, their focus in emerging markets has primarily been on driving premium growth. Stronger growth in emerging and developing economies since the turn of the century has given rise to a swelling middle class. At the same time, many lower and some middle-income countries have managed to largely skip the mass rollout of fixed-line telephony as the prevalence of low-cost mobile telephony has seen a surge in mobile phone penetration rates not too dissimilar to those in advanced economies. </p><p>In turn, this has facilitated financial inclusion, allowing tens of millions to access formal financial services for the first time. Kenya's mobile money system, M-Pesa, is a notable example, blazing a trail for mobile banking in developing economies. In fact, Kenya's mobile payment system is on par with, or even ahead of, those in many advanced economies. Over time, the sophistication and availability of digital financial services has greatly expanded, from e-payments to microcredits and, more recently, insurance products.</p><h>Insurtech</h><p>According to a report titled \"Technology and innovation in the insurance sector\" published in 2017 by the OECD, InsurTech is used to describe \"the new technologies with the potential to bring innovation to the insurance sector and impact the regulatory practices of insurance markets\". InsurTech, as compared to financial technology (fintech), is more often related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to businesses. Sector participants sometimes use the term more broadly to encompass the application of digital technology to all stages of the insurance supply chain. In its insurance market outlook for 2018-19, global insurer Munich Re noted that \"InsurTech start-ups benefit from the achievements of fintech companies, as new financial technologies also allow insurers' product ranges to be expanded, alternative sales channels to be created and additional groups of clients to be reached\". This is highlighted as being particularly relevant in \"underdeveloped insurance markets by offering simple, innovative and needs-based products digitally, and thereby developing new markets\". Concrete examples cited in the Munich Re article include micro-insurance for health and crop insurance, which can be contracted and managed via mobile phone.</p><h>Penetration</h><p>The share of insurance premiums in GDP is closely and positively correlated with GDP per capita, and varies significantly across regions. According to the \"World insurance in 2017: solid, but mature life markets weigh on growth\" report by Sigma, Swiss Re's research and analysis arm, North America and Europe had the highest insurance penetration rates that year, measured as premiums as a percentage of GDP, with 7.1% and 6.5% of GDP, respectively. Asia, which includes the Middle East, and Oceania tied in third place with 5.6%. While Taiwan (21.3%), Hong Kong (17.9%), South Korea (11.6%), Japan (8.6%) and Singapore (8.2%) recorded rates above those seen in North America, about half of the countries in Asia have rates less than 3% of GDP, with large, populous economies such as Pakistan and Bangladesh registering rates under 1%. Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa hold the most potential for catch-up growth, with penetration rates of 3.06% and 2.96%, respectively.</p><h>Premium Growth</h><p>The pattern in premium growth, however, is somewhat different, reflecting both stronger growth in emerging markets and the catch-up potential represented by relatively low penetration rates. In 2017 premiums were flat in North America, and contracted in Europe and Oceania by 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, premium growth in Asia registered 5.7%, but differed markedly between its sub-segments. Advanced Asian economies contracted by 1.1%, while emerging Asian markets and the Middle East and Central Asia region grew by 14.7% and 5%, respectively. Premium growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was a modest 0.1%, reflecting muted economic activity across the region, particularly in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Similarly, premium growth in Africa was weak, at 0.5%, dragged down by the performance of South Africa, which dominates the continent's insurance market, and Nigeria, which experienced an economic blowback from weak oil prices.</p><h>Mobile Phones</h><p>Mobile phone penetration is almost universal in advanced countries, and rapidly catching up in emerging and developing economies. According to the World Bank, in 2017 there were more than 115 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in North America, Europe, and the East Asia and Pacific region, while there were more than 100 in the Middle East and North Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. Even in sub-Saharan Africa, there were more than 70 mobile phone users per 100 people.</p><p>A similar pattern can be found in the use of mobile banking services, albeit at much lower levels. According to the World Bank's 2017 Global Findex database, the share of the adult population that used a mobile phone or the internet to access a financial institution account in the past year was 68% in North America, 36% in Europe and Central Asia, 32% in the East Asia and Pacific region, 12% in the Middle East and North Africa region, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 8% in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not surveyed specifically, it could be expected that the penetration of digital insurance products would be an order of magnitude smaller across all regions. Moreover, the extent of mobile phone penetration relative to that of the use of mobile banking underlines the potential for growth in the coming years. For bancassurers in particular, this provides significant opportunities to cross-sell insurance products, while for pure insurers there is potential for joint ventures with banks and technology - notably e-payment - companies.</p><h>Key Figures</h><p>As for the InsurTech segment itself, CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, estimated that total global investment reached $2.3bn in 2017 following a compound annual growth rate of 45% since 2012. In the first half of 2018 there were $1.3bn worth of InsurTech deals, putting the year in a good position to top the annual record of $2.7bn in 2015. The bulk of InsurTech deals since 2013 have been made in developed markets, with the US alone accounting for 58% that year. While leading emerging markets, such as China and India only recorded shares of 5% and 4%, respectively, they are beginning to make their presence felt. Emerging markets share of global InsurTech deals is increasing, with China and India accounting for 13% and 10%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Israel accounted for 6% and South Africa for 4%. While new, sometimes disruptive, market entrants are starting to account for a larger share of sales, 83% of those made between 2012 and 2017 involved an established insurer or reinsurer as a sole or joint investor.</p><h>Big Tech</h><p>Even if much of InsurTech investment has thus far been complementary, rather than disruptive, to incumbent insurers, large technology companies are entering the market, particularly in economies such as China. For example, Alibaba, sometimes labelled as the Chinese Amazon, teamed up with Tencent, another Chinese technology giant, and insurer Ping An Insurance to launch China's first wholly online insurer, Zhong An, in 2013. Over time, it is likely that the biggest global tech firms will look to enter insurance markets in other advanced and emerging economies, either through their own well-established brands or through joint ventures with established insurers. An August 2018 survey by US-based marketing research company JD Power found that one in five US consumers would be willing to purchase home insurance from Amazon or Google.</p><h>Emerging Asia</h><p>Given the size and growth rate of its economy and its even faster expanding insurance sector, it is hardly surprising that China is not only the top emerging market contributor to global premium growth, but has been a key driver of overall global premium growth in recent years in light of a relatively lacklustre performance in many advanced economies. In 2017 Chinese insurance premiums adjusted for inflation grew by 16.2% to reach a 4.1% share of GDP. According to Swiss Re, \"China will remain the biggest contributor to global insurance market growth among emerging markets for the next decade at least\". However, given the extent of convergence with the insurance penetration rate in more advanced economies by 2030, the increase in Chinese premiums is expected to moderate thereafter, with other emerging markets taking up the mantle to drive the expansion of global premiums.</p><p>Beyond China, the extent of InsurTech's impact varies. Kheedhej Anansiriprapha, executive director at Thai General Insurance Association, told OBG that \"online insurance sales account for a relatively small proportion of the market, with only motor and travel products being purchased online. For life and non-life, agents and bancassurance will be the vehicles for distribution in the short to medium term\". By contrast, Mark Lwin, president and CEO of AIG Philippines Insurance, explained that some segments have already seen a big impact. \"Technology has had a broad and deep impact on retail and high-volume insurance segments, such as life and consumer insurance,\" he told OBG. \"However, the commercial segment in the Philippines lags globally and has not undertaken major investments in ICT or digitally-enabled products and capabilities.\" Thailand is one of the more developed insurance markets in Southeast Asia, with a penetration rate of 5.3% of GDP in 2017. This compares favourably to rates in Malaysia (4.8%), Indonesia (2.4%), Vietnam (2.1%) and the Philippines (1.8%), suggesting that InsurTech could play an even stronger role in driving catch-up premium growth in less-saturated markets such as the Philippines.</p><h>Latin America &amp; The Caribbean</h><p>Some Caribbean islands - notably the Caymans, the Bahamas and Jamaica - already have reasonably deep insurance markets with penetration rates comparable to advanced economies. As the highest income Latin American economy, it is unsurprising that Chile also had the highest insurance penetration rate at 4.9% of GDP in 2017. With the largest economy in the region by far and a penetration rate of 4.1%, Brazil accounted for the biggest source of premiums at $83.3bn. Mexico, the region's second largest economy, had a penetration rate of 2.2%, suggesting it has significant catch-up potential.</p><p>InsurTech adoption varies across the region. A notable success in Brazil is Bidu, established in 2011, which has been a pioneer in selling online insurance to final consumers, mainly in the non-life segment. It has built a strong market position by combining savvy use of technology with offline consultations to maximise the quality of the consumer experience. Adoption is somewhat slower in Mexico, however, though market players expect uptake to increase. On the expected impact of technology on Mexico's insurance sector, Juan Pablo Murgu\u00eda, CEO of Murgu\u00eda, an insurance and surety bond broker in Mexico, told OBG that the introduction of core business systems such as customer relationship management, data analytics and portals will have a dual effect: to provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for all actors, and to boost transparency and accountability throughout the entire value chain.</p><h>Middle East &amp; North Africa</h><p>Both insurance penetration and digitisation rates vary across the region, registering higher rates on average in the Gulf than in North Africa. In the latter, some countries are tapping into InsurTech to help drive premium growth. Philippe Vial, administrative director-general of La Marocaine Vie, a Morocco-based life insurer and subsidiary of the investment management multinational Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, stated that bancassurance holds a competitive advantage owing to the contacts that they have with customers. \"These contacts constitute an asset in that they provide us with personal information that helps us to better serve our customers,\" Vial told OBG. \"The optimisation of these assets is one of our major priorities in the coming years.\"</p><p>By contrast, the use of technology in the Algerian and Egyptian insurance sector is very much in its infancy, though it has broken some ground. Youcef Benmicia, CEO of Compagnie Alg\u00e9rienne des Assurances, an Algerian non-life insurer, told OBG that the firm has \"introduced e-payments and bank card payments for insurance premiums, SMS notifications of contract expiry and online subscriptions for some types of insurance\". Some Algerian insurers also use social media to contact clients, but digitisation efforts in the country are still relatively unsophisticated and insurance penetration is much lower compared to the rest of the region. For example, the penetration rate in Algeria in 2017 was 0.7% compared to 3.5% in Morocco.</p><h>Sub-Saharan Africa</h><p>South Africa's insurance market is already relatively saturated, with a penetration rate of 13.8% of GDP in 2017, higher than most advanced countries and many other countries in the region, while Namibia ranked second in the region at 7.6% and Kenya third at 2.6%. However, there is considerable scope for tech-driven catch-up growth in premiums in West and East Africa. Market players are confident in the potential of digitisation to drive premium growth in Ghana, for example.</p><p>\"Digitisation is needed to help customers apply advanced payment techniques, such as staggered premium payments,\" Esther Osei-Yeboah, managing director of Imperial General Assurance, told OBG. \"By removing the feeling of a bulk payment, staggered payments will increase uptake of insurance products.\" Bode Oseni, managing director of RegencyNem, a local insurance company, added that premiums are already advertised, sold and collected by telecoms companies in the country. \"Mobile money is already helping increase Ghana's insurance penetration rate, particularly in rural areas. Premiums are already advertised, sold, and collected by telecoms companies,\" Oseni told OBG.</p><p>With the continent's largest population and economy, yet with a penetration rate of 0.3% of GDP in 2017, one of Africa's lowest, Nigeria has perhaps the most striking potential for catch-up premium growth in the years ahead. Adebowale Banjo, general manager of global distributor of insurance products AutoGenius, told OBG that \"WhatsApp coverage has provided a great way to distribute insurance online, using a platform Nigerians already understand and trust. \"WhatsApp Insure\", for example, has been very effective for dealing with enquiries, sending messages, such as vehicle licence information, insurance certificates and e-payment links,\" he said. \"Eventually, artificial intelligence will be employed to handle enquires, claims and build better risk profiles. Independent firms will continue to drive InsurTech in Nigeria and the more established incumbents will have no choice than to join the prevailing trend.\" On increasing insurance penetration, he noted that \"the key to expanding outside the major cities is to localise content and communication while riding on established telecoms and mobile money infrastructure\".</p><h>Road Ahead</h><p>It appears that InsurTech will remain a key driver of premium growth, and therefore rising insurance penetration, in emerging markets for years to come. As the insurance sectors of developing and emerging markets become more sophisticated, it can be expected that digital solutions will filter down through the insurance supply chain, driving operational efficiency and ultimately profitability, as is already being seen in more advanced markets. As has been the case with mobile banking, in markets where mobile phone penetration greatly exceeds that of financial services, the scope for technology-driven, catch-up growth is particularly large. While technology may drive premium growth in emerging markets, this trend is likely to lag behind in some less-developed markets.</p><p>Ultimately, achieving insurance penetration rates comparable to those in advanced economies will require further convergence in terms of macroeconomic development and income levels. Efforts to boost financial literacy and awareness about the potential benefits of insurance products in markets where they have not traditionally had a strong presence will also be essential. Finally, it will be important for products to become tailored to specific markets to help overcome persistent cultural resistance to using formal financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-945980</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS6-C4W1-JBGS-H22P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The move will accelerate Lantiq's smart home gateway and intelligent access networks business. </p><p>It will also help the world's biggest chip maker advance its position in the Internet of Things, or making everyday objects smart and connected. Intelsaid that the move will help its offering in cable residential gateways as well as gateways for digital subscriber lines (DSL) over phone networks, fiber, long-term evolution (LTE), and Internet of Things smart routers. The move could also help Intelbecome more competitive against arch rival Qualcomm, which announced its own smarthome initiative [1]at the 2015 International CES. Big companies like Intel, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom and many others are all jockeying to become the center of digital ecosystems[2] that drive smarthomes and the larger Internet of Things 'By 2018, we expect more than 800 million broadband connected households worldwide,' said Kirk Skaugen, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's Client Computing Group, in a statement. 'Intelhas been a global leader in driving broadband into the home and to connected compute devices. The combination of our cable gateway business with Lantiq's technology and talent can allow global service providers to introduce new home computing experiences and enable consumers to take advantage of a more smart and connected home.' The deal is subject to regulatory approvals. Terms were not disclosed. 'Inteland Lantiq share a common vision about the evolution of the connected home and the intelligent network,' said Dan Artusi, CEO of Munich, Germany-based Lantiq, in a statement. 'Together we can drive the transformation of the broadband customer premises equipment (CPE) as it becomes a smart gateway that connects an increasingly diverse roster of devices and services in the home.' Lantiq's main investor was San Francisco-based Golden Gate Capital. Lantiq said it has over 2,000 patents related to\u00a0broadband communications and offers technologies including xDSL solutions with vectoring and G.Fast; fiber-based technologies such as fiber to the distribution point (FTTdp) and other technologies.

A showdown is on in the US, with security agencies demonizing these privacy-protecting technologies and demanding a \"backdoor\" to them, while tech companies resist this logic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UK Prime Minister David Cameron has argued that there should be \"no form of communication...that we cannot read.\" Meanwhile, there were rumours (now busted) of France banning the widely used ToR (the onion router), which anonymizes users by hiding the original IP address and routing traffic through several points.</p><p>End-to-end encryption became popular after Edward Snowden's leaks about widespread spying by the US National Security Agency. This means that data gets encrypted on one device and decrypted only when it reaches the recipient, making it technically impossible for anyone in the middle to access it. Most big tech companies have tightened their default encryption since. There is a set of new messaging tools, like Signal, CryptoCat and others, which allows users to mutually verify their keys.</p><p>\"People are far more security-aware now -not just about protecting their information from the government, but also hackers and malicious third parties,\" says Raman Jit Singh Chima, global policy director at Access Now, a digital freedom group that successfully petitioned the Obama administration to take a more considered view.</p><p>Intelligence agencies claim that these technologies give terrorists an invisibility cloak. \"But terrorists aren't looking for government-approved platforms to communicate, they'll just find other black market tech,\" says Chinmayi Arun, research director of the Centre for Communication Governance.</p><p>\"In the process, citizens will get worse encryption, journalists won't be able to communicate securely with their sources. Intelligence agencies create this false confrontation between national security and personal security,\" says tech analyst Nikhil Pahwa. He argues that the link between encryption and intelligence failure is a smokescreen; the real problem, as witnessed in the Paris attacks, is that security agencies are unable to sift the signal from the noise despite the data they do have.</p><p>Others, like security consultant Akash Mahajan, argue that forcing tech companies to build a backdoor would create vulnerability -one that could also be used by others for malign ends. \"Encryption is math. Math doesn't care if you're the NSA or Daesh,\" says Mishi Choudhary of the Software Freedom Law Centre.</p><p>\"Terrorism isn't the only fact in the world. These tools are used by businesses everywhere, weakening encryption could make corporate espionage much easier,\" says Mahajan. India has stakes in this global official backlash against encryption. \"Indian banks and companies, the Paytms and Flipkarts, are the first to suffer with weak encryption,\" Choudhary points out.</p><p>India has several laws, ranging from the Indian Telegraph Act to the Information Technology Act, which let central and state governments monitor private communications in the name of security or public safety. Service providers have to agree that they will open their networks to government surveillance; interception and monitoring systems exist across a range of intelligence and tax agencies. There is no judicial oversight, getting metadata is not even seen as interception.</p><p>The core problem is that \"there is no comprehensive data protection law in India, apart from scattered requirements under different statutes,\" says lawyer Shyam Divan.</p><p>The government's draft encryption policy, unveiled in September, was booed off stage because it sought to weaken standards rather than boost them. It had heavy-handed specifications on encryption algorithms, mandatory registration of encryption products, and the retention of unencrypted user information for 90 days.</p><p>Now, as the government reworks its stand on encryption, the question is which way it will respond to the global climate of opinion. \"It should learn from the mistakes of other countries, where overbroad regulation took years to fix. Undermining security standards just leaves everyone vulnerable,\" sums up Chima.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOI-50159364</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOI2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HKR-RGH1-JB3N-T51K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"716\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

A showdown is on in the US, with security agencies demonising these privacy-protecting technologies and demanding a \"backdoor\" to them, while tech companies resist this logic. UK Prime Minister David Cameron has argued that there should be \"no form of communication...that we cannot read\". Meanwhile, there were rumours (now busted) of France banning the widely used ToR (the onion router), which anonymizes users by hiding the original IP address and routing traffic through several points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">End-to-end encryption became popular after Edward Snowden's leaks about widespread spying by the US National Security Agency. This means that data gets encrypted on one device and decrypted only when it reaches the recipient, making it technically impossible for anyone in the middle to access it.Most big tech companies have tightened their default encryption since. There is a set of new messaging tools, like Signal, CryptoCat and others, which allows users to mutually verify their keys.</p><p>\"People are far more security-aware now -not just about protecting their information from the government, but also hackers and malicious third parties,\" says Raman Jit Singh Chima, global policy director at Access Now, a digital freedom group that successfully petitioned the Obama administration to take a more considered view.</p><p>Intelligence agencies claim that these technologies give terrorists an invisibility cloak. \"But terrorists aren't looking for government-approved platforms to communicate, they'll just find other black market tech,\" says Chinmayi Arun, research director of the Centre for Communication Governance. \"In the process, citizens will get worse encryption, journalists won't be able to communicate securely with their sources.\"</p><p>Intelligence agencies create this false confrontation between national security and personal security,\" says tech analyst Nikhil Pahwa. He argues that the link between encryption and intelligence failure is a smokescreen; the real problem, as witnessed in the Paris attacks, is that security agencies are unable to sift the signal from the noise despite the data they do have.</p><p>Others, like security consultant Akash Mahajan, argue that forcing tech companies to build a backdoor would create vulnerability -one that could also be used by others for malign ends. \"Encryption is math. Math doesn't care if you're the NSA or Daesh,\" says Mishi Choudhary of the Software Freedom Law Centre.</p><p>\"Terrorism isn't the only fact in the world. These tools are used by businesses everywhere, weakening encryption could make corporate espionage much easier,\" says Mahajan. India has stakes in this global official backlash against encryption. \"Indian banks and companies, the Paytms and Flipkarts, are the first to suffer with weak encryption,\" Choudhary points out.</p><p>India has several laws, ranging from the Indian Telegraph Act to the Information Technology Act, which let central and state governments monitor private communications in the name of security or public safety. Service providers have to agree that they will open their networks to government surveillance; interception and monitoring systems exist across a range of intelligence and tax agencies. There is no judicial oversight, getting metadata is not even seen as interception.</p><p>The core problem is that \"there is no comprehensive data protection law in India, apart from scattered requirements under different statutes,\" says lawyer Shyam Divan.</p><p>The government's draft encryption policy, unveiled in September, was booed off stage because it sought to weaken standards rather than boost them. It had heavy-handed specifications on encryption algorithms, mandatory registration of encryption products, and the retention of unencrypted user information for 90 days.</p><p>Now, as the government reworks its stand on encryption, the question is which way it will respond to the global climate of opinion. \"It should learn from the mistakes of other countries, where overbroad regulation took years to fix. Undermining security standards just leaves everyone vulnerable,\" sums up Chima.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-50158673</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HKR-RG01-JB3N-T3Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"715\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

On microphone number one. Hi, I'm for the motion and I was just wondering, and the fact that Facebook you were talking about the dreams is made to unleash all those dreams but you're giving the impression that Facebook is a philanthropist's organisation. I ask you how does Facebook make money? What is its business model and surely that gives it away as well? Okay, thanks. Elizabeth, I'll come to you soon, but that first question about how do you split the companies? looked at in a different way Each company would have to be - but let me say... - Can it be done? It can be done. It has been done, by any other number of industries in the past. They fight against data privacy. They fight any kind of less Draconian solution that has been proposed, they fight against. So I fear, frankly, that there will have to be tough regulatory measures like a breakup to actually shift their power. And these firms have bought much of Washington. Tech is the number two lobbying power in Washington. So sadly I fear that the measures will have to be tough to bring these firms to heal. Pinar, can this be done as an expert that last point in competition law? If I could pick up in terms of breaking up the number two lobbyer. So you're admitting there's even a bigger lobbyer than the tech giants. If we are worried about political power we should also be talking about the finance industry, the health industry, the energy industry where we also see giants. We cannot compare the so-called tech giants to the monopolies</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-bfedf99369c2430e843cfe98d4daa391</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJT-V9Y1-DY08-34P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"404\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

Executives previously said the company planned to pursue $6 billion to $8 billion of asset sales in 2019. In May, AT&amp;T CFO John Stephens said the company had already raised about $5 billion of its goal. According to media reports, the four AT&amp;T RSNs could fetch some $1 billion.</p><p>A FOX Sports camera films from the sidelines of a baseball game.Sinclair Broadcast is set to become the largest owner of regionalsports networks in the U.S. after it closes on a portfolio of FOXnetworks.Source: Associated Press</p><p>Sinclair is awaiting the closing of a $9.6 billion deal to purchase 21 former FOX RSNs from Walt Disney Co. The FOX networks went up for sale as a condition of the U.S. Department of Justice approving Disney's purchase of myriad assets from 21st Century Fox Inc. The deal will make Sinclair the top RSN operator in the U.S. NBC Sports Regional Networks will rank second with seven RSNs.</p><p>\"Strategically, it would make sense for [Sinclair] to digest the purchase and get a rhythm going with their new assets,\" said Curt Pires, president of consultancy CAP Sports. The Disney-Sinclair deal still needs to gain DOJ approval. \"Why make that process more difficult right now?\" Pires said.</p><p>Last month, three Democratic presidential hopefuls asked the DOJ and U.S. Federal Communications Commission to take a look at how the pending Sinclair deal could impact network carriage pricing and Sinclair's overall reach given that it would bring together the sports network portfolio with Sinclair's extensive local U.S. broadcast station holdings.</p><p>Sinclair, which did not respond to a request for comment, expects the deal to close in the third quarter.</p><p>Mark Lazarus, chairman of NBCUniversal Broadcast, Cable, Sports and News, previously indicated the company had concerns about the regulatory scrutiny that NBCU might draw with for some potential regional sports network buys.</p><p>At an industry conference in December 2018, Lazarus said that NBCU did not have serious interest in the FOX RSNs in particular because it was unlikely any deals for the assets within Comcast's footprint would pass regulatory muster. The potential for vertical integration of the RSNs in markets where NBC (US) also owns stations and Comcast is a major cable operator has informed the company's strategy, he said.</p><p>The markets served by the AT&amp;T RSNs fall within Comcast's video footprint, and while NBC does not own stations in the AT&amp;T RSN markets, NBCUniversal Media LLC's Telemundo (US) does.</p><p>CAP Sports' Pires said he is not sure NBCU would have interest in AT&amp;T Sports Southwest, given its involvement in the now-defunct CSN Houston, the predecessor to the AT&amp;T's current Houston-based RSN, which was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2014 and later sold to AT&amp;T and DIRECTV.</p><p>NBC declined to comment.</p><p>Another factor likely to influence buyer interest in AT&amp;T's RSNs is that a number of team rights renewals are in the offing, meaning any network buyer would soon be renegotiating what it must pay for programming distribution rights. In discussing the upside of the deal for the FOX RSNs, Sinclair said the portfolio as a whole carries an 11-year weighted average for the expiration of rights deals, giving it a measure of cost certainty.</p><p>Outside of Sinclair and NBCU, media experts said other potential buyers could be found among the parties that had expressed interest in the FOX RSNs to be sold to Sinclair. Among the final bidders for those networks were John Malone's Liberty Media Corp. in conjunction with Major League Baseball Enterprises Inc. and Big 3. Private equity and big tech companies were also reported to be interested, though some were reported to have concerns about the expense of maintaining sports programming rights.</p><p>While tech companies like Amazon could be interested, Lee Berke, president and CEO of media consultancy LHB Sports, Entertainment &amp; Media Inc., said he believes it will take five to 10 years for the streaming market to grow to include wide-scale, OTT streaming packages that would host networks of regional interest.</p><p>Nevertheless, Berke believes there will be interest in the live programming that sports networks deliver. \"The content remains very valuable,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-52814906</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKW-4CK1-JDVW-N25P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Thanks, everyone, for joining. Once again, my name is Tien-tsin Huang; I cover the computer services and IT consulting group at JPMorgan. So next up to bat we have IBM. From IBM we have Steve Mills, he is the -- he runs software and systems as well, to give us an update.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So again, I am going to do fireside chat as a format. We will take questions from the Ask a Question portal. So feel free to ask questions there. And I was asked to remind everyone if you want to tweet about the conference, #TMTBoston, if you care to do that, if not no big deal. I won't be doing that for sure. But anyway, thanks again, Steve, for being here. Steve has been a -- what is it, a 40-plus year vet at IBM?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVE MILLS, EVP, SOFTWARE &amp; SYSTEMS, IBM CORPORATION: 42.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: So you have seen a lot of things happen at IBM. So very lucky to pick his brain a little bit here. But I thought we'd start out with just sort of the obligatory question, Steve, if you wouldn't mind just -- this is a tech conference. Maybe if you could just walk us around the globe here and tell us what you are hearing from CIOs, CTOs, CEOs, etc. What is selling, what is not and just generally how demand is across the globe and then we can dig in deeper from there if that is okay.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>STEVE MILLS: Okay. Well, first of all I would say that the patterns that we see around the world are somewhat more industry specific than geographic. There are differences and the US market I think is a little bit more active and energetic than the European market. Emerging markets still obviously represent strong growth rates albeit not as high as they had once been. More importantly are the similarities you see at the industry level.</p><p>So financial services companies are always a tale of two cities. On one side they are trying to improve operational efficiency, that is where they spend a huge amount of their IT budget in their back-office operations. But everyone is trying to free up money to get into new types of customer service, analytics, obviously have to serve the mobile client. And clearly a lot of money going into various aspects of security, counter fraud, any money laundering, those kinds of spaces.</p><p>Retailers are I think in kind of refresh mode. I think retailers recognize that in order to maintain relevancy they are going to have to do more around leveraging customer relationships, loyalty programs are hot. Ship from store, Amazon has sort of thrown down the gauntlet in certain markets about next day shipping and even same-day shipping. So retailers are rethinking their distribution models using stores not just as walk in but also stores as distribution centers. So there is a lot going on there.</p><p>Healthcare space, you have seen IBM increase our level of investment in healthcare. We are very excited about what we see as a shift that has occurred in the last few years, particularly among healthcare providers where they are looking seriously at information technology investments as now being on a par with the kinds of investments historically they made in hospital equipment.</p><p>IT and information-based healthcare, information-based healthcare delivery is becoming an ever bigger topic out there and that market obviously is moving pretty well at this point in time and moving in that direction.</p><p>I think other industries tend to have their classical cyclical characteristics, manufacturing sort of depends upon what particular cycle you are going through and obviously a lot of that is long-term capital investment and clearly leveraging of technology. But in ways somewhat different than you might see in some of the more, if you will, virtual businesses that are really based upon information technology.</p><p>Internet of Things is a hot topic in the marketplace today. Anybody who is managing or maintaining expensive capital infrastructure is looking for better predictive maintenance, the ability to manage, maintain and ensure the uptime of their equipment, there is real money tied up in that. We see projects that have just extraordinary returns in the IoT space for a relatively modest initial investment being driven entirely by predictive maintenance cycles.</p><p>And so, these are all hot spaces in terms of an industry perspective. I think you turn it on its side and people are spending money on analytics in just about every dimension and domain, analytics, analytics, analytics. Mobile device and digital engagement -- [I think more] the device is a piece of it, but there is a very important part of it related to digital engagement, how do I engage with my customers.</p><p>I think people have this notion in their head that there is an Uber-izing application that they potentially can hunt out for their business that gives them distinct client value and therefore growth opportunities. So that is a hot topic. The whole world is spending a fortune on security. That is probably not going to come to an end.</p><p>The byproduct of this incredible porous telecommunications infrastructure that we have created that allows commerce to exist on a global scale and also that it is ripe for the malicious and ripe for those that want to attack those kinds of scenarios. And so, everybody is spending more and more and more money, if you will, on their defensive measures and posture related to analytics.</p><p>And of course the last thing is, not to leave it out, but cloud. Cloud touches everything; everyone talks about cloud in just about every context one can imagine. It continues to be a somewhat confusing topic insofar as you have to qualify and clarify exactly what aspect of cloud-based deployment and cloud-based services you are looking for in your particular business and your profile.</p><p>I think in general there is a characteristic of move to cloud that spans at one end of the spectrum more human interaction where these things are very popular cloud solutions. And at the other end extreme data intensity and data quantity where the cost of moving data and concerns about privacy and security are clearly having an effect on the rate and pace of adoption.</p><p>But there is no question that we are seeing a pretty big move towards cloud-related services, especially for those things that involve people interacting with people.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Anything to say that is helpful on the vertical side and going through some of the themes? Anything to say or add geographically in terms of what you are seeing?</p><p>STEVE MILLS: Again, I think that China, which obviously carries enormous expectation for the future, I don't think those expectations have diminished in any way. I think how that is going to evolve and come about looking ahead over the next decade is going to be a little bit different than what we've seen over the last couple of decades.</p><p>And obviously China has a very big push on local company participation. We have certainly been moving our business model increasingly towards a partnering model in China. We know that in many market spaces we're going to have to go to market with partners to an even greater degree than we have gone to market with partners in the past. So that is certainly a part of the shift in China.</p><p>But I don't think China is necessarily unique. I mean, you see some of these same issues emerging in Europe, a desire to ensure participation of local companies. Everybody wants to be a part of information technology and where it is going. It is the transforming technology of the last 60 years. It will be in the transforming technology of the next century. And every government sees this as representing opportunity for economic growth.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Okay, so maybe let's shift and talk about more IBM specifically in terms of the investments. I know there is a lot of change given all the big tech waves that you just described. So just maybe talk about where you are placing your bets organically. I know Watson has been something I'm sure we will talk about as well. But also inorganically with Software. So, can you up us understand the difference between the two there, organic versus inorganic investments?</p><p>STEVE MILLS: Well, let's just back up a second. So, and I think we have been pretty clear in our quarterly calls and annual analyst sessions that we have been investing in technologies that represent the faster rate of growth in the industry and therefore bringing about more transformation. So cloud analytics, mobile, social security -- these spaces are among the faster growing for our business.</p><p>We have pegged the 20% on average rate of growth. We have certainly been experiencing that or better in those market spaces. That now represents more than 25% of IBM in 2014. And we clearly would expect that that rate of growth is going to be an ever bigger percentage of the Company.</p><p>That doesn't mean that traditional uses of technology disappear. But where the growth is going to be. And the fact of the matter is how many of those traditional spaces will transform are going to be affected by cloud analytics, mobile, social, security and so on.</p><p>So, as we've seen so many times before, each sort of new wave of technology or technology shift has both the ability to pull the industry in a particular direction, but it also washes back across the rest of what is there.</p><p>And things that remain, and so much of what we have created over the decades in technology still remains, but it is there because it was able to adapt to the changing dynamics of the way people wanted to access and use the technology, not that it just remains sort of in place.</p><p>I think this notion of legacy sometimes is a bit of an illusion insofar as even things that people would deem as legacy actually go through some pretty dramatic changes.</p><p>So we are, as we have been forever at IBM, shifting our Company, shifting the mix, changing the underlying profile of the business and moving towards where we see the value going. We are a Company grounded on invention. And so, we view that there is a profit margin to be had around IP and invention, we are very much geared towards that.</p><p>Because we generate good free cash flow we also buy things. So there is the inorganic side of the model. But the inorganic side has to fit with the organic side. To get a return on that invested capital you have got to be acquiring things that fit with what you have, so good adjacency, good synergy and therefore you get a lift.</p><p>The acquired company, the acquired assets, we could actually get them to grow faster and become bigger because they that fit well with what IBM already has. And we often get synergistic effects going the other way, which is something we acquired now completes a solution, makes it more desirable to the customer and they will buy more of what we currently have.</p><p>So we are sticking with that model, it has worked very well for us. Over the last decade plus, 15 years, we've bought 150 companies. And so, we continue to be acquisitive. But at the end of the day we are going to clearly do more -- at a $6-billion-plus R&amp;D there is more organic development going on than inorganic.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Yes. So, you mentioned IP research, I know IBM research obviously is always leading the way in a lot of new and fun areas and cognitive is one. And we still get a lot of questions around Watson. I know Watson Health is something that has been getting a little bit of airtime with the press.</p><p>Can you just talk about Watson Health and how you plan to monetize that, just the business model there? And can we see something similar come about in other industries?</p><p>STEVE MILLS: So healthcare-related projects, we embarked on those fairly early after we did the Jeopardy game and demonstrated what this technology can do. And Watson is a system, it is a collection of technologies. It was derived from a whole set of research initiatives and product initiatives in IBM.</p><p>And we were looking for a particular pattern, if you will, that brought many technologies together. In context understanding, be able to parse and understand text-based information, surfacing ontology's and relationships, and then putting to work some fairly unique AI capability that IBM had inside in a set of use cases that would make some business sense.</p><p>And so, playing Jeopardy was a [stalking] horse for the research team to get excited about bringing all these things together. But you saw us immediately shift into healthcare examples. As soon as we finished that effort in 2011, played the game, we were quickly into -- and here is how this technology now can be applied, healthcare is an ideal environment to do it.</p><p>Where an inferencing-based model is most effective is where you have massive quantities of data, far more than any human being could ever read and understand, where relationships will vary as a function of the characteristics.</p><p>So we think about healthcare, which we all understand a little bit about. We think about symptomatic information leading to diagnosis, leading to treatment, leading to outcome. And as any physician will tell you, vary the symptoms you vary the diagnosis. Can I see all the patterns as a physician. Why do physicians consult with each other? Well, because no one physician can know everything.</p><p>When you have literally tens of millions of scientific documents being published related to healthcare on an annual basis there is no way to keep up with that, even in your own specialty it is hard to do. So why not use the computer as the basis of assembling all of that data and then go further, let it find patterns, relationships and associations and point you to the possibility of a diagnosis or a treatment that you hadn't seen before because there was no way to actually understand all the data.</p><p>To do the what if -- maybe I should run another test or maybe I shouldn't. Will more testing lead to more information of value or will it just lead to more cost? I think physicians in general want to get it right the first time. And so, we are excited about this technology is ideally suited to the medical challenge.</p><p>We've just done a couple of acquisitions, we've bought a couple companies that have given us the statistical data now on 100 million lives. So that data is important because it provides us with diagnosis, provides us with treatment and outcome information for 100 million human lives.</p><p>That provides a strong statistical base and we are finding that providers that have their own data are willing to share that data with us, particularly when we are showing them patterns in our [100 million] that they weren't seeing in their data. And if we add their data to ours that 100 million goes up. Our notion is, well let's double it in double it and double it again.</p><p>It is not that IBM needs to even own all the data, it is access to the data because the insights are where the value is. That doesn't make us a healthcare provider, it makes us a Company that supports the insight challenge related to figuring out what the right diagnosis and the right treatment is.</p><p>Clearly accuracy is important to all of us, but bringing down cost is also important. And the healthcare industry is ready to make these kinds of moves. So we are quite excited about this. It is an ideal use case for Watson.</p><p>There are other use cases out there. Financial services has shown an interest in using it as a wealth advisory tool. A lot of concerns in financial services about regulatory compliance, legal considerations -- do your wealth advisors follow the patterns associated with the particular risk appetite of the customer and then your recommended steps and actions to be taken around portfolio management.</p><p>The oversight issues, particularly in Europe, are now becoming so severe that having an electronic guide now is becoming an interesting option for businesses. And frankly anything that involves advisory services where you have N number of combinations, as the combinations grow the complexity grows, the computer becomes an unbelievably important tool to try to get it right the first time.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Got you. Yes, I always joke that Watson is going to put equity sell side research out of business because it can answer all our stock questions. But that said, I mean just the business model quickly. I mean, is this more going to be a subscription model thinking about how folks want to tap into the data or use it on a platform basis?</p><p>STEVE MILLS: Well, I mean, certainly there are notions of self-service. You can speak to the system, the system today understands English. We are working on other languages. And obviously you can ask questions, system will provide answers. But the curation of the data, getting the data right is one of the bigger challenges that businesses have.</p><p>Data curation -- for all of the buzz we have on big data and analytics and so on and so forth, for those that deal with this every day they know data curation is probably the number one thing they are going to spend their money on. They are going to spend less money on tooling than they will on curation.</p><p>And then for these complex problem spaces, what is true? When we do a healthcare project we work with the researchers and physicians on patterns, relationships and truths. And the expertise of the physician becomes an important part of getting the system to where the system understands the truth and is able to statistically and probabilistically calculate out what is likely to be true given the arrival of a new piece of data.</p><p>So those kinds of characteristics exist in all of these problem sets. And Watson certainly is well suited to many advisory types of roles. But there are other technology spaces, other use cases that don't necessarily need that kind of [inferencing] capability.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Okay. So maybe let's shift gears and talk about cloud a little bit. I know Amazon was starting to disclose some data there, but I guess my bigger question is, how is IBM set up to beat an AWS or Microsoft or Google you pick your player. What is sort of the differentiation?</p><p>STEVE MILLS: Well, a number of things. We have a set of offerings in our portfolio that frankly reflect what others are doing. So many of -- all the major players are doing some things that are similar to each other. Insofar as we have an Infrastructure-as-a-Service type of environment and literally tens of thousands of companies are hosted on the SoftLayer environment. We expanded that from 13 locations now to more than 40 locations around the world.</p><p>That is important because in so many places in the world people want to keep the data in country. Germany does not want to move their data anywhere, for example, but that is not unique to Germany. And so, having that infrastructure ability is important from that perspective.</p><p>And we do all the same kinds of offerings for storage, networking and compute. We have by-the-hour billing as well as longer-term kinds of contract relationships with customers.</p><p>We have a platform as a service environment for application development and there we have done some things quite unique in that Amazon certainly has a lot of tooling and capability, we have all of that and more. Our environment is very heterogeneous and designed to deal with virtually any tool. And by the way, you can bring your own tools, your own capability to bear.</p><p>And we announced this year that that platform as a service environment is also available to be installed locally. But many of our customers -- you think of big financial institutions, they worry a lot about where is their data, who is doing what, where.</p><p>So they want to keep certain things on premise. So we are providing an on-premise footprint that actually collaborates with the public cloud on our premise footprint. And you can build out your dev ops and agile development-based environment, it is all about an API component-based assembly process.</p><p>Then we have a whole set of software as a service offerings, over 100 offerings in our portfolio geared very specifically to software as a service. So those are where you are less concerned about changing and manipulating, you just simply want to get access to the tooling, the capability, the applications in the classical software as a service mode.</p><p>So we are doing certainly what others are doing, but our portfolio spreads quite broadly across these many different kinds of offerings. And our ability to deliver on hybrid, which so many larger businesses are interested in.</p><p>You are not going to break your business process just because of cloud. You are going to say, wait a minute, I need to run from end to end, I need to enable my order to cash, my straight through processing infrastructure.</p><p>And there may be elements that I want to run in a cloud, public, private, whatever term you want to use, protected, open. But I need to have process choreography, I need to have recoverability, I need to have audit ability. And again, those are areas that we are investing in.</p><p>We have 100% transparency into our SoftLayer infrastructure, nobody else delivers that, Amazon doesn't do it, Microsoft doesn't do it. You can track every transaction, every change, every access right down to the device level. You can see absolute -- our audit ability is as good as any corporate in-house audit ability for our environment. And again for most large businesses, the regulation and audit ability is a critical differentiator.</p><p>So, we are quite enthusiastic about this idea of hybrid cloud shared services, Federated services. And we think this represents one of the bigger opportunities in the world of cloud.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Okay, no, that is good to hear. You sort of touched upon a lot of subjects there. So it reminded me I want to make sure I ask you just this question, again bigger picture. You mentioned SaaS and whatnot, just this concept of [co-opetition] and partnership.</p><p>I know partnership was a big theme that IBM talked about at your investor conference. So how is IBM approaching partnership? I know there has been Apple and Twitter and others have been mentioned as partners. I am just curious what has changed, what is the new approach towards partnership here and co-opetition?</p><p>STEVE MILLS: Well, first of all we have done this for a very long time. And so, it is not new. But as you -- as we think about where the markets are going, we see this ecosystem dynamic becoming ever more important. And there is some literature and things written about this.</p><p>People will talk about platforms and other terms that are used that are indicative of this idea that you establish, if you will, some sort of base technology and then you want to build popularity around that. And as it becomes more popular you get more participation. And so you get this exponential effect taking place as more and more people are participating.</p><p>Clearly around an open-based approach a lot of boats can rise, so ours would not be the only one to benefit from these kinds of things. But we certainly would get our benefit from it.</p><p>We have been a major driver around things like OpenStack, that was IBM working with Rackspace to bring that out as an open environment the things we did with Pivotal and Cloud Foundry. The myriad of open initiatives that we are engaged in through different types of dot.org entities, those are all part of the what we are doing.</p><p>We've moved our power architecture into an OpenPOWER model similar to ARM. So we are now licensing power complete with all the IP and diagrams to build a power processor to anybody who is a member of the OpenPOWER consortium. There are 110 companies now that are members of OpenPOWER.</p><p>As a result of that you will see Google here at the end of this year begin to deliver boards into their systems, into their racks that are power based, not just Intel-based.</p><p>So that ARM licensing dynamic is something the industry is very familiar with. Every one of the handheld devices in this room is ARM based. And frankly the industry likes that kind of model because it provides freedom of action and the ability to create derivative work. So again, moving to more of a partner driven model.</p><p>Clearly you look at our cloud initiative, you look at the SoftLayer environment, we are trying to get more and more independent software vendors to run on that environment. You have to create partner models, we are doing that with SAP and dozens of other independent software vendors.</p><p>Apple is all about -- Apple's motivation to do more in the enterprise and our motivation to do a better job of enabling where our customers want to go in the enterprise with mobility. So that partnership has mutual benefit in terms of what it does for us as well as what it does for them.</p><p>Twitter, I mean Twitter wants to put their data to work. We have a very big footprint in e-commerce and in marketing analytics. So bringing Twitter data in and, by the way, combining it with other data so there are other data sources. You saw us make an announcement with Facebook.</p><p>So again, it is bringing more of that external data in. All of that, again, designed to help the retailer do a better job of figuring out customer preference, loyalty dynamics and so on.</p><p>So we are constantly focused on can we build out ecosystems that expand the interest the market has in IBM and our boat will rise. But it is going to rise in conjunction with other boats.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Yes, right, yeah. So you mentioned ecosystems, I know models are changing. So I guess bringing it back to IBM and the business you run on the software side, I know that last year there was obviously a negative surprise there.</p><p>So I am curious just how visibility is now in general. I don't know if it is worth going through what happened last year. But how do you approach sort of visibility and budgeting on the software side with respect to the revenue outlook?</p><p>STEVE MILLS: So, I mean our business is obviously a big business, $25 billion software business inside of IBM and it has a lot of different component pieces. So to start out with what you are working with, and the good news is we have about 70% of the business which is annuity. It is either monthly license charge, mainframe-based technology, not necessarily something that grows, although when we cycle the systems we usually get a little bit of uptick and then it flattens out and goes down.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Right.</p><p>STEVE MILLS: Subscription and support which goes with the install base and we have tens of millions of licenses of our products installed around the world. So that generates a sizable amount of revenue for IBM. But that last 30% comes from transactions. And the transactions take multiple forms.</p><p>So the good news is some of our largest clients do very large transactions but they don't do them all the time. So it is wonderful when they do a large transaction, those large transactions give them tremendous flexibility, they are essentially portfolio transactions. And they have the ability to mix and match and choose across the product line.</p><p>So they will do one every so many years. I mean typical large deal transactions these days run about three years. Some companies do five years. So not unusual to get three year plus types of transactions. It creates a rather lumpy transaction business, however.</p><p>We do a lot of small transactions and we are continuing to spread our resources and partner resources to go wider in the market. And of course Software-as-a-Service, which is growing substantially for IBM, significant double-digit growth even some parts of our portfolio even as much as triple-digit growth.</p><p>But we want that to be, because it has an annuity characteristic, an even bigger part of the transaction flow because it will manifest itself in even more predictable annuity stream flow in the future.</p><p>So we have got to work all these dynamics. It is what you deal with in any portfolio. Parts of the portfolio such as collaboration are moving pretty rapidly towards SaaS or our traditional notes business along with things like connections and other collaboration technologies in IBM are moving quickly to a SaaS-based market preference.</p><p>Application development tools are becoming more in the cloud because of the variability of usage. So you get some of those aspects that you manage through the business.</p><p>But we know we are in the right places. We are seeing solid market reaction to things we are doing in newer areas whether it is analytics or security and people still buy traditional middleware. With 35 million servers deployed around the world, there is still a lot of middleware infrastructure that goes into today's IT environments that does get refreshed.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Okay, no, that is helpful. So we've got about 5 minutes left. I've got a couple questions here. Maybe I'll just round it out, Steve. I am not going to hit all these questions obviously. But maybe just a bigger picture question. You have seen a lot of tech waves. You have been at IBM for a long time -- a while let's say.</p><p>I mean maybe just talk to us -- we like to sweat a lot of the details and the obvious questions, I am sure you're getting them all the time. But maybe what do you see that maybe we are missing and maybe people don't appreciate from a software perspective or IBM perspective that you would highlight for us?</p><p>STEVE MILLS: Well, I think that there is a certain infatuation with every wave that comes along. For those that have been around long enough they can think of the dialogue, the rhetoric and the discussions that occurred with every perceived technology wave that somehow or other the new would eliminate the old. And yet that hasn't really been the case.</p><p>Infrastructure is like a city, whether it is Boston or New York or whatever your favorite city is. You see change and change to the skyline, you see improvement. But you also do see a lot of things that are as they were. They haven't changed or maybe they have gotten a new coat of paint and some renovation. Certainly the subway cars in New York City today are air-conditioned, I remember when they were not air-conditioned. And so those kinds of things happen.</p><p>So the old doesn't entirely disappear. It is really a matter of how the old transforms itself to do more of what people want to do with it today while still supporting things that they wanted to do before. And that happens with every single wave that we have seen.</p><p>Now I mean change is inevitable, so we view this as a journey, not a destination. So it doesn't matter what the period of time is that will be the next new set of things that people will be talking about and will have a change effect. For an IBM that means we need to go where the market is going. It also means we need to leverage what is changing and bring it back to the base.</p><p>One of the fastest growing drivers of mainframe MIPS consumption in the industry today is direct connect of mobile devices to mainframes. Most people in this room don't know that if they go do an account look up on their mobile device there is a good chance it is going back into their mainframe environment to actually get that data.</p><p>It happens; unless you are in the IT shop you don't pay much attention to it. But if you are in the IT shop you are a little bit startled by how your capacity requirements are going up as a function of mobile device access.</p><p>Almost a third of all of the mainframe MIPS deployed in the world today are running Linux. In fact, there are many companies that are running Linux only-based mainframe environments. There are some companies that are running more Linux than traditional z/OS workloads. And so, that thing that is the mainframe, one of the sort of older products that's been around in our industry keeps morphing and transforming and changing.</p><p>The new mainframe is a 10 terabyte memory system, able to do in line analytics in conjunction with transaction processing. And to do so economically to where it is questionable whether you ought to be replicating all your data off the mainframe.</p><p>So we are constantly adding and adapting different use scenarios to where the market wants to go. And in every case you are looking for ways in which the existing technologies can be taken, if you will, moved forward to the next generation of use scenarios.</p><p>So, this perception that somehow or another everything is just going in a direction is just not true. It is a $2 trillion industry. And so there are many directions all at once that the industry is moving in.</p><p>I also think that there is a lot of confusion over revenue pools versus profit pools. And revenue is one of the easiest things to find in the tech industry. And profit is one of the hardest. And so, you see a lot of interesting dynamics.</p><p>Now if you are one of those companies that is given extraordinary market valuations without necessarily having to deliver profits, well, I suppose why not. I am not part of one of those companies, but if I was I am sure I would be sitting there smiling going this is great.</p><p>I'm just going to plow back, plow back, plow back and maybe the day will come when the investors will demand that I deliver a different type of business model, but in the short-term if you let me I will just keep plowing back because there is an endless appetite for spending in the tech industry.</p><p>There is always something else you would use your money for. Everybody who works for me has stars in their eyes over the money they could spend if only I would let them. But since Martin Schroeter doesn't let me, I don't let them.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Of course.</p><p>STEVE MILLS: Some of us have to deliver return on invested capital every quarter.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Yes, well it is good to have some discipline. All right, we should probably stop there, wish we had more time, Steve, but really appreciate hearing your views. Thank you so much for being here.

The comment was written on Dec. 9, 2019, and posted on March 25, 2020:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Introduction</p><p>Thanks to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the opportunity to comment on the impact of the implementation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p><p>The International Center for Law and Economics (ICLE) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan research center whose work promotes the use of law &amp; economics methodologies to inform public policy debates. We believe that intellectually rigorous, data-driven analysis will lead to efficient policy solutions that promote consumer welfare and global economic growth./1</p><p>ICLE's scholars have written extensively on privacy and data security issues. Some of these writings are included as references in the comment below. Additional materials may be found at our website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.laweconcenter.org\">https://www.laweconcenter.org</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.truthonthemarket.com/\">https://www.truthonthemarket.com/</url>.</p><p>In this comment, I write primarily address the first question presented by the Commission (\"Is there a continuing need for the Rule as currently promulgated? Why or why not?\"). This comment answers that question in the negative, arguing the FTC should return to the pre-2013 version of the COPPA Rule. However, these comments also speak to several other questions, including specifically:</p><p>b. What are the aggregate costs and benefits of the Rule?</p><p>* The benefits are unclear, but the costs -- in the form of restricting the ability of family-friendly content creators to monetize their products -- are real.</p><p>c. Does the Rule include any provisions not mandated by the Act that are unnecessary or whose costs outweigh their benefits? If so, which ones and why?</p><p>* The 2013 amendment's definition of personal information is not only arguably inconsistent with the statute, but also very costly in restricting targeted advertising.</p><p>2. What effect, if any, has the Rule had on children, parents, or other consumers?</p><p>a. Has the Rule benefited children, parents, or other consumers? If so, how?</p><p>* The benefits to parents or children are unclear.</p><p>b. Has the Rule imposed any costs on children, parents, or other consumers? If so, what are these costs?</p><p>* The costs on children and parents are felt in less-available zero-priced online children's content.</p><p>c. What changes, if any, should be made to the Rule to increase its benefits, consistent with the Act's requirements? What costs would these changes impose?</p><p>* The repeal of the 2013 amendments and returning the focus of COPPA to protecting children from online threats would decrease COPPA's costs while maximizing its benefits to society.</p><p>9. Do the definitions set forth in Sec. 312.2 of the Rule accomplish COPPA's goal of protecting children's online privacy and safety?</p><p>* The definition of personal information does not clearly protect online privacy and safety, but it does impose costs on online children's content creation.</p><p>12. The 2013 revised COPPA Rule amended the definition of \"Personal information\" to include, among other items, a \"persistent identifier that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different websites or online services.\" Has this revision resulted in stronger privacy protection for children? Has it had any negative consequences?</p><p>* There are no clear benefits to privacy in this revision, but there are negative consequences in less online children's content creation.</p><p>In Part I, this comment argues that the 2013 amendments got the purpose of COPPA wrong in focusing on targeted advertising rather than protection from predators. In Part II, this comment explains how the 2013 changes to the definition of personal information and the YouTube enforcement action exemplify this changed focus and resulted in making the monetization of children-friendly content online much harder. Part III then analyzes the 2013 definition of personal information in a cost-benefit framework and finds the uncertain benefits to children's privacy are outweighed by the harm to children's content creation.</p><p>I. COPPA is about protecting children from predators, not protecting children from advertising</p><p>The primary question the FTC should consider in this rule review is: What is the purpose of COPPA? In other words, what are we protecting children from?</p><p>At the time the legislation was introduced, Senator Richard Bryan (D-Nevada) laid out the purpose of COPPA in a speech, saying:</p><p>The goals of this legislation are: (1) to enhance parental involvement in a child's online activities in order to protect the privacy of children in the online environment; (2) to enhance parental involvement to help protect the safety of children in online fora such as chatrooms, home pages, and pen-pal services in which children may make public postings of identifying information; (3) to maintain the security of personally identifiable information of children collected online; and (4) to protect children's privacy by limiting the collection of personal information from children without parental consent. The legislation accomplishes these goals in a manner that preserves the interactivity of children's experience on the Internet and preserves children's access to information in this rich and valuable medium./2</p><p>In other words, COPPA was designed to protect children from online threats by promoting parental involvement in a way that also preserved a rich and vibrant marketplace for children's content online. If COPPA is to be understood in this light, the 2013 COPPA revisions from the FTC miss the mark.</p><p>The safety of children online is an explicit animating purpose of COPPA. Protecting children from targeted advertising is not./3</p><p>Targeted advertising is tremendously important to the monetization of content online. Without it, access to online children's content is seriously impaired./4</p><p>With this in mind, it seems unlikely that children revealing their IP address or device numbers online would allow online predators to track them down. Instead, the clear goal of the 2013 amendment to the definition of \"personal information\" is to \"protect\" children from targeted advertising.</p><p>The statutory definition of \"personal information\" in COPPA's enabling legislation supports the argument that COPPA was not originally designed to prevent targeted advertising. Arguably, the FTC exceeded its statutory authority by promulgating the new definition in 2013.</p><p>COPPA's definition for personal information is \"individually identifiable information\" collected online./5</p><p>The legislation included examples such as first and last name, home or other physical address, and e-mail address, a telephone number, or a Social Security number./6</p><p>These are all obviously connected to real identities of people. COPPA does empower the Commission to determine whether other identifiers should be included, but it must permit \"the physical or online contacting of a specific individual\"/7 or \"information concerning the child or the parents of that child that the website collects online from the child and combines with an identifier described in this paragraph.\"/8</p><p>In 2013, the FTC amended the definition of personal information to include \"[a] persistent identifier that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different Web sites or online services. Such persistent identifier includes, but is not limited to, a customer number held in a cookie, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a processor or device serial number, or unique device identifier.\"/9</p><p>Neither IP addresses nor device identifiers alone \"permit the physical or online contacting of a specific individual\" as required by 15 U.S.C. Sec. 6501(8)(F). A website or app could not identify whether a person is an adult or child or their personal identity by these pieces of information alone. In order for persistent identifiers, like those relied upon for targeted advertising, to be counted as personal information under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 6501(8)(G), they need to be combined with other identifiers listed in the definitions. In other words, it's only when a persistent identifier is combined with a first and last name, an address, an email, a phone number, or a Social Security number that is should be considered personal information protected by the statute.</p><p>While administrative agencies receive Chevron deference in court challenges when definitions are ambiguous, the text, when illumined by canons of statutory construction,/10 is clear. The canon of ejusdem generis applies when general words follow an enumeration of two or more things./11</p><p>The general words are taken to apply only to persons or things of the same general kind or class specifically mentioned. Persistent identifiers like cookies bear little semblance to the other examples of \"personally identifiable information\" listed in the statute, like first and last name, address, phone, email, or Social Security number. Only when combined with such information could a persistent identifier become personal information.</p><p>The 2013 amendments take for granted that it is harmful for children to receive targeted advertisements, even where, as here, the targeting is based not on any knowledge about the users as individuals, but upon the browsing and search history of the device they happen to be using. But children under 13 are extremely unlikely to have purchased the devices they use, to have paid for the access to the Internet to use the devices, or to have any disposable income or means of paying for goods and services online. Thus, contrary to the presumptions of the 2013 amendments, the actual targets of behavioral ads \"served\" to children are much more likely to be the children's parents.</p><p>As such, parental oversight is essentially built-in to any type of advertisement children see (including targeted advertisements), in the sense that few children can realistically make their own purchases or even view those advertisements without their parents giving them a device and Internet access to do so.</p><p>From this perspective, it is much harder to see the harm from targeted advertising. COPPA's regulatory design is supposed to prevent stalkers, creepers, and perverts from using online information to interact with children. The 2013 amendments greatly reduce the ability of children's content to generate revenue by use of relatively anonymous persistent identifiers like cookies -- and thus, almost certainly, greatly reduce the amount of content actually made for and offered to children.</p><p>II. The addition of persistent identifiers to the definition of personal information makes the monetization of children's content very difficult</p><p>As described above, the 2013 COPPA amendments define personal information to include persistent identifiers, like cookies, used for targeted advertising. These cookies allow site operators to effectively manage user sessions across multiple websites. Access to this data allows companies to advertise more effectively than is possible with static contextual advertisements, which estimate users' interests based upon the type of content being viewed at the time. The age-old problem for advertisers is that \"half the money spent on advertising is wasted; the trouble is they don't know which half.\"/12</p><p>While this isn't completely solved by the use of targeted advertising based on web browsing and search history, the fact that such advertising is more lucrative compared to contextual advertisements suggests that it is more effective at matching viewers and advertisers./13</p><p>The FTC's recent COPPA enforcement actions against platforms, like YouTube, that host content of interest to children, will lead those platforms to restrict the ability of content creators to use those platforms to monetize their content through targeted advertising. The YouTube settlement, along with the $170 million fine, is the most important enforcement action in this space since the 2013 amendments. According to the complaint issued by the FTC and the New York Attorney General, YouTube violated COPPA by collecting personal information of children on its platform without obtaining parental consent./14</p><p>YouTube's error, in the eyes of the FTC, was that the site left it to channel owners on YouTube's general audience site to determine whether to monetize their content through targeted advertising or to opt out and use only contextual advertisements./15</p><p>As it turns out, many of those channels -- including channels identified by the FTC as \"directed to children\" -- made the more lucrative choice by choosing to have targeted advertisements on their channels.</p><p>In response to this enforcement action, YouTube has greatly restricted the ability of family-friendly content creators to monetize their content. The Order requires YouTube to obtain verifiable parental consent on any content \"directed to children.\"/16</p><p>YouTube, under the Order, is now subject to even higher fines if found in contempt./17</p><p>Combine risk aversion on behalf of YouTube with the uncertainty as to what may be considered content \"directed to children\" and it is no surprise that YouTube is changing its platform to restrict the ability of creators to use targeted advertising on content which could be of interest to children.</p><p>The fears of online content creators, especially those who create content that may be of interest to children, should not be ignored. The incredibly high numbers of comments from content creators is instructive.</p><p>Stories abound online about online content creators' fears of demonetization after the FTC's recent enforcement actions:</p><p>* Video game creators: \"It's kind of like they're killing video game content,\" Forrest told The Verge. \"The top three games on YouTube right now are Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox, which are generally non-[realistically-]violent and child-centric games, especially Roblox. Now, we can't make videos on more mature video games because they'll get demonetized, but if we make videos on child-friendly games, they're also now going to get demonetized. What do we do?\"/18</p><p>* Family vloggers: Melissa Hunter, the CEO of Family Video Network, a company that works with family vloggers and family-friendly channels, said she worries about creators she works with who are now preparing for financial losses and possible career shifts. And she puts most of the blame on the FTC. \"People who I deal with at YouTube feel horrible that the creators are the ones who are going to be hurt by this,\" Hunter told The Verge. \"The part that's really frustrating to me is trying to apply a very outdated policy to a really unique and unexpected platform.\" Now, she argues, it's families and the children who watch those videos who will suffer. \"If people stop making content that's intended for children, it's because they're not going to be able to support themselves and make money making that content,\" Hunter said. \"The landscape on YouTube is going to change dramatically, but that isn't going to stop children from going to YouTube. So instead of being served content that is geared towards them, that is safe for them, that's enriching for them, and that's fun for them, they're going to be watching what exactly?\" The irony is that many of the creators who will suffer the most got into family content because the system seemed to favor content that appealed to a younger audience. Creators were clamoring to make more family-friendly content. Family vloggers, like the Ace Family, saw a huge uptick in traffic and success for their family vlog series; creators like Jake Paul started working with kids to try and appeal to a younger audience; and, yes, more creators started playing games like Minecraft. These were the types of videos that YouTube could sell to advertisers -- especially at a time when the platform was so tumultuous and overrun by controversies./19</p><p>* Toy reviewers: \"Creators are being held directly responsible by the FTC,\" Dan Eardley, who reviews collectible toys on his channel Pixel Dan, told The Verge on Wednesday. \"So if the FTC decides that [we] are indeed targeting children, we'll be fined. That is frightening.\" \"It's especially scary because the verbiage of 'kid directed' vs 'kid attractive' isn't very clear,\" he continued. \"It's hard to know if we're in violation or not.\"/20</p><p>* Children's Apps: Against this legal landscape, a recent study of nearly 6,000 of the most popular children's apps on Android found that \"a majority are potentially in violation of COPPA.\" The list of potentially non-compliant companies includes a number of household names, major education companies, and other large content providers./21</p><p>* EdTech: Schools frequently rely on third parties that operate websites and online programs. Common examples include online research sites, homework help forums and testing platforms. Under COPPA, schools can currently consent as the parents' agent when websites collect information solely for the benefit of the students or the school and not for a commercial purpose. If student information is used for a commercial purpose, then parents need to consent too./22</p><p>The economics are simple: If these creators are essentially demonetized, there will be less content created that children can benefit from.</p><p>See graph here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=FTC-2019-0054-116146&amp;attachmentNumber=1&amp;contentType=pdf\">https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=FTC-2019-0054-116146&amp;attachmentNumber=1&amp;contentType=pdf</url>)</p><p>The supply curve for online children's content shifts left as the marginal cost of monetizing it increases. The marginal cost of monetizing such content is increased by the higher compliance costs of obtaining verifiable parental consent before serving targeted advertising. This supply shift means both that less online content for children will be created and the price for such content in the market will be higher. The current price of zero for consumers will be shifted up to a positive price if targeted advertising is no longer practical. Expect monetization in the form of subscription fees to increase. But regardless of exactly how it manifests, it can be safely predicted that less zero-priced online children's content will be available online.</p><p>III. The uncertain privacy benefits of COPPA do not outweigh clear costs of less zero-priced children's content online</p><p>While some genuinely believe there is a privacy harm in the collection of persistent identifiers for targeted advertising,/23 there are considerable benefits to targeted advertising in monetizing content that is zero-priced to consumers. The balance COPPA aimed to strike was in protecting children's privacy against predators while still allowing children to access valuable online resources. COPPA's privacy protections were certainly not meant to come at the expense of a vibrant online children's content marketplace.</p><p>The privacy benefits of the current COPPA Rule is uncertain. While some may classify the restriction of the collection of persistent identifiers as a benefit, this benefit itself comes with a cost.</p><p>Moreover, the current COPPA Rule disregards the possibility that controls that take advantage of parental oversight may be the most cost-effective form of protection. As Geoffrey Manne noted regarding the FTC's analogous complaint against Amazon under the FTC Act, which ignored the possibility that Amazon's in-app purchasing scheme was tailored to take advantage of parental oversight in order to avoid imposing excessive and needless costs:</p><p>[For the FTC], the imagined mechanism of \"affirmatively seeking a customer's authorized consent to a charge\" is all benefit and no cost. Whatever design decisions may have informed the way Amazon decided to seek consent are either irrelevant, or else the user-experience benefits they confer are negligible....</p><p>Amazon is not abdicating its obligation to act fairly under the FTC Act and to ensure that users are protected from unauthorized charges. It's just doing so in ways that also take account of the costs such protections may impose -- particularly, in this case, on the majority of Amazon customers who didn't and wouldn't suffer such unauthorized charges..../24</p><p>In other words, parents can protect their children's privacy simply by taking control over the devices they allow their children to use./25</p><p>Tech-savvy parents could install software or use ad-blockers prevent persistent identifiers if they so choose./26</p><p>But even less tech-savvy parents could make sure their children are not subject to advertisements and tracking they do not wish to have by simply monitoring the usage of the devices they give their children and ensuring they use only YouTube Kids and other platforms that are explicitly created for children. In fact, iPhones, iPads, and other devices now have built-in, easy-to-use controls that enable both monitoring and blocking of children's access to specific apps and websites./27</p><p>But the FTC should not assume that the many parents who allow their children to access YouTube and other online content subject to targeted advertisements are harmed. In many instances, it must be the case that parents have decided that the benefits of their children experiencing online content are larger than the costs they might experience in privacy harms from targeted advertising. Indeed, this seems likely in the vast majority of cases because parents still control the ability to actually buy any goods or services those ads are trying to sell.</p><p>A less restrictive COPPA rule could still enhance parental involvement and protect children from predators without severely impairing the marketplace for online children's content. Parents already have the ability to review their children's content-viewing habits on devices they buy for them. A COPPA rule which enhances parental control by providing for verifiable parental consent when children could be subject to sharing personal information like first and last name, address, phone number, email address, or Social Security number obviously makes sense. Requiring verifiable parental consent for geolocation data that could allow predators to identify children makes sense. But relatively anonymized data collection that comes from persistent identifiers for the purpose of targeted advertising is much more efficiently monitored by parental oversight without requiring costly verifiable parental consent.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The FTC should reconsider its course on COPPA. The Commission should repeal the 2013 amendments and make clear that persistent identifiers, by themselves, are not personal information requiring verifiable parental consent. Enforcement actions like the YouTube settlement should be abandoned, as well, and assurances should be given to online children's content creators that the FTC will not come after them for using targeted ads to monetize their work. The FTC should refocus its enforcement activity against apps and websites which allow children to post the type of personally identifying information the COPPA statute originally targeted.</p><p>Ben Sperry,</p><p>Associate Director,</p><p>Legal Research</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1/ ICLE has received financial support from numerous companies, organizations, and individuals, including firms with interests both supportive of and in opposition to the ideas expressed in this and other ICLE-supported works.

When an advertiser uses YouTube's backend marketing customization tools to target a specific demographic for its ads, two things happen. 1) The ad ideally gets put in front of more people who might actually want to buy the product, based on their personal data, viewing history, browsing activity, and more; and 2) in exchange for that targeting service, the advertiser pays YouTube more to run the ad. That means creators with videos that run \"personalized ads\" take home more revenue than they would if non-targeted ads ran against their content.</p><p>How drastically will creator income be impacted? By our assessment, very drastically. We asked creators to go into Creator Studio and disable personalized ads (called \"Interest-Based Ads\", under the \"Advanced\" tab) for a few days. Based on our initial testing, a video not running personalized ads sees a loss in revenue somewhere between 60% to 90%. So, if a video on a given channel could generate $100 in revenue for a creator right now with personalized ads running, categorizing the video as \"directed to children\" (and therefore removing the personalized ads) would mean the video's revenue would drop to somewhere between $10 and $40.\"</p><p>14/ FTC and New York v.

More than 50 years later, the times are indeed interesting, thanks in part to the actions of the US and China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As for how the construction industry is feeling, lots of people can probably relate to the words: \"You can't always get what you want,\" by the Rolling Stones.</p><p>As much as many would like to see an injection of optimism, the most the International Monetary Fund could offer in its latest update was \"still sluggish global growth\" and an adjustment of global growth forecasts to 3.2% for 2019 and 3.5% for 2020.</p><p>Continuing uncertainty around trade relations - between the US and China; the UK and eurozone, with an increasing likelihood of a \"no-deal\" Brexit; and the US, Canada and Mexico - as well as emerging tensions in the Persian Gulf - add to the challenge.</p><p>The landscape might seem gloomy for the construction sector, but that is not necessarily the case. Looking across factors such as currencies, commodity prices and the latest governmental initiatives around the world, there are reasons for careful optimism. The global economy and construction are of course highly interdependent, and together are a source of both opportunity and threat.</p><p>Paradoxically, slowing growth could be the stimulus the construction sector needs to finally tackle some of its long-standing issues, such as low productivity, slow uptake of innovation, and impacts on the environment.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h>02 / Construction markets around the world</h><p>While the extent of construction activity in markets around the world varies, the outlook is generally positive, with multiple examples of governmental initiatives aimed at sustaining and/or increasing output.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">US</emphasis></p><p>In the US, despite the ongoing trade feud with China and a GDP prognosis for 2019 of 2.6% (a 0.3% decrease on 2018 GDP growth), optimism is still high among contractors and equipment distributors. Residential sector recovery is expected later in 2019 and in 2020. President Donald Trump's recently created council on eliminating barriers to affordable housing development could facilitate future growth.</p><p>Investment in infrastructure also remains strong, driven by the need to expand and to address issues related to ageing assets. Additionally, big tech is driving large mixed-used schemes including Facebook's $850m (\u00a3703m) Willow Campus in San Francisco, California, and Microsoft's $1bn (\u00a3827m) Redmond headquarters in Washington.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">China</emphasis></p><p>China's GDP is growing at the slowest rate since 1992 - 6.2% in Q2. It has become clear that its current growth model has reached a peak and further reforms are needed. A trade war with the US has only added to the challenges. State-driven, large-scale investments in transport and energy infrastructure continue, and are likely to do so, especially in view of recently relaxed infrastructure project finance rules. A temporary decrease in renewable energy investment has been mainly caused by moving away from subsidies for solar and wind. This is likely to be overturned as additional funding comes from the World Bank for the China Renewable Energy and Battery Storage Promotion Project. China is also experiencing a boom in hotel construction, while investment related to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will soon kick in.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">India</emphasis></p><p>As one of the few countries to maintain an increasing trend in GDP growth, India is expected to achieve 7% growth in 2019 and 7.2% in 2020. Construction growth is set to continue, aided by the recent election success of prime minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party coalition. He has previously expressed commitment to significant infrastructure investment, especially around the access to potable water. Indeed, last month's budget focused on increased infrastructure spending, easing rules around foreign direct investment and improving life in rural India. Investment in renewable energy is also expected, following the government's pledge to increase the share of renewables in the total energy mix to 40% by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Australia</emphasis></p><p>The Australian economy is slowing, as reflected by the revised GDP projections from Reserve Bank of Australia of 1.75% in June, down from 2.5%. The outlook for residential is uncertain, following a sharp decline in housing approvals (-21% May 2018 - May 2019).</p><p>Like many regions, growth is likely to be attributed to investment in infrastructure, with the 2019 budget granting A$73bn (\u00a313bn) for infrastructure over the next 10 years. Initiatives related to renewable energy also continue, driven by the country's pledge to source 50% of energy from renewables by 2025. Recently, Victoria's biggest solar farm has been completed and construction has also started on the world's first liquid hydrogen project.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Europe</emphasis></p><p>In both Western and Eastern Europe, despite low GDP forecasts, the outlook for the overall construction sector is positive. Across Germany, regardless of\u00a0 a slight loss in construction momentum, the market remains strong. Following a better-than-expected opening quarter when mild weather triggered boost in new orders and output, activity has plateaued. Yet, construction companies do not seem discouraged and rates of hiring are increasing. Low interest rates are expected to facilitate the initiation of new building projects.</p><p>Stimulated by government infrastructure investment including the Grand Paris Express, a further expansion of high-speed rail and the initiation of preparations for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, the French construction sector is growing at a modest pace of 1.7%.</p><p>In the Netherlands, 2019 GDP growth is expected to reach 1.6% and it is likely to stay at similar level in 2020, as the Dutch construction market comes to the end of a boom. An additional trigger for construction, especially in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, are Brexit relocations, with Dutch cities hosting bodies including the European Medicines Agency.</p><p>Poland is one of the most dynamic economies in the EU, with growth of 4% pencilled in for 2019. The Polish construction sector has experienced high levels of volatility as the government's plans to upgrade and expand infrastructure have coincided with a housing boom. Inflation in 2018 exceeded 15% as the industry pulled out of a short-term dip in activity. With $27bn (\u00a322bn) of construction under way and a further $85bn (\u00a370bn) in the pipeline, pressure on resources is expected to remain.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h>03 / Snapshot of the international construction costs index</h><p>Figure 1: International Costs Index 2019</p><p>This year, New York and San Francisco have swapped places but remain the two most expensive cities in which to build, closely followed by Hong Kong. There were only slight changes to the rest of the top 10, notably with European cities (Copenhagen, Geneva, London and Zurich) moving marginally ahead of East Coast US cities Boston and Philadelphia. Some newcomers appeared in the lowest part of the index, including Chengdu and Shenzhen in China and Belgrade, Serbia.</p><p>Insights from additional locations, both in the upper and lower part of the index, indicate that a global convergence of construction costs is taking place, with a slight narrowing of the gap between the lowest and highest cost locations.</p><p>The inclusion of additional cities in the index provides a richer picture and allows us to extract the differences on a national level. For example, cities in the US span index positions from the very top (San Francisco and New York) to the bottom half (Dallas, Memphis).</p><p>This difference is caused by multiple factors including structure and availability of workforce, current project pipelines and also the level of project specifications. On top of that, historically successful locations such as New York and San Francisco have been a focus for wealth and investment for a long time and have become more and more regulated. Conversely, more deregulated states in the south and west such as Texas and Utah have taken deregulating steps to become more competitive as locations to live and work.</p><p>In the UK there is also a wide range of cost - albeit over a far smaller area. London remains in the top 10 most expensive cities - highlighting the remarkable resilience of the UK's commercial and housing sectors over the past three years. Concurrently, Manchester and Birmingham have been catching up. Significant levels of investment in regeneration, supported by the prospects of HS2 and the Northern Powerhouse, have been driving higher inflation in regional cites</p><p>than in London, with specifications upgraded in response to user expectation. On the other hand, Cardiff and Aberdeen, further down the index, display the characteristics of a more local market, smaller in size, with lower labour costs and lower project specifications. Interestingly, regional cost variations elsewhere are much less pronounced - reflecting the more decentralised nature of many European construction markets.</p><p>Looking across the anticipated levels of tender price growth, a few locations stand out - among them Dublin, Rotterdam and Amsterdam, with tender prices increasing at 6%-9%. Ireland's recovery from the crash is still running at full throttle. These locations would be likely to see increased levels of activity in the medium term in the event of a disruptive Brexit, as more businesses in the UK relocate at least some of their operations to the EU.</p><p>Elsewhere, remarkable cost increases of around 16% have been seen in Warsaw as the market recovers from a recent slump. This is the combined result of a full affordable housing pipeline and infrastructure upgrades, favourable investment conditions luring foreign investors and increasing workforce shortages.</p><h>About the Construction Costs Index</h><p>The Arcadis International Construction Costs Index provides a comparison of construction costs across 100 global cities. Apart from providing a comparative indexation of construction costs around the world, the report also provides market insights and highlights opportunities for performance improvement associated with innovation, sustainability and end-user benefits. This article includes data for 50 cities. The full report can be accessed via Arcadis.com. \u00a0</p><p>The index is based on a survey of construction costs of 21 building types, based on local specifications and denominated in USD to enable comparison. The ICC compares the costs of delivering a building function in different locations rather than a like-for-like comparison of the costs of a similar type of work.</p><h>04 / Currency trends</h><p>Figure 2: US$ movement against other currencies: year to end July 2019</p><p>After a relatively quiet few months, the currency markets have been set alight by an escalation in tensions between the US and China and by growing fears of a no-deal Brexit. A positive interest rate policy in the US means the US dollar (USD) remained relatively strong in Q1 2019, appreciating against a basket of world currencies. The unexpected fall in the value of the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) to more than seven RMB to a USD in early August, following a 0.25% rate cut, has triggered a further escalation of the trade war.</p><p>President Trump wants a cheaper dollar to boost US exports, but this aim is incompatible with the US' current economic strength and the role of USD as global reserve currency. One of the objectives of the interest rate cut was to</p><p>reduce support to the value of the dollar. However, the Federal Reserve's lukewarm prognosis for future cuts in rates has undermined this policy.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dollar appreciation</emphasis></p><p>The effect of dollar appreciation is to make construction costs in other locations less expensive relative to US cities, which has affected Europe more than emerging markets. Over the past year, the USD gained almost 5% against the Euro and between 4% and 7% against other European currencies. The Australian dollar depreciated by 6% against the USD, owing mainly to lower than expected economic performance caused by declining manufacturing and mining outputs.</p><p>By contrast, in emerging economies, the pace of dollar appreciation has been slow - approximately 1% - which in turn has reduced pressure on costs of servicing of dollar-denominated debt. The Indian rupee, for example, depreciated by only</p><p>0.45% over the year. The Turkish lira remains one of the world's basket-case currencies - seeing a further depreciation of approximately 13% against USD - although compared with the last year's 90% fall, this can be read</p><p>as a token of recovery. In our sample, two currencies strengthened against the dollar: the Philippine peso and Japanese yen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sterling</emphasis></p><p>The performance of sterling remains closely related to developments around Brexit. GBP depreciated by 18% against the dollar between the referendum and the end of July this year. After the initial shock, partial recovery took place throughout 2018, but this trend has been reversed. Within Boris Johnson's first week as prime minister, further depreciation of sterling by 3% took place. Morgan Stanley analysts believe that in the event of no deal, the pound could fall to as low as \"one-for-one\" against the dollar. This would make the UK a competitive exporter but would be expected to drive inflation as a result of rising import costs.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h>05 / Commodities\u00a0</h><p>Figure 3: International Monetary Fund price indices</p><p>Figure 4: International Monetary Fund price indices</p><p>While the first half of 2018 saw price increases of many commodities, the trend changed dramatically in 2019. Energy prices have decreased by 25% over the last 12 months, driven mainly by a remarkable decline in the average price of coal (-39%) and natural gas (-44%). For coal, this has been caused by lower demand associated with decarbonisation. For natural gas, the shift towards cleaner fossil fuels drives the demand - but the US shale gas boom combined with a change in regulation has resulted in remarkable increase in exports from the US to other markets. </p><p>The availability of infrastructure on both sides of the Atlantic, for example the liquefied natural gas (LNG) port in Poland, has enabled the import of US gas, which at the time of writing is 30% cheaper than the gas produced in Europe or Russia. Through 2018, the export of LNG from the US has spiked by 53% in total, and by 272% to Europe alone, pushing the prices of Russian gas down by more than 50% in the last 12 months.</p><p>The price of Brent crude oil decreased on average from $70 (\u00a359) per barrel in H2 2018 to $60 (\u00a350) in the first months of 2019. Recent tensions in the Persian Gulf are not likely to drive up prices, as the US has reached all-time high levels of oil export - 3.3m barrels a day in June. Oil majors including Chevron and Exxon Mobil continue exploration activities as well as energy diversification, while large-scale exploitation of reserves off the coast of Guyana will add to supply.</p><p>The average price of metals increased by 11% in relation to July 2018. Copper, nickel and aluminium maintained a downward trend; however, this was more than compensated for by a significant, but one-off increase of 63% for iron ore - the highest since 2014, due to continuing demand from China and limited supply from Brazil caused by mining firm Vale's dam disaster in January. So far, no significant increase in steel prices has been observed.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h>06 / Conclusion</h><p>The global economy's rate of growth is slowing. This is a source of concern, but for construction it could be the push needed to change things for the better. The world's population is facing a number of challenges, from increasing urbanisation and lack of affordable housing, to ageing infrastructure, constrained resources and climate change.</p><p>In order to address these issues, the sector will need to continue transforming to proactively address shortfalls around productivity, skills and environmental impacts. These problems apply around the world - whether it is a construction of water infrastructure in India or mixed-use developments in California. Shortages in skilled workforce are especially prevalent across global markets.</p><p>Governments are actively encouraging collaboration between industry and academia, aimed at the development and implementation of innovative solutions. Some of these are specific, for example the Green Construction Through Wood programme launched by Natural Resources Canada, which explores the use of wood in non-traditional construction projects, or the Australian Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre and the Research Council Training Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Prefabricated Housing. Other solutions have a broader remit, focusing on enhancing wider innovation across the sector, including the Construction Innovation and Technology Fund in Hong Kong and the UK's Construction Sector Deal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key research</emphasis></p><p>Research from some of the industry's biggest players is helping to gradually change the perception of the sector as slow and outdated. Investment is being directed into diverse projects - developing concrete to reduce a carbon footprint by 70%-80%, artificial intelligence for project management or virtual reality for the on-site safety - to name a few.</p><p>However, technical developments alone will not fundamentally transform the industry. The challenge remains to change the mindset of the sector - the use of BIM and digital twins, for example, did not protect Crossrail from delays and cost overruns. But this should not come as a surprise or be source of disappointment. The reflection here is that digital technologies, to be successful, require new ways of working and tackling some deeply ingrained cultural issues - at each stage and potentially in each profession involved.</p><p>Construction is not just facing a skills shortage, but also a shortage of long-term thinking about the new capabilities required to fully realise the potential of theoretical ideas. The circular economy has been a buzzword for a few years already and today, thanks to digital technologies, concepts such as Buildings as Material Banks, become possible. This introduces a new way of thinking about the assets - as a temporary storage for resources that in the future will be reused. But are demolition technologies being reviewed to ensure that what we will be able to recover is high quality? Are we training architects to buildings made of limited or exactly defined resources?</p><p>In a \"smart\" world, it is time for construction to become smart too. The industry needs to think ahead - for the sake of its own and wider economic resilience.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>shutterstock_706070308</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BLDG-5101362</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BLDG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1V-H951-JD6M-50T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3118\"/><timeReceived>05:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Assemble Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Building</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50525\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 30, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

And thank you to the Bank Al-Maghrib -- which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year -- for hosting this conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We're pleased to join you here in Rabat, as we continue a series of conferences that we're convening this year in every region, worldwide. The purpose of our conferences is to promote broad discussions on -- and develop a better understanding of -- how our member countries are incorporating the high-level considerations proposed in the Bali Fintech Agenda in their national frameworks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Promoting progress in Fintech will surely be a daunting challenge for policymakers -- as we aim to reap the potential benefits of new financial technologies, while also managing their risks.</p><p>\"This conference will give us an opportunity to reflect on the relevance of the elements of the Bali Fintech Agenda (what we refer to as the \"BFA\") to each economy's conditions; to share experiences; to voice concerns and explore challenges; and to discuss various policy approaches.</p><p>\"Technological change, along with market developments, present us with a wide range of new options -- and an array of new risks. With the BFA outlining an integrated approach, our task now is to adjust the policy framework in a comprehensive manner around these trends -- aiming to grasp the full, positive potential of Fintech for the good of society.</p><p>\"The BFA started in response to the call -- by many member countries of the World Bank Group and the IMF -- to have a high-level conceptual framework that can tie together the many challenges inherent in the digitalization of financial services.</p><p>\"Maintaining the momentum of the BFA -- after its launch last October at our Annual Meetings -- the Bank and the Fund have already started to set this agenda into action.</p><p>\"We've already conducted a survey -- with more than 100 responses -- that will provide insights into how our membership sees the agenda's priorities. The survey results -- combined with a summary of recent Fintech developments and regulatory responses -- will soon be presented in a formal paper to our Executive Board. We are also furthering our understanding of Fintech issues through our dialogue with national authorities in the context of our Article IV consultation and FSAP reports. And we've been working closely with standard-setters in each of their respective areas.</p><p>\"In facing the challenges ahead, everyone has a role to play. Given the diversity within our global membership, the experiences of policymakers with Fintech vary widely. Some jurisdictions have been at the frontier, with pro-active and sometimes experimental proposals -- while others, until now, have observed from the sidelines.</p><p>\"There are important public-sector initiatives underway that provide a sound footing for private-sector fintech activities -- including payment-systems modernization in Egypt and Morocco. In other jurisdictions, including the UAE, legal frameworks are being constructed to ensure that fintech developments observe prudential principles. In the next two days, we hope to learn more about this.</p><p>\"We'll also discuss a very promising area, where Fintech seems ready to provide a major benefit to the region -- promoting Financial Inclusion. Making financial services available to populations that now have little, or no, access to finance is a profoundly important priority in global development. Those services include making payments, as well as ensuring easier access to credit -- through peer-to-peer networks, for example. Some countries in the region have made enormous strides in mobile payments, while others are still catching up.</p><p>\"Those benefits, however, are accompanied by new challenges. For instance: Since those broader types of access to financial services are provided by non-bank firms -- such as telecom operators and lending platforms -- new regulatory issues have arisen. Financial regulations, in the past, have been focused more on licensed institutions -- principally, banks. So how should these new areas be regulated? And should there be relatively high barriers to entry to mitigate unknown risks --or does financial innovation require more flexible solutions, including regulatory sandboxes?</p><p>\"Amid today's discussions, we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the Financial Inclusion theme -- as well additional issues in financial development. They include new ways of raising funds, managing risks, and prioritizing national development strategies. We're also mindful of ensuring that the new landscape is competitive, so that we can realize the full value of the new efficiencies promised by new technologies.7</p><p>\"Another opportunity that we'll discuss today -- where the potential for cost savings and time efficiency is enormous -- is cross-border payments. That includes remittances, which play a very significant role in the region. Banks currently play a major role in international money transfers -- but banks' role is changing in light of new entrants, including telcos, Big Tech, and other firms. In the region, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are spearheading fintech initiatives to facilitate cross-border settlements.</p><p>\"This area includes a wide array of policy challenges that, by their nature, require a coordinated international framework. We must seek ways</p><p>\"to improve the payments infrastructure, to enable greater efficiency;</p><p>\"to broaden access to, and review the oversight of, this infrastructure to new entrants -- and ensure the interoperability of systems to maximize the benefits of innovation;</p><p>\"to oversee and appropriately address the transformation of the banking business due to new technologies; and</p><p>\"to mitigate the risk of money laundering in the new payment channels.</p><p>\"In addition, some fundamental services of central banks relate to the issuance of currencies -- specifically, the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies (or \"CBDCs\"). According to a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements: 70 percent of central banks are currently involved in -- or soon will be involved in -- this complex area, with one-third of them now seeing the issuance of CBDCs as likely.</p><p>\"In today's discussions, we'll explore the costs and benefits of CBDCs -- along with the implications for \"banking as we know it.\" Panelists will delve into the implications of Fintech for providing central-bank services -- as well as for developing robust data infrastructures, to address privacy and cyber risk concerns.</p><p>\"With all of these new developments occurring around us, we must also change what regulators and supervisors monitor and analyze. Classic prudential reporting frameworks, which rely on statutory powers, will need to be complemented by new data-collection frameworks. They must cover new entrants and new channels -- and the legal basis for doing so, may not yet be in place.</p><p>\"Similarly, issues regarding the regulatory perimeter must be addressed. For example: What is the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto assets -- and, more generally, to new products and activities? What are the stability implications -- and, as we identify new risks, how can we mitigate them? Such adjustments should be embedded in strong institutional and legal frameworks that guarantee financial integrity.</p><p>\"After considering all of these issues: Our final session of the day, will be devoted to a roundtable, in which participants will be invited to share their experiences and ask further questions.</p><p>\"As we start developing our work program, to follow-up on the Bali Fintech Agenda, we can begin our efforts by taking three specific steps.</p><p>\"First: Given the comprehensive nature of these challenges, and these opportunities, it would certainly be useful for all jurisdictions to begin consultations with all of the relevant parties in this area -- with central banks, regulators, and private-sector participants -- to come up with country-specific approaches. Taking into account the comparative advantages and specific situations of each jurisdiction, the priorities are likely to differ from country to country, and the focus will have to shift to meet their specific needs. For some countries, AML/CFT issues may be the top priority; for others, financial inclusion may be the central concern; for still others, the leading priority may be infrastructure.</p><p>\"Second: Another concrete step would be to have regional consultations and cooperation efforts.</p><p>\"And third: We can commit ourselves to sharing knowledge, and to engaging in more events like this one, to reach beyond our own specific countries' conditions and concerns. Agreeing to pursue a robust program of publications by our respective institutions can be very helpful, as well, in promoting broader knowledge-exchange.</p><p>\"I'm looking forward to our discussions over the next two days, and I'll be eager to keep in touch with all of your institutions -- as we move forward in the months to come, to advance this exciting agenda.</p><p>\"Before concluding, I should also mention that, as you may already know, the IMF and Morocco have started a broad partnership towards hosting the 2021 IMF Annual Meetings in Marrakesh. This conference is one of many events that will be organized in Morocco and the region to build momentum for this global event, and we are happy to have the Moroccan authorities as our partners.</p><p>\"Thank you once again for your participation, and for your warm welcome here in Rabat.</p><p>\"With that, I'll wish you well, hoping that we'll have productive discussions.</p><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><p>Contact: Andreas Andriano, 202/623-7100, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MEDIA@IMF.org\">MEDIA@IMF.org</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>TeamManager-6649305 TeamManager</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6649305</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMT-RPJ1-JC11-141B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1639\"/><timeReceived>8:11 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The company recently debuted a version of its e-commerce site in Hindi, a move Amazon's top India executive  said was part of its effort to attract \"the next 100 million customers,\" in what analysts described as the company's most important market abroad.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet whether India continues to welcome Amazon is an open question. The country's policymakers recently raised alarm bells about what they describe as a \"handful of companies\" that \"dominate the digital economy\" and earlier this year instituted a rule change that forced Amazon to scale back aspects of its business in India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The country of more than 1.3 billion people is not the only place where Amazon is experiencing challenges.</p><p>Three sets of regulators in Europe over the past year have opened investigations into whether Amazon is a threat to open competition, underscoring how foreign markets are demonstrating the type of concern about the company's power that is only beginning to draw attention in the United States.</p><p>If policymakers in these countries end up moving to limit Amazon - in effect protecting homegrown businesses - that would present a barrier to continuing the company's record of unbridled growth  . Amazon has rapidly grown its sales over the past two decades, but some analysts are now questioning whether the U.S. market is becoming saturated, putting an increased burden on foreign sales.</p><p>The challenges abroad could also be a hint of what's to come in the United States, where a small but growing number of political leaders are taking aim at the company.</p><p>\"Just because they were successful in the U.S. doesn't mean they'll be successful internationally,\" said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. \"The international side of things definitely creates speed bumps. . . . As it becomes more and more difficult, does the company have to pivot or decide to exit some of these markets?\"</p><p>Amazon, for its part, said in a statement, \"People like low prices, big selection and fast delivery, pretty much everywhere around the world.\" While there may be differences in how the company markets certain programs or delivery options, \"we don't change our approach as we move around the world, and we face stiff competition everywhere we operate.\"</p><p>(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Jay Carney, Amazon's senior vice president of global corporate affairs, told The Post that while Amazon is a tech company, \"a lot of the issues that are front and center in Europe, as well as here, that raise concerns are simply not ones that are prominent for us because of our business model.\" Still, he said part of his job involves working with policymakers around the world to \"build and invest and hire and meet the needs of governments.\"</p><p>\"We're not morally superior,\" Carney said. \"We just have a different business model.\"</p><p>Amazon's international business is important to its overall model, accounting for 28\u00a0percent of its revenue in 2018 - although it has long been a money-losing unit. Adding to the importance of succeeding in India and Europe, the top market for many American companies, China, has long been difficult for Amazon. It purchased a subsidiary online retailer there in 2004 and has worked for more than a decade to build its Chinese e-commerce business. But the country has become almost entirely cut off to foreign online retailers, given the dominance of platforms like Alibaba and JD.com, which together account for almost 75 percent of all retail e-commerce sales in China in 2018, according to eMarketer.</p><p>Amazon officially threw in the towel in the domestic Chinese market earlier this year, announcing it would close its marketplace in July.</p><p>Amazon's investments will only become more important should American retail sales level out, Yarbrough said. That means heavy investment in countries like India, with the hope that profits are not far behind.</p><p>\"They're sinking all this money into the India market,\" Yarbrough said, \"and they're saying they're going to replicate what they did in the U.S. after years and years of investment.\"</p><p>The pushback from India and Europe has important differences, but there is a common thread: As Amazon points its ambition abroad, foreign governments are pushing back in ways the U.S. government has not.</p><p>The biggest broadside came in September from Margrethe Vestager - the European Union's top competition enforcer, who has taken a tough stand against big technology companies. That month, she launched a preliminary antitrust investigation into Amazon, probing whether Amazon's \"dual role\" as a seller of its products and a marketplace for others gives the company too much power. Vestager said her concern is that Amazon could use data from its rivals - namely merchants who sell on its platform - to edge out the competition.</p><p>The probe followed up on concerns raised by retailers who say Amazon's model gives it an unfair advantage.</p><p>\"The question here is about the data,\" Vestager said in September. \"If you as Amazon get the data from the smaller merchants that you host - which of course can be completely legitimate because you can improve your service to these smaller merchants - do you then also use this data to do your own calculations on what is the new big thing? What is it that people want?\"</p><p>The preliminary probe, which she said in March was in \"quite advanced\" stages, includes sending questionnaires to online sellers and could be the first step toward a more formal investigation.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment on the E.U.'s probe into antitrust concerns.</p><p>Vestager has made her mark going after Big Tech. Consider Google: In March, the E.U. fined Google roughly $1.7\u00a0billion for advertising practices the European Commission said violated antitrust laws. Last year, Vestager handed the tech giant a $5\u00a0billion antitrust fine and required the company to change how it places search and Web browser functions into Android phones. And in 2017, Vestager levied a $2.7\u00a0billion fine on Google for how it steered users toward its comparison shopping site.</p><p>\"The European Union has always been preoccupied with very large companies,\" said Scheherazade Rehman, a professor of international business at George Washington University. \"Whether it's Microsoft or Facebook or Amazon . . . their focus is antitrust and, more recently, privacy.\"</p><p>In mid-April, Italy's competition authority said it, too, would launch a preliminary probe into how Amazon used its e-commerce and logistics services. Regulators said they would look into whether Amazon boosted third-party vendors that used its logistics service over other sellers that did not.</p><p>Germany has also announced an antitrust investigation into Amazon.</p><p>In India, the pushback against Amazon is part of a broader response to the rise of foreign players in the e-commerce industry. The country's Hindu nationalist ruling party, which is seeking reelection, has long drawn strength from the owners of the country's millions of mom-and-pop stores. Those shopkeepers have complained loudly about the growing influence of companies like Amazon.</p><p>Experts say India has become Amazon's most important emerging market. Amazon said it has committed more than $5\u00a0billion to India, including building more than 50 warehouses to make deliveries all over the country. According to British bank Barclays, Amazon is the country's No. 1 Internet marketplace in terms of total value of merchandise sold.</p><p>Big companies all have the same goals, said Praveen Khandelwal, who heads the Confederation of All India Traders, an association that says it represents 70\u00a0million small retailers. \"Number one, to control, dominate and monopolize the market, and second, to crush the competition,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are not against e-commerce,\" he continued, but companies like Amazon indulge in \"malpractices which include predatory pricing, deep discounting and loss funding . . . to the utter disadvantage of the retail sector of India.\"</p><p>Amazon says the prices for products sold on its Indian marketplace are determined by the sellers. The company said it invests in services, like Fulfilled by Amazon and Easyship, which help sellers lower their costs as they scale up to sell nationally.</p><p>At the end of December, India's Commerce Ministry issued new rules that targeted how Amazon and Walmart did business in the country. Under existing Indian regulations, Amazon could not control its own inventory, as it does in the United States. But it worked with two key sellers - Cloudtail and Appario - in which it indirectly held a stake. The rule change aimed to close that loophole.</p><p>\"It was a bit of an ambush,\" said one person involved in the industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.</p><p>Amazon and Walmart urged the Indian government to delay the implementation of the rules, but it refused. As a result, when the rules came into force in February, all the products sold by Cloudtail and Appario disappeared from the Amazon site. But within two weeks, they were back - after Amazon had reduced its stake in the parent companies of both firms.</p><p>\"I would expect them to continue fighting and not to give up because the potential upside is almost limitless,\" said Michael Auslin, an expert on U.S. policy in Asia and a fellow at the Hoover Institution.</p><p>In February, the Indian government released a new draft of a national e-commerce policy that aims to provide a \"level playing field\" for all companies. It seeks to empower domestic entrepreneurs and warns of \"enterprises with deep pockets\" that \"threaten the existence of small businesses\" and discourage competition. Among the changes it proposes are restrictions on how data from Indian consumers can be used.</p><p>The government is soliciting feedback on the policy, but a final version is unlikely to emerge until after India's national elections conclude in late May.</p><p>\"Definitely, the idea is to promote domestic market players, be they big or small,\" said Atul Pandey, a partner at Khaitan &amp; Co., a major Indian law firm, who focuses on cross-border transactions.</p><p>But others say India's objective is more far-reaching: to create a \"China-like situation\" where the barriers to foreign players \"progressively become higher,\" said Nikhil Pahwa, a technology expert who has written extensively on Indian government policy.</p><p>The government sees \"data as a national asset and control of the Internet economy as a nationalistic objective,\" he said.</p><p>Representatives of India's Commerce Ministry declined to comment.</p><p>So far, American antitrust law has not posed a threat to Amazon's business model. The company's portfolio spans e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising and more.</p><p>But more policymakers on both sides of the aisle have been viewing Amazon with a skeptical eye.</p><p>In 2017, a lengthy essay published in the Yale Law Journal by then-law student Lina M. Khan made a case for why American antitrust law is no longer fit to take on Amazon and tech giants like it. Khan's argument has proved influential among a number of U.S. policymakers, and she has subsequently advised the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>The 2020 elections could further debates around antitrust law and its ability to rein in Amazon. Those calls have largely come from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who said she would move to break up Amazon, Facebook and Google if she became president. The companies have \"too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,\" she said.</p><p>Talking specifically about Amazon, Warren said the company should be able to operate its own platform - but not also own the auxiliary businesses that sell on it.</p><p>\"It's like in baseball,\" Warren said in an interview with The Washington Post last month. \"You can be the umpire; that's like the platform. Or you can own the team; that's one of the businesses. But you don't get to be the umpire and own the team in the league.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rachel.siegel@washpost.com\">rachel.siegel@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:joanna.slater@washpost.com\">joanna.slater@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-6b1bfcce651711e989854cf30147bdca</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W31-73M1-DXKP-J0PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2010\"/><timeReceived>7:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

That\u2019s the good news. The bad news? Though the measure is likely to be passed in the House, its prospects in the Senate are much dimmer.

There need to be some rules to keep the potential bad actors in line and to ensure that the rich and powerful few cannot crush some innovative little startup company toiling away in a garage.</p><p>The Save the Internet Act introduced by Democratic leaders last week is an effort to do just that.

If you search for a glue gun, your search results will show you glue guns, not squirt guns or gun safes or DVDs of \u201cTop Gun.\u201d Then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll click one of the products at the top of the search results, rather than scroll through pages of products or click away to another site.</p><p> For everyone involved, search rankings can be the difference between phenomenal success and utter failure. So there\u2019s an ongoing battle between the people who are trying to manipulate the search engines and the tech companies that want to prevent the manipulation. Search algorithms are secret and often changed. This game of cat-and-mouse is one reason that a website or product may suddenly stop showing up at the top of search results. When changes are made to stop fraudsters, legitimate sites that were highly ranked before may drop down to the middle of page 3.</p><p> This became everybody\u2019s problem when it began to affect political content.</p><p> In May 2018, just before the statewide primary election in California, a Google search for \u201cCalifornia Republican Party\u201d brought up a prominently displayed \u201cknowledge panel\u201d that listed the party\u2019s primary ideologies as conservatism, market liberalism and Nazism. House majority leader Kevin McCarthy posted a screenshot of the search result and said it was a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d</p><p> Did the well-known liberal politics of Silicon Valley lead Google employees to defame the Republican Party by falsely associating it with Nazis? Did the search results persuade voters to turn away from Republican candidates?</p><p> The answer to the first question, according to a Google spokesperson, is no.

In a 2018 article titled \u201cTaming Big Tech,\u201d he wrote that his team of researchers had estimated that \u201cGoogle\u2019s search engine \u2014 with or without any deliberate planning by Google employees \u2014 was currently determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the world\u2019s national elections.\u201d</p><p> Epstein would like to launch a monitoring project to capture ephemeral search results in order to get hard data about what people are seeing online when they  search, and how they are influenced by it. That might help researchers figure out whether search results are affected by tech company bias, or perhaps by dozens of people clicking links in Bangladesh.</p><p> The stakes are high, and tech companies are under pressure from all sides. Twitter announced that it will no longer accept political advertising, while Facebook took the opposite position and refused to ban political ads. Of course, a policy on paid ads doesn\u2019t address questions about search results for unpaid content, or ads that are not technically political, like paid promotion of news stories. The words used in headlines, for example, may carry a strong connotation of approval or disapproval of a politician\u2019s actions.

If you search for a glue gun, your search results will show you glue guns, not squirt guns or gun safes or DVDs of \u201cTop Gun.\u201d Then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll click one of the products at the top of the search results, rather than scroll through pages of products or click away to another site.</p><p> For everyone involved, search rankings can be the difference between phenomenal success and utter failure. So there\u2019s an ongoing battle between the people who are trying to manipulate the search engines and the tech companies that want to prevent the manipulation. Search algorithms are secret and often changed. This game of cat-and-mouse is one reason that a website or product may suddenly stop showing up at the top of search results. When changes are made to stop fraudsters, legitimate sites that were highly ranked before may drop down to the middle of page 3.</p><p> This became everybody\u2019s problem when it began to affect political content.</p><p> In May 2018, just before the statewide primary election in California, a Google search for \u201cCalifornia Republican Party\u201d brought up a prominently displayed \u201cknowledge panel\u201d that listed the party\u2019s primary ideologies as conservatism, market liberalism and Nazism. House majority leader Kevin McCarthy posted a screenshot of the search result and said it was a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d</p><p> Did the well-known liberal politics of Silicon Valley lead Google employees to defame the Republican Party by falsely associating it with Nazis? Did the search results persuade voters to turn away from Republican candidates?</p><p> The answer to the first question, according to a Google spokesperson, is no. The Nazi reference on the CAGOP search result was drawn from a vandalized Wikipedia page for the California Republican Party. Somebody made a malicious change to the online encyclopedia, which was live on that site from</p><p> May 24 to May 30.

If you search for a glue gun, your search results will show you glue guns, not squirt guns or gun safes or DVDs of \u201cTop Gun.\u201d Then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll click one of the products at the top of the search results, rather than scroll through pages of products or click away to another site.</p><p> For everyone involved, search rankings can be the difference between phenomenal success and utter failure. So there\u2019s an ongoing battle between the people who are trying to manipulate the search engines and the tech companies that want to prevent the manipulation. Search algorithms are secret and often changed. This game of cat-and-mouse is one reason that a website or product may suddenly stop showing up at the top of search results. When changes are made to stop fraudsters, legitimate sites that were highly ranked before may drop down to the middle of page 3.</p><p> This became everybody\u2019s problem when it began to affect political content.</p><p> In May 2018, just before the statewide primary election in California, a Google search for \u201cCalifornia Republican Party\u201d brought up a prominently displayed \u201cknowledge panel\u201d that listed the party\u2019s primary ideologies as conservatism, market liberalism and Nazism. House majority leader Kevin McCarthy posted a screenshot of the search result and said it was a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d</p><p> Did the well-known liberal politics of Silicon Valley lead Google employees to defame the Republican Party by falsely associating it with Nazis? Did the search results persuade voters to turn away from Republican candidates?</p><p> The answer to the first question, according to a Google spokesperson, is no. The Nazi reference on the CAGOP search result was drawn from a vandalized Wikipedia page for the California Republican Party. Somebody made a malicious change to the online encyclopedia, which was live on that site from</p><p> May 24 to May 30. Google \u201cscraped\u201d Wikipedia\u2019s content and indexed it, and that\u2019s how Nazism showed up in search results for the California Republican Party. \u201cWe have systems in place that catch vandalism before it impacts search results, but occasionally errors get through, and that\u2019s what happened here,\u201d the Google spokesperson said.</p><p> That\u2019s small consolation to the California Republican Party, which is still plagued by the slander in search results that call up stories about the vandalism incident.</p><p> How many voters were influenced by seeing the words \u201cNazi\u201d and \u201cRepublican\u201d on their screens at the same time? There\u2019s no way to know, but by the end of the 2018 election cycle, McCarthy was the House minority, not majority, leader.</p><p> One researcher has concluded that \u201cephemeral\u201d search results, including the words that briefly appear on your screen as search suggestions while you\u2019re typing, can \u201cshift the percentage of undecided voters supporting a political candidate by a substantial margin without anyone knowing.\u201d Dr. Robert Epstein, the former editor i -chief of Psychology Today, has testified before the U.S. Senate about this Search Engine Manipulation Effect. In a 2018 article titled \u201cTaming Big Tech,\u201d he wrote that his team of researchers had estimated that \u201cGoogle\u2019s search engine \u2014 with or without any deliberate planning by Google employees \u2014 was currently determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the world\u2019s national elections.\u201d</p><p> Epstein would like to launch a monitoring project to capture ephemeral search results in order to get hard data about what people are seeing online when they  search, and how they are influenced by it. That might help researchers figure out whether search results are affected by tech company bias, or perhaps by dozens of people clicking links in Bangladesh.</p><p> The stakes are high, and tech companies are under pressure from all sides. Twitter announced that it will no longer accept political advertising, while Facebook took the opposite position and refused to ban political ads. Of course, a policy on paid ads doesn\u2019t address questions about search results for unpaid content, or ads that are not technically political, like paid promotion of news stories. The words used in headlines, for example, may carry a strong connotation of approval or disapproval of a politician\u2019s actions. Most people won\u2019t read the whole story to get both sides.</p><p> However, we\u2019re in extremely dangerous territory here, on the slipperiest of slopes. Last April, Sen.

If you search for a glue gun, your search results will show you glue guns, not squirt guns or gun safes or DVDs of \u201cTop Gun.\u201d Then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll click one of the products at the top of the search results, rather than scroll through pages of products or click away to another site.</p><p> For everyone involved, search rankings can be the difference between phenomenal success and utter failure. So there\u2019s an ongoing battle between the people who are trying to manipulate the search engines and the tech companies that want to prevent the manipulation. Search algorithms are secret and often changed. This game of cat-and-mouse is one reason that a website or product may suddenly stop showing up at the top of search results. When changes are made to stop fraudsters, legitimate sites that were highly ranked before may drop down to the middle of page 3.</p><p> This became everybody\u2019s problem when it began to affect political content.</p><p> In May 2018, just before the statewide primary election in California, a Google search for \u201cCalifornia Republican Party\u201d brought up a prominently displayed \u201cknowledge panel\u201d that listed the party\u2019s primary ideologies as conservatism, market liberalism and Nazism. House majority leader Kevin McCarthy posted a screenshot of the search result and said it was a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d</p><p> Did the well-known liberal politics of Silicon Valley lead Google employees to defame the Republican Party by falsely associating it with Nazis? Did the search results persuade voters to turn away from Republican candidates?</p><p> The answer to the first question, according to a Google spokesperson, is no. The Nazi reference on the CAGOP search result was drawn from a vandalized Wikipedia page for the California Republican Party. Somebody made a malicious change to the online encyclopedia, which was live on that site from</p><p> May 24 to May 30. Google \u201cscraped\u201d Wikipedia\u2019s content and indexed it, and that\u2019s how Nazism showed up in search results for the California Republican Party. \u201cWe have systems in place that catch vandalism before it impacts search results, but occasionally errors get through, and that\u2019s what happened here,\u201d the Google spokesperson said.</p><p> That\u2019s small consolation to the California Republican Party, which is still plagued by the slander in search results that call up stories about the vandalism incident.</p><p> How many voters were influenced by seeing the words \u201cNazi\u201d and \u201cRepublican\u201d on their screens at the same time? There\u2019s no way to know, but by the end of the 2018 election cycle, McCarthy was the House minority, not majority, leader.</p><p> One researcher has concluded that \u201cephemeral\u201d search results, including the words that briefly appear on your screen as search suggestions while you\u2019re typing, can \u201cshift the percentage of undecided voters supporting a political candidate by a substantial margin without anyone knowing.\u201d Dr. Robert Epstein, the former editor i -chief of Psychology Today, has testified before the U.S. Senate about this Search Engine Manipulation Effect. In a 2018 article titled \u201cTaming Big Tech,\u201d he wrote that his team of researchers had estimated that \u201cGoogle\u2019s search engine \u2014 with or without any deliberate planning by Google employees \u2014 was currently determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the world\u2019s national elections.\u201d</p><p> Epstein would like to launch a monitoring project to capture ephemeral search results in order to get hard data about what people are seeing online when they  search, and how they are influenced by it. That might help researchers figure out whether search results are affected by tech company bias, or perhaps by dozens of people clicking links in Bangladesh.</p><p> The stakes are high, and tech companies are under pressure from all sides. Twitter announced that it will no longer accept political advertising, while Facebook took the opposite position and refused to ban political ads. Of course, a policy on paid ads doesn\u2019t address questions about search results for unpaid content, or ads that are not technically political, like paid promotion of news stories. The words used in headlines, for example, may carry a strong connotation of approval or disapproval of a politician\u2019s actions. Most people won\u2019t read the whole story to get both sides.</p><p> However, we\u2019re in extremely dangerous territory here, on the slipperiest of slopes. Last April, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke of regulating the tech companies to prevent \u201cpolitical censorship\u201d on their platforms. That might sound good to some people, until we get to the part where enforcement requires tech companies to report to the government what is being said and how often, and by whom.</p><p> It is far more dangerous to allow the government to regulate the means of communication than it is to let lies roam free on the internet. Freedom of speech requires strict limits on the power of government.

If you search for a glue gun, your search results will show you glue guns, not squirt guns or gun safes or DVDs of \u201cTop Gun.\u201d Then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll click one of the products at the top of the search results, rather than scroll through pages of products or click away to another site.</p><p> For everyone involved, search rankings can be the difference between phenomenal success and utter failure. So there\u2019s an ongoing battle between the people who are trying to manipulate the search engines and the tech companies that want to prevent the manipulation. Search algorithms are secret and often changed. This game of cat-and-mouse is one reason that a website or product may suddenly stop showing up at the top of search results. When changes are made to stop fraudsters, legitimate sites that were highly ranked before may drop down to the middle of page 3.</p><p> This became everybody\u2019s problem when it began to affect political content.</p><p> In May 2018, just before the statewide primary election in California, a Google search for \u201cCalifornia Republican Party\u201d brought up a prominently displayed \u201cknowledge panel\u201d that listed the party\u2019s primary ideologies as conservatism, market liberalism and Nazism. House majority leader Kevin McCarthy posted a screenshot of the search result and said it was a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d</p><p> Did the well-known liberal politics of Silicon Valley lead Google employees to defame the Republican Party by falsely associating it with Nazis? Did the search results persuade voters to turn away from Republican candidates?</p><p> The answer to the first question, according to a Google spokesperson, is no. The Nazi reference on the CAGOP search result was drawn from a vandalized Wikipedia page for the California Republican Party. Somebody made a malicious change to the online encyclopedia, which was live on that site from</p><p> May 24 to May 30. Google \u201cscraped\u201d Wikipedia\u2019s content and indexed it, and that\u2019s how Nazism showed up in search results for the California Republican Party. \u201cWe have systems in place that catch vandalism before it impacts search results, but occasionally errors get through, and that\u2019s what happened here,\u201d the Google spokesperson said.</p><p> That\u2019s small consolation to the California Republican Party, which is still plagued by the slander in search results that call up stories about the vandalism incident.</p><p> How many voters were influenced by seeing the words \u201cNazi\u201d and \u201cRepublican\u201d on their screens at the same time? There\u2019s no way to know, but by the end of the 2018 election cycle, McCarthy was the House minority, not majority, leader.</p><p> One researcher has concluded that \u201cephemeral\u201d search results, including the words that briefly appear on your screen as search suggestions while you\u2019re typing, can \u201cshift the percentage of undecided voters supporting a political candidate by a substantial margin without anyone knowing.\u201d Dr. Robert Epstein, the former editor i -chief of Psychology Today, has testified before the U.S. Senate about this Search Engine Manipulation Effect. In a 2018 article titled \u201cTaming Big Tech,\u201d he wrote that his team of researchers had estimated that \u201cGoogle\u2019s search engine \u2014 with or without any deliberate planning by Google employees \u2014 was currently determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the world\u2019s national elections.\u201d</p><p> Epstein would like to launch a monitoring project to capture ephemeral search results in order to get hard data about what people are seeing online when they  search, and how they are influenced by it. That might help researchers figure out whether search results are affected by tech company bias, or perhaps by dozens of people clicking links in Bangladesh.</p><p> The stakes are high, and tech companies are under pressure from all sides. Twitter announced that it will no longer accept political advertising, while Facebook took the opposite position and refused to ban political ads. Of course, a policy on paid ads doesn\u2019t address questions about search results for unpaid content, or ads that are not technically political, like paid promotion of news stories. The words used in headlines, for example, may carry a strong connotation of approval or disapproval of a politician\u2019s actions. Most people won\u2019t read the whole story to get both sides.</p><p> However, we\u2019re in extremely dangerous territory here, on the slipperiest of slopes. Last April, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke of regulating the tech companies to prevent \u201cpolitical censorship\u201d on their platforms. That might sound good to some people, until we get to the part where enforcement requires tech companies to report to the government what is being said and how often, and by whom.</p><p> It is far more dangerous to allow the government to regulate the means of communication than it is to let lies roam free on the internet. Freedom of speech requires strict limits on the power of government.

For PR practitioners, it can be a rocky and sometimes challenging landscape to navigate. One thing we can agree on is the need for more transparency among all parties</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was over two decades ago that the Internet was in its infancy. Since then, it has had a significant impact on the way we live. It's brought sweeping changes to how we communicate, work, shop, date, and travel. In those early days, especially after the first dot-com bust, no one could truly envision what was to come. And as such, tech companies had a fairly open playing field. Relatively little regulation actually paved the way for innovation, and tech companies thrived. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft aren't called the \"Big Five\" for nothing. However, many of these technological and lifestyle shifts have come at a cost.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Significant innovation at a price?</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fast forward to today, where millions of us have willingly traded our privacy for free access to social networking platforms and other content. We carry around smartphones that we rely on for much more than phone calls. Data breaches and wide scale hacking are everyday occupational hazards for banks, social networks, entertainment companies and governments, to name a few. More than ever, it's important for us to speak the same language in order to formulate solutions that enable investment and innovation that benefit the individual.</p><p>We're now witnessing a reckoning among elected officials, Wall Street bankers and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to better understand each other. One example is the recent testimony given by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg on Capitol Hill. Utah Senator Orrin Hatch asked Zuckerburg, \"How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?\" To which Zuckerberg replied. \"Senator, we run ads.\" Tempting as it may be to look down at lawmakers' confusion about Facebook's business model, it's also not entirely off the mark. Plenty of consumers have a limited idea of how Facebook's business works, what happens to their personal data, and what they can do to tighten control over their privacy. Not just on Facebook, but across the various touchpoints we all make daily with the Internet.</p><p>Clearly there is still a disconnect. But increasing regulations means grappling with complicated questions. Namely, how do you balance the free thinking that has fueled the internet's success with laws that also rein it in? As PR professionals, we know the importance of communication and this situation is no different. There needs to be constant, open dialogue between all parties to agree on a set of regulations that will protect us but also continue to encourage the innovation which spurred the Internet in the first place.</p><p>The Internet Bill of Rights is proposing exactly that. It's a set of principles that gives users more control of their online lives while creating a better Internet economy. Representative Ro Khanna from California recently unveiled a list of 10 points he hopes will guide data privacy laws to protect U.S. citizens in today's digital age. It calls for, among other things, consumers' right to Internet service without the unnecessary data collection, notification in a timely manner if a company holding personal data has a security breach, opt-in permission for data collection and greater transparency in the collection of data and what it's used for by companies.</p><p>This is even more important because of what's at stake today. The Internet and data usage goes far beyond fake accounts on Twitter or cloned accounts on Facebook. There's more real-life implications we face. In the not too distant future, technological advances such as autonomous vehicles, remote surgery and augmented reality will demand even greater performance from the internet. With no predictable rules for how the Internet works, it would be very challenging to meet the requirements of these new technology advancements.</p><p>Bearing all this in mind, what does this mean for us as communications professionals? After the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica data breach in March, Facebook rolled out an ad campaign that harkens back to its roots and promises to do more to keep consumers safe and protect our privacy. Uber also released a campaign showcasing its new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, and his renewed commitment to Uber customers in an attempt to salvage its reputation after the former CEO was ousted.</p><p>The backlash these companies faced brought to light not only how influential big tech has become - the Big Five in particular - but how much sway they've gained with the public. Does this decline in brand reputation signify a shift in consumer confidence? Because customer privacy data is a major competitive edge of these big tech companies, it means the level of risk and uncertainty has increased. And in the wake of this decline, transparent communications remains crucial. Companies regardless of size need to do the right thing by their users and develop and maintain a strong and consistent accompanying message.</p><p>Consumer consensus is that it's long past time to see something like the Internet Bill of Rights put in place. And while historically, tech companies had opposed any sort of regulation, experts say that some kind of federal data privacy law is inevitable and more recently the tech industry seems to be on board. In September, executives from Amazon, Apple and others testified before the Senate Commerce Committee about concerns that lawmakers had over privacy and publicly declared support for a new federal privacy law. So, progress is being made. But lawmakers and tech companies will need to come together to answer the very important question of how we protect consumer privacy without stunting Internet innovation.</p><p>This Internet Bill of Rights is coming at a critical time. It's sparking much needed conversation between lawmakers, tech companies and consumers. We have a responsibility to protect the Internet and should want to uphold a just Internet because it's in our best interests to do so - not just to avoid a fine or persecution. As I mentioned, no one could have ever predicted what the Internet would become, and it's hard to imagine now where it will be in another 20 years. But one thing everyone can agree on from Capitol Hill to Wall Street to Silicon Valley: we all have a responsibility to communicate openly amongst each other to protect and uphold one of the most impactful creations ever made.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSRVS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRSRVS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR0-39K1-DYRW-V005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1043\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 J.R.

It is a smart article that seeks to channel the regulation of mass-distributed content through Internet platforms, especially in the European Union and the United Kingdom. The Founder of Facebook is part of a no-brainer that fans on both sides of the spectrum intentionally forget: a balance must be sought between freedom of expression and security, privacy and law enforcement. </p><p>Raising censorship on the grounds of protecting citizens can easily restrict democratic freedoms. Not regulating at all can make the Internet a paradise for paedophiles, terrorists and criminals, or a soundboard for hate speech. The same reasons that at the time gave rise to the regulation of broadcast content are those that are now being discussed in Europe and which for our legislators and regulators seem distant and unattainable, as if they were still living in the 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Zuckerberg's article, Facebook made a number of regulatory proposals to the European Commission, which he itself summed up as an intermediate place among newspapers, which are fully responsible for what they publish, and telecommunications companies, who assume no responsibility for the content of communications that run over their networks. It should be noted that this, in the case of Mexico, is not the case. With regard to newspapers, the main person responsible is the author of the text and, in any case, the newspaper would have only a subsidiary civil liability and that in respect of the right of reply. For its part, in the case of telecommunications companies, we must distinguish between personal-to-person communication, in which, in fact, the telecommunications company has no responsibility for what those persons say to each other, and the restricted television, for example, in which both the company and the programming channels have certain responsibilities for the content. Finally, it should be remembered that, as I have already explained in this space in accordance with Mexican law, Internet platforms are telecommunications companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Zuckerberg's article and Facebook's proposal take place in an environment where the European Commission will issue regulation on Artificial Intelligence and raise the level of responsibility of online content platforms with the New Digital Services Act expected by the end of 2020. For its part, the UK government is working on legislation to give Ofcom, the telecommunications and broadcasting regulator, the power to regulate and monitor the content of online platforms, particularly as it does to children's rights, hate speech, pornography and terrorism. What is striking is that both in the European Union and in the UK are considering large platforms on the Internet as broadcasting, as a message reaches an audience of hundreds of millions.

The five biggest technology firms\u2014Alphabet (Google's parent), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft\u2014have published financial results in recent weeks that put their combined quarterly revenues at $143bn. Yet this rude financial health conceals a more troubling long-term trend: governments, long willing to let internet firms act as they wish, are increasingly trying to tie them down. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This goes far beyond the latest row over sexism and tolerance of diverse political viewpoints in Silicon Valley, sparked by a memo written by a Google employee (see next article). Scarcely a week passes without a sign of the shift in attitudes. On August 1st Amber Rudd, Britain's home secretary, warned that unless the firms did more to block extremist content from their platforms, they would be forced to do so by new laws. Stephen Bannon, the chief strategist at the White House, reportedly wants to regulate Facebook and Google as utilities. Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, has talked of taking action against Amazon because it allegedly does not pay its fair share of tax.</p><p>Under pressure from the Chinese government, Apple removed several \"virtual private networks\" (VPNs)\u2014services that enable users to bypass China's censorship apparatus\u2014from its local app store. In June Canada's Supreme Court ordered Google to stop its search engine returning a result advertising a product that infringed on a firm's intellectual property. And on August 9th it emerged that the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, which preserves old versions of edited web pages, has been blocked in India, apparently by order of the department of telecommunications.</p><p>The examples vary, but they amount to a significant change in the regulatory environment. When the internet went mainstream in the late 1990s, tech firms and most democratic governments embraced its global nature. Firms operated largely free from onerous rules (blocking pornography featuring children has been the main exception). </p><p>One reason is technological. It has become easier to enforce borders in cyberspace. Tools that use \"IP addresses\", the numbers that identify internet connections, have become much better at enabling online firms and regulators to work out where users are. The shift to smartphones has increased governments' power. App stores have local links, for example to payment services, which make it easier to monitor and control users' activity. </p><p>Meanwhile, as the internet has penetrated every aspect of life offline, incumbents from publishers to carmakers are coming to see the tech titans as a threat to their survival. Indeed, tech firms are easy targets for anyone worried about change. They employ relatively few people, and pay little tax. President Donald Trump does not see them as natural allies, as Barack Obama did. (Mr Obama's administration was packed with former Google employees.) Some governments are unsettled by the growing role in their national lives of firms whose values are distinctively American, in particular in their commitment to free speech ahead of privacy. </p><p>One consequence of governments' fading deference towards tech firms is a more muscular approach towards taxation. Apple is expected soon to put ?13bn ($15.3bn) into an escrow account while courts consider its appeal against last year's ruling by the European Commission that the firm owed back taxes in Ireland, home to its European headquarters. Another consequence is public policies that pay little heed to their needs, for example on immigration. Mr Trump has complained that tech firms import foreign workers rather than hiring Americans, and has ordered a review of the rules governing work visas.</p><p>For more than two decades internet platforms have largely been treated as intermediaries. They have been seen as more like telecom companies, which may transmit criminal material for which they are not liable, than media firms, which can be prosecuted or sued for what they publish. Now, governments in America and Europe are starting to hold them responsible for what their users do and say. Germany is the most striking example. From October 1st it will require social-media platforms to take down hate speech, such as Holocaust denial, within 24 hours or face fines of up to ?50m. </p><p>Under Germany's law, the clock starts when firms are alerted by users or the authorities. But some governments are thinking of requiring firms to block some objectionable content as soon as it appears (as they already do with child porn). Britain's government, for example, wants them to block Islamist propaganda, such as videos of beheadings. It has ignored tech firms' complaints that this will be difficult and costly. Distinguishing such content from mainstream reporting on the war in Syria is harder than sifting out child porn. Automated techniques will block some legitimate content. Humans will often have to make the final decision.</p><p>Tech firms have been building barriers in cyberspace for some time. Their aim has been commercial: to keep users within \"walled gardens\" where it is easier to sell them services. But governments are also erecting borders\u2014and theirs are more constraining. Like China, Russia plans to clamp down on VPNs. Both countries now require data on domestic users to be stored within their borders. Such data-localisation rules are a growing problem in democratic countries, too. In January the European Commission complained about \"unjustified restrictions on the free movement of data\" within the EU. </p><p>Even as the internet starts to fragment into local versions, some countries are trying to extend their legal reach beyond their borders. In the past internet firms would ignore requests from governments that sought to censor what people elsewhere saw online, for example requests originating in Thailand, with its stifling l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws that ban all criticism of its king. But now some democracies are passing extraterritorial laws that seek to regulate online content wherever it appears. \"We risk a heckler's veto, where any single country can get a piece of information removed not just within that country but anywhere around the world,\" says Alan Davidson, who served in Mr Obama's administration and is now a fellow at the New America Foundation, a think-tank.</p><p>The Canadian ruling against Google, which applies worldwide, could be just the start. Later this year the European Court of Justice will decide whether the EU's much-contested \"right to be forgotten\" applies not just to Google's European sites, but to all of them. This would mean that links to information about people that is deemed \"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant\" in the EU will no longer be returned in response to any Google search anywhere. If the firm does not comply, it may face stiff fines.</p><p>The biggest long-term threat to tech firms is probably antitrust law. Regulators, particularly in America, have long held that online, competition is only a click away. But they are increasingly concluding that even in cyberspace competition can be restricted by dominant firms, for instance when the tech giants buy up smaller rivals before they mature into a threat, or discriminate against their offerings (for example, in search rankings). Governments have also started to fret about foreign data monopolies, which they think hoover up local information and turn it into valuable artificial-intelligence services.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Europe has produced no big digital platform of its own, such thinking is common in the EU. In June the European Commission hit Google with a ?2.4bn fine for abusing its \"monopoly\" in online search. But elsewhere, too, regulators are becoming more active. In Japan the head of the Fair Trade Commission has warned that exclusive access to data could be used to restrict competition. Even in America, such thinking is gaining ground.</p><p>As tech giants build up their offline presence, they can expect regulatory scrutiny to increase still further. Though Amazon has so far got off lightly, its recent purchase of Whole Foods, an American grocer, is likely to change that. Amazon's fulfilment centres (warehouses from which products are shipped) have created hundreds of thousands of jobs; earlier this month it sought to hire 50,000 people across America in one day. That has given it brownie points with governments. But as more retail jobs are lost to e-commerce, and positions at Amazon become automated, the mood could shift. Amazon is not alone in venturing into the physical world. Google is experimenting with self-driving cars and Facebook with drones, which will bring new headaches and increased oversight.</p><p>The tech giants are not all equally vulnerable. As a legacy of the antitrust investigations it faced in the 2000s, Microsoft still has plenty of lawyers and lobbyists. It also comes under less scrutiny than Facebook and Google, which play a bigger role in consumers' daily lives. Both firms are now ramping up their lobbying operations, having seen how Microsoft only belatedly recognised the risks that accompany commercial dominance. Google, for example, has around 500 people in its public-affairs and regulatory team, only a handful of whom work from its headquarters in California. Many are based in Europe. \"Each company learns from the mistakes of those that went before,\" says Mr Davidson. </p><p>Complying with a proliferation of new laws means expanding local teams: Facebook is planning to have 650 \"moderators\" in Germany to enable it to respond to takedown requests within the stipulated 24 hours. Services and technical infrastructure are also becoming more fragmented. On August 4th it emerged that Google had agreed to tighten monitoring of terrorist and other offensive material on its YouTube video-sharing service in Indonesia. Amazon and Microsoft, for their part, have built data centres in certain jurisdictions, such as Germany, to be able to comply with data-protection rules.</p><p>The firms hope that funding local initiatives will help curb resentment. Google's \"Growth Engine for Europe\" aims, among other things, to help small businesses hone their digital skills. Facebook's \"Journalism Project\" will seek to fight fake news and to develop new subscription services with publishers, including Axel Springer, which played a big part in the campaign against Google in Europe. In October Microsoft published a book that could easily be mistaken for a political party's manifesto. It lists dozens of detailed public-policy recommendations, ranging from protecting privacy to fighting cybercrime. Amazon, which faced criticism a few years ago for its working conditions, has started offering public tours of its fulfilment centres in Europe. </p><p>Governments sometimes have good reason to claim sovereignty over the digital realm. They are responsible for national security and elected to uphold national laws. But their regulatory push threatens to create a \"splinternet\", with national borders reproduced in cyberspace. That would harm the internet's function as an open forum where people can communicate freely and come up with new global products and services\u2014which is precisely what made it great in the first place. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-TN6M2SK</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P6Y-WVF1-JBKN-B01D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1875\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

The five biggest technology firms\u2014Alphabet (Google's parent), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft\u2014have published financial results in recent weeks that put their combined quarterly revenues at $143bn. Yet this rude financial health conceals a more troubling long-term trend: governments, long willing to let internet firms act as they wish, are increasingly trying to tie them down. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This goes far beyond the latest row over sexism and tolerance of diverse political viewpoints in Silicon Valley, sparked by a memo written by a Google employee (see next article). Scarcely a week passes without a sign of the shift in attitudes. On August 1st Amber Rudd, Britain's home secretary, warned that unless the firms did more to block extremist content from their platforms, they would be forced to do so by new laws. Stephen Bannon, the chief strategist at the White House, reportedly wants to regulate Facebook and Google as utilities. Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, has talked of taking action against Amazon because it allegedly does not pay its fair share of tax.</p><p>Under pressure from the Chinese government, Apple removed several \"virtual private networks\" (VPNs)\u2014services that enable users to bypass China's censorship apparatus\u2014from its local app store. In June Canada's Supreme Court ordered Google to stop its search engine returning a result advertising a product that infringed on a firm's intellectual property. And on August 9th it emerged that the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, which preserves old versions of edited web pages, has been blocked in India, apparently by order of the department of telecommunications.</p><p>The examples vary, but they amount to a significant change in the regulatory environment. When the internet went mainstream in the late 1990s, tech firms and most democratic governments embraced its global nature. Firms operated largely free from onerous rules (blocking pornography featuring children has been the main exception). </p><p>One reason is technological. It has become easier to enforce borders in cyberspace. Tools that use \"IP addresses\", the numbers that identify internet connections, have become much better at enabling online firms and regulators to work out where users are. The shift to smartphones has increased governments' power. App stores have local links, for example to payment services, which make it easier to monitor and control users' activity. </p><p>Meanwhile, as the internet has penetrated every aspect of life offline, incumbents from publishers to carmakers are coming to see the tech titans as a threat to their survival. Indeed, tech firms are easy targets for anyone worried about change. They employ relatively few people, and pay little tax. President Donald Trump does not see them as natural allies, as Barack Obama did. (Mr Obama's administration was packed with former Google employees.) Some governments are unsettled by the growing role in their national lives of firms whose values are distinctively American, in particular in their commitment to free speech ahead of privacy. </p><p>One consequence of governments' fading deference towards tech firms is a more muscular approach towards taxation. Apple is expected soon to put ?13bn ($15.3bn) into an escrow account while courts consider its appeal against last year's ruling by the European Commission that the firm owed back taxes in Ireland, home to its European headquarters. Another consequence is public policies that pay little heed to their needs, for example on immigration. Mr Trump has complained that tech firms import foreign workers rather than hiring Americans, and has ordered a review of the rules governing work visas.</p><p>For more than two decades internet platforms have largely been treated as intermediaries. They have been seen as more like telecom companies, which may transmit criminal material for which they are not liable, than media firms, which can be prosecuted or sued for what they publish. Now, governments in America and Europe are starting to hold them responsible for what their users do and say. Germany is the most striking example. From October 1st it will require social-media platforms to take down hate speech, such as Holocaust denial, within 24 hours or face fines of up to ?50m. </p><p>Under Germany's law, the clock starts when firms are alerted by users or the authorities. But some governments are thinking of requiring firms to block some objectionable content as soon as it appears (as they already do with child porn). Britain's government, for example, wants them to block Islamist propaganda, such as videos of beheadings. It has ignored tech firms' complaints that this will be difficult and costly. Distinguishing such content from mainstream reporting on the war in Syria is harder than sifting out child porn. Automated techniques will block some legitimate content. Humans will often have to make the final decision.</p><p>Tech firms have been building barriers in cyberspace for some time. Their aim has been commercial: to keep users within \"walled gardens\" where it is easier to sell them services. But governments are also erecting borders\u2014and theirs are more constraining. Like China, Russia plans to clamp down on VPNs. Both countries now require data on domestic users to be stored within their borders. Such data-localisation rules are a growing problem in democratic countries, too. In January the European Commission complained about \"unjustified restrictions on the free movement of data\" within the EU. </p><p>Even as the internet starts to fragment into local versions, some countries are trying to extend their legal reach beyond their borders. In the past internet firms would ignore requests from governments that sought to censor what people elsewhere saw online, for example requests originating in Thailand, with its stifling l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws that ban all criticism of its king. But now some democracies are passing extraterritorial laws that seek to regulate online content wherever it appears. \"We risk a heckler's veto, where any single country can get a piece of information removed not just within that country but anywhere around the world,\" says Alan Davidson, who served in Mr Obama's administration and is now a fellow at the New America Foundation, a think-tank.</p><p>The Canadian ruling against Google, which applies worldwide, could be just the start. Later this year the European Court of Justice will decide whether the EU's much-contested \"right to be forgotten\" applies not just to Google's European sites, but to all of them. This would mean that links to information about people that is deemed \"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant\" in the EU will no longer be returned in response to any Google search anywhere. If the firm does not comply, it may face stiff fines.</p><p>The biggest long-term threat to tech firms is probably antitrust law. Regulators, particularly in America, have long held that online, competition is only a click away. But they are increasingly concluding that even in cyberspace competition can be restricted by dominant firms, for instance when the tech giants buy up smaller rivals before they mature into a threat, or discriminate against their offerings (for example, in search rankings). Governments have also started to fret about foreign data monopolies, which they think hoover up local information and turn it into valuable artificial-intelligence services.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Europe has produced no big digital platform of its own, such thinking is common in the EU. In June the European Commission hit Google with a ?2.4bn fine for abusing its \"monopoly\" in online search. But elsewhere, too, regulators are becoming more active. In Japan the head of the Fair Trade Commission has warned that exclusive access to data could be used to restrict competition. Even in America, such thinking is gaining ground.</p><p>As tech giants build up their offline presence, they can expect regulatory scrutiny to increase still further. Though Amazon has so far got off lightly, its recent purchase of Whole Foods, an American grocer, is likely to change that. Amazon's fulfilment centres (warehouses from which products are shipped) have created hundreds of thousands of jobs; earlier this month it sought to hire 50,000 people across America in one day. That has given it brownie points with governments. But as more retail jobs are lost to e-commerce, and positions at Amazon become automated, the mood could shift. Amazon is not alone in venturing into the physical world. Google is experimenting with self-driving cars and Facebook with drones, which will bring new headaches and increased oversight.</p><p>The tech giants are not all equally vulnerable. As a legacy of the antitrust investigations it faced in the 2000s, Microsoft still has plenty of lawyers and lobbyists. It also comes under less scrutiny than Facebook and Google, which play a bigger role in consumers' daily lives. Both firms are now ramping up their lobbying operations, having seen how Microsoft only belatedly recognised the risks that accompany commercial dominance. Google, for example, has around 500 people in its public-affairs and regulatory team, only a handful of whom work from its headquarters in California. Many are based in Europe. \"Each company learns from the mistakes of those that went before,\" says Mr Davidson. </p><p>Complying with a proliferation of new laws means expanding local teams: Facebook is planning to have 650 \"moderators\" in Germany to enable it to respond to takedown requests within the stipulated 24 hours. Services and technical infrastructure are also becoming more fragmented. On August 4th it emerged that Google had agreed to tighten monitoring of terrorist and other offensive material on its YouTube video-sharing service in Indonesia. Amazon and Microsoft, for their part, have built data centres in certain jurisdictions, such as Germany, to be able to comply with data-protection rules.</p><p>The firms hope that funding local initiatives will help curb resentment. Google's \"Growth Engine for Europe\" aims, among other things, to help small businesses hone their digital skills. Facebook's \"Journalism Project\" will seek to fight fake news and to develop new subscription services with publishers, including Axel Springer, which played a big part in the campaign against Google in Europe. In October Microsoft published a book that could easily be mistaken for a political party's manifesto. It lists dozens of detailed public-policy recommendations, ranging from protecting privacy to fighting cybercrime. Amazon, which faced criticism a few years ago for its working conditions, has started offering public tours of its fulfilment centres in Europe. </p><p>Governments sometimes have good reason to claim sovereignty over the digital realm. They are responsible for national security and elected to uphold national laws. But their regulatory push threatens to create a \"splinternet\", with national borders reproduced in cyberspace. That would harm the internet's function as an open forum where people can communicate freely and come up with new global products and services\u2014which is precisely what made it great in the first place. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-TN6M2SK</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P8F-P6R1-DY2R-201D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1875\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon - which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use - can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports.</p><p>EARLY TECH RESISTANCE</p><p>The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn't standing still - and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve.</p><p>Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook - lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with <person><nameText>Sen. Ed Markey, </nameText></person>a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality.</p><p>Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules.</p><p>Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time.</p><p>CALM BEFORE THE STORM</p><p>The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflixand Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback.</p><p>Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was \"extremely well received,\" according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.)</p><p>Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.)</p><p>At least one big supporter of net neutrality - Netflix- has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality \"on a public policy basis.\"</p><p>WHAT COMES NEXT</p><p>The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause.</p><p>In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to \"blacklist\" sites from the internet.</p><p>Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped.</p><p>In 2014, smaller companies held an \"internet slowdown\" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a \"site loading\" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue.</p><p>For the moment, though, there's no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won't be until there's an actual FCC proposal up for debate.</p><p>And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. \"Next steps haven't been figured out yet,\" Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. \"I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,\" said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-4711204</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5ND9-3KR1-JCX4-60M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 26, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>ORCL (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nation &amp;

Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favorites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon \u2014 which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use \u2014 can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora.Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. </p><p>Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports. EARLY TECH RESISTANCE Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn't standing still \u2014 and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook \u2014 lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules.Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback.Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was 'extremely well received,' according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.)Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality \u2014 Netflix \u2014 has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality 'on a public policy basis.' WHAT COMES NEXTThe tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to 'blacklist' sites from the internet.Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an 'internet slowdown' event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a 'site loading' icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. For the moment, though, there's no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won't be until there's an actual FCC proposal up for debate. And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. 'Next steps haven't been figured out yet,' Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. 'I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,' said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.

Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon - which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use - can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports.</p><p>Early tech resistance</p><p>The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers.

Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with <person><nameText>Sen. Ed Markey, </nameText></person>a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality.</p><p>Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules.</p><p>Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time.</p><p>Calm before the storm</p><p>The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflixand Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback.</p><p>Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was 'extremely well received,' according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.)</p><p>Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.)</p><p>At least one big supporter of net neutrality - Netflix- has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality 'on a public policy basis.'</p><p>What comes next</p><p>The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause.</p><p>In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to 'blacklist' sites from the internet.</p><p>Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped.</p><p>In 2014, smaller companies held an 'internet slowdown' event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a 'site loading' icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue.</p><p>For the moment, though, there's no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won't be until there's an actual FCC proposal up for debate.</p><p>And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. 'Next steps haven't been figured out yet,' Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago.</p><p>'I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,' said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PDYINQ-PDI26042017000363</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PDYINQ2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NDJ-9S91-JCH9-G446-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400855</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"796\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Philippines Daily Inquirer All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Philippines Daily Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 26, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>ORCL (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC's broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&amp;T and Comcast for bad behavior.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pai, the nation's chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. The FCC plans to release an official proposal for the vote on Thursday.</p><p>Pai doesn't have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality, but is seeking input on how to \"approach\" its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net-neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon -- which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use -- can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora.</p><p>He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality.</p><p>EARLY TECH RESISTANCE</p><p>The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn't stood still as Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve.</p><p>Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook -- lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with <person><nameText>Sen. Ed Markey, </nameText></person>a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality.</p><p>Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called up small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules.</p><p>Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time.</p><p>CALM BEFORE THE STORM</p><p>The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, earlier called on Pai to support net neutrality, and Wednesday issued a statement warning that his changes would \"result in a worse internet for consumers.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was \"extremely well received,\" according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.)</p><p>Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.)</p><p>At least one big supporter of net neutrality -- Netflix -- has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality \"on a public policy basis.\"</p><p>WHAT COMES NEXT</p><p>The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause.</p><p>In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to \"blacklist\" sites from the internet.</p><p>Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped.</p><p>In 2014, smaller companies held an \"internet slowdown\" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a \"site loading\" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue.</p><p>But until Wednesday, there had been no net-neutrality development to rally around.</p><p>\"Next steps haven't been figured out yet,\" Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago.</p><p>\"I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,\" said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-5220524</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NDH-D1C1-JCB3-X400-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"846\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 26, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>NET</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NEUTRALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>INTERNET</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>PAI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>RULES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FCC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FIGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SITES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008WWI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;
