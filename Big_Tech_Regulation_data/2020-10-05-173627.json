One that speaks to populist frustrations with Big Tech and environmental concerns about waste and that is already being adopted in other jurisdictions.</p><p>\"Right to repair\" is a growing movement of people fed up with being told they aren't allowed to fix the stuff they've paid a lot of money to own.</p><p>Whether you've been told a minor fix for your iPhone will cost $650, a replacement part for your two-year-old espresso maker isn't made any more, or it's illegal to repair your John Deere farm implement without using their own high-priced services, you're one of the 75 per cent of Canadians found by recent polls to be in support of government action that would force manufacturers to provide the necessary documents, parts and information to allow anyone to repair their products.</p><p>The movement has hit a nerve across the political spectrum and in both urban and rural communities. As a left-leaning west coast entrepreneur and a centre-right industrial Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, we're living proof of the broad appeal. And things are moving quickly. In the U.S., over 20 states are already developing \"right to repair\" laws. In Europe, the EU recently passed legislation that will cover products for a wide range of electronics.</p><p>But here in Canada, not so much.</p><p>Most of us grew up taking pride in our ability to repair things. But the situation has changed dramatically in recent years.</p><p>Companies have aggressively begun to block access to repair through an assortment of strategies. For example, many have stopped selling replacement parts or progressively marked up the pricing, so there's no choice but to by a new item. Manuals and technical information are made scarce as products age, or not made available at all. Important software is locked or unusable without authorized parts or repair systems. All this leaves consumers at the mercy of manufacturers who can charge whatever fees they want. The calculated result is higher costs, more consumption, greater waste.</p><p>Obviously, the companies that invest in creating the products need to get a fair return on servicing and replacement sales but allowing monopolistic behaviour like this distorts markets, discourages innovation, gouges consumers and creates environmental problems.</p><p>Instead, let's take action to encourage a more circular economy, one that builds resilience and economic opportunity by encouraging reuse, repair and recycling.</p><p>A small regulatory change can make a big difference. Providing reasonable access to parts and information after a manufacturer stops supporting a product would be a good start. Not just for our pocketbooks and landfills, but maybe for our divided parliament and our national mood too.</p><p>Glen Lougheed is a high tech entrepreneur who advises the BCNDP on innovation policy.</p><p>Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Beland is cleantech executive with a public policy and public finance background.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019120856566443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP5-X8X1-DY91-K019-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;

Many apps and products are initially set up to be public: Instagram accounts are open to everyone until you lock them, and the whole world can see whom you split utilities with until you make your Venmo private. Even when companies announce convenient shortcuts for enhancing security, their products can never become truly private. Strangers may not be able to see your selfies, but you have no way to untether yourself from the larger ad-targeting ecosystem.</p><p><br/>That lack of definitive privacy has come to the fore over the past few weeks as Google and Amazon each announced shortcuts to mitigate \"always on\" tracking-if users choose to enable them. Amazon Echo users can <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/amazon-adds-alexa-delete-what-i-said-today-command/\">clear 24 hours of stored voice commands</url> by saying, \"Alexa, delete what I said today.\" Google       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535657/google-incognito-mode-search-youtube-maps-private-io-2019\">announced at its I/O meeting</url> in early May that Google Maps will eventually feature an \"incognito mode\" that turns off tracking. While it's enabled, users' location won't be added to their profile or used to inform ad data. (Google declined to comment for this article; Amazon confirmed the details of its history-clearing feature but did not elaborate further.)<br/>While the packaging for these features is shiny and new, the substance behind them is not. Users could always use Maps while logged out of their Google profile and manually delete stored Echo messages by logging in to their Amazon account. The recently announced features are faster and require less searching through menus, but privacy and ethical-design experts are unimpressed by the measures. While useful, they argue, the new policies do very little to shift the needle.<br/>Mona Sloane is a professor at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University, where she researches ethical-design principles in engineering and artificial intelligence. The first problem with privacy features that can only pause, not stop, surveillance, she argues, is that users have to enable these features themselves. \"Outsourcing that is a way of circumnavigating and avoiding responsibility,\" Sloane says. \"It's a way of maintaining the core business model, which is generating as much data as possible.\"<br/>For both products, the default remains: You can pause tracking, but you can't stop it. Users can't tell Alexa never to store their Echo commands to begin with, nor can they preemptively tell Google to never track them while they're logged in to the Maps app.<br/>The new shortcuts seem targeted at a user base that's fed up after two years of big-tech privacy breaches and surveillance scandals.

Cahn says that consumers' perceptions of risk and reward when they're shopping for smart products are changing. With each new scandal, wary shoppers become more convinced that it's not worth wagering their privacy to use tracking software. These incognito-style moves are, in Cahn's opinion, designed as damage control to get back in buyers' good graces.<br/>Cahn described shoppers' new caution as an \"existential threat\" to tech companies. \"They're fearful of what lawmakers will do,\" he says, \"and they're trying to win back our trust with these measures that create the illusion of privacy, but don't threaten their core business model.\"<br/>Those business models, some scholars argue, often become tech companies' ethics, shaping how they design their products. Ben Wagner, a professor at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, has found in his research that companies do embrace ethical principles after privacy backlashes. But those principles don't necessarily adhere to the same values that consumers use. Wagner       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.privacylab.at/1064/ethics-as-an-escape-from-regulation-from-ethics-washing-to-ethics-shopping/\">wrote about</url> the risks of this disconnect in 2018, noting that firms regularly engage in \"ethics washing\" and \"ethics shopping,\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/ege/pdf/ege_ai_statement_2018.pdf\">phrases borrowed from an earlier</url> European Union report on governing AI.<br/>Both terms are useful here. Ethics shopping is when companies pick and choose self-guided frameworks to uphold based on what suits their bottom line. It's only possible when regulation over an industry is weak or patchwork, as it is with AI and data collection. Ethics washing refers to the tactics companies employ to avoid substantial oversight, such as announcing advisory boards, employing token measures like incognito modes, and even calling for the government to (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/12/06/facial-recognition-its-time-for-action/\">lightly</url>) rein in the industry. Many of these measures are symbolic: The advisory boards may or may not have the authority to influence products and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/4/18295933/google-cancels-ai-ethics-board\">can be terminated</url> without notice. The stopgap measures still require users to be vigilant about their settings. A company can call for government oversight, and at the same time, as Microsoft recently did,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/201902/duelling-washington-state-facial-recognition-bills-spark-regulation-debate\">lobby against</url> specific policies it doesn't want.<br/>Tech companies are moving to become even more deeply embedded in our lives, which will only amplify the risks posed by security breaches. Google has filed patents for speakers that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/11/google-patent-bedroom-privacy-smart-home/576022/?utm_source=feed\">listen to you brushing your teeth</url> and smart cameras that scan your clothes to make product recommendations.

They will leave it up to users whether they want their data collected, how they want their data reused or appropriated, and most crucially, whether they want to exist in the ecosystem at all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-alexagoogleincognitomodenotrealprivacy590734</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8H-4V41-JCG7-V181-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1103\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Earlier in the year, Apple CEO  Tim Cook repeated a claim that \u201cthere will be a day we look back and say Apple\u2019s greatest contribution to mankind has been in health care.\u201d Meanwhile, Google Cloud CEO  Thomas Kurian wrote in September that \u201cwe can transform health care and improve lives.\u201d    Based on their past innovations (and earnings), there are very few things Apple and Google can\u2019t do. One of those things, I predict, will be transforming health care.    Three announcements suggest that Google and Apple stand to make a lot of money on health-related products and services. But none of their recent acquisitions or consumer plays will make a substantial impact where it matters most: On the quality and cost of U.S. health care. Here\u2019s why.    1. Consumer preferences are different than medical needs     Everyone knows fitness trackers are big business.  Nearly half of Americans  (49%) own one and, by 2022, the U.S. wearables market is expected to grow to  $27 billion with 137 million units sold .    That\u2019s partly the reason Google  acquired Fitbit for $2.1 billion  last month. And if the deal survives an upcoming  DOJ probe , Google could see a very healthy return on investment. But if you think Google is making this acquisition to solve the U.S. health crisis, think again.    A recent review of six studies found \u201cthere was  little indication that wearable devices provide a benefit  for health outcomes.\u201d Other research indicates  a third of people stop using their wearables within six months.    None of this should surprise us. If you look closely at what these devices actually do, you\u2019ll see they serve three basic functions. They can calculate our steps, but so can our smartphones or a $5 plastic pedometer. They also measure heart rate, but so can you by applying a finger to an artery, counting your pulse for 15 seconds and multiplying the number of beats by four. Finally, they tell users how well they slept the night before. Impressive, but then again, do people without trackers not know how well they slept? And if the device does successfully inform a user of a poor night\u2019s rest, what does it do to make the next night better?    Despite their limitations, wearables remain successful. That\u2019s because they solve an important problem, albeit not a health care problem. The issue these products address is called the \u201cDecember Dilemma.\u201d You\u2019ve probably experienced it: Christmas or Hanukkah is coming up, and you want to give your loved one a cool gift (between $100 and $200) that shows how much you care. Wearables solve this problem, just like inline skates did in the 1990s (even though half the recipients never opened the box again after December 25).    This acquisition is doubtlessly a consumer play, designed to connect Google\u2019s many products and services with  Fitbit\u2019s 28 million users . In consumer tech, volume is money: The more often consumers come to your platform, the more opportunities you have to sell.    The relatively upscale demographic of wearables wearers could greatly expand Google\u2019s market position, even if the product itself never saves a single life.    2. No major tech company is willing to accept medical liability     Last month, Stanford researchers published an Apple-sponsored study in the  New England Journal of Medicine , confirming that \u201coptical sensors on wearable devices can detect irregular pulses,\u201d a problem referred to by doctors as atrial fibrillation (AFib), which can lead to stroke.    This is a potentially valuable finding given that as many as  6.1 million Americans  might have the condition. But there was a lot wrong with the research, and the potential implications on patient health are worth noting.    Let\u2019s start with the demographics of Apple\u2019s self-described \u201c groundbreaking health study .\u201d Over an eight-month period, the company recruited more than 419,000 iPhone and Apple Watch users. The majority of enrollees were under 40 years of age. Only 6% were 65 or older. That\u2019s the first problem because, as pointed out in an associated  NEJM editorial , this group of people \u201cmay be the opposite of a desirable age profile for a study of atrial fibrillation.\u201d Currently, only 2% of people below age 65 have AFib compared to about 9% of people over 65.    Of those who opted-in (via an app), 0.52% received notifications of an irregular pulse. Of them, only 1 in 5 (450 people total) followed the next step in the study: receiving an  electrocardiogram patch  in the mail and sending the data along to Apple. This very low opt-in rate was the second problem.    Finally, there\u2019s no way to know how many of these 450 people already knew they had AFib. And that\u2019s problem number three. If Apple wanted the study to be groundbreaking, it wouldn\u2019t have excluded people with known AFib, it would have designed it for them. And it would start building applications to help them, medically.    The study\u2019s design protected Apple, legally, because the company didn\u2019t have to worry about what would happen if its heart-rate monitoring function occasionally failed to spot AFib. No one would know. And if a potential problem was spotted, all they had to do was notify the person and send the electrocardiogram patch to avoid liability.    Now, let\u2019s talk about how the watch could be more useful. Patients with AFib often take medications to regulate their heart rate. It would be both technically feasible and tremendously beneficial if the watch told these patients when their medication is working (and everything\u2019s under control) vs. when it\u2019s not (and they need to consult a physician). But that would create potential legal risks if the product malfunctioned or provided inappropriate medical advice.    A company the size of Apple is loath to put itself in such a financially precarious situation, even though it could transform health care delivery and save lives.    This type of monitoring device and patient-enabling software is what our nation needs, not just for those with AFib but also diabetes, asthma, and a host of other chronic conditions. If Apple wanted to make the \u201cgreatest contribution to mankind,\u201d it would aggressively move into each of areas of monitoring. Alas, it won\u2019t.    3. Tech companies will face major data-ownership issues ahead      According to a recent report in the  Wall Street Journal , Google\u2019s cloud division recently entered into a secretive agreement with Ascension, one of the nation\u2019s largest hospital systems. Together, they began collecting and crunching the personal-health data of 50 million patients across 21 states\u2014a collaboration code-named \u201c Project Nightingale .\u201d    Google has refused to comment on how it will use the data or what research function it will serve, but executives at Ascension promise the data won\u2019t be used to sell ads. Google concurs,  emphatically denying  it will compromise patient privacy.    It\u2019s worth noting that this clandestine exchange of identifiable patient data is 100% legal.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 \u201cgenerally allows hospitals to share data with business partners without telling patients, as long as the information is used \u2018only to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions,\u2019\u201d according to the Journal.    The law is silent, however, on the issue of whether companies can use the patient data to develop and sell new products. After all, without the 50 million Ascension patients (who never gave Google permission to access their personal health information), Google couldn\u2019t develop commercial consulting tools for others.    This is an ethical gray area, one that has put industry watchdogs on high alert. They note that health care is a very different kind of service than search because of dramatically different user expectations, fears, and risks.    When it comes to internet search, there\u2019s an implicit quid pro quo. In exchange for getting answers to questions at no cost, users give Google permission to sell their data to corporate bidders.    Health care is different. When patients receive care, they pay for the services rendered, either directly or through private insurance. So, if someone were to benefit financially from their medical information, shouldn\u2019t they get a cut?    It turns out there\u2019s precedent for this ethical quandary. Back in the early 1950s, Henrietta Lacks went to Johns Hopkins Hospital to have a tumor removed. During surgery, doctors took Ms. Lacks\u2019 cells without knowledge or permission and cloned them for generations of research projects. Today, vials of her cells continue to go for  up to $10,000 . Meanwhile, her family continues to fight for ownership rights.    A decade ago, Google launched  personal medical record service  that promised to help patients gain control of their medical information. Patients didn\u2019t trust the tech giant back then, and the effort shut down within three years.    As the company faces another federal probe, this time for its deal with Ascension, Google is learning how difficult it is to acquire and profit from medical data. Faced with this reality, I predict that instead of transforming care delivery, Google will end up tinkering at the edges. Google and Apple, along with Amazon and Facebook, have dollar signs in their eyes as they look at the size of the health care industry. As they see it, all 330 million Americans are patients and potential customers. Their respective platforms\u2014be it a smartwatch or a speaker or an online marketplace\u2014are all potential pathways toward making hundreds of millions off of health care.    But despite lofty promises, it\u2019s doubtful their products will transform American health care.    It\u2019s not that they couldn\u2019t. Big tech firms have the engineering and technical know-how to create powerful health care tools. But they won\u2019t be willing to take the risks involved or able to access the patient data required.    Robert Pearl  is a physician and CEO, Permanente Medical Groups.

Earlier in the year, Apple CEO  Tim Cook repeated a claim that \u201cthere will be a day we look back and say Apple\u2019s greatest contribution to mankind has been in health care.\u201d Meanwhile, Google Cloud CEO  Thomas Kurian wrote in September that \u201cwe can transform health care and improve lives.\u201d    Based on their past innovations (and earnings), there are very few things Apple and Google can\u2019t do. One of those things, I predict, will be transforming health care.    Three announcements suggest that Google and Apple stand to make a lot of money on health-related products and services. But none of their recent acquisitions or consumer plays will make a substantial impact where it matters most: On the quality and cost of U.S. health care. Here\u2019s why.    1. Consumer preferences are different than medical needs     Everyone knows fitness trackers are big business.  Nearly half of Americans  (49%) own one and, by 2022, the U.S. wearables market is expected to grow to  $27 billion with 137 million units sold .    That\u2019s partly the reason Google  acquired Fitbit for $2.1 billion  last month. And if the deal survives an upcoming  DOJ probe , Google could see a very healthy return on investment. But if you think Google is making this acquisition to solve the U.S. health crisis, think again.    A recent review of six studies found \u201cthere was  little indication that wearable devices provide a benefit  for health outcomes.\u201d Other research indicates  a third of people stop using their wearables within six months.    None of this should surprise us. If you look closely at what these devices actually do, you\u2019ll see they serve three basic functions. They can calculate our steps, but so can our smartphones or a $5 plastic pedometer. They also measure heart rate, but so can you by applying a finger to an artery, counting your pulse for 15 seconds and multiplying the number of beats by four. Finally, they tell users how well they slept the night before. Impressive, but then again, do people without trackers not know how well they slept? And if the device does successfully inform a user of a poor night\u2019s rest, what does it do to make the next night better?    Despite their limitations, wearables remain successful. That\u2019s because they solve an important problem, albeit not a health care problem. The issue these products address is called the \u201cDecember Dilemma.\u201d You\u2019ve probably experienced it: Christmas or Hanukkah is coming up, and you want to give your loved one a cool gift (between $100 and $200) that shows how much you care. Wearables solve this problem, just like inline skates did in the 1990s (even though half the recipients never opened the box again after December 25).    This acquisition is doubtlessly a consumer play, designed to connect Google\u2019s many products and services with  Fitbit\u2019s 28 million users . In consumer tech, volume is money: The more often consumers come to your platform, the more opportunities you have to sell.    The relatively upscale demographic of wearables wearers could greatly expand Google\u2019s market position, even if the product itself never saves a single life.    2. No major tech company is willing to accept medical liability     Last month, Stanford researchers published an Apple-sponsored study in the  New England Journal of Medicine , confirming that \u201coptical sensors on wearable devices can detect irregular pulses,\u201d a problem referred to by doctors as atrial fibrillation (AFib), which can lead to stroke.    This is a potentially valuable finding given that as many as  6.1 million Americans  might have the condition. But there was a lot wrong with the research, and the potential implications on patient health are worth noting.    Let\u2019s start with the demographics of Apple\u2019s self-described \u201c groundbreaking health study .\u201d Over an eight-month period, the company recruited more than 419,000 iPhone and Apple Watch users. The majority of enrollees were under 40 years of age. Only 6% were 65 or older. That\u2019s the first problem because, as pointed out in an associated  NEJM editorial , this group of people \u201cmay be the opposite of a desirable age profile for a study of atrial fibrillation.\u201d Currently, only 2% of people below age 65 have AFib compared to about 9% of people over 65.    Of those who opted-in (via an app), 0.52% received notifications of an irregular pulse. Of them, only 1 in 5 (450 people total) followed the next step in the study: receiving an  electrocardiogram patch  in the mail and sending the data along to Apple. This very low opt-in rate was the second problem.    Finally, there\u2019s no way to know how many of these 450 people already knew they had AFib. And that\u2019s problem number three. If Apple wanted the study to be groundbreaking, it wouldn\u2019t have excluded people with known AFib, it would have designed it for them. And it would start building applications to help them, medically.    The study\u2019s design protected Apple, legally, because the company didn\u2019t have to worry about what would happen if its heart-rate monitoring function occasionally failed to spot AFib. No one would know. And if a potential problem was spotted, all they had to do was notify the person and send the electrocardiogram patch to avoid liability.    Now, let\u2019s talk about how the watch could be more useful. Patients with AFib often take medications to regulate their heart rate. It would be both technically feasible and tremendously beneficial if the watch told these patients when their medication is working (and everything\u2019s under control) vs. when it\u2019s not (and they need to consult a physician). But that would create potential legal risks if the product malfunctioned or provided inappropriate medical advice.    A company the size of Apple is loath to put itself in such a financially precarious situation, even though it could transform health care delivery and save lives.    This type of monitoring device and patient-enabling software is what our nation needs, not just for those with AFib but also diabetes, asthma, and a host of other chronic conditions. If Apple wanted to make the \u201cgreatest contribution to mankind,\u201d it would aggressively move into each of areas of monitoring. Alas, it won\u2019t.    3. Tech companies will face major data-ownership issues ahead      According to a recent report in the  Wall Street Journal , Google\u2019s cloud division recently entered into a secretive agreement with Ascension, one of the nation\u2019s largest hospital systems. Together, they began collecting and crunching the personal-health data of 50 million patients across 21 states\u2014a collaboration code-named \u201c Project Nightingale .\u201d    Google has refused to comment on how it will use the data or what research function it will serve, but executives at Ascension promise the data won\u2019t be used to sell ads. Google concurs,  emphatically denying  it will compromise patient privacy.    It\u2019s worth noting that this clandestine exchange of identifiable patient data is 100% legal.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 \u201cgenerally allows hospitals to share data with business partners without telling patients, as long as the information is used \u2018only to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions,\u2019\u201d according to the Journal.    The law is silent, however, on the issue of whether companies can use the patient data to develop and sell new products. After all, without the 50 million Ascension patients (who never gave Google permission to access their personal health information), Google couldn\u2019t develop commercial consulting tools for others.    This is an ethical gray area, one that has put industry watchdogs on high alert. They note that health care is a very different kind of service than search because of dramatically different user expectations, fears, and risks.    When it comes to internet search, there\u2019s an implicit quid pro quo. In exchange for getting answers to questions at no cost, users give Google permission to sell their data to corporate bidders.    Health care is different. When patients receive care, they pay for the services rendered, either directly or through private insurance. So, if someone were to benefit financially from their medical information, shouldn\u2019t they get a cut?    It turns out there\u2019s precedent for this ethical quandary. Back in the early 1950s, Henrietta Lacks went to Johns Hopkins Hospital to have a tumor removed. During surgery, doctors took Ms. Lacks\u2019 cells without knowledge or permission and cloned them for generations of research projects. Today, vials of her cells continue to go for  up to $10,000 . Meanwhile, her family continues to fight for ownership rights.    A decade ago, Google launched  personal medical record service  that promised to help patients gain control of their medical information. Patients didn\u2019t trust the tech giant back then, and the effort shut down within three years.    As the company faces another federal probe, this time for its deal with Ascension, Google is learning how difficult it is to acquire and profit from medical data. Faced with this reality, I predict that instead of transforming care delivery, Google will end up tinkering at the edges.        Google and Apple, along with Amazon and Facebook, have dollar signs in their eyes as they look at the size of the health care industry. As they see it, all 330 million Americans are patients and potential customers. Their respective platforms\u2014be it a smartwatch or a speaker or an online marketplace\u2014are all potential pathways toward making hundreds of millions off of health care.    But despite lofty promises, it\u2019s doubtful their products will transform American health care.    It\u2019s not that they couldn\u2019t. Big tech firms have the engineering and technical know-how to create powerful health care tools. But they won\u2019t be willing to take the risks involved or able to access the patient data required.    Robert Pearl  is a physician and CEO, Permanente Medical Groups.

Weeuro;trade;ve moved from the bloviating stage (concerns, bad press, and hearings) to the call for action stage (fines, lawsuits, regulatory action). As one interesting indicator, The New Yorker, in its August 26 edition, has a major piece, titled euro;oelig;Silicon Valleyeuro;trade;s Crisis of Conscienceeuro;. Even with all these winds swirling, the major actors yet to experience significant repercussion: profits and stock prices are near all-time highs; and, as I wrote a few weeks ago, there has yet to be significant consumer backlash (Whateuro;trade;s Missing from the euro;tilde;Tech-Lasheuro;trade;: Consumers[1]). This lack of broad-based consumer anger is due in part to the un-stated euro;tilde;tech grand bargaineuro;trade; (free = data collection and targeted advertising), but also inertia (tendency not to take action until personally affected). But thereeuro;trade;s a third aspect, which Ieuro;trade;d like to discuss here, and for which I have a proposed solution. I call it the euro;tilde;deer in the headlightseuro;trade; phenomenon: the issues are so many, so broad, and so obtuse that consumers doneuro;trade;t know exactly where to direct their anger or how to take action. </p><p>As a friend asked me at a recent dinner: euro;oelig;Am I supposed to be mad at Facebook?euro; Hereeuro;trade;s an example of the yin and the yang. On August 21, Facebook announced it was rolling out tool to limit off-Facebook data gathering. Great! Now, have your non-techie friend or colleague read the following passage from the lay-friendly CBS News website: euro;oelig;The company is launching a long-promised tool that lets you block the social network from gathering information about you on outside websites and apps. This includes the 'Facebook pixel,' a piece of code that businesses can use to track activity on their sites by people who have a Facebook account, and 'Facebook login,' which lets people use their Facebook ID for outside sites.euro; Huh? This tells me that regardless of the hearings, fines, new regulations, and corporate actions that will surely be coming down over the next few months, this will largely remain an inside-the-Silicon-Valley-Beltway issue. It is barely a blip in the consumer consciousness, and this is a big problem. The companies can roll out all the tolls they want to appease the regulators and make themselves feel better, but they will be ineffectual until the average consumer realizes exactly what the problems are and then actually does something about it. So, here is my proposed solution. New regulations, settlements, fines, etc. should have a significant consumer education component. There are two important elements. First, consumers need to be much better informed about a range of issues related to their data: security, privacy, how it can be used and by whom, and so on. Second, user-friendly tools need to be developed that allow consumers to adjust settings appropriately, understanding the tradeoffs (i.e. less relevant advertising). As Ieuro;trade;ve written before, having some understanding of how data security and privacy works is a the 21st century equivalent of Drivereuro;trade;s Ed. We all need to know the basic rules of the road. There are numerous ways this could be implemented. Ieuro;trade;d love to see the FTC or other entities that are collecting significant fines from Big Tech direct meaningful dollars toward a broad-based consumer education campaign. This could be a clever, creative, and informative video (euro;oelig;Your Data 101euro;) that, yes, perhaps has to be mandatory for consumers. Not unlike how every parent has to take a short mandatory course before their kid gets a drivereuro;trade;s license. Then, Ieuro;trade;d like to see a requirement that each of the major platforms (Facebook, Google, etc.) develop a series of user-friendly, easy-to-discover tutorials that clearly lay out how to adjust settings for items like data collection, advertising, search history, etc. Users should not be expected to go deep into menus and settings themselves to learn how to do all this. And, these companies should staff call centers for consumers who have questions. Yes, Google, Facebook, and friends: Joe the Plumber and Mom the Septuagenarian should be able to talk to a human being at your company. Not email, not chat, not euro;tilde;product forumseuro;trade;, not clever AI routing, not Zendesk: a human being. There are other ways to take a personal approach: euro;tilde;Your Data 101euro;trade; could be something offered at Apple stores and other retailers. Maybe there could be a fund used to train and then pay instructors to teach euro;tilde;Your Data 101euro;trade; at Adult/Community Education centers, which exist in nearly every city or town in the country. For the average consumer, iteuro;trade;s time to stop merely reading about euro;tilde;Fake Newseuro;trade;, data breaches, and the like. Iteuro;trade;s time to become at least conversant about what is happening, and what can be done about it. And any consequences/new regulations of Big Tech that come out of this process should include a requirement that the relevant actors do a better job of both educating consumers and training them on how to take action.

Until now Googlehas largely remained behind the scenes and used surrogates to oppose amending the Internet law, Consumer Watchdog asserted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Friday, a group of more than 60 individuals and organizations committed to the protection of trafficking victims issued a statement expressing deep concern over the pervasive misinformation Big Tech supporters were offering. Among those criticizing Googlefor its hypocrisy was the National Center on Sexual Exploitation.</p><p>\"You would think a company whose motto is 'don't be evil' would think twice before choosing the side of sex traffickers,\"\u00a0said Patrick Trueman, president of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. \"Googlelobbyists are bombarding members of Congress with emails against passage of the only legislation that will dramatically decrease sex trafficking of girls, boys, and adults online. This is a case of Big Tech caring more about its bottom line than the victims of serial rape for profit.\"</p><p>Nacole S., the mother of a teenager trafficked on Backpage said:</p><p>\"Googleis using its billions to prevent families like ours from holding websites like Backpage.com\u00a0accountable.\u00a0Once again, the bottom dollar means more than the lives left in the wake of Backpage. This just shows how other companies would rather back them and save their 'precious' Section 230, than to see a safer Internet.\"</p><p>She said she is asking Googleand other tech companies to act in good faith to deal with the sex-trafficking issue.</p><p>E. Stewart Jeffries, GooglePublic Policy Council, blasted out the email last week in opposition to S. 1693, theStop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017and H.R. 1865, theAllow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017.\u00a0 Linked to the email were statements from groups opposing it based on myths about the reform effort.\u00a0</p><p>Read Jeffries' email here:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/googlecongressemail080317.pdf\">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/googlecongressemail080317.pdf</url></p><p>Virtually all of the groups voicing opposition to amending Sec. 230 after S. 1693 was introduced last week have received funding from Google. Groups include the Internet Association, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and the Computer and Communications Industry Association, the R Street Institute, and the Software and Information Industry Association.</p><p>The anti-trafficking groups expressing concern over the pervasive misinformation Big Tech supporters were offering listed six \"myths\" Big Tech cites in opposing an amendment to Section 230:</p><p>Myth # 1:This is just about going after Backpage. \u00a0Fact: If Backpage shuts down, other companies will quickly fill this space. The business model, not Backpage, is the reason that amending Section 230 is so essential.Myth # 2:Section 230 should not be amended because bad actors can be prosecuted under federal criminal law.Fact: There is an urgent need to amend Section 230 because the 1st Circuit, inDoe v. Backpage, recently found that even if Backpage had participated in criminal activity, its conduct was protected from the claims of children who had been sold on its site.\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, the court advised the children to seek a legislative remedy because Section 230 was in conflict with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization ActMyth # 3:This legislation is an attack on free speech on the Internet.Fact: The primary purpose of Section 230 was to protect a fledgling Internet industry from legal fees related to defamation claims based on third party content. Courts have consistently interpreted and expanded Section 230 far beyond its original intent, to protect not only \"irrational free speech\" (e.g. revenge porn, snuff film sites, and other types of malicious speech) but actual criminalconduct.Myth # 4:Section 230 is the bedrock of the Internet.Fact: courts have interpreted the statute to protect not only good faith filtering, but all third-party content (whether or not filtering occurs). This was never the intent.\u00a0 Technology has outpaced our legal framework with harm never contemplated when the law was enacted.\u00a0 Thus, Section 230 must be calibrated in light of decisions by courts to protect \"Bad Samaritans\" (hosting of illegal commercial sex; revenge porn; and the like) as well as actual criminal conduct.Myth # 5:The Internet will break if Section 230 protection is clarified.Fact: Civil liability for all online entities that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking will have no impact on self-regulating, good faith actors.Myth # 6:Amending Section 230 will discourage self-policing.Fact: Most legitimate tech companies have embraced self-policing and will continue to do so. However, for bad actors like Backpage, Section 230 has allowed the Wild West of the Internet to proliferate with no incentive to keep the dark side of technology at bay.</p><p>\"We call on Members of Congress and legitimate technology companies to join us in our efforts to end the horrific practice of sex trafficking and to join in an honest dialogue based on the facts,\" the statement said.</p><p>Read the statement here:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/2u9BrVa\">http://bit.ly/2u9BrVa</url></p><p>Google's Jeffries wrongly claimed that the Senate bill is \"trying to go after a single bad actor, Backpage.\"</p><p>\"Backpage is the prime example of how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act allows websites to escape accountability for enabling child sex-trafficking,\" said John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog's Privacy Project Director, \"but this bill is about stopping the business model that allows exploitation.\u00a0 What matters to Googleis that it relies on a similar business model and is worried its profits are threatened.\"</p><p>Tech companies and other defenders of CDA Section 230 claim it promotes and protects free expression on the Internet, but a US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations staff report shows that sites like Backpage.com aid and abet under-age sex traffickers using the blanket protection of the Act.</p><p>Backpage's abuses and the fight by its victims to hold it accountable are the subject of the documentary film,I am Jane Doe,(<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.iamjanedoefilm.com\">http://www.iamjanedoefilm.com</url>)\u00a0 which is now available on Netflix or can be downloaded from GooglePlay, iTunes or Amazon.</p><p>\"Google's executives may claim the motto, 'Don't be evil,' but they don't put their money where their mouths are,\" said Simpson.</p><p>In May Consumer Watchdog, DeliverFund, Faith and Freedom Coalition, The Rebecca Project for Justice, Trafficking in America Taskforce and Nacole S., a sex-trafficking victim's mother, released a comprehensive report detailing Backpage's wrongful activities and how Googlehas spent millions to fund efforts to thwart any changes in Section 230.</p><p>Read the report here:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/backpagereport.pdf\">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/backpagereport.pdf</url></p><p>Meanwhile, the tech industry is pressing the Trump Administration to adopt language in a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal that would protect that facilitate child sex-trafficking.</p><p>Consumer Watchdog has told the top US trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, that he should ignore calls from tech industry associations on behalf of tech giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter, to include language in a new NAFTA deal that would protect notorious websites like Backpage.</p><p>Read Consumer Watchdog's letter here:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/ltrnafta072717.pdf\">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/ltrnafta072717.pdf</url></p><p>Visit our website at:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.consumerwaahdog.org\">http://www.consumerwaahdog.org</url></p><p>View original content:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consumer-watchdog-says-google-steps-out-of-shadows-to-press-congress-to-keep-law-which-may-also-shield-online-child-sex-trafficking-300500976.html\">http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consumer-watchdog-says-google-steps-out-of-shadows-to-press-congress-to-keep-law-which-may-also-shield-online-child-sex-trafficking-300500976.html</url></p><p>SOURCE Consumer Watchdog</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC60205&amp;Transmission_Id=201708080900PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC60205&amp;DateId=20170808\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: John M.

Twenty-one Senators introduced a bill Tuesday, endorsed by Consumer Watchdog, amending a key Internet law to combat such abuses. A similar House bill has 101 co-sponsors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter say that law, Sec. 230 of the Communications Decency Act, protects Internet Freedom and are pushing for similar language in a new NAFTA deal.</p><p>\"Internet freedom must not come at the expense of children who are sex trafficked,\" said John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog Privacy Project Director. \"Just as the First Amendment does not allow you to shout fire in a crowded movie house, or to assist hit men and drug dealers in their criminal activity, CDA Section 230 must not be allowed to protect an exploitative business that is built on child sex-trafficking. Such language cannot be included in trade agreements.\"</p><p>The nonpartisan, nonprofit group has told the top US trade negotiator that he should ignore calls from tech industry associations on behalf of tech giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter, to include language in a new NAFTA deal that would protect notorious websites like Backpage.com.</p><p>In a letter to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Simpson wrote:</p><p>\"Backpage.com, has become a virtual hub for child sex-trafficking. By one count 73% of child trafficking reports in the United States involve this cynical website. Backpage hides behind the cloak of CDA Sec. 230 while too many in the tech industry blindly and reflexively claim that needed amendments would undermine Internet freedom. Now tech companies and trade associations are pushing to enshrine their misguided view in our trade agreements.\"</p><p>Read Consumer Watchdog's letter here: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/ltrnafta072717.pdf\">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/ltrnafta072717.pdf</url></p><p>In comments filed in June with the US Trade Representative in preparation for renegotiating NAFTA, tech groups, at least one of which - the Internet Association -- explicitly claims to speak on behalf of 40 tech firms including Google, Facebook and Twitter - have called for including language from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in a new NAFTA accord.</p><p>The bipartisan Senate bill, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017 was introduced Tuesday by 21 Senators including Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO). It would amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the section of the law that provides a website can't be held liable for what's posted on its site by third parties. Tech companies and other defenders of CDA Section 230 claim it promotes and protects free expression on the Internet, but a US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations staff report shows that sites like Backpage.com aid and abet under-age sex traffickers using the blanket protection of the Act.</p><p>Find the Subcommittee report and an archived video of a subcommittee hearing about Backpage here:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/backpagecoms-knowing-facilitation-of-online-sex-trafficking\">https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/backpagecoms-knowing-facilitation-of-online-sex-trafficking</url></p><p>The documentary, I am Jane Doe, tells the story of families victimized by Backpage.com and a report released by anti-trafficking groups, a subject of the documentary and Consumer Watchdog in May outed Google and other tech companies for backing Backpage and called for the Senate to act.</p><p>In addition to the Senate bill, the House of Representatives already has a bill that tackles the issue. The bipartisan bill, Rep. Ann Wagner's H.R. 1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017, has 101 co-sponsors. It would also amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. A public hearing on the bill is expected this fall.</p><p>A recent Washington Post article, \"Backpage has always claimed it doesn't control sex-related ads. New documents show otherwise,\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/backpage-has-always-claimed-it-doesnt-control-sex-related-ads-new-documents-show-otherwise/2017/07/10/b3158ef6-553c-11e7-b38e-35fd8e0c288f_story.html?utm_term=.b965ef54d775\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/backpage-has-always-claimed-it-doesnt-control-sex-related-ads-new-documents-show-otherwise/2017/07/10/b3158ef6-553c-11e7-b38e-35fd8e0c288f_story.html?utm_term=.b965ef54d775</url>) makes clear Backpage's deep involvement in this sordid exploitation, Consumer Watchdog said.</p><p>Consumer Watchdog said that while It is possible that with the release of the new documents the company many finally be held to account for some of its abuses, it is still incumbent on Congress to act to end the outrageous and exploitive abuse of Section 230. Both the Senate and House bipartisan bills would do just that, Consumer Watchdog said.</p><p>In May Consumer Watchdog, DeliverFund, Faith and Freedom Coalition, The Rebecca Project for Justice, Trafficking in America Taskforce and Nacole S., a sex-trafficking victim's mother, released a comprehensive report detailing Backpage's wrongful activities and how Google has spent millions to fund efforts to thwart any changes in Section 230. As detailed in the report, primary recipients of Google's largess are two nonprofit organizations, The Center for Digital Democracy (CDT) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). As documented in the report, CDT and EFF have frequently jumped to aid Backpage as it faced various legal challenges.</p><p>Read the report here: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/backpagereport.pdf\">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/backpagereport.pdf</url></p><p>Google, CDT, EFF, the Internet Association, the Computer and Communications Association, the Computer Technology Association and other tech industry representatives may claim to be protecting free speech and Internet freedom, but their activities have done little more than protect a notorious sex-trafficking hub from being held accountable by its victims, Consumer Watchdog said.</p><p>Backpage's abuses and the fight by its victims to hold it accountable are the subject of the documentary film, I am Jane Doe, (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.iamjanedoefilm.com\">http://www.iamjanedoefilm.com</url>) which is now available on Netflix or can be downloaded from Google Play, iTunes or Amazon.</p><p>\"Watch the film,\" Simpson said. \"You'll clearly understand the abuses that blind defense of Sec. 230 enables.\"</p><p>The 21 senators introducing the bill are: Rob Portman (R-OH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), John McCain (R-AZ), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), John Cornyn (R-TX), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Bob Casey (D-PA) Susan Collins (R-ME), Bob Corker (R-TN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Marco Rubio (R-FL).</p><p>The Senate bill would clarify Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to ensure that websites that knowingly or recklessly facilitate sex trafficking can be held liable so that victims can get justice. The narrowly-crafted legislation offers three reforms to help sex trafficking victims. The bipartisan bill would:</p><p>* Allow victims of sex trafficking to seek justice against websites that knowingly or recklessly facilitated the crimes against them;</p><p>* Eliminate federal liability protections for websites that assist, support, or facilitate a violation of federal sex trafficking laws; and</p><p>* Enable state law enforcement officials, not just the federal Department of Justice, to act against individuals or businesses that violate federal sex trafficking laws.</p><p>Read a summary of the Senate bill here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=2E240D5D-7894-4A3C-9978-5AB96F4DA997\">https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=2E240D5D-7894-4A3C-9978-5AB96F4DA997</url></p><p>Read the text of Senate bill here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=1DA519D4-4B37-4C5E-B8B9-4A205C5E488F\">https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=1DA519D4-4B37-4C5E-B8B9-4A205C5E488F</url></p><p>Read a summary of reasons for the bill here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=A04A55C5-F455-4CA9-8EE9-7C13DD91F1FC\">https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=A04A55C5-F455-4CA9-8EE9-7C13DD91F1FC</url></p><p>Read Rep.

Twenty-one Senators introduced a bill Tuesday, endorsed by Consumer Watchdog, amending a key Internet law to combat such abuses. A similar House bill has 101 co-sponsors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter say that law, Sec. 230 of the Communications Decency Act, protects Internet Freedom and are pushing for similar language in a new NAFTA deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Internet freedom must not come at the expense of children who are sex trafficked,\" said John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog Privacy Project Director. \"Just as the First Amendment does not allow you to shout fire in a crowded movie house, or to assist hit men and drug dealers in their criminal activity, CDA Section 230 must not be allowed to protect an exploitative business that is built on child sex-trafficking.\u00a0 Such language cannot be included in trade agreements.\"</p><p>The nonpartisan, nonprofit group has told the top US trade negotiator that he should ignore calls from tech industry associations on behalf of tech giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter, to include language in a new NAFTA deal that would protect notorious websites like Backpage.com.</p><p>In a letter to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Simpson wrote:</p><p>\"Backpage.com, has become a virtual hub for child sex-trafficking.\u00a0 By one count 73% of child trafficking reports in the United States involve this cynical website.\u00a0 Backpage hides behind the cloak of CDA Sec. 230 while too many in the tech industry blindly and reflexively claim that needed amendments would undermine Internet freedom. Now tech companies and trade associations are pushing to enshrine their misguided view in our trade agreements.\"</p><p>Read Consumer Watchdog's letter here:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/ltrnafta072717.pdf\">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/ltrnafta072717.pdf</url></p><p>In comments filed in June with the US Trade Representative in preparation for renegotiating NAFTA, tech groups, at least one of which - the Internet Association -- explicitly claims to speak on behalf of 40 tech firms including Google, Facebook and Twitter - have called for including language from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in a new NAFTA accord.</p><p>The bipartisan Senate bill, theStop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017was introduced Tuesday by\u00a021 Senators including Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO). It would amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the section of the law that provides a website can't be held liable for what's posted on its site by third parties. Tech companies and other defenders of CDA Section 230 claim it promotes and protects free expression on the Internet, but a US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations staff report shows that sites like Backpage.com aid and abet under-age sex traffickers using the blanket protection of the Act.</p><p>Find the Subcommittee report and an archived video of a subcommittee hearing about Backpage here:<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/backpagecoms-knowing-facilitation-of-online-sex-trafficking\">https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/backpagecoms-knowing-facilitation-of-online-sex-trafficking</url></p><p>The documentary,I am Jane Doe, tells the story of families victimized by Backpage.com and a report released by anti-trafficking groups, a subject of the documentary and Consumer Watchdog in May outed Googleand other tech companies for backing Backpage and called for the Senate to act.</p><p>In addition to the Senate bill, the House of Representatives already has a bill that tackles the issue. The bipartisan bill, Rep. Ann Wagner's H.R. 1865, theAllow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017,has 101 co-sponsors. It would also amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\u00a0 A public hearing on the bill is expected this fall.</p><p>A recent Washington Post article, \"Backpage has always claimed it doesn't control sex-related ads.

As detailed in the report, primary recipients of Google's largess are two nonprofit organizations, The Center for Digital Democracy (CDT) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).\u00a0 As documented in the report, CDT and EFF have frequently jumped to aid Backpage as it faced various legal challenges.</p><p>Read the report here:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/backpagereport.pdf\">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/backpagereport.pdf</url></p><p>Google, CDT, EFF, the Internet Association, the Computer and Communications Association, the Computer Technology Association and other tech industry representatives may claim to be protecting free speech and Internet freedom, but their activities have done little more than protect a notorious sex-trafficking hub from being held accountable by its victims, Consumer Watchdog said.</p><p>Backpage's abuses and the fight by its victims to hold it accountable are the subject of the documentary film,I am Jane Doe,(<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.iamjanedoefilm.com\">http://www.iamjanedoefilm.com</url>)\u00a0which is now available on Netflix or can be downloaded from GooglePlay, iTunes or Amazon.</p><p>\"Watch the film,\" Simpson said. \"You'll clearly understand the abuses that blind defense of Sec. 230 enables.\"</p><p>The 21 senators introducing the bill are: \u00a0Rob Portman (R-OH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), John McCain (R-AZ), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), John Cornyn (R-TX), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Bob Casey (D-PA) Susan Collins (R-ME), Bob Corker (R-TN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Marco Rubio (R-FL).</p><p>The Senate bill would clarify Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to ensure that websites that knowingly or recklessly facilitate sex trafficking can be held liable so that victims can get justice. The narrowly-crafted legislation offers three reforms to help sex trafficking victims. The bipartisan bill would:</p><p>Allow victims of sex trafficking to seek justice against websites that knowingly or recklessly facilitated the crimes against them;Eliminate federal liability protections for websites that assist, support, or facilitate a violation of federal sex trafficking laws; andEnable state law enforcement officials, not just the federal Department of Justice, to act against individuals or businesses that violate federal sex trafficking laws.</p><p>Read a summary of the Senate bill here:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=2E240D5D-7894-4A3C-9978-5AB96F4DA997\">https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=2E240D5D-7894-4A3C-9978-5AB96F4DA997</url>\u00a0<br/>Read the text of Senate bill here:\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=1DA519D4-4B37-4C5E-B8B9-4A205C5E488F\">https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=1DA519D4-4B37-4C5E-B8B9-4A205C5E488F</url>\u00a0<br/>Read a summary of reasons for the bill here:\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=A04A55C5-F455-4CA9-8EE9-7C13DD91F1FC\">https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=A04A55C5-F455-4CA9-8EE9-7C13DD91F1FC</url>\u00a0<br/></p><p>Read Rep.

Will we embrace it as offering a way out of the crisis to our 'new normal', or will suspicions, particularly around privacy, prove too strong?</p><p> How we feel about the answer to this question might well depend on where we live or the approach proposed. We are seeing some interesting variations in both. One distinction that is emerging is between decentralized and centralized structures for tracing apps. The centralized approach involves a central server into which alerts from users are received, held and sent out. Examples include the UK's NHSX app (which is still being tested) and the Australian app. In contrast, with the decentralized approach (including those built on Google and Apple's tracing API technology) alerts are passed directly between user devices with no central depository. The decentralized approach is currently favoured by more countries including Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and Ireland, among others. At the heart of the debate are the issues of privacy and trust, with concerns being voiced about the possibility of even anonymous identifiers being circumvented, of data being used for other purposes and of the risks of potential attack. These concerns are stronger with a centralized model, of course, where the target offers more rewards. Data Protection Authorities (including the UK's Information Commissioner) and the European Data Protection Board have commented with a preference for a decentralized model whilst noting that both can (with an emphasis on 'can') be compliant with data protection laws. However, some have questioned whether European data protection laws are in fact fit for purpose in this case? In Australia, additional legislation has already been passed to amend the Privacy Act 1988, including provisions to ensure employers can't make downloading the app a condition of returning to work, as well as covering the obtaining of consent. There have been some calls in other countries, including the UK, for more specific legal protections to be implemented. In the UK and European Union, additional laws should not be necessary for tracing apps. The General Data Protection Regulation (the Regulation) which celebrated its second birthday on 25 May, has very wide ranging requirements impacting both public authorities and private companies. The Regulation contains central principles on data minimisation, purpose limitation, special category data (such as health data) usage, and security, to name a few. Guidance has also been emerging on how these requirements should apply in the context of tracing apps, yet concerns still remain.  A primary point of contention is the heavy reliance on principles in the Regulation, especially combined with regulators constantly saying they will take a 'risk-based approach'. This leaves a little too much wiggle room and ambiguity to be able to convince everyone. A further complication is that many of the key provisions of the Regulations around employee data and use of data by public health authorities in the public interest or for health emergencies are left for local law confirmation, meaning it is natural to see some variations in approach by different Member States. On balance, however, it is clear that there are laws in place that can be applied in the case of contact tracing apps, and which should provide sufficient safeguards and controls. It, therefore, seems unlikely that we will see more specific regulation for apps in Europe even though the last few years have seen constant calls for tech regulation, including for biometrics, facial recognition and artificial intelligence. Member States and regulators are understandably now reluctant to rush in new laws which raise such big and complex questions around transparency and liberty, and need careful debate and consideration unless strictly necessary. One might question, in the face of potential freedoms that tracing app technologies offer, whether public mistrust is actually less with big tech currently and more with government. An interesting reality, therefore, is that the rollout of these apps will in itself amount to an experiment in direct democracy. Governments reportedly need 60% of the population to download their apps for these to work effectively, an ominous number when it comes to turnout. In the European elections, such turnout was last achieved in 1979. By comparison, in the last UK general election, it was 67.3% which was the second highest turnout in the past two decades, except for the Brexit referendum. Achieving a similar outcome in this context may be a tall order given that not everyone even has a smartphone for the apps to work. What will the results of this civic choice really indicate, if anything, about our new relationship with technology and dependence upon it? We may all feel we are living through a strange experiment with uncertain outcomes at the moment. However, unquestionably, we are seeing large technology companies stepping up to the plate with options, technologies, solutions, and examples of privacy by default and design in practice. The pandemic has also brought a period of reflection for many. As we reassess our values, some of those factors that are key to data governance, such as fairness, transparency, accountability, remain as prevalent as ever. However, in a post-pandemic world, perhaps the tech-backlash of recent years won't ring quite so loud. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-EURP13458215924090486732587610003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURP-134582</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6055-HH51-JCMN-Y528-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"951\"/><timeReceived>3:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>EU Reporter</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

He is a sought after speaker on digital identity and data privacy.        After a delay, contact tracing apps are coming to smartphones in the U.S. Virginia just became the first state to launch an app using Google and Apple\u2019s Exposure Notification System (ENS). Google announced that 20 U.S. states and territories \u2014 about 45% of the population \u2014 will soon be using contact tracing apps based on technology, and 16 countries and regions around the world have used them.    Given that experts say it takes about 60% of a population for contact tracing apps to be effective, this effort to detect and prevent the spread of Covid-19 still has some hurdles to overcome. But for people who will be using it, privacy concerns remain.      Google has addressed privacy concerns related to location tracking by announcing that with the release of Android 11, devices won\u2019t need to have location settings on to use ENS. But that doesn\u2019t solve all the issues these apps pose. While the technology may help slow the spread of coronavirus, it comes at a big social cost and poses what I see as the biggest ethics quandary in my 20 years in the infosec industry. These apps will force citizens to rely on big tech companies \u2014 whose business is enabled by monetizing data \u2014 to protect the privacy of their sensitive data. These apps play on humanity\u2019s greatest fear: our mortality.     Other countries are aware of this privacy dilemma. Norway pulled its contact tracing app because real-time GPS data was being constantly uploaded, among other reasons. One recent study found that such apps are being used as mass surveillance tools in Middle Eastern countries. Meanwhile, another study found that of 17 Android contact tracing apps, only one used full encryption and obfuscation to hide sensitive data.    The issue isn\u2019t just the type of data collected but who is collecting it. A recent Axios poll found that a majority of respondents would reject an app developed by tech companies (66%), and even more (68%) would not use one from the U.S. government. Meanwhile, 51% said they would use one from the Centers for Disease Control or other public health officials.     Commercial interests trump consumer privacy    Big tech companies don\u2019t have the best track record of serving as model stewards of consumer data, as the myriad privacy controversies involving Google and Facebook , and the existence of GDPR itself, attest to.    When we are intellectually honest with ourselves, the fundamental problem with the privacy demands and obligations placed on big tech and other industries is that they request that the data of a consumer be protected while failing to require that the actual consumer be protected as well. Because of this glaring disconnect, all I have ever needed to do is be you and I get your stuff.    This fundamental weakness in identity control hasn\u2019t been magically remedied with the introduction of contract tracing apps. The promise of anonymization has already proved to be an exercise in willful ignorance, in particular given the heat maps that fitness app Strava presented in late 2017 that clearly showed the locations of sensitive military bases and operations.     The undeniable reality is that the data being aggregated in contact tracing apps has tremendous value. And if it has value, someone will either misuse it or simply ignore the promises made to consumers around privacy and security. A critical question that needs to be resolved in the United States is whether a human being\u2019s digital persona requires a higher duty of protection by companies or if the constant siren call of monetization is the top priority. So far, companies have not shown interest in putting the security and safety interests of consumers ahead of their profit-making.    There are factors mitigating the risks with the use of Apple and Google's technology. So far, use in the U.S. is voluntary. GPS is not used, and the data is encrypted, stored locally and limited to virus contact tracing. However, it\u2019s naive for anyone to think those mitigations can\u2019t be overcome and that anonymized and seemingly innocuous data has no value. If you have enough data and apply statistical analysis, you can triangulate anonymized data to identify exact locations and individuals. In the end, it\u2019s just a math problem.     National privacy law would protect consumers during coronavirus and beyond    We need a national data privacy standard to address issues that arise with well-intentioned emergency technology like these apps. Absent federal regulation, tech companies will make the rules about protecting consumer data, and the bias could slant toward commercial interests. Contact tracing as it\u2019s being deployed isn\u2019t a solution; it\u2019s a symptom of specious reasoning. Society believes technology can solve its problems, but only by sacrificing privacy. However, we don\u2019t have to make that trade-off.    At a minimum, we need an interim measure to protect consumers using the contact tracing apps during this pandemic. There are three measures in Congress that would address this, and the strongest is the bipartisan Exposure Notification Privacy Act , sponsored by Senator Maria Cantwell. The measure would require apps to be created in collaboration with public health authorities, to include strong privacy safeguards to prevent data misuse, and to get consent to collect data and delete it when consumers request. Meanwhile, Democratic senators want to include privacy provisions in the next round of the coronavirus relief legislation.    Finally, we need to ensure that people can use technology without exposing who they are. You can\u2019t say you\u2019re truly protecting people\u2019s data if their identities aren\u2019t protected too. That\u2019s why our company is a member of the Better Identity Coalition , which is working with policymakers to improve digital security, privacy and convenience for consumers via next-generation remote identity proofing and authentication verification systems. This means contact tracing and other apps that store sensitive information would be better able to safeguard consumer data from hackers and big tech.

Give us some time.\u2019\u200a\u201d</p><p>Like other large social media companies, Facebook is spending more time and money monitoring and censoring extreme messages, photos and videos published by its 2.45bn users.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/oversight-board-structure/\"> oversight board</url>\u201d is due to start deliberating next year, and is being presented as the most ambitious step yet by Big Tech to create an impartial system for content arbitration. The board \u2014 whose 40 members will be paid through a trust funded by the company but not include Facebook employees \u2014 has been given the task of balancing freedom of speech with protection from unlawful content and hate speech.</p><p>Moderating content is problematic for all big social media platforms, says Sarah Roberts, assistant professor of information studies at University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cThey wish they could be out [of content moderation]. But that\u2019s not going to happen and if anything, it\u2019s going to increase.\u201d</p><p>When a Facebook user disagrees with how the company enforces its rules, the user will be able to request an appeal to the oversight board.</p><p>Facebook says the board will be independent, and that its content decisions will be binding in most cases \u2014 the exception being potential violations of local law \u2014 even if Facebook disagrees. The board is likely to consider serious cases that have a wider \u201creal-world impact\u201d, Facebook says.</p><p>Potential cases could include disagreement with Facebook\u2019s decision to remove content judged to be hate speech or bullying; removing a page promoting terrorism; or allowing nudity on the site because the content is deemed newsworthy. \u201cWe make millions of content decisions every week,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/letter-from-mark-zuckerberg-on-oversight-board-charter.pdf\"> wrote</url> Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive. \u201cI don\u2019t believe private companies like ours should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own.\u201d</p><p>Experts have mixed views on the board.

I spent the weekend watching three stories unfold at the intersection of social networks and politics. Let's take them in turn.<br/>I.<br/>During the initial George Floyd protests earlier this month, a big question was whether the social networks would take action against President Trump for one of his bad posts. Twitter applied some warning labels, and Snapchat removed him from promotion in the Discover tab. But Facebook declined to take action, and a lot of people got mad: current employees, former employees, advertisers. There was even a virtual walkout. Facebook not acting in this case led some people to believe it would not act in any case, and it's still dealing with the fallout.</p><p><br/>Around that time, I predicted that by July or August, Trump would post something else that clearly violated Facebook's policies and had to be removed. (Scrub to about 1:03:45 of this Vergecast episode.) Instead it took about two weeks. Here's Russell Brandom in The Verge:<br/>Facebook has removed more than 80 ads placed by the Trump campaign for use of imagery linked to Nazism. The ads used the imagery of an inverted triangle, which the Trump campaign has argued is a \"symbol widely used by antifa.\" The same symbol was used to identify political prisoners in Nazi death camps, leading Media Matters to call it an \"infamous Nazi symbol\" with no place in political rhetoric.<br/>Facebook agreed, ultimately removing the ads because of the Nazi-linked imagery. \"Our policy prohibits using a banned hate group's symbol to identify political prisoners without the context that condemns or discusses the symbol,\" said Facebook's Andy Stone in a statement.<br/>A day later, both Facebook and Twitter removed an organic post from Trump's account. In this case, the video was a deceptively edited piece taken from CNN, and it was removed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. That's a little different than removing a post for violating a rule about speech, but it still signals that Facebook is willing to act, and I have no real doubts the company will continue removing presidential posts that violate their standards.<br/>In fact, my cynical read here is that everyone is getting something that they want. Trump and the right get ammo for their ongoing bad-faith allegations that social networks are \"biased\" against them, even as their posts get more distribution than anyone else's; and Facebook gets to point to enforcement action as evidence it's not in bed with the administration. (Even if it's an occasional dinner guest.) That ought to help with morale, and may discourage other brands from showily, temporarily pulling their advertisements.<br/>At the same time, there is a clear pattern of escalation here. Questionable posts stayed up; that led to the posting of Nazi imagery; surely worse is to come. I've never thought it was even plausible that a big social network would ban one of the president's accounts. But if he continues in this vein, one or more of them may feel as if they don't have a choice.<br/>II.<br/>Another thing the president did over the weekend was to hold an indoor, mask-optional rally at the near-height of the ongoing pandemic. At one point, the campaign expected that as many as 1 million people would try to attend the rally. It turned out that they had been played. Here are Taylor Lorenz, Kellen Browning and Sheera Frenkel in the New York Times:<br/>TikTok users and fans of Korean pop music groups claimed to have registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets for Mr. Trump's campaign rally as a prank. After the Trump campaign's official account @TeamTrump posted a tweet asking supporters to register for free tickets using their phones on June 11, K-pop fan accounts began sharing the information with followers, encouraging them to register for the rally - and then not show.<br/>The trend quickly spread on TikTok, where videos with millions of views instructed viewers to do the same, as CNN reported on Tuesday. [...] Thousands of other users posted similar tweets and videos to TikTok that racked up millions of views.<br/>Discussion of this story dominated my feeds on Sunday. One, the people in my feeds mostly like to see the president made to look foolish. Two, the culprits - younger music fans organizing on an upstart social network - made the story irresistible.<br/>It also raised some provocative questions.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>How much of the low turnout should be attributed to the teens, and how much should be attributed to other factors - like that pandemic, for example?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Was this an example of what Facebook would call, on its platform, \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\"? Or was it something else? (Nathaniel Gleicher, who runs security policy at Facebook, said it's something else, because the TikTok teens appeared to be using their real accounts and are not working to hide their coordination.)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>How will this behavior be weaponized in the future against the rest of us? \"When one group uses these algorithms effectively, supporters tend to celebrate,\" Zeynep Tufecki tweeted. \"In 2012, it fell on deaf ears when a few of us tried to warn that the role Facebook was playing in elections wasn't healthy for democracy. It took 2016 to realize tools don't stay in one side's hands.\"</p></bodyText></listItem></list>In the moment, Trump versus the TikTok teens offered a canvas that anyone could project their hopes and LOLs onto. And a lot of good comes out of online protests and organizing. But if you worried about Russians tricking Americans into showing up to fake events in 2016, it seems to me you might also worry about the implications of Americans tricking campaigns into doing, uh, whatever they tricked Trump into doing this weekend. A country where nothing is true and everything is possible is, to be clear, looks more like Russia than the one I grew up in. It seems like a dangerous path to go down, even if I realize we're already well on our way.<br/>III.<br/>Snap won some praise earlier this month when CEO Evan Spiegel announced that Trump would be removed from Snapchat Discover. As part of that announcement, he wrote an unusually personal blog post in which he reflected on his privilege and advocated for reparations for black folks.<br/>Some former employees read the blog post and then tweeted about how when they worked at Snap, that commitment to racial justice hadn't always been apparent. Then some current employees were like hey, if you want to show your commitment to black folks, how about releasing a public diversity report, like all of Snap's peers? And Spiegel said no, because it would \"only [reinforce] the perception that tech is not a place for underrepresented groups.\" The idea apparently being that not knowing how many underrepresented minorities work at Snap would make it more attractive to underrepresented minorities than knowing.<br/>Anyway, then Friday was Juneteenth, and as it often does, the company released a special augmented-reality filter to commemorate the occasion. It was, unfortunately, a disaster. Kim Lyons and I wrote about it at The Verge:<br/>Snapchat is apologizing for a controversial Juneteenth filter that allowed users to \"smile and break the chains,\" saying the filter had not gone through its usual review protocols. The filter was panned by critics on Friday morning shortly after its release for its tone deafness, and was disabled by about 11AM ET. [...]<br/>Atlanta-based digital strategist Mark S. Luckie demonstrated the filter on Twitter, calling it \"interesting.\" The filter showed what appeared to be an approximation of the Pan-African flag, and prompted the user to smile - a common trigger for animated Snapchat filters - causing chains to appear and then break behind the user.<br/>Snap has a history of releasing disastrous filters. It also has a history of bragging about how it uses human curators to weed out bad stuff from Discover and other surfaces of its app. So this one hurt.<br/>The company investigated what happened and emailed its findings to the team. We published that email on Sunday, and it's worth reading in full. Oona King, the company's head of diversity and inclusion, said that black and white employees had collaborated on the filter, but that it had not gone through the usual review processes. She wrote (emphasis hers):<br/>For the record, and the avoidance of all doubt: the two Snap team members who on separate occasions specifically questioned if the \"smile\" trigger was appropriate for Juneteenth were two White team members. The Snap team members who suggested the smile trigger to begin with, and said it was acceptable to use, were Black Snap team members, and / or members of my team.<br/>Speaking on behalf of my team, clearly we failed to recognize the gravity of the \"smile\" trigger. That is a failure I fully own. We reviewed the Lens from the standpoint of Black creative content, made by and for Black people, so did not adequately consider how it would look when used by non-Black members of our community. What we also did not fully realize was a) that a 'smile' trigger would necessarily include the actual word \"smile\" on the content; and b) that people would perceive this as work created by White creatives, not Black creatives.<br/>I asked people to share their thoughts, and heard from more than 50, including from some black folks who work in tech. I encourage you to read them.<br/>On one hand: mistakes happen. I've spoken to people at Snap about this incident, and they're clearly pained by it. Sometimes at a company you try to do a nice thing, and despite your best efforts it blows up in your face. And it can be hard to sort out the real lessons to be learned from the conversation on Twitter, which is a powerful amplifier for schadenfreude.<br/>On the other: Snap had been setting itself up to take this fall for years. It talks a big game about inclusion and platform integrity, but the reality has often been found to be running far behind the hype. If you want to take the credit, you've got to do the work. Snap ought to hire and retain more underrepresented minorities, release its diversity report, and stop distributing filters to its entire user base without a proper review. And until it does, the least it can do is to stop patting itself on the back.<br/>The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.<br/>Trending up: Google is adding fact-checking labels to Google Images search results. The move is meant to curb the spread of misleading photos and images. (Sara Fischer / Axios)<br/>Governing\u2b50 Over 1,650 Google employees have signed an open letter to CEO Sundar Pichai demanding the company stop selling its technology to police forces across the US. \"We should not be in the business of criminalizing Black existence while we chant that Black Lives Matter,\" they said. Zoe Schiffer wrote about it today at The Verge:<br/>Employees are specifically calling out Google's ongoing Cloud contract with the Clarkstown Police Department in New York, which was sued for allegedly conducting illegal surveillance on Black Lives Matter protestors in 2015. They're also highlighting the company's indirect support of a sheriff's department in Arizona tracking people who cross the US-Mexico border.<br/>To workers, the partnerships stand in sharp contrast to the external statements of racial equity that executives like Pichai have been making. While the company has pledged $175 million to support black business owners and job seekers, and YouTube created a $100 million fund to amplify the voices of black creators, it continues to profit from police contracts.<br/>Nextdoor is discontinuing a feature that allows users to forward their posts directly to local police departments. The move comes as the company faces scrutiny over its role as a platform for racial profiling and its increasingly cozy partnerships with law enforcement. (Sarah Holder / Bloomberg)<br/>Mark Zuckerberg and Donald Trump have forged an uneasy alliance. While the two can speak out against each other publicly, in reality the status quo benefits them both. (Ben Smith / The New York Times)<br/>Companies, including the outdoor apparel brand The North Face, are committing to an advertising boycott of Facebook in light of the platform's handling of misinformation and hate speech. (Brian Fung / CNN)<br/>Rumors about buses full of anti-fascist activists known as antifa coming to cities across the United States spread through local Facebook groups as well as on Nextdoor and community texting networks. While the information turned out to be false, it was hard to track down and stop. (Davey Alba and Ben Decker / The New York Times)<br/>Twitter added a warning label to one of President Trump's tweets after the company determined it violated its policies on manipulated media. The president tweeted a doctored version of a popular video that went viral in 2019 that showed two toddlers, one black and one white, hugging. (Cat Zakrzewski / The Washington Post)<br/>Both Trump and Biden's presidential campaigns are using custom apps to speak directly to voters. But Trump's app is also gathering a ton of personal information on users, including their identity and location. It also asks to control the phone's Bluetooth function. (Jacob Gursky and Samuel Woolley / MIT Technology Review)<br/>The US Supreme Court rejected an appeal on a ruling that tech companies like Facebook and Google say will cost them billions of dollars in taxes by limiting deductions for stock payments to employees. The appeal challenged an Internal Revenue Service regulation that forces companies to allocate some of those stock expenses to foreign subsidiaries.

Here's The Verge's Tom Warren:<br/>Microsoft has struggled to reach the scale needed for Mixer to compete with Twitch, YouTube, and even Facebook Gaming which has led to today's decision. \"We started pretty far behind, in terms of where Mixer's monthly active viewers were compared to some of the big players out there,\" says Phil Spencer, Microsoft's head of gaming, in an interview with The Verge. \"I think the Mixer community is really going to benefit from the broad audience that Facebook has through their properties, and the abilities to reach gamers in a very seamless way through the social platform Facebook has.\"<br/>\u2b50 Apple announced iOS 14, its next major software update coming to to iPhones later this year.

On average, the number of organizations already spending over 20% of their budget on digital marketing channels is expected to increase by more than 70% over the next six years. The budget increase pattern, Indegene said, highlights how marketing organizations across the globe are undergoing fundamental structural change. </p><p>Gaurav Kapoor, executive vice-resident at Bangalore-based Indegene, said that the pharma industry's digital maturity journey is now getting fast-tracked, with a concomitant rise in digital adoption by healthcare professionals (HCPs) and the need for personalization.</p><p>\"Pharma has realized that going digital is no more a differentiator but a necessity,\" Kapoor told Scrip, adding that while regulatory compliance plays a key role in driving pharma's digitization, the \"primary impetus\" is nevertheless coming from the market itself. </p><p>Millennial HCP preferences</p><p>Kapoor noted that digital capabilities are being extensively used in areas such as digital therapeutics, use of real-world evidence for clinical development and medical legal regulatory reviews, among other functions.</p><p>\"Changing customer behaviors and expectations, impending patent cliffs, and entrance of big tech players into pharma are causing a paradigm shift in the marketplace. Furthermore, digitally-driven customer experience is starting to take its place as a key performance driver of products along with its clinical effectiveness and market access,\" Kapoor explained.</p><p>Millennial HCP preferences also play a key role in influencing the decisions made by marketers, given that smartphone and tablet usage continues to increase significantly. Earlier, a doctor survey in India by management consultancy Bain &amp; Company in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industry showed that the primary sources of information used by doctors include digital channels at 83%, peer discussions (73% ) and only then followed by medical reps (62%). </p><p>The trend was more marked in younger doctors, where 85% use digital channels and about 60% consult MRs, details of the survey, which covered 325 physicians, showed. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://Scrip.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//SC125877//\">\"Prescription Influencer Shifts In India Is Pharma Geared Up\" \"Scrip\"</url>)</p><p>KOL Webinars - Channel of Choice</p><p>The Indegene report also indicated that KOL (key opinion leader) webinars have emerged as the channel of choice for marketers and featured among the top three channels across the Americas, Europe and Asia regions, in both called-on as well as \"white space\"' marketing channels (essentially accessing otherwise inaccessible HCPs through additional channels to augment reach). </p><p>The channel preference is interesting given that respondents to the Indegene survey were uniformly distributed across big pharma as well as small firms and biotechs. Kapoor indicated that this suggests that even smaller firms not only realize the value of KOL webinars but also incorporate these events into their marketing mix.\u00a0</p><p>\"Traditionally speaking, KOL engagements have been a strong suit of larger companies due to considerable resource requirements. But the latest advances in data and analytics have enabled smaller firms to streamline the entire KOL engagement process through better KOL profiling and identification,\" Kapoor noted.</p><p>KOL webinars also provided the maximum return on investment for pharma marketers, while social apps drove the least returns versus spends. Marketing e-mails provided \"balanced returns\" the report said.</p><p>Indegene also said that pharma marketers need to focus on improving the availability of their content in journals and websites. Third-party websites in the US and tele-detailing in Europe/Asia received the highest rating for white space marketing among upcoming channels. </p><p>Content Strategies</p><p>Meanwhile, at the global level, personalization emerged as the top most effective content strategy for pharma marketers, followed by promotional infographics and repurposing of content into videographics.</p><p>\"Respondents confirmed that content personalization has generated maximum returns on digital investments, addressing the challenges of reduced face time for sales representatives,\" Indegene said.</p><p>In terms of technology adoption, marketing organizations have developed a suite of automation and analytics tools to push content through various digital channels. Digital analytics tools appear to be the most popular technology choice among pharma marketers, with close to 65% stating these have already been implemented within their marketing stack, while campaign automation followed as the next most widely implemented technology.</p><p>'Social Listening'</p><p>However, pharma scored \"poorly\"' on tools deployed for social listening, which has a significant bearing on the collection of real world data (RWD).</p><p>Indegene's Kapoor stated that social media listening has been used mostly to identify safety issues and carry out pharmacovigilance, but that it has \"huge potential\" to identify the real-life impact of diseases and therapies when combined with scientific study methods. </p><p>\"Listening to social media can help pharma companies understand the challenges behind adherence and also learn about new indications and markets. The potential value and use of cases of real world evidence/RWD is phenomenal,\" he said.</p><p>But Kapoor also underscored that there are complex challenges with analyzing massive amounts of \"unstructured\" data and that this will require investments in machine learning and natural language processing capabilities. \"Currently social data cannot be easily cross-linked and integrated to other RWD datasets. Once these issues are ironed out, we expect to see a proliferation of social listening tools,\" he predicted.</p><p>By <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:anju.ghangurde@informa.com\">Anju Ghangurde</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCRPIT-SC141201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCRPIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ4-SDM1-F0JS-Y3NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1096\"/><timeReceived>1:22 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Informa All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Scrip Intelligence</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48254\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC00028PO</classCode><className>BAIN &amp;

In India, it has been in the eye of the storm for alleged \"right wing\" bias, and its inability to take down hate content. Amber Sinha, executive director of Bengaluru-based think tank Centre for Internet and Society, talks about the shortcomings of the Facebook business model and the need to address them. Excerpts from an email interview:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is Facebook facing a public relations crisis, considering that it has failed to manage its image in most markets?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is no doubt that the last few years have been an ongoing public relations nightmare for not only Facebook, but all Big Tech companies. However, the problem is not one of image. Repeated data and content regulation lapses on Facebook's part have emerged, and these have rightly raised severe questions about their business model, and led to more attention, scrutiny and questioning from several governments across the world, including India.</p><p>After the revelation about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook to profile and manipulate users with political content emerged, the Indian government has been engaged in a series of ad hoc communications with Facebook and other social media companies. In July 2018, information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had warned that social media platforms could not \"evade their responsibility, accountability and larger commitment to ensure that their platforms were not misused on a large scale to spread incorrect facts projected as news and designed to instigate people to commit crime\".</p><p>There continues to be little clarity on how social media companies should be regulated, but there is growing consensus that they operate in a relative regulatory vacuum.</p><p>Why is it important to fill this regulatory vacuum?</p><p>The platformization of the web has allowed the creation of business models, wherein several technology companies have started intermediating our access to many services and products. These platforms are structured in a way that traditional sectoral regulations often do not apply to them. Further, because these business models provide \"free\" services dependent on advertising revenue based on monetization of data, they also often fall outside the purview of consumer protection laws.</p><p>In several cases, including for Facebook, serving as the primary platform for consumption of news for many people, traditional regulations may also not fully make sense. However, instances such as these highlight and underscore the need for formulating appropriate regulation.</p><p>What explains the Facebook controversies? Where does the problem lie?</p><p>The backlash Facebook is facing right now about its regulation of hate speech arises from flaws in its own policies and processes. The first issue is of inconsistent application of Facebook's community guidelines. These guidelines are a set of general rules, applicable globally, often with limited guidance about local contexts. This is not the first time that patterns of inconsistent application have been brought to attention.</p><p>For instance, Sarah Koslov from Georgetown University Law Centre, has pointed out how in some cases in Israel and Palestine, Facebook's rules \"favour elites and governments over grassroots activists and racial minorities\". The second issue is that of structural problems within the organization, which has led to serious conflicts of interest.</p><p>What kind of structural issues?</p><p>The structural issues seem to arrive from a lack of full appreciation of the various aspects of public policy that a company like Facebook's platform and engagements intersect with. The legal and ethical responsibilities of the platform, with respect to content regulation, requires them to clearly uphold internationally-recognized principles and domestic laws on free speech, hate speech, thresholds for takedown, etc.</p><p>Similarly, on data protection and privacy, the platform is expected to discharge its legal obligations as per local law and, ideally, set standards in accordance with the most robust data privacy obligations globally.</p><p>On the other hand, the public policy teams at Big Tech companies like Facebook routinely need to engage with government stakeholders. It is to be expected that the objectives and interests of the content regulation teams can collide with those who work on government affairs.</p><p>There must be a very clear segregation between the two, and those working in government affairs should not be in a position to influence how hate speech or other content is regulated on the platform.</p><p>Does Facebook have an identity crisis, as it pretends to be a news platform to attract advertisers, but is free of rules that govern traditional publishers?</p><p>This situation is less of an identity crisis; it is much more of a situation created by regulatory oversight, lagging way behind emerging, and, in this case, somewhat established business models of social media platforms. So far, platforms like Facebook have enjoyed safe harbour protections. These protections are based on the idea that intermediaries, Facebook in this case, are mere dumb conduits for the distribution of speech of its users, and are not speakers themselves.</p><p>This argument no longer holds water. Using highly-intelligent prioritization algorithms, most, if not all, social media platforms affirmatively shape the form and substance of content posted by users in some manner.</p><p>Facebook employs techniques to ensure that each user sees stories and updates in their \"News Feed\" that they may not have seen on their last visit to the site. It analyses, sorts and reuses user data to make meaning out of user's \"reactions\", search terms and browsing activity in order to curate the content of each user's individual feed, personalized advertisements and recommendations.</p><p>That said, it will be a stretch to equate social networking platforms to publishing and media companies. While platforms like Facebook do is significantly mediate our consumption of content, and play a role far beyond mere transmission, they do not control the content that is posted.</p><p>How do you resolve a problem such as the one with FB? What laws are required to regulate social media platforms?</p><p>It is important to recognise the nature of different roles that platforms like Facebook play, and shape regulation based on that. Currently, the regulation paints all internet intermediaries with the same brush.</p><p>There is a definite need for differentiating between infrastructure information intermediaries (such as ISPs) and content information intermediaries that facilitate communication (such as social media networks). It might be possible to create content-neutral standards for infrastructure information intermediaries that do not primarily focus on content transmission.</p><p>For example, a set of content-neutral standards (like common carrier regulations) could apply to infrastructure intermediaries, while separate standards that are not content-neutral would apply to content intermediaries. Given their control and power over our user experience online, intermediaries do owe us a duty of care.</p><p>The right to free speech and protection of equality and dignity are recognized by most constitutions around the world. We need a shift from content regulation and safe harbour to meta regulation, under which companies which determine and dictate online moderation are held accountable to a set of principles in line with international standards of freedom of opinion and expression.</p><p>Centre for Internet &amp; Society has been a recipient of research grants from Facebook since 2017.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

But that's exactly what Brad Smith, president of Microsoft Corp., and Carol Ann Browne, the company's director of communications, say in their book Tools And Weapons : The Promise And The Peril Of The Digital Age. They provide insights into how Microsoft slowly came around to realizing that companies, which create technology that has the power to transform the world, also have a deep responsibility to the society they build for. They focus on the competing priorities corporations face, and talk about Microsoft's efforts to find a middle ground after ending up in the hot seat two decades ago in the anti-trust case. The authors stress how important it is that \"data does not become the province of a few large companies and countries\". In Tools And Weapons, Smith and Browne cover 15 issues, from privacy, surveillance and cybersecurity, to protecting democracy, the geopolitics of technology, and artificial intelligence and ethics.</p><p>They write, \"Tech companies have become too important to the economy to be left to a laissez-faire policy approach.

While the limited structure of WhatsApps new payments solution has been clarified by regulators, startups here must have a level playing field, whether in payments or in any other segment, he told ET Magazine.</p><p>Its not just WhatsApp. Entrepreneurs across the country are keeping a weather eye on Amazon, Alibaba and Google.</p><p>Some experts criticise the motives of these behemoths and worry about the fate of homegrown startups. If Google and Amazonwere investing in Indian startups without strings attached, that would be a good thing. The problem is when foreign companies are allowed to dump capital and build monopolies, says Vivek Wadhwa, distinguished fellow at Carnegie Mellon Universitys College of Engineering, US.</p><p>The startup ecosystem is wary and welcoming in turns of the freespending behemoths. While their advent and aggression may give startups cause for concern, they also bring in crucial funding, mentorship, incubation and acceleration for some ventures.</p><p>Votaries of tech giants say they are crucial for startups to network with top investors and warp speed their growth plans. They provide key investments in Series A and B rounds. They are also a mine of talent for the startup community  and it is not just about Sachin and Binny Bansal, Flipkart founders, germinating their idea at Amazon, but finding employees down the ladder. The</p><p>big companies form a critical piece of this ecosystem, says Siddharth Ladsariya, an angel investor in about 100 startups. For many, an acquisition by these large companies also builds a viable exit model.</p><p>One of the sectors that is targeted by Amazon  the $178 billion technology company with $5 billion committed to India  is fashion and apparel. Amazon is building a massive inventory of products and a large team to hunt for deals. Over the past three years, there has been a clear-out in the market, as investors backed out of discount-driven businesses. Entrepreneurs have been forced to shutter businesses or sharply change course.</p><p>For instance, Nidhi Agarwal, founder of Kaaryah, a Gurgaon-based fashion startup, met about 100 investors before getting some backers for her venture, but soon ran aground. Sujayath Ali, founder of fashion startup Voonik, funded by Sequoia Capital and RB Investments, has been luckier. He has pivoted his business away from the long tail of fashion to focus on a narrower but more profitable business at the top of the market.</p><p>Voonik, Ali claims, is profitable, even as it has slashed the number of suppliers and is focused on building its own brands. Entrepreneurs who want to take on Amazon with metoo business models have no chance now, he says. We too have pivoted to focus on a smaller number of highquality sellers and our own brands.</p><p>Big and Bad?</p><p>Large companies, including Facebook and Amazon, bristle at the suggestion of any villainous plans to destroy Startup India. Executives at both these companies, whom ET Magazine spoke to, say anonymously that they have little to do with the shakeout in the startup ecosystem. They argue that brittle business plans and subsequent disinterest from wary investors grounded many of these ventures rather than perceived ulterior motives from these behemoths.</p><p>They suggest that a liberal access to their technology  for example, a range of products is being developed in India using Alexa and Echo from Amazon  gives fledgling firms a better chance to succeed in a competitive market. Initiatives such as Googles Launchpad Accelerator Program, which allows startups to work with advisors, mentors and the latest technology, are also helping rather than hindering companies (See column, Learnings from Google).</p><p>In the payments space, WhatsApp has spent a little over a fortnight seeding its peer-to-peer (P2P) payments initiative. It has spoken to several players in the space as it launched its payments service in India where it has its largest user base.</p><p>Amazon executives say they have no plans to slam smaller startups. Instead, they say its India unit is a registered subsidiary, pays taxes locally and is committed to growing the market.</p><p>Academics such as Devashish Mitra, professor, Syracuse University, US, strike a balanced note on the issue of alleged capital dumping. Without detailed data on prices and costs, we cannot make any claims, he says. It is possible that these foreign companies are technologically more advanced in their methods of production and management techniques  which lower their cost of production  and one cannot compare the prices of their services in India with those abroad to claim that dumping is taking place, he says. In India, adds Mitra, they are combining their advanced technologies with cheap labour.</p><p>There is a need for a government agency to whom dumping claims can be sent and they can evaluate whether price differentials just reflect cost differentials or not, he says. If there is predatory dumping (along with injury to indigenous firms and local labour), there needs to be an anti-dumping tax (equal to the calculated dumping margin), which is similar to anti-dumping duties on internationally traded goods.</p><p>Indian venture capitalists also agree that the government needs to do more to regulate the space and protect these companies. Vani Kola, veteran venture capitalist and managing director of Kalaari Capital, gave the warning exactly a year ago. She wrote in a piece on Medium: Being the first mover doesnt give anyone the entitlement to own the market. But, what we see today is an example of how unregulated market can take away some of the benefits that free markets provide to the society. Unregulated markets can be anti-competitive, because it gives some players undue advantage. She said firms such as Amazon and Uber have access to unlimited finance  from the fact</p><p>that they have successful business for many years in other geographies  and can use that to stifle competition in India by providing products and services that are economically unviable even to them in the long term (but it is a loss that they can take on, because of the cushion from their home markets).</p><p>She said while it might seem to be a good deal for the customers, it can be a bad deal for the country as a whole. Today every country needs to nurture and protect its knowledge economy and think about capital as commodity. Hence thought is required around how capital might also be used in a way conceptually similar to dumping.</p><p>While many, including Wadhwa, point to how Chinas walling off of the Silicon Valley giants has helped homegrown Baidu, Weibo, Alibaba and Tencent to become tech titans, not everyone thinks that protectionism is the way forward.</p><p>Anindya Ghose, Heinz Riehl Chair Professor of Business at New York University, says, If the Indian government starts favouring local entrepreneurs by stopping foreign firms from operating in its markets, the primary losers will be consumers. What is to stop the likes of Ola, Flipkart and Paytm from not pursuing unfair pricing in the absence of competition in India? On China, Ghose says, the Chinese BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) companies took on the tech innovation by Western companies and, in fact, forged ahead in subsequent years. Where do we see that kind of commitment to innovation in India? Competition benefits consumers by lowering prices and increasing innovation, he says.</p><p>Mitra from Syracuse University also contends that China may not be the best model for India. The main reason China keeps Googleand Facebook out is that they want to restrict the flow of information and ideas to their citizens, he says. That is not something a democracy should do There are some things to learn from China but not its control of economic and political freedom.</p><p>Even so, when China raised barriers to foreign companies, it boosted tech innovation.</p><p>There are some parallels with Japans protectionism of its auto industry, says Ghose. But Japan couldnt protect its auto industry forever, and in 1981, it was forced to accept quotas that limited its ability to freely export cars into the US. By then, however, Japanese companies were large enough to compete on a level playing field with US and European automakers, says Ghose, adding that South Korea also practised protectionism for both its auto industry and tech companies like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG.</p><p>In Japan and Korea, protectionism led to innovation. Ghose says the world needs to recognise the innovativeness of some of the Chinese tech companies and shake off the mental image of Chinese knockoffs. Chinese companies are setting global trends in various areas such as technologyenabled transportation, digital payments,</p><p>mobile economy and artificial intelligence, he says.</p><p>Wadhwa says India needs to see through the spiel on free market. The US tech industry is by no means a free market. It breaks every rule in the book. When the leaders of both America and China talk about free markets, it is to demand that others open up their markets for them, argues Wadhwa. He says innovation will thrive in India even without Silicon Valley. Entrepreneurs need mentorship, education and seed financing. If there are enough of these, there will be local competition to create innovation.</p><p>Critics like him worry that if Uber cant defeat Ola, it might acquire it. Amazon could do the same to Flipkart and Snapdeal. It isnt a level playing field, so Indian companies wont have a chance, adds Wadhwa. They will likely be forced into bankruptcy by the American giants. The Indian inferiority complex  that a foreign product must be better than ours  is at play again and so we will bend over backwards and bow down to our white masters.</p><p>This concern is likely to ring out loud in segments that have seen a growing presence of Big Tech. Theres a clear consolidation happening in the payments market as wellfunded giants take centre stage and startups question the viability of their business model, says Soma Sundaram, CEO of iKaaz, a mobile payments venture based in Bengaluru. It has been acquired by Grab, an app-based transport firm in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Money Talks</p><p>The biggies are now putting their money to work. For example, leading online grocer Bigbasket has raised about $887 million in funding led by Chinese Alibaba and its affiliates. Hari Menon, CEO, is unabashed about the heft the money has brought. You require capital to build a strong business in this space. The pretenders have been cleared out, he says. Bubbles in segments such as hyperlocal commerce have burst. Alibaba isnt just about grandstanding; the Chinese internet giant is looking to piece together its investments in Bigbasket, logistics player Xpressbees and Paytm Mall  such integrations across segments could create aftershocks.</p><p>Even before Alibaba  whose logistics business alone is valued at around $7 billion  intensified its play in the sector, there had been a clear-out.</p><p>In the truck aggregation market, a raft of startups, including Truckmandi, TheKarrier, Loadkhoj and Sastabhada, had shut down. Hemmed in by rising capital requirements and credit demands from truckers, startups had struggled to stay afloat. It was impossible for us to compete in a capital-intensive business and provide 30-45 days credit, says Ankit Singh, cofounder, Truckmandi, which shut shop in August 2016.</p><p>In December 2015, Amazon invested in Housejoy, a provider of on-demand services in two dozen cities in India. At that time, the market was packed with a couple of dozen players, now there are barely five or six, as vanishing funding and dim business models have taken their toll. This is a market for deep-pocketed companies, but investors showed little interest after initial funding, says Aseem Khare, founder of Taskbob, which folded last year. Homegrown unicorn Quikr has a big presence in the sector. But large companies are lumbering in.</p><p>While dozens of startups have floundered, any move to keep out foreign giants remains debatable. Ghose of NYU says: The big question I have for the Vijay Shekhar Sharmas and the Sachin Bansals is: Can we make a commitment to pursue innovation in startups in India so that even if the government allows for protectionism to level the playing field against foreign Goliaths, Indian firms will actually focus on innovation and not mere imitation for land-grab purposes? </p><p>While Indian companies may be crying for protection from marauding multinationals, how can regulators and, indeed, the government stop local entrepreneurs from pursuing predatory pricing even in the absence of global competitors?</p><p>The future will be roiled, but if as Wadhwa warns, India will be colonised by what he calls 21st centurys East India Companies, then it will be among the biggest challenges for the countrys entrepreneurs as well as regulators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_16_25022018006001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRH-X0V1-JB3N-T47H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2434\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

I will not be silenced.\"</p><p>                      The video, taken at a news conference Immanuel led on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, went viral after President Donald Trump's Twitter page shared it.

Brett Giroir, a member of Trump's coronavirus task force, earlier this month said that \"from a public health standpoint, at first, hydroxychloroquine looked very promising\" but at \"this point in time, there (have) been five randomized control, placebo-controlled trials that do not show any benefit.\"</p><p>                      Nevertheless, Immanuel told the Chronicle in late July that she has used the drug on more than 400 people, including the elderly, asthmatics and diabetics. She said, \"We have not lost a patient yet.\"</p><p>                      Immanuel could not be reached for comment Thursday.</p><p>                      In Thursday's tweet, Immanuel said medical boards in Louisiana and Washington, D.C., also have opened \"queries on me.\" Immanuel holds a license in Louisiana as well as Texas, but the Washington, D.C., medical board website does not list her as licensed there.</p><p>                      Immanuel included the Houston health department among the entities that have launched queries.</p><p>                      A health department spokesman noted that the department does not discipline doctors and said it has not initiated a query of Immanuel.</p><p>                      The Texas Medical Board's July 31 statement said the medical community is \"still learning, researching and gaining understanding of the virus,\" but stressed that while drugs and therapies are being used to treat COVID-19, \"there is no definitive cure at this time.\" Any treatment decision must be made \"with full, proper and accurate disclosure by a physician,\" it said.</p><p>                      It did not say a complaint involving false, misleading or deceptive advertising had to involve harm to a patient.</p><p>                      Tweets about the board's statement drew support of Immanuel by some and pledges by others that they planned to levy complaints.</p><p>                      Immanuel also attracted attention because of some eccentric beliefs .

This is a significant milestone after more than two years of intense negotiations and lobbying which have pitted the creative and content industries against the tech industry and consumer digital rights advocates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The European Commission initially announced the copyright reform back in 2016 as part of its digital single market strategy, which aims to create more opportunities to do business across the EU whilst giving citizens better access to online goods and services. Although the reform was intended to make European copyright law fit for the digital age, its detractors have warned it could 'break the internet'.</p><p>At the heart of the controversy are Articles 11 and 13. Article 11 (known as the 'press publisher's right' or 'link tax') initially required news online service providers, such as Google News, to obtain a licence to use online press articles. Article 13 (known as the 'value gap') initially required platforms hosting user-generated content, such as YouTube or Facebook, to remunerate rightsholders for the use of their works and to take responsibility for copyright infringement by implementing technical measures such as upload filters.</p><p>Whilst rightsholders have broadly supported these provisions, the tech industry and digital rights advocates have voiced concerns that they would hamper online innovation, restrict free speech and lead to mass monitoring and censorship. The significant lobbying from both sides has caused numerous delays and set-backs as the EU institutions have tried to find a solution that satisfies both factions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Article 11</emphasis></p><p>The official version of the agreed text and the European Commission's press release give a fairly good indication of the compromise struck. Article 11 has been retained, but with the carve-out that it will not apply to hyperlinking or the re-use of \"single words or very short extracts\".</p><p>Whilst this appears to be a victory for online service providers, a large amount of uncertainty still remains as to what constitutes a \"very short extract\". This may mean that online service providers will proceed cautiously until further guidance has been given by the Commission or by the courts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Article 13</emphasis></p><p>Article 13 has also been retained, but it imposes weaker obligations upon platforms. Rather than being required to implement technical measures to prevent copyright infringement, platforms will instead have to conclude licensing agreements with rightsholders for use of their works. If no such licensing agreements are in place, platforms will have to (i) use their best efforts to obtain authorisation from rightsholders; (ii) use their best efforts to ensure the unavailability of unauthorised content which has been identified by rightsholders; and (iii) act expeditiously to remove any unauthorised content after being notified and use their best efforts to prevent future uploads. However, some believe that platforms will still need to use upload filters in practice to comply with these obligations and the increased costs and regulatory burden will make it harder for smaller platforms to compete with the internet giants.</p><p>Although there is a lighter regime for start-ups which have annual revenues under 10 million euros, fewer than 5 million monthly users and which have been around for less than three years, critics have pointed out that there are currently very few platforms in Europe that meet these criteria.</p><p>The tech industry and those advocating for freedom of expression continue to oppose the directive on an ideological level</p><p>As a result, the tech industry and those advocating for freedom of expression continue to oppose the directive on an ideological level and the lobbying is expected to continue ahead of the final plenary vote by MEPs at the end of March. If the MEPs vote in favour of the agreed text, member states will have a two year period to implement the directive into national law. The UK however will only be obliged to implement the new directive if it leaves the EU with a deal and the implementation deadline falls within the transition period.</p><p>If the new directive does become law, there is no doubt that it will have a significant impact upon all stakeholders, from individual authors and artists to major record labels and big tech companies. But will it break the internet? That remains to be seen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Zoey Forbes is a Technology, Media and Entertainment associate at </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Harbottle &amp; Lewis.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMPTG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMPTG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHW-8TP1-DYWJ-F4B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172297</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Incisive Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Computing</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33179\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

This is being driven by an increasingly fierce battle fought by TME firms who are attempting to gain a competitive edge in the market. 2014 saw new levels of convergence deals amounting to US$34.5 billion, with this trend predicted to increase further.<br/> \u00a0<br/> The report reveals that cross-sector convergence varies widely across the TME sectors. Entertainment businesses are the most willing to branch out, with more than 33 per cent planning non-entertainment purchases. This willingness has the potential to put acquisitive businesses ahead, but they must be aware of the potential risks involved in cross-sector acquisitions.<br/> \u00a0<br/>Gregor Pryor, Reed Smith partner and co-chair of the firm's global Entertainment and Media Industry Group, explains: \"One major challenge for cross-sector acquirers is understanding a new area of business. This can be a steep learning curve. If you are a big tech company, the biggest challenge is just understanding the space. Film doesn't operate in the same way as music or the same way as computer games. Companies need to learn about a new sector.\"<br/> \u00a0<br/> The report also shows that TME companies that are seeking growth are increasingly crossing borders, with 57 per cent saying their next acquisition is likely to be outside their home market. Of those businesses in search of cross-border opportunities, 37 per cent say they are most likely to target Asia-Pacific, followed by Western Europe (23 per cent) and North America (17 per cent). These expectations must be set against the need for firms to understand the political and regulatory risks in the target markets.<br/> \u00a0<br/> This desire to converge is not limited to the global giants in the industry. There has been a recent upsurge in so-called 'quad play' deals, in which telecom providers seek to become a one-stop shop for TV, broadband, fixed and mobile telephony.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Michael Young, corporate finance partner at Reed Smith, explains: \"With increased cross-border convergence activity, companies must be prepared for the regulatory challenges that will result as they move from one jurisdiction to another. Local guidance, whether that be legal, commercial or financial, thorough due diligence and thoughtful deal structuring is critical to the success of these transactions.\"<br/> \u00a0<br/> Nick Cheek, global managing editor of Remark, the events and publications division of the Mergermarket Group, adds: \"In the face of aggressive and agile competition, trusted business models can no longer be relied on.

He was a misfit, he was a sociopath, and both the CIA and the FBI knew it. They were tracking him in various ways.</p><p>The shocker in this is that not only did the FBI and the CIA not communicate regularly with one another, and that`s putting it mildly, neither one of them ever told the secret service about Lee Harvey Oswald. This assassination could definitely have been prevented.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Al Hunt, Mike Allen, David Ignatius, <person><nameText>Roger Altman, </nameText></person>and Larry Sabato, when we continue.</p><p>Funding for \"<person><nameText>Charlie Rose</nameText></person>\" is provided by the following: Bank of America, life better connected.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: And by Bloomberg, a provider of multimedia news and information services worldwide.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: From our studios in New York City, this is \"<person><nameText>Charlie Rose.</nameText></person>\"</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Turning now to politics, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is one step closer to getting his tax cut. The house voted Thursday to pass the senate`s budget plan that allows Republicans in congress to try and pass an overhaul of the tax code without the votes of the Democrats.</p><p>For more on this, I`m joined from Washington by Al Hunt of Bloomberg View and also Mike Allen, the co-founder of Axios. Mike, let me begin with you. Before we get to the tax reform, tell me what`s happening within the Republican Party when you have some criticism of the president by <person><nameText>Jeff Flake, </nameText></person>by <person><nameText>John McCain, </nameText></person>by George Bush without naming the president, and of course by Bob Corker. What does this mean, if anything, today in Washington?</p><p>MIKE ALLEN, CO-FOUNDER, AXIOS: Well, Charlie, it`s the Republican parties and we`re seeing more clearly on the national stage the split that we have been seeing in the house for a long time, that we looked out so carefully during health care. And now we`re seeing the Trump and Bannon part of the party. And we`re seeing the more traditional part of the party where so many senators now saying publicly what others are saying privately behind the scenes.</p><p>But, Charlie, here`s the twist, and here`s why a lot of the coverage this week has been very misleading. The twist is that all those senators and all those Republicans around the country that think privately, the criticisms that McCain and Corker and other Flake and Bush and others are saying publicly, they`re going to keep it private.</p><p>Trump is strong in their states, strong in their districts, and so <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is now more commanding of the party than he has been at anytime. There`s not going to be any sort of tipping point when these folks start to speak out against him. So, at the moment, Trump very strong with the Republican Party`s house and senate.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The Republican Party is now Trump`s party, Al?</p><p>AL HUNT, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Yes, I think if anything, Mike understated the case. This is Donald Trump`s party. <person><nameText>Jeff Flake </nameText></person>gave a remarkable senate floor speech. I think you have to go back to Margaret Chase Smith J. Smith in 1950 with a declaration of conscience against Joe McCarthy to find something like it.</p><p>And you know what, Charlie? He talked about how Trump has coarsened the political dialogue and political integrity. It had almost no public effect, at least, because Trump does dominate this party in Washington but particularly out there in the country. And so <person><nameText>Jeff Flake </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>speak out. Then you look at someone who you used to think of as an independent like Lindsey Graham and he`s become a Trump poodle. So, this is Donald Trump`s party.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So gets his tax cuts, he gets his tax reform?</p><p>MIKE ALLEN: Well --</p><p>AL HUNT: No, they get a tax cut. They won`t get tax reform. I think they desperately -- this is where Republicans and Trump are on the same page, they desperately need a success. And this has nothing to do with economics and everything to do with politics. I think they will get a tax cut, there will be almost no reform, and I would guess it`s not going to be popular. You don`t pass big things on a strictly partisan basis and usually have it succeed.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Mike?</p><p>MIKE ALLEN: I think Mr. Hunt is right about the diminished ambition of what they might pass, but even that may be hard. Al follows it so carefully. He should tell me if I`m wrong about this, but I think it`s going to be harder than people think. The way that one person expressed it to me is that if health care is a sixth of the economy, tax reform is everything.</p><p>So, how do you pull off the specific cuts? And this is, I think, one of the downstream worries for Trump about antagonizing these Republican senators that we agree that he`s strong now, he`s strong in these states and districts. But if you`ve only got 52 Republican senators, so you can only lose a couple, Senator McCain, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee already reluctant to vote for tax cuts that just add to the deficit, now they have even more cover to that.</p><p>The president this week saying that Bob Corker, who`s the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, couldn`t win an election for dog catcher, you lose a couple of them. And tax cuts even modest ones start to look shaky in the senate.</p><p>Then over in the house where you still have the math problem that you had during health care, you have this divided republican conference, house members, if it starts to look shady or starts to look uncertain on the senate side, they`ll say, am I going to take a tough vote where I`m going to vote to eliminate some tax breaks for interests that are important to me? That could mean that even tax cuts could go down.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Also on Capitol Hill next week, I think, some of the giants of Silicon Valley are coming to testify. Mike, we have been hearing about the idea that these companies are so powerful, and they`re so ingrained into who we are today, that they need some supervision, some monitoring, perhaps some regulation, maybe even breaking up. Does that idea have legs?</p><p>MIKE ALLEN: Well, it does and it`s getting increasing legs because it appeals to both Republicans and Democrats for different reasons. Charlie, this could be a remarkable scene Tuesday and Wednesday on Capitol Hill, something that we haven`t seen in years. It`s been years since Facebook has testified.</p><p>Representatives of Facebook, Google, and Twitter testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the next day before the senate and house intelligence committees looking into what happened in the 2016 election, what`s being done preemptively ahead of 2020. And the subtext of that as you rightly say is, what else is going to be done to rein in these companies?</p><p>On the left, Democrats very concerned about the concentration of wealth, the concentration of power, wondering if these companies should be broken up in some way or regulated more as a utility. And then as we talked about on the right, among Republicans, so much suspicion of these platforms.</p><p>A little ironically, perhaps, since whatever effect the Russian ads had on the social platforms, they seem to have, if anything, helped <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>but Republicans look at these companies as political actors. They look at them as advocates for the other side. People want open borders, more progressive social policies. And so Republicans also would love to take the big tech down a notch.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Al?</p><p>AL HUNT: Well, Mike, as always is on to something. He said earlier, tell me if I`m wrong. I have been trying for 20 years now and never have been able to. But I do think maybe the bottom line won`t occur. I agree there`s a left and a right coalition that both are angry at big tech. I think the coalition will break down when you come to what can you do about it.</p><p>And for all the concerns and all the anxiety, this is an enormously powerful group. Remember their fight against the Hollywood studios who they clobbered four or five years ago. So my guess there will be a lot of sound and thunder, but in the end not a whole lot will happen.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: There is also this issue of sexual harassment which is happening a lot and lots of plots of conversation, lots of women coming forward. We`re seeing a lot of talk about what it means and where it`s going. Is this touching Washington? Where is it in the nation`s capital?</p><p>MIKE ALLEN: Well, Charlie, what we`re seeing is that industry by industry, this is becoming a subject of conversation, of investigation, and what`s fascinating about it, what`s so instructive for your viewers, how quickly this has happened. It was three weeks ago plus a day or two that \"The New York Times\" broke its story about Harvey Weinstein, and look at the industries that touched since then including media.</p><p>And, Charlie, I think next is government, and you were right to bring in Washington. One of the fascinating sort of leading-edge stories of this week, Associated Press correspondents and a couple of state houses asked around and with just a few state houses involved came up with hundreds of people saying that when it comes to lobbying, when it comes to legislation, that some of these issues that arose in Hollywood also are issues in state capitals.</p><p>So, Charlie, there you`re going to see investigations, you`re going to see accusations. So, this is going to be if not the story of the year, one of the stories of the year because every industry has their list, every industry has targets. There are a lot of men who are rightly worried that they`re next.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Al?</p><p>AL HUNT: Charlie, I agree that California state legislature already has taken action, and I think congress will be the next target.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Let me turn to the president. Notwithstanding what we`ve said about the senators and the former president who spoke to them, two former presidents who spoke about the president, he`s getting ready to go to China and I want to talk about that.</p><p>But what are the difficulties that he faces right now in this fall season as he tries to get some legislative victory on the board and he has got Steve Bannon now attacking the republican establishment, where is he in terms of his own presidency? What`s the moment for <person><nameText>Donald Trump?</nameText></person></p><p>AL HUNT: It starts off, Charlie -- Charlie, he starts off with historically low popularity and as we`ve said earlier, he`s got great strength in the Republican Party which means he has none among Democrats and is really weak among independents. That`s not a good political position.</p><p>Might help you with your own party caucus, but I don`t think he engenders a lot of fear among many Democrats around the country. There is a whole question about whether he can govern. I think that was implicit in some of the stuff, the George H.W. Bush said, and there`s a question of -- I mean, General Kelly was going to bring order to the White House and General Kelly just has had a miserable week in which I`m not sure he`ll ever quite recover from.</p><p>So I think that for all the successes that we alluded to earlier, and I would add the opioid speech which I think was a rare moment of looking presidential, I still think this is a very troubled presidency.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Mike?</p><p>MIKE ALLEN: And, Charlie, you mentioned the China trip, and I know that has been on your mind for a while. This fascinating Asia swing, the choreography of a presidential trip abroad always so vital, but this is going to be one of the most fascinating presidential trips we`ve ever covered because he`s going to be going to Japan where he`s going to see the emperor.</p><p>He`s going to be going to South Korea where so many American citizens are worried about what might be happening on the other side of the border, and he`s going to China where President Xi has never looked stronger, his name written into the constitution. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>will probably ask him for tips on how to get that done.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MIKE ALLEN: But all this is designed to bring pressure on North Korea, and that`s why this is so delicate. Fascinating reporting this week, a split in the White House, do you take the president to the demilitarized zone?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>MIKE ALLEN: Such a frequent stop for presidents. Reporting is that they have decided not to do that. Concerns about both the look and the also the physical danger that might be involved.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: North Korea will be clearly one of the topics there, and we had this week from the director of the CIA, sort of an alarming assessment of where the North Koreans were. And we have an interesting piece coming up on \"60 Minutes\" this weekend about the same subject. Al, North Korea, where are we?</p><p>AL HUNT: No, I think there is certainly more talk about a possible military solution now. It`s not to say it`s going to happen, but it`s a serious situation. And, you know what? Nothing`s going to be accomplished without the Chinese. And <person><nameText>Xi Jinping </nameText></person>right now I think not only in China -- imagine <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in the American constitution. James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>somehow doesn`t come together.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>AL HUNT: But , I think around much of the world, there is a feeling that the Chinese leader is a more formidable and enduring figure than the American leader. You know, nothing good can happen in North Korea -- I`m not sure any good can happen anyway -- but it can`t happen without the Chinese.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Mike Allen, Al Hunt, thank you so much.</p><p>MIKE ALLEN: Happy weekend, Charlie.</p><p>AL HUNT: Thank you, Charlie.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Have a great weekend.</p><p>Turning to further elaboration of events in China, China`s Communist Party held its congress this week, its 19th congress. President <person><nameText>Xi Jinping </nameText></person>was officially enshrined in the party charter during the ranks of Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong. The president, <person><nameText>Xi Jinping, </nameText></person>emerges from the congress as China`s most powerful leader in decades.</p><p>But as David Ignatius writes in Friday`s Washington Post in China, it may be wise to appear less powerful than you are. We are now talking to David Ignatius. David, set up for me how <person><nameText>Xi Jinping </nameText></person>became what he is, what he wants to do, and why in the seeds of that may be a threat to his power?</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: Charlie, this week`s party congress was a kind of coronation of Xi as a supreme leader of a kind that China hasn`t seen since Mao Zedong. Five years ago, when Xi became general secretary of the Communist Party and President of China, he began consolidating power in a way that was not immediately clear.</p><p>But we can now see was from the beginning a decisive attempt to put his personal imprint on China and really change the nature of what had been a collected shared leadership, fairly cautious leadership in the years after Mao, after Deng Xiaoping.</p><p>The way he did it was to seek to purify a Communist Party that it become corrupt. He was correct in seeing that as China grew rich, the bribes that were being paid to party officials, to generals in the army were beginning to weaken China, to eat out the core of the system and make people doubt the party`s fitness to rule.</p><p>So as I noted in my column this morning, in the last five years under Xi`s leadership, 1.5 million members of the Communist Party have been disciplined. Two hundred and seventy thousand have been prosecuted. Eleven percent of the central committee has been prosecuted for corruption or other crimes. The same thing has happened in the military. Thirteen thousand officers have been sacked. Fifty generals have been replaced.</p><p>So during the last five years of Xi`s reign, basically a complete turnover in the leadership of China and the new people are his people. So what that means is he now owns China. He is responsible for every bit of its economic, foreign, security policy. They`re all his people. There is nowhere else to turn. Once upon a time, it was collective, blame and credit were shared. Not anymore.</p><p>The point of my column this morning was that`s a little bit dangerous. When you own responsibility for a country as big as China, if things go wrong, you have to take the blame. There`s nowhere else to share it. And I have been hearing from the China watchers that I respect the most murmurings that even as Xi has consolidated power, the chance that he could have a misstep down the road may actually have increased.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What happened to Wang Qishan who was on the Standing Committee, who was his close friend, who was his ally in the anti- corruption effort but was no longer on the Standing Committee? Some thought that if he would continue in the Standing Committee, it would give Xi an opportunity if he wanted it to say, well, we are no longer honoring our 65- year rule.</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: There`s a lot of speculation, Charlie, as you know, about Wang Qishan who was the chief enforcer of Xi Jinping`s anti-corruption campaign, heading the so-called Discipline Inspection Committee. And it was thought that his tenure in that post, his tenure and senior position might be extended as a kind of forerunner of a similar extension for Xi when he finishes his second term as general secretary.</p><p>Typically there`s been a 10-year term limit. It was thought maybe Wang Qishan will be the forerunner to break that mold. It didn`t happen. Why? There are all kinds of rumors. I should note for your viewers, this is speculation. There are rumors in the west that there may be issues involving Wang Qishan and his family, similar to those he`s investigated with others (ph).</p><p>The most likely theory is that Xi wanted to save this mold-breaking for himself. He didn`t want to use that unusual tool too early for his ally Wang, but instead down the road five years say perhaps it`s time for me to continue as leader rather than turn it over to someone else.</p><p>The important point is, there`s nobody else in the wings. This is the first time in decades that there hasn`t been a next generation leader pre- selected. So we`re going to head to the end of this 10-year period without any obvious successor in place.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: In fact, most of the people in the Standing Committee are over 60 themselves.</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: They`re older people. As you say, Xi`s contemporaries. There were thoughts that there might be some younger people in their `50s. The Guangdong Party secretary often was mentioned as a possibility who would be in line to be the leader in the next generation. That didn`t happen. There is speculation that it didn`t happen because Xi doesn`t want competition.</p><p>The younger guy kind of beginning to jockey for position. But he`s going to have a group of contemporaries. He`s going to have essentially unchallenged rule. His factions running his politics is very factionalized. His faction now dominates both the Politburo itself, 17 to 25 members, and the Standing Committee of the Politburo which is the key ruling body, four of the seven members. So, he`s really in the driver`s seat in every way possible.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Now that he`s consolidated all this power and stands alone, will China be different? Will it be more aggressive? Will it -- does it have ambitions for greater influence around the world?</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: I think, Charlie, that may be the most important corollary of the party congress that we`ve just seen. China under Xi is now being more explicit and direct about its ambitions not simply to be a regional power that exercises more authority in the South China Sea but to be a global power.</p><p>Xi talked a lot in his lengthy three and a half hours speech to this Party Congress about the strategy known as one belt, one road, which essentially is the Chinese idea for consolidating trade all the way to Europe through Central Asia. It`s a very ambitious scheme. And it`s China projecting economic and ultimately military power.</p><p>Xi also, in his report to the party, sketched a process of growth for China not simply through his tenure, but all the way to 2050. In that sense, he has ambitions I think that go beyond his personal ambition to be a Mao-like leader. He has a vision of China, he calls it the China dream.</p><p>And I think Americans need to understand that China sees American power weakening. It`s preparing its own instruments, financial, military and otherwise, to fill the space that, in Chinese eyes, America is giving up.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And especially in technology. You see the rise of Chinese technological companies that are in some cases bigger than the companies they were paralleling.</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: Xi`s speech made note of the specific technologies that China wants to dominate. Internet communications technology, artificial intelligence, go down the list. One thing that he didn`t talk about specifically but that the Chinese talk often about at other venues is quantum computing, a subject I`ve written a new novel about. So the scope of China`s ambition and Xi`s personally I think is really central now.</p><p>And Americans need to see it clearly. The period in which the Chinese, the phrase was hide and bide. You know, make your power less visible, bide your time, wait for America, hang out in the shadows as it were. That period`s over.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: There is coming to China, a man from the west, from Washington, D.C.</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: Indeed.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What`s the significance of this? And what might come out of it?</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: So, Charlie, I think President Trump`s visit to Asia but in particular to China which begins November third, is the most important trip of his presidency to date. The Chinese understand that Trump is reaching out to embrace Xi. The Trump who threw last year`s presidential campaign attacked China. China is raping us on trade, all the rhetoric that we remember. That`s gone. He now speaks of Xi as my very good friend, a very good person.</p><p>As you noted, he likened him to a king and he didn`t do that critically but almost enthusiastically. I think he sees <person><nameText>Xi Jinping </nameText></person>as --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: Well, he may have ambitions of his own. But I think he sees <person><nameText>Xi Jinping </nameText></person>as a kindred spirit. They`re both kind of big guys physically. Tall, burly. They both have a very direct, emphatic style of leadership. Xi, in China, sometimes known as Big Daddy Xi, Xi Dada. I think Trump would love to be seen in a similar way.</p><p>I think the Chinese will go all out to make this visit as friendly, as successful as possible, a big welcoming ceremonies. The Chinese can put on a spectacular show. I think there will be efforts to make the relationship appear very much personal, warm, maybe involve the families in some way.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: I think the issue that we should focus on, because there be a lot of confetti tossed in the air, the issue we should focus on is whether the Chinese are actually willing to deliver more on North Korea and trade in particular.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has made a big bet that China will help by really squeezing North Korea, will help him get more from North Korea in terms of actual negotiations about their weapons programs than any president`s gotten before.</p><p>He also hopes that the very unbalanced trade relationship that the U.S. has had with China for decades will change, that the Chinese will recognize the price of our exceeding to their greater role is their being more responsible and more balanced to playing field in trade.</p><p>So that`s the way both sides are setting the table. I think both sides have such a strong interest in this visit being successful that, you know, the headlines will probably be positive, but the Chinese will have to move some especially on North Korea.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: David Ignatius, thank you so much.</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: Thanks, Charlie.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Have a great weekend.</p><p>DAVID IGNATIUS: You, too.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: We`ll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p><person><nameText>Roger Altman </nameText></person>is here. He is the founder and senior chairman of the investment banking firm Evercore. He is a former deputy treasure secretary under President Clinton.</p><p>He has an op-ed in today`s Washington Post in which he writes, \"the election of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was, in many respects, the greatest presidential election upset in modern U.S. history. Now, with his presidency reeling amid a special counsel probe, multiple resignations, an absence of legislative achievements and dismal approval ratings, many Americans already seem to view his victory as the equivalent of a hundred-year flood. In other words, the type of surprise that today`s voters won`t see again, except they will.\"</p><p>I`m pleased to have <person><nameText>Roger Altman </nameText></person>back at this table. Why will they?</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: It will because the underlying cause of such voter anger that reflected itself in Trump`s election I think is economic. There are just some basic facts that frame that. If you just look at wage trends, if you look at household income trends, if you look at the financial condition of American households, and if you look at income mobility, you see stagnation.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Stagnation for two decades.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, wages haven`t risen in this country essentially for 40 years, 0.2 (ph) percent.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: As of end of last year. Household income, real median household income hasn`t risen in 20 years. The Federal Reserve does a survey every three years of what they call the well-being of the American household. They did it last year. They found which is really quite stunning, that 46 percent of American households could not meet a $400 emergency expense without borrowing or selling something.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And you suggest that signals a new era of extreme voter discontent?</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So the American dream, essentially you`re suggesting, is over.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Because the dream was that each generation would do better than the previous.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: And the data shows today, and this is very I would say profound research done by (INAUDIBLE) at Stanford and others working with him, data shows that for those who were born in 1980, the 1980 cohort, who are now roughly 35 years old and in their prime working years, only about half of that cohort is going to live better than its parents.</p><p>And if you were to measure the 1990 group which is now obviously 25, 27 years old, and they haven`t done that yet, but you will would likely find, that less than half is going to live better than its parents because this trend has been going down steadily for 40 years.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And why is the trend going down steadily?</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Well, most economists would cite three to four factors: Globalization, technology, the decline of unions, and stagnant results on education this country, college completion rates, for example. And these trends, unfortunately, as you know, are very deep-seated and they`re very long-term and they`re not likely to abate. Nothing suggests these trends will abate. And therefore, there`s nothing to suggest that this vast income stagnation is going to change and, therefore, the anger that we saw in 2016, I think, is the beginning of a period of election volatility driven by that voter anger and that we`re going to see continued surprises, and Trump is just the first.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yet, you also say it is possible -- it is possible to imagine a bold policy agenda that might move wages up, it could involve elements of other Republican, Democratic wish list like huge federal infrastructure, business tax reforms, steps to increase college entrance and completion rates, expansion of the earned income tax credit, and better protection against abuses in overtime pay, and work schedules, and all of that. You`re saying it`s possible to imagine, but are you saying you can imagine it but it won`t happen because of the political--</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- gridlock?</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: If, in a perfect world, and we don`t live in that, of course, there are five or six great big steps that this country could take which, at least over the next few years, four to seven, eight years, could well move wages up, and I cite a few of them there. And let`s just take the example of a giant federal infrastructure initiative. And I`m talking about $1 trillion to $2 trillion over 10 to 20 years, that`s something we should have done 5, 10 or 15 years ago. We are to do it today, but we are nowhere near doing it as you know. Infrastructure is not on the agenda right now in Washington, for reasons that are strange. But it`s a perfect example.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: On the agenda, but after so many other things.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Well, both sides agree--</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Tax reform--</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Both sides agree that we ought to an infrastructure initiative, they just can`t agree on how to finance it, they can`t agree on how to govern it, and therefore it`s going anywhere. You know, Trump propose in the campaign that it ought to be done, Charlie, with private capital. That`s a really unsound idea in so many respects. Democrats, you know, typically view this as grants to mayors and governors, and that`s probably not perfect either historically. But it`s the type of thing that`s a perfect example of what we could do in a different political environment, but we`re not doing. And so, you just can`t say to yourself with a straight face that we`re going to take any of these steps that could possibly have a medium turn upward impact on wages. We`re not going to do them.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You say also that continues to be a debate among political scientists and sociologist, whether this income pressures that kept wages as they have come from cultural factors such as rebellion against the establishment or something else?</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Well, you know there is a big debate right now as to what really caused this election result in 2016. And on one side you have sociologists who think it`s primarily cultural factors, resentment and anger toward the establishment as people see the establishment, and economists who many of which think it`s primarily the types of economic factors I`ve talked about on my own view and I say in the piece. These two are interrelated because economic stagnation causes resentment. And I think it`s one issue, not two, but I think at the very bottom of it all is this -- the vast stagnation.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You were an advisor to Secretary of State Clinton. Did she believe in this, did she appreciate this, does she understand this?</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: She did understand it, and didn`t need help from me to do that. Most people who think about these issues, Charlie, understand these problems.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But it speaks to the economic discontent, it speaks to the problems that people are having, the frustration, the wage stagnation, it speaks to all those things, yet they listen to another candidate rather than her.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Well, there are, you know, so many factors that explain her failure to win. But I think you had a very angry electorate for the reason we`re talking about here.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And he was able to tap into it more than she was.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Because he was talking about blowing everything up. We need to blow everything up and change everything. And that for -- reasons of this unhappiness and stagnation appeal to people.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Look at the economy today. We`ve just had a recent report of 3 percent.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Three percent as reported today.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: We have stock markets going through the ceiling.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What`s going on?</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Well, you know, there`s a widespread view right now in the investment community that we`re seeing what they call synchronized global growth. We`re seeing an acceleration of global growth. China doing better, Europe finally beginning to come to life, and some improvement in the U.S. growth rate, and we saw that today, 3 percent is a good quarter. And that is the main factor -- not the only one, the main factor driving markets to these breathtaking levels, and I think there`s reasonable data to suggest that, yes, global growth is doing better and the IMF has changed its forecast, and so forth. I happen to think the stock market is at scary levels, but that`s a whole different issue. But the data I talk about in this piece incorporate -- excuse me, the stagnation I talk about in this piece incorporates the very latest data. So, yes, the economy is doing a little bit better and, yes, over the past couple of years average hourly earnings for example have ticked up. Have ticked up--</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Employment is down -- unemployment is down.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: -- 4.2 percent.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: But that`s all reflected. I mean, we`ve just--</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: For all those economic factors whether it`s market factors, GDP factors, employment factors signaling that the economy is sort of coming out of--</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: If you said or anybody said we`re going to be able to grow at 3 percent-plus for the next quite a few years, we would see wages and incomes improve.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So growth of the economy is crucial.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, but our demographics -- simply, for example, the declining size of our workforce--</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: -- as the population ages and a large percentage of, for example, working age males aren`t in the workforce for all sorts of reasons and the opioid epidemic is one of them.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Technology--</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: And so forth. But our demographics basically say that we don`t have the capacity today to grow on a steady year after year basis of 3 percent. We don`t. We have about a 2 percent long-term growth potential just based on the size of our population, which slowed way down in terms of its growth.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Are you saying that any politician have suggests we can achieve a GDP between 3 and 4 percent is--</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Well, if you could wave a wand and you could take a series of the steps we talked about here, you could probably get the growth rate up for a medium-term period of time to that level, I mean five years, six years, something like that. But do we have the capacity today in the United States to grow a 3 percent for the next 10 or 15 years? We don`t. We don`t. We have to have a very, very, very different immigration policy, and we`d have to see our population as a whole start to grow instead of be stagnant. We just don`t have -- you can`t grow -- I mean, growth is a function of basically productivity or capital and labor to put it that way. And the workforce in this country is not growing -- not particularly growing. So you can`t grow at a rate of 3 or 4 percent for the long term if your workforce isn`t growing. And Japan, by the way, is seeing this problem to a very deep degree because its population is actually declining.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And it`s an older demographic than us.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Right. So, it`s good to see the economy show a 3 percent growth, but don`t get me wrong, it`s great, and it has shown some little blip in wages these last two years, but the long-term trends aren`t changing, not in my view. I wish they were, but they`re not.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And there`s nothing we can do--</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: That`s politically feasible today.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That`s politically feasible today. So we have to change our politics it seems to be the argument that comes out of this. If we change our politics then we can begin to -- you`re a Democrat and we expect you to say we have to change our politics, although some Republicans are saying that.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Well, it doesn`t have to be a Democratic wave. If we somehow magically entered into a period, even a relatively brief period of bipartisanship following for example a great crisis, if there were to be a great crisis, 9/11, God forbid, redux, or something like that, we just might have a period of bipartisanship, and you might actually be able to do some of these things. And you can do them over a relatively short period of time. But absent bipartisanship, not so much just one party or the other, you can`t do these things.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And do you also believe -- I mean, we`ve just talked about the economic results that are in, do you expect to see if we don`t do any of the things that are recommended here to slip even further behind in terms of wage growth, in terms of economic growth, in terms--</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: As you know, and you`ve had debates on this show to this effect. There`s an enormous debate about the long-term demand for work--</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: -- and whether technology is going to undermine the long- term--</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: One of the important -- I say this all the time here, every table I sit at--</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Probably the number one social and economic issue.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Exactly right.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. And I happen to be a bit pessimistic on that. I know the technology has always created as many jobs as it has destroyed historically, but I think the accelerating pace of technology which is astonishing suggests, at least to me, that it is going to undermine the demand for work. So, I think over the next to or 20 years as I say in the piece, we`re going to see this continued stagnation, we`re going to see very unhappy voters, and they`re going to produce elections to surprise us. Over the very long term it looks tough to me. It looks difficult.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Steve Bannon says what`s going to happen in this country, we`ll either have economic nationalism from the right or from the left.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Well, one--</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The left would be Bernie Sanders. The right would be Steve Bannon.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: One outcome that would not surprise me would be to see either in 2020 or 2024 the exact opposite of Trump, which would be--</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That would be from the left, populism from the left.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. You know, we have a -- I don`t know if I`d call it tradition, we have a dynamic in this country where at least in the modern era, voters tend to want the opposite of what they`ve just had. So Obama following George W. Bush, JFK following Eisenhower, and so forth.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Reagan following Carter.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Right. And the exact opposite of Trump would be someone like Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, someone like that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: So it wouldn`t surprise me at all if that`s -- what we get next in this era of election--</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But they`re likely to be able to get the legislation and the agenda passed?</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: No.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why not?</p><p><person><nameText>ROGER ALTMAN</nameText></person>: Because the country is so polarized and, of course, the politics reflects that. So if you had a massive wave where both houses of congress went the other way, in this case Democrats, and you had -- the Democrats would pass a lot of legislation, yes, but I don`t see that happening -- I don`t see the pendulum swinging that far in this country myself.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: <person><nameText>Roger Altman. </nameText></person>Back in a moment. Stay with us. We`ll talk to Larry Sabato about the <person><nameText>Kennedy assassination. </nameText></person>Stay with us.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: On Thursday night, the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>released thousands of government files regarding the assassination of <person><nameText>President John F. Kennedy </nameText></person>which took place on November 22nd, 1963. The documents made public in accordance with a 1992 law that require their release after 25 years. In a last minute decision, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>vowed to advise us in withholding certain documents from publication over national security concerns. Joining me from Virginia is Dr. Larry Sabato, he is the founder and director of the center for politics at the University of Virginia. His team of researchers is currently reviewing the Kennedy files. I`m pleased to have him back on this program. Welcome.</p><p>LARRY SABADO, CENTER OF POLITICS DIRECTOR: Thank you, Charlie. Appreciate it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Let me begin with this, what might be -- what are historians looking for here, and I know you`re continuing to look at these documents, what might they find?</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Well, there are little gems throughout, Charlie. There`re little nuggets. And I think, gradually, these nuggets will fill in pieces of the puzzle that we have never quite fully understood. But what are we looking for? We`re looking to see if anything contradicts the basic conclusion reached by most people who`ve really examined the assassination that Lee Harvey Oswald was the shooter, probably the lone shooter, that`s my view, in Dealey Plaza. We want to know more about him. We want to know what his motive was. We`re still unsure about the motive, unfortunately, thanks to Jack Ruby, who I consider one of the real villains of the <person><nameText>Kennedy assassination, </nameText></person>had he not shot Oswald, it`s almost certain that the police would have gotten from him his motives rather quickly by hook or crook.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And what do we know about -- I mean, anything to know about why Jack Ruby did it?</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Well, not in these documents that we`ve seen so far. And I want to stress, we have not come close to finishing the work just on these, and the ones that Trump held back may well include more information about Ruby and Oswald and everybody else. I think that`s the good stuff. What we`ve got right now basically doesn`t change the time line of the assassination, doesn`t change the basics, but it does add some very interesting little qualities to it that we weren`t fully familiar with prior to this.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Like?</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Well, I`ll give you an example. One document had been released in part before this, and this particular document shows that a telephone call was made to a reporter at a Cambridge newspaper in the United Kingdom. The call came in at 12:05 PM Dallas time, in other words, 25 minutes before President Kennedy was assassinated. The anonymous caller said you better call the U.S. embassy, there is going to be big news coming out of the United States. Now either that`s the greatest coincidence in world history or it suggests that somebody knew something from some source about what was going to happen in Dallas. What`s new about it is we didn`t know that British intelligence had checked that out and checked the reporter out and, to the extent they were able to do so, they validated it. They were never able to find the person. In those days it was impossible, particularly, if you were calling from a phone booth. So we`ll never know who that anonymous person was, but it certainly was odd.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What else? I mean, that`s fascinating tidbit.</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Oh, there`re so many other things. There`s a Cuban intelligence person in 1967 who`s chatting with another Cuban in an interview, and they were discussing the <person><nameText>Kennedy assassination, </nameText></person>and one of the Cubans said to the other, you know, Lee Harvey Oswald must have been a pretty good shot. And the second Cuban said, oh, he was. He was very good, I knew him. Well, W, was it true? Was it true? You know, maybe they were bragging. But if it were true, how did he get to know Lee Harvey Oswald? Was it at the Cuban embassy in Mexico City when Oswald went there seven weeks before the assassination, and spent six days, Charlie, six days? We know about a few hours when he went to the Soviet embassy and the Cuban embassy. What happened? And also, J. Edgar Hoover suggested to the Warren Commission his sources had told him that Fidel Castro said, as Oswald was leaving the Cuban embassy, I`m going to killed <person><nameText>John F. Kennedy, </nameText></person>I`m going to prove my fidelity to the revolution, I`m going to kill President Kennedy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I missed that. Who said I`m going to kill--</p><p>LARRY SABATO: J. Edgar Hoover -- Oswald.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Oswald said I`m going to kill--</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Oswald said that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- and prove my fidelity to the revolution?</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Yes. That`s essentially what Hoover communicated to the Warren Commission. Why didn`t the Warren Commission follow up? Well, first of all, they didn`t have direct access to Fidel Castro. And second, they downplayed the Mexico City incident for obvious reasons. President Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, and others, in various ways, formal and informal, communicated to Chief Justice Warren and others on the Warren Commission that the last thing they wanted was for anything to come out of this commission that could trigger a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Johnson feared that the American people if they thought the Soviets or the Cubans had anything to do this would demand retaliation and then it would inevitably lead to nuclear war.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: There comes out of this also the name of someone name El Mexicano.</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Who is that?</p><p>LARRY SABATO: This is -- well, no one`s entirely sure. This is a very odd incident. We`re investigating it. I think I`m going to take a pass on that one for the time being.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Because you don`t know enough yet, or because it`s so tantalizing you want to have more before you say anything?</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Both. We want to find out what we can find out. And, Charlie, you`ve seen intelligence files before. This is what -- really is a lot of this disclosure. You have raw information here. You have a lot of gossip, and rumor, and innuendo, and people writing down anything that anybody who called in said and, of course, a lot of it is just junk and it wasn`t true. It wasn`t true then, and they may not even have taken time to debunk it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: One theory is that both the CIA and FBI wanted to cover up their own, for the lack of a better word, incompetence.</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Well, Charlie, they dropped the ball on Lee Harvey Oswald. Think about this guy. He was one of the few American defectors to the Soviet Union. I mean, who wanted to go to the Soviet Union back then? He defected. He was a very strange person before that. Had been arguing Marxism in his marine barracks with others and gotten into fights about it. Then he comes back, after having defected with money provided by the state department and almost immediately is campaigning on behalf of Fidel Castro in New Orleans. And the story gets more complicated, but essentially this guy stood out like a sore thumb. He was a misfit, he`s a sociopath, and both the CIA and the FBI knew it. They were tracking him in various ways. The shocker in this is not only that the FBI and the CIA not communicate regularly with one other, and that`s putting it mildly, neither one of them ever told the secret service about Lee Harvey Oswald. This assassination could definitely have been prevented.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That non-communication predated the government all the way up through 9/11.</p><p>LARRY SABATO: It sure did. And, of course, it was supposedly fixed after that. I bet you there`s problems we don`t know about because it`s human nature, agencies want to reserve information to themselves, knowledge is power, and they have the power as long as they have the information, which is another reason why they`re arguing so strenuously to keep many of these documents hidden.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But at the same time, are you suggesting and do you know that those documents that have been redacted, that they are withholding for now, are some of the things that is really containing the questions that most everybody wants to know more about? In other words, what they`re hiding or keeping for themselves right now on national security reasons is the very thing that most people, analyst, and researchers know contains possible further understanding of what happened?</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Well, that would be my guess. There`s got to be some reason why they think it`s so sensitive. It can`t just be that there`s the name of some source, and they`re suggesting that the ones who are living, there can`t be many, would be endangered, potentially, and now they`re adding their families, too. Well, you know, people have families for generations and decades and centuries. Is that going to be the permanent excuse for keeping this private? There`s got to be something in there that embarrasses them or that gives us a new theme, a new line on the assassination, and they`re not interested in letting everybody know what that is.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Did hoover ever talk about this to any degree?</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Only privately. He liked to talk to the president about it, some of the people in the justice department, the senior people there, and, of course, senior people in his own operation. He had strong opinions about lots of things. He was furious at the Dallas police department. The FBI had called and asked them what they needed, it was essential to protect Oswald, and the Dallas police department said, oh, we don`t need any help, everything`s fine, nothing will happen. Well, we know what happened. And Hoover went through the roof and called it inexcusable. And realized immediately what it meant, it meant no end to conspiracy theories. No end ever. We`ll be talking about this 200 years from now. Not you and I, but others.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Robert Kennedy`s son told me in Dallas, and only one time that his father never believed the Warren Commission or something exactly like that, something close to that. That doesn`t say he had a theory as to what happened, but he said he was troubled by the Warren Commission`s report. Can you tell me more about that?</p><p>LARRY SABATO: Is that exactly true? Yes, that`s exactly true, and I`ve had chance to talk to a couple of the Kennedys over the years and they all report the same thing that it seemed impossible to Bobby Kennedy, and also to Jackie Kennedy that this was the product of one man`s imagination, that he managed to carry it off. Although, you know, strange things happen. It is possible, if you look at human history, some of the least people can take care of some of those with the most to offer. But the Kennedy`s thought at various times, it was Castro seeking revenge or it was the anti- Castro Cubans seeking revenge because of the Bay of Pigs, or that the Soviet Union might have been involved, or that the mafia, the fact they had pursue -- the Kennedys have pursued Jimmy Hoffa, other members of the mafia, Sam Giancana, who knows? But all the evidence we`ve had, and every piece of investigation that`s been done by a neutral party not trying to prove a particular theory suggests that Oswald, at least, was the lone shooter. Now, if others were involved, that`s another subject entirely. It`s possible that there were people behind Oswald.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Larry, thank you so much.

Money laundering and conspiracy indictments were handed down for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business partner Richard Gates. Both pled not guilty.</p><p>But the bigger news may be that a former campaign advisor, George Papadopoulos, pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his efforts to establish a relationship with the Russians. With me is Nick Confessore. He is a political investigative reporter for \"The New York Times\". Welcome, Nick.</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Good to be here.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: So, let`s do the timeline for people. Manafort joins the campaign to help wrangle delegates at one point. That`s in March.</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Right.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: In June, he takes over as campaign chairman. By August, he`s out.</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Correct.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: So, all this has to do with the campaign, yet his indictment had to do with all of his the work in the Ukraine. Why is that relevant?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Well, what`s important here is that for years and years before he joined the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort was working abroad at the intersection of business and politics. He would export American- style campaign consulting to places like the Ukraine and then do business with oligarchs in the Ukraine and Russia.</p><p>He had his business ties. Where it connects is, as he was coming on the Trump campaign, he was still in contact with some of those oligarchs and some of his Russian contacts. And appeared that he owed a lot of debts or had financial relationships outstanding with some of these people in eastern Europe and in Russia.</p><p>And that is the crux of why there might be more here for the counsel. But the reason he`s in trouble right now is because as he was working for the Ukraine, he was lying about working for the Ukraine.</p><p>Under U.S. law if you`re working for a foreign power, you have to register in Washington and provide detailed disclosures. He did not do that. He claimed he was working for some center in London and it turns out in fact he was running the whole lobbying campaign for Ukrainian political party.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: This indictment was incredibly detailed. We found out about bank accounts. We found out he spent $850,000 on clothing in four years. That kind of detail, who is that giving pause to in the administration right now?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: That`s a great question. Look, I think that if you are in the inside in the White House right now, this is a terrifying time. <person><nameText>Bob Mueller </nameText></person>has access to tax returns. He was able to get bank accounts from Cyprus that Paul Manafort had access to. He was able to chart money flows.</p><p>So, if, as we know, the Trump family had business connections in Russia which was trying to do deals with them, was selling apartments to wealthy Russians, and if, as we know, people in the Trump orbits like Michael Cohen were doing a lot of business with people with money in Russia and Eastern Europe, it`s very easy to understand that Mueller is going to have access to all of that money flow.</p><p>He`s probably going to be able to see it and track it. And if there is anything that suggests a running financial relationship between Trump or his world and some of these interests, it`s going to show up.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: How wide (INAUDIBLE) does Mueller have?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Technically, it`s not that wide, right? But he is allowed to investigate crimes he discovers in the course of the investigation. So, he was not appointed to inquire as to whether Paul Manafort was working for the Ukraine and hadn`t registered under the Foreign Agents Act, but he did find that out in the course of investigating. And now there is a prosecution and a trial set for next year.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Last week about this time, it was leaked that there would be an indictment. And over the weekend, I`m sure you heard a lot of people, who is it going to be? Is it going to be Flynn? Is it going to be Manafort? A lot of people thought it would be former national security advisor Michael Flynn. Do we know why it wasn`t? Were you surprised it wasn`t Flynn?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: You know, I had my money on either Flynn or Manafort and Gates, and the reason is those two guys or those three men are the lowest hanging fruit in the investigation. Paul Manafort was already under federal investigation for some of his activities in Eastern Europe and Ukraine and Russia. He was already under the gun.</p><p>And Flynn, we already know, had likewise not disclosed properly that he was working on behalf of a foreign government, in this case Turkey. That stuff has been reported. It`s been out there. There`s plenty of stuff on the ground for the prosecutors to look at. So I`m not surprised it would be some mix of that, but look, there are a bunch of sealed indictments in that courthouse that have not come out yet and we`re all waiting to see who`s next.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: The name that no one said last Friday was George Papadopoulos. I`m going to guess most people didn`t say George Papadopoulos. He`s a new player to a lot of people here. Who is he the most concerning for right now?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: I think he`s the most concerning for Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions. And the reason is, you know, you saw the first indictment or pair of indictments come out with Gates and Manafort. And instantly, the Trump White House said, see, no connection to Russia, it`s not about the campaign, it`s all a mess, it`s all bogus.</p><p>Then a few hours later out comes the Papadopoulos indictment and what it shows, actually more of a guilty plea, I should say, and what it shows is that, in fact, this was a named foreign policy advisor who sat in meetings with Sessions, sat in a meeting with President Trump, now President Trump, and was trying to arrange meetings back and forth with Russian interests and the Russian government.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: The Trump administration puts him basically an intern.</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: It`s true. But, look, what we`re seeing here with Manafort and Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis who was also a foreign policy advisor but not a guy with a huge amount of expertise in foreign policy, what we are seeing is a side effect of the nature of Trump`s campaign.</p><p>He could not get the best people in Republican politics. He could not get the top shelf foreign policy advisers. So ended up with Carter Page, a guy who claimed to be an oil executive but actually works out of shared office space near Trump Tower, and Papadopoulos is a guy who falsified his credential on his resume which shows you the actual level of qualification.</p><p>So it`s true and fair to say this was not a heavy hitter, but he is one of the five people who the campaign at an early stage had put on its foreign policy committee and he was clearly empowered to be working on behalf of the campaign in setting his foreign policy and what we`ll find out is how much the other Trump officials, the senior officials on the campaign, knew about his intersections with and conversations with Russians.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: It also shown a light that Jeff Sessions misremembered again.</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Yes, you know, Sessions has been kind of towing a careful line on recollections of meetings with Russians and Russian ambassadors and what we see here as he`s changed his story now, and it`s going to be -- again, really fascinating to see what the whole paper trail is.</p><p>We now know that there are pictures of the meeting and a lot will depend on what Sessions can credibly say about what he knew about the conversations and what kinds of permissions or authorizations Papadopoulos had and what he was kind of carrying back and forth in terms of information, offers, ideas.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: What does it say to you as an investigative reporter that no one knew about George Papadopoulos, or most people in the know didn`t know about him?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Well, you know, we knew who he was. We knew he was on the circle of the five foreign policy advisers, but I think --</p><p>ALISON STEWART: It didn`t leak even.</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Well, it didn`t leak. And, look, that tells me that <person><nameText>Bob Mueller </nameText></person>knows a whole lot that we in the media and the public don`t know. He knows a lot. There was material -- you know, I`m very familiar with Paul Manafort`s business, his work in the Ukraine.</p><p>There was material in the indictment that I had never seen before, I had suspected. It was fascinating. You can get, when you`re a prosecutor like him, when you can get Cyprus to hand over banking records, you can get behind the veil, and Manafort had really cast a veil over his activities and was lying about them.</p><p>The Papadopoulos part, it just shows you there are not many leaks coming out of, you know, coming out of Mueller`s operation. I think a lot of leaks are coming out of the fence, as they often do. He is running a very tight ship. And there`s no -- I mean, some shoe will drop next but it`s not clear which one.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Let`s talk about the court proceedings so far. We learned a lot of interesting things. Paul Manafort has three passports among them, they consider him a flight risk. He and Gates are both on house arrest. What else did we learn from Thursday`s court proceeding that we should pay attention to going forward?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Well, what we now learned aside from his vast wardrobe, apparently, was that he had set up transactions in Cyprus that are really fascinating. In some ways, the indictment lace out Paul Manafort as a case study on how wealthy Americans avoid taxation, hide their money.</p><p>So as investigative reporter, I was really fascinated by it. The simple trick is, you park your money in offshore accounts and you bring onshore just the stuff you want to pay or to avoid even that, you have your offshore companies pay your bills for you directly to your vendors, whether it`s the person who is decorating your house or somebody else.</p><p>So we really saw in great detail how that works. The other piece was those three passports, I suspect we`re going to hear more about them. Why did he have three passports? Well, sometimes you get an extra passport because, you know, let`s say you visited Israel as a business person and you want to visit some Islamic country or Muslim country that doesn`t like Israel, you may want a second passport where the entry and exit visas for Israel are not on it.</p><p>But once you have those multiple passports, it is possible to use them in an interesting way to cloak or hide the places you`re visiting from. You can use one passport to get to London, then take a flight to Cyprus with the other passport, for example, and you can hide a lot about your movements until somebody actually bothers to check and look, pull the passports and compare them.</p><p>So I suspect we`re going to hear more about what the purpose of those three passports was and I don`t think it was an accident or he lost the passport.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: The judge in this case was not amused, not pleased that there have been discussion in the media about the lawyers who went to the media. What do you think about the way that she is going to conduct the courtroom? How long do you think we`re going to be involved in this trial?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: It`s a great question. Look, I think Manafort and Gates are maintaining that the indictment is misleading, they`ve not done anything wrong, they`re going to fight it. The interesting question is whether these two men have enough money left to spend on lawyers to fight this kind of a case.</p><p>But, look, it`s going to proceed almost on its own track. You are going to see a case that is essentially built around tax evasion, money laundering, and failure to disclose working for a foreign power.</p><p>And what I`m really going to be focusing on and listening for is whether at some point the progress of that trial creates opportunities for or additional pressure for Mueller to use to get these guys to tell him more things about Donald Trump.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: What`s next in Mueller`s investigation, from where you sit?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Like I said, it`s a tight ship --</p><p>ALISON STEWART: OK.</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: But what I see just based on the public facts, right, what you see is an experienced prosecutor doing two things, moving extraordinarily quickly, very, very fast. He indicted Paul Manafort within days, I believe, after getting the records from Cyprus of Manafort`s bank accounts.</p><p>And, two, he`s moving outside-in. He`s got Papadopoulos as a cooperating witness. It`s possible that he was actually cooperating in the investigation before the indictment was unsealed and the plea was unsealed.</p><p>There is a lot that George Papadopoulos could be saying, and we`ll find out whether there were any conversations he had while wiretapped with people in the Trump world. That`s going to be very interesting to find out. I suspect we`ll learn more about that in the months ahead.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: The obvious question everyone wants to know and wants to answer is how close it was, if there was Russian interference and collusion with the Trump administration, the inner circle. Outside of the obvious question, what`s the question that interests you?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: You know, the question that really, you know, I would say the question that I`m really intrigued by is whether -- so we know about two prongs of the Russian effort, right? One was to try to help maybe the Trump campaign, offer them damaging information on Hillary Clinton, sort of bolster his -- again, involved with him for various reasons.</p><p>The other was this social media information warfare campaign, setting up thousands or hundreds of fake pages and accounts on Twitter and Facebook and other social media platforms, using them to divide the country, push divisive content, target voters. A real open question that no one has been able to answer yet is whether those two efforts ever crossed paths.</p><p>Whether there was any exchange or collaboration between the Trump campaign in terms of its voter targeting and what the Russian intelligence agencies and proxies were doing to go after American voters. That I think is a critical, huge question.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Aside from all this, the president`s duties go on. He`s about the take off on this long trip to Asia, five stops in eleven days. Will this investigation have an impact on that trip in any way?</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Look, it already has. He`s been tweeting about fake news and a hoax investigation within minutes of his planned departure on this trip. On the other hand, we`ve often seen that sometimes these trips are so busy for the president, that some of his instincts to engage, to get on Twitter, to start fights are a bit repressed, he doesn`t have time as much.</p><p>We saw that on his trips to the Middle East. The kind of Twitter (INAUDIBLE) quieted down for a couple of days. It`s possible we`ll see that. I`m not really sure if where he is really affects what <person><nameText>Bob Mueller </nameText></person>is doing on any given day.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Nick Confessore from \"The New York Times\", thank you so much.</p><p>NICHOLAS CONFESSORE: Thank you.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Some of the social media ads bought and paid for by Russia during the last election were on display in Capitol Hill this week and they were shocking. Representatives of tech giants Facebook, Twitter, and Google all testified before house and senate committees about Russia`s attempts to influence the 2016 campaign and what should be done to prevent it from happening again.</p><p>Alexandra Suich Bass joins me now from San Francisco where she covers the tech industry for The Economist. Alexandra, what were the main questions the senators wanted answered during this testimony?</p><p>ALEXANDRA SUICH BASS, U.S. TECHNOLOGY EDITOR, THE ECONOMIST: The senators are really interested in the extent of the Russian campaign and they`re trying to get their heads around it. Initially, the tech giants were very evasive and really underplayed the threat that Russians had manipulated Americans in the lead up to the 2016 election.</p><p>They then come forward and said that they have found evidence that there were fake accounts and bots, ads that were directed at Americans that we are seeing before which might have influenced their votes.</p><p>And so the senators were really pressing the tech giants, one for details about how widespread the manipulation went. And then the other question was what the tech giants are going to do to make sure that nothing like this happens again particularly in the 2018 election.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Did the tech giants offer any details?</p><p>ALEXANDRA SUICH BASS: The tech giants showed us some of the ads and fake accounts for the first time. There were some really fascinating ones. For example, Hillary Clinton dressed up as the devil battling Jesus. And it was said, if you want Jesus to win, like this ad. And, of course, then if you have liked it or engaged the ad, you can be targeted again for some similar material.</p><p>We`ve seen that around 150 Americans, which is a huge percentage of Americans, were exposed to this content on Facebook and Instagram. So, in the hearings, we were able to see, A, the extent of the Russian messaging and, B, some of the specific messages, which I think were surprising in their directness.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: It`s sort of interesting in Washington, the hearing, the tech giants and senators seem to be talking past one another, because the tech folks kept saying, but we`re a platform, it`s sort of the \"I don`t recall\" of the tech industry. Explain why they want to stay with that \"we we`re just a platform\" saying.</p><p>ALEXANDRA SUICH BASS: Right. It`s kind of similar to the NRA that says, you know, guns don`t kill people, other people kill people. They basically don`t want to have any responsibility for how their tools are being used, the internet giants in this case.</p><p>They are very wary -- I think they`re being cautious, but they also have good reason to be. So, if you look at internationally how platforms are being used, they get constant take down requests from authoritarian governments or requests for more information about users.</p><p>So from Turkey, for example, Egypt. So they have to really be careful in establishing the precedent, that they`re willing to comply with governments in that regard, or that they`re responsible for hate speech or anything like that that occurs on their platforms.</p><p>So that`s why they`re saying we might accept advertising but we`re not your typical media company. I think where their response was really insufficient is Facebook especially has done this audit where they found a few thousand ads, they say, that were paid for in rubles.</p><p>I think that`s kind of the equivalent of saying, you know, the police investigate crimes based on which homes doors have been left open -- the front door has been left open.</p><p>And looking just at rubles as a sign of when the Russians were responsible for adds I think is really insufficient. And something that the senators didn`t get at is to ask for a complete audit of all ads.</p><p>Facebook, Twitter and Google offer really sophisticated tracking tools when it comes to marketers and advertisers, so companies like Coca-Cola or Unilever, for example, but in this case they`re deflecting their ability and downplaying their ability to really do a full audit.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Many of the senators seemed unsatisfied with many of the answers that they got. Senator Feinstein particularly said, you do something or we will, to these giants. Should they be afraid of that threat? What could she do? What could congress do?</p><p>ALEXANDRA SUICH BASS: So, I think that there`s tremendous frustration and the general counsels who were there, not their CEOs, were trying to be humble, but did deflect a lot of questions, a very pointed questions. So I think that frustration bubbled over among the senators.</p><p>When it comes to action, I do think that there is real disconnect between the rhetoric right now and the feeling that America has been betrayed by the large tech giants and a disconnect from what they`re really able to do. So, right now, there are a couple of things being considered.</p><p>One is to propose -- there has been a bill proposed that would require more transparency when it comes to political advertisements, basically bringing digital ads up to the same standards that television ads and ads on other media are held to. I think that`s very sensible.</p><p>The tech giants are saying actually that, you know, they`re broadly in favor of transparency and they`re actually going to implement more transparency and disclosure about who`s paying for ads on their own, but that they`re not quite sure about the details of the regulation -- the proposed regulation and whether or not they will support it.</p><p>And then, of course, this week, we saw a proposal for tax reform which would be highly favorable to the tech giants by lowering the corporate tax rate. And, so, on one side, you hear these very angry, disappointed claims coming from the senators, and then you have the reality that there is not that much that`s being suggested that looks close to passing that could change their fortunes or behavior.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Let`s look at the optics of what we saw. We did not see familiar faces sitting behind that table. In fact, one editor at the Columbia Journalism Review tweeted, tech CEOs will show up for magazine covers, Davos, Burning Man, Game of Thrones, (INAUDIBLE) parties, just not senate hearings. We did not see Zuckerberg, we did not see Sandberg, we did not see Twitter`s Jack Dorsey. What was that about?</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Well, it was actually even more pointed, so not only did they not show up, but Mark Zuckerberg was at Facebook headquarters in Silicon Valley on an earnings call announcing record profits and revenues and seeing Facebook shared prize surge. So it was a day of dissident realities, if you will.</p><p>I think if you`re looking at the tech giants` interests which is to not submit your CEO to very hostile questions and give journalists the ability to talk about Mark Zuckerberg`s or Jack Dorsey`s humbling in front of the senators, they made the right choice in sending their general counsels there, who were excellent lawyers at talking around the issues and sometimes not answering very specifically.</p><p>But I know it disappointed the senators. And I wouldn`t say that it`s out of the question that there would be another hearing where the tech bosses might be forced to show if we get more investigations and disclosures into the extent of the interference. We might have a second act.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Something that you have been reporting about at The Economist is sort of the isolation of these tech giants. They don`t necessarily feel aligned at this point with the Democratic Party or with the Republican Party. What happened that they ended up being a little bit on an island to themselves in terms of political power and political capital?</p><p>ALEXANDRA SUICH BASS: It`s exactly right. They really are an industry with no political party. They used to be able to depend on the Democrats for sympathy because Democrats, I think, were very tech forward under President Obama`s administration, a lot were put in top seats, they had given heavily to the Democrats.</p><p>But Democrats really feel betrayed by the tech platforms. They feel like the Russians were able to influence the outcome of the 2016 election for the worst because of the company`s lack of oversight of advertising and fake accounts. So, the Democrats have turned away from tech.</p><p>And the Republican Party today isn`t as predictably anti-regulation as they used to be, and because of the populist strains going through both parties right now, it`s playing really well to criticize tech and you see, actually, Senator Elizabeth Warren on the left and others on the right, Steve Bannon, talk about regulating tech as utilities are breaking up big tech.</p><p>And so, again, that goes to the rhetoric. I write about it as a tech-lash in Washington, a tech backlash. But it`s unclear that either side really wants to own the tech industry and work on their behalf right now.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: And we shouldn`t suggest the tech industry is doing a rope- a-dope and sitting this out. They are spending enormous amounts of money on lobbyists, correct?</p><p>ALEXANDRA SUICH BASS: They are. In one sense there, they are very well positioned, because these are incredibly successful and profitable tech companies, they have a lot to spend and they have learned from the mistakes of their predecessors. So, what Microsoft didn`t do well and why they ultimately saw a lot of backlash in Washington is they didn`t manage their Washington relationship early.</p><p>So Google and Facebook were a lot earlier to put people in Washington, set up large offices. We see Amazon doing the same thing. The reason they`re in a difficult position is there`s a few reasons. One is that their interests are all so diverse. So some tech companies are coming out in support of issues, others against it.</p><p>And so you see that with something that`s being proposed right now that would hold tech companies responsible for sex trafficking that occurs on their platforms with heavy fines. Oracle, a tech giant from the Valley is actually in support of it. Google isn`t. and so you see a disconnect amongst the giants of what`s in their interests.</p><p>And a further problem is that they have to lobby a lot of different government agencies. Unlike, say, pharmaceuticals where, you know, you know that you really need to be on top of the FDA and what they`re considering.</p><p>Tech is regulated by so many different groups, the FTC, the FCC, and others. And so, they in the past have really struggled to focus their attention and know exactly where to put it to avoid push back and manage the reputation.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: And to circle back to my last question to what we first started talking about. Obviously, these hearings were about the 2016 election and Russian interference, but this could really go to any kind of false information being put on these platforms. That`s actually the big picture issue, right?</p><p>ALEXANDRA SUICH BASS: Yes. I think the big picture issue right now and we actually have it on our cover for The Economist this week is, is social media bad for democracy? A few years ago, there were so much optimism that platforms like Facebook and Twitter and Google and You Tube, the online video site, would help with really democratic movement, kind of include new voices that weren`t possible to hear through established media.</p><p>And we did see some of that. We saw it in the Ukraine. We saw it in Egypt. And then, today, I think we`re seeing the dark side of social media. We`re seeing how these platforms can be used for bullying, for abuse, for terrorists and other extremist content, for hate speech.</p><p>And so I think the big picture is, is social media going to bring us together or pull us apart, and are we able to get social media firms to take responsibility so that their platforms can be used for good rather than for evil.</p><p>ALISON STEWART: Alexandra Suich Bass from The Economist, thanks so much.</p><p>ALEXANDRA SUICH BASS: Thank you for having me.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE, </nameText></person><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE </nameText></person>SHOW HOST: Joan Didion is among the most celebrated writers of the past 50 years.

And it was just -- she loved being involved in the process. And at some point during this time, I became aware or I realized there had never been a documentary about her, by her own choice. So I just pushed my luck and asked if I could do it, if she would agree, and it took her all of -- she went, OK. And that was it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: And I went, oh, my god, this is a big one.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why did she never become a filmmaker?</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Become a filmmaker?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yeah.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: You mean like directing?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yeah.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: I don`t know.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: No, I mean like Nora Ephron.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Yes, right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: I just wanted to make sure what kind of film we were talking about.

And you know, when you`re related to someone, of course, I`d write -- we would get John and Joan`s books for Christmas every year, inscribed, you know. And, so of course, we read the books, you know, and the times that they came out.

And she`d been doing that. You know, the fascinating thing about self-respect, which has become kind of a moral tone for so many people, you know, she`s writing about living a life, accepting, you know, the consequences, being able to live in the bed that you`ve made.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: It was written when she was 20, 21-years-old, and it is so wise, and the character that wrote that -- the person who wrote that has virtually unchanged.

Not working every day. As the money came in, I would get shooting. You know, it was a process of stop and start.

I worried about it every day, until all the money came in from Netflix. And she -- but then I showed it to her. I showed her a cut I would never have shown...</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Three hours, or so?</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Thee hours.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yeah.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Three-hour cut. And I just wanted to give her the opportunity to say, hey, stop this right now.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JOAN DIDION: In this light, all narrative was sentimental. In this light, all connections were equally meaningful and equally senseless. Try these. On the morning of John F. Kennedy`s death in 1963, I was buying at (Inaudible) in San Francisco, a short silk dress and wished to be married.</p><p>A few years later this dress of mine was ruined when at a dinner party in Bellaire, Roman Polanski accidentally spilled a glass of red wine on it. On July 27th, 1970, I went to the Magnin (ph) high-shop in Beverly Hills and picked out at Linda Kasabian`s request.</p><p>The dress in which she began her testimony about the murders of Sharon Tate at Polanski`s house on Cielo Drive. I believe this could be an authentically nonsensically chain of correspondences but in the jingle, jangle of that morning in that summer, it made as much sense as anything else did.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: What fascinates me about that is as we have just saying, she writes to know what she thinks. And, you know, throughout her whole life, the things she writes about is a world in disorder and, eventually, her life became a world of disorder. And she`s trying to make these connections, these nonsensical connections. And of course, the time, you know, late `60s, Manson, you know, ultimate assassinations, none of these things...</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Make sense.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: ... could make sense.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Did she feel greater -- as she began to write both journalism and novels, did she feel one was more her metier than the other?</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: I think -- I think she started as a non-fiction writer and I think that that`s -- I mean, she loves stories. You know, in novels she like -- she writes and she doesn`t know where her novel is going to go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: We`re sitting here talking about her like she`s somewhere.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: She`s probably going to watch television to see this. Hi, Joan. But, you know, I think her interest is always particularly strong in essays and nonfiction and writing about politics and...</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Bob Silver helped her plan politics.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Absolutely.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Bob Silver is one of the famous editors who recently died as well. And other we know (Inaudible), and other`s he played roles in this world of media.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Yes and he was -- he was someone that said, Joan, how would you like to go to Salvador and write about this brutal civil war? And she -- and she leapt to it. And he seemed to know, from reading her earliest essays, that she would actually make a beautiful transition into writing also about American politics but she really didn`t -- not that she didn`t have any interest, she just didn`t think that would be her strong suit.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Her strong suit was culture or something else?</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: I think her strong suit was more personal -- the personal essay of her confronting, you know, everything from being a mother to, you know, things that would be these insights that she would have that other people would relate to so strongly in their own lives.</p><p>She saw that your actually -- you could write about Cheney, such a devastating piece that he should be hiding under a bed from the moment he reads it, you know. And just have character insight into, you know, deciphering the message that the politicians don`t want you to hear and what the media is really saying, the underlying message. That turned out to be her strongest talent in her political -- in writing about Salvador.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: How does she differ from Oriana Fallaci?</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: I think she`s -- Oriana Fallaci hardly an expert on her book, reading her essays and her interviews, I think she`s much more aggressive, you know? Kind of...</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Clearly that.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: And more assertive and is very much on the equal plain. Joan is -- Joan is quieter and I think that quietness of world, she`s very comfortable and makes other people talk to her. And you know, that`s why she likes writing about musicians because, you know, they`re just let it all unfold. So she could hang out with Morrison, and Morrison probably wasn`t the effusive speaker either, and very enigmatic kind of difficult personality, but, I don`t know, they were meet, Joan, and they`d open up.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: She and John Dunne, how long were they married -- for how long?</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: They were married in 1960.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I love the fact that you would go to restaurants and you see them together eating.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Yeah.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And you would see them and -- I always watch this when I`m in New York and I go out to eat. Are they talking to each other? They were always talking to each other.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: It was like, they just carried the conversation all from the cab.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: From the house to getting to the cab, to getting at the restaurant.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Yeah. I mean they were just constantly -- they were just always interested in each other, and, you know, there`s another thing about John and Joan being in a restaurant. You know, people often never believe that they weren`t, you know, competitive. And, you know, one more famous than the other and, you know, being, you know, competitive in that way. John was very -- when John would be at Ellio`s (ph), for example.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That`s why you would see him more that anyone else.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Exactly. And when he went to Ellio`s, if he saw someone craning to see Joan and saw that he was blocking their view, he would move.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That`s great.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: I just love that about John.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I do, too. Once there was a time in which they thought they might divorce.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Yeah, which we found out by reading Life Magazine, the famous piece that was -- that she wrote while -- during an oncoming tsunami in Honolulu, she is there, Quintana is very young, and she and John are there mulling over whether they should split.</p><p>And she makes this equation between the seismic shifts outside the window of their hotel room and what`s going on between them, and we as family members, and my parents and brother, and sister, we had no idea. They`ve always been John and Joan, one word.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Absolutely. They read everything each other wrote?</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: And they read -- so John actually edited that piece. I mean she wrote it about thinking of getting a divorce, leaving my husband.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: How do you like it? Do you think that paragraph is good? I don`t know. Not so sure.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It`s unbelievable.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: It`s incredible. I love that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And when she found out she had -- she was going to have Quintana -- I mean when Quintana was born, she gets a call from the hospital?</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Yep. They had been -- it was like a call just out of the blue. I think they weren`t really thinking about it a whole lot. They wanted to have a child, they couldn`t have a child, and one of their friends knew the gynecologist at the hospital, and this guy just called and said, we have this baby in St. John`s Hospital, and they got in the car right away, and they...</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Went and picked the baby up?</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: They picked the baby up and they drove home on 405, and Joan bonded with Quintana there as, you know, a two-day-old infant.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And then John dies -- heart attack.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Heart attack. Heart attack. He`d always had heart issues. His ticker, as he would call it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yeah.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: And, you know, he would write about it, of course. You know, he became fascinated with the valves and all the arteries that would go through -- through his body. He wrote about it quite beautifully, almost like -- he compared it to music and the symphony of the body.</p><p>But, you know, Quintana, on Christmas Eve, was admitted to hospital with septic shock and that was very serious, and the -- I think the trauma of his worry for Quintana brought on the heart attack, and it was sudden and unexpected and, as John writes, you know, life changes in an instant.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is -- go to clip four. This is from this show. This is Joan talking about writing, the year of magical thinking, which is the book about that year. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is probably the first book you`ve ever written without John.</p><p>JOAN DIDION: Yeah. It is the first book. I had written a couple of pieces before I did the book -- I mean after he died but before I did the book, but this is certainly the first book. I mean, my first novel was written before we were married, but he still read it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But he would read everything.</p><p>JOAN DIDION: He would read everything</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You talked to him.</p><p>JOAN DIDION: Yeah. Yeah. So that`s something I miss because he would give me a sense of being safe, you know. If he said it was OK, then I would proceed. And if he said it wasn`t OK, then I would rewrite.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And you do the same thing for him?</p><p>JOAN DIDION: Yeah. So that was kind of a thing -- you grow to rely on that. And at the time -- you know, at the time it happened -- and they said to me, why you are going to rely all that. You can develop new readers. Well, it doesn`t -- it`s not really the same, you know. Nobody else has that investment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is another clip. This is clip number three. She`s on this show and she is talking about how she learned the rhythm of writing. Here it is. This is in 2000 -- this is 1992.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Oh, my.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Goodness, gracious. 1992.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOAN DIDION: I taught myself how to type. You know, I`m not a touch typist. I still do it this way. But I taught myself how to type by typing sentences, typing out Hemingway`s sentences over and over again.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Looking for?</p><p>JOAN DIDION: Just how they worked, because they appeared to be so simple, but you would come away from a string of them with these overwhelming feeling of whatever he had in mind for you to feel. So, I mean, obviously, something was going on in the sentences.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: People...</p><p>JOAN DIDION: You know what was going on. It was -- it was a withholding. There was withheld information in these sentences, and it had to do with a rhythm. I mean, I can`t exactly explain it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But you got it.</p><p>JOAN DIDION: Yeah.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Well, then, she described what she`s famous for, the withholding.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: And, you know, learning to do that by typing Hemingway`s sentences is kind of a genius, you know.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: There is a famous story, which I do not know whether it`s true or not and I want to believe it so badly. It is that Hunter Thompson was at the public library and somebody happened to be there, and went over and said, Hunter, what are you doing? And he was reading Shakespeare. And they said, what? He said, I`m trying to get the rhythm.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: No kidding! I want to believe that, too.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Don`t you want to believe that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: I`m sure he was reading something really bloody, too. I`m sure.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And then the death of the daughter.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Yeah, Quintana. You know, it was -- you know, it was from -- it took her weeks to recover from the first visit to the hospital after septic shock, and so, the funeral for John wasn`t going to happen until she was able to attend. And she wanted to go to California, to go to Malibu with her husband Jerry. They were newly married.</p><p>But it was like the next day, she was already quite frail, you know. She had just been out of the hospital. And the plane lands in Los Angeles and she falls and hits her head, and goes back into coma, and from which required a great deal of physical therapy to get past it when she came out of the coma.</p><p>You know there was -- and she was, you know, in a wheelchair and she had to learn how to walk and move, and it was, I think, just a part of her just started to sort of break down. And just -- she just really didn`t want to be around much longer.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What do you want us to come away from in this documentary?</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: I want people to feel that they`ve witnessed a life lived, someone who -- someone who you know, came from descendents of homesteaders, who -- you know, it`s very significant...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The Donner Party.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Who came out with the Donner Party...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: And this is John`s character -- you don`t take short cuts.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Exactly.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: And it`s a -- it`s a morality that she`s lived her whole life by, and she is -- you know, she`s outlived all her friends for a reason. She`s, like, from strong western stock.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What is amazing, when you would hold her arm, it`s like this thin.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Yeah.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And I`m afraid I`m going to...</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Yeah.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And yet you know that, within her, is a strong -- like a bull.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: No, I mean, I see -- you know, I see a John Wayne movie in that soul. I mean I see, you know, cattle ranches and, you know, just people.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: All that stuff from the west.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: All that stuff from the west. I mean -- and I wouldn`t have seen that had I not made this movie, you know. She was -- she was my aunt and John`s wife, and who I`ve known all my life.</p><p>But I saw -- and I`ve grown up hearing about her, you know, described as, you know, bird-like but strong and fierce on the inside. But I really saw that. You know, it`s something I will never unsee. You know, I see that strength inside of her like I never had before.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The title is The Center Will Not Hold.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: The paraphrasing of The second Coming, The Yeats poem.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: And you know she wrote about it. She used it in slouching towards Bethlehem, her most famous essay in the `60s and, you know, -- she was writing about -- everybody else was writing about peace and love, and the hippie movement and, you know, everybody riding around the Volkswagen bugs.</p><p>And she goes there, and she`s looking at families that are falling apart, she`s looking at runaway children, she`s looking at the center of families, of the fabric that, you know, had been pretty strong in the `50s when she was growing up and before then and, here, the `60s had come along and, you know, society just was falling apart at the seams, and that whole decade was one of just massive chaos.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Thank you for coming.</p><p>GRIFFIN DUNNE: Thank you for having me.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Griffin Dunne. Joan Dion and the film was called, The Center Will Not Hold. Thank you for joining us.

He is chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. The agency adopted net neutrality rules earlier this year. The new regulations treat Internet service as a public utility. The commissioner has also been active in reviewing media and telecommunications mergers.</p><p>This summer it approved AT&amp;T`s takeover of DirecTV which created the largest television distributor in the United States. Next year the FCC will hold an auction to coordinate the sale of television air waves.</p><p>For all those reasons I`m pleased to have Chairman Tom Wheeler at this table for the first time. It seems like I`ve known him for 100 years. It`s a pleasure to have you.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Charlie -- thank you. It`s great to be here.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And we had your favorite Ohio State coach here the other day and --</p><p>TOM WHEELER: From the Ohio State University.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: From the Ohio State University. My impression is they have no bigger or stronger fan than you.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: I think that`s a true statement.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. And you used to work with Woody Hayes.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Yes, way back when, when I was in graduate school I had the privilege of being able to rub shoulders with Coach Hayes and some of the things he was doing in the state. He was a great --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I would imagine you had lots to talk about military history and all the things that he taught there.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Yes. And three yards and a cloud of dust -- that`s the way he ran. You know, three things can -- why don`t you pass coach? Three things can happen and two of them were bad.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So what can happen to the FCC?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, you know, Charlie we`re sitting at a really exciting time in history if you stop and think about it. The most important external force in our daily lives are the networks that connect us, and we at the FCC get the privilege to be involved in the evolution of those networks into the digital era, whether it`s broadcasting or cable or satellite or telephone networks or the Internet. That`s our jurisdiction.</p><p>It`s about a sixth of the economy that we get a chance to participate with as they`re evolving from the old analog world to the new digital world.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And so -- but what do you do? I mean you obviously hear important arguments and make rulings on them.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, you know, the really interesting thing about this job is that the statute was written in 1934. It was updated in 1996. And even from 1996, a lot has changed. So the challenge that we have is to say, OK, let`s look at the basic four corners that the Congress has laid down and said this is what we think is in the public interest, and then make interpretations as to how that statutory responsibility works in the new digital world.</p><p>And so we`re dealing with everything from mergers to competitive issues and how do you make sure that there is competition in these markets? How do you make sure that there is consumer protection? How do you make sure that national security is protected? So it`s a very broad palette that we have to work with.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is what predecessor Michael Powell, president of the National Cable Communications Association and the chairman of the FCC in the Bush administration said quote, \"The commission has breathed new life into the decayed telephone regulatory model and applied it to the most dynamic free wheeling and innovative platform in history.\"</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, I agree totally with him. The Internet is the most dynamic and free wheeling platform in history.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: It`s the most powerful and pervasive platform in history.</p><p>I disagree entirely with him because on his other part because, basically, what the cable industry and the telephone industry and those who provide Internet service, last-mile service, have been saying is, oh, leave us alone, leave us alone.</p><p>What we did was we said, wait a minute -- there is a basic responsibility that people who are providing Internet service have to make sure that consumers have unfettered access to the content they want to go to on the web and that those who are creating content have unfettered access to consumers, and that`s some basic things.</p><p>There should be no blocking. You should not be able to say you can get through when you can`t. There should be no throttling. You shouldn`t be able to say, well, your service, I`m not going to allow it to go as fast as another service. There should be no paid prioritization. You shouldn`t be able to say well, you`re a fast lane and you`re a slow lane, because you`re paying me more.</p><p>And then what you need to have in place is I think the thing that they`re really most concerned about and that is you need to have a referee on the field. We were talking about Woody Hayes and Urban Meyer a minute ago.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: You need to have a set of rules that says is this just unreasonable and you need to have somebody who can throw the flag if it isn`t. We don`t know what the Internet is going to become five years from now. I mean think back five years and where we are today. We had no idea it would end up today. What we don`t want to have happen as a regulatory agency is to thwart innovation. But at the same point in time, we don`t want those who are --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That`s one of the arguments they made.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: But the other part is we don`t want people who are running the networks to have to be the ones who provide permission for innovators and entrepreneurs to provide new services. So it`s the concept of permissionless innovation and making sure that there is somebody to say does this make sense? Is this just and reasonable?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: OK. But their argument is that you inhibit innovation. That`s where they --</p><p>TOM WHEELER: But I think that that is easily refuted by you look at the tremendous growth in investment that has taken place in entrepreneurial activities since we put the rules in place. You look at how the industry, the cable industry, the telephone industry, the wireless industry have unprecedented levels of investment since we put the rules in place. I mean the network itself is growing and those who serve the network is growing since we put in the rules.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So if you make a huge capital investment to provide the fastest Internet service somewhere, you now simply have to make that available to everybody.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Correct.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: When John Oliver was on this program he talked about the story of someone with your experience becoming the FCC chairman. You have said that experience provided you with all that was necessary to do a good job.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Absolutely.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: He said, why would we let someone who`s been trying to lobby the FCC become the person who chairs the FCC? Is that some inherent conflict?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, I think that, you know, if you go back and you look -- and, Charlie, I ran the Cable Television Association when it was an up and coming industry being and fighting for its survival. I ran the cellular industry, you know, a dozen years ago when it was an entirely different business.</p><p>I`ve started my own businesses. I have been a partner to venture capital firm helping start businesses. So I come to this job with an understanding of both business and policy and how it works with the people that we regulate. So I actually think I come with a leg up.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What do you hope you accomplish while you`re chairman of the FCC? You addressed net neutrality. You have some mergers you have addressed.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: At the core, it is competition, you know. I mean the consumer`s best friend is a competitive market, and our broadband market isn`t as competitive as it could be. So, one of the reasons that you have an open Internet rule is to increase competition.</p><p>One of the reasons that we turned down the Comcast merger was to increase competition. One of the reasons that we have encouraged -- we pre-empted states -- let me just say -- one of the things the big providers were doing were going to state legislatures and getting them to pass laws that prohibited cities from building a competitive product if their people wanted them to. And we said no. That`s anti-competitive and so we pre- empted that.</p><p>And we have a whole series of actions that are saying how do we increase competition? You know, the joke around the commission is that my mantra is competition, competition, competition, which is normally said \"competition- competition-competition\". And that`s the goal that we`re working on.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So let me just jump ahead to some mergers. So the Comcast merger you said does not increase competition.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: If those two giants get together, Time Warner and Comcast --</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right. So we turned that down.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You turned that down. But when AT&amp;T came along, buying DirecTV, a satellite company -- you said that`s fine.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Because we put in the terms and conditions of that agreement specific pro competitive activities. For instance, AT&amp;T is required to bring fiber service -- high-speed fiber service to 12.5 million new American homes. That`s a 40 percent increase in the number of homes reached by fiber. And guess who they`re --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: They`ll get faster service.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: They`ll get faster service. And guess who they`re competing with for that? The cable companies -- OK. So that was a key part of that. We put in there some other rules to make sure that there was pro competition coming out of it.</p><p>Here`s the key statistic -- 83 percent of Americans can access high-speed broadband service.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: 83 percent?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: 83 percent.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: But two-thirds of those can get it from only one company. So the goal is how do you facilitate competition? Because competition drives prices down, competition incentivizes better service, competition is a consumer`s friend with innovation.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Speaking of mergers -- trying to understand how you approach these and how you make a judgment about competition, there was a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right, and we actively discouraged that, that four wireless carriers is a good and vibrant market, and if you were to take number three and number four and allow them to merge to go to three, that would have hurt --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But would it have made them stronger and therefore be more competitive because there is a difference.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: But look at what`s happened --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: there is a difference between those four. And if three and four could combine and therefore be more competitive with one and two, why isn`t at that a good idea?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Look at what T-Mobile has done since we didn`t allow them to merge.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What have they done.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: And they have become the most innovative, the most price- competitive, and they`re forcing the market to respond to them, including Sprint respond to them with good old American competition. That`s what we were trying to stand for.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: OK. Let me talk about something else you wrote. You said \"We need to continue looking to the future and act now to facilitate the fifth generation of mobile technology.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right. Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What is that? So we`re right now going through the fourth generation of mobile technology that you`ve seen in the ads called LTE.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right. And we`re now -- we`re heading towards the fifth generation. The fifth generation is going to be a new level of service. It will be different from what you`re used to right now. It will be the enabler of what they call the Internet of things.</p><p>You know, by 2020, there are going to be 50 billion connected things, everything from your washing machine to, you know, your trash can.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: From your cell phone -- from your smart phone, you can run everything?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: You can run everything and they will talk to each other and you won`t even know it. But you need to have an infrastructure that has what the technologists call very low latency which means that they interact real quickly and you need to have new spectrum that that works over.</p><p>So I leave for instance from this to go to Geneva where we`re engaged in international negotiations to make sure that we have spectrum that is harmonized around the world for the next generation.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: We have not had that?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: No, we always -- we have that but --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: No, we have not had harmonization with the rest of the world in some cases -- have we?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, you know, in some cases but for the most part it`s harmonized and because it`s important. That`s how you get to drive down the cost of infrastructure and the insets.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: OK.</p><p>I`m sure you thought of this and done this. If you go to Korea, or go to Japan --</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- everybody says they`re so far ahead of us in terms of broadband and its possibilities and its speed and what it`s doing. Is that true?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: They have very innovative ideas but we`re the world leader in 4G technology. There are more -- 98 percent of the American population now has access to an LTE wireless signal and a competitive LTE wireless signal. You look at Europe, you look at Asia, nobody has those kinds of statistics like we do.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Is the television business as we know it healthy?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: I think the television business is in the process of evolving.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: To what?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: So it used to be that there were special networks for special kinds of video. You had the movie networks, if you will -- the theaters, OK, for movies. Then you had the television networks, and really they never really meshed with each other.</p><p>Now you have the digital world in which everything is the same in terms of being digitized and can be distributed over a common network. And that challenges everybody to evolve. And I think the television industry is evolving just like everybody else is evolving.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: To what though?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: To a broadband video business is one.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Exactly. Yes, right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: And -- but I also think --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It`s a content company.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: But I also think that there is going to be a fine future for broadcast -- traditional broadcast television. But I think it will also be redefined.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What is that future?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: I think continuing to provide local service, continuing to be a way that in a local market you can reach all of the people at one time. But that content continues to sector markets and slice them down and that ends up being over on the Internet.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You`ve called next year`s auction of wireless air waves quote, \"a once in a lifetime opportunity\". Define what a once in a lifetime opportunity is.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, there is going to be one auction. But let`s talk about what that auction is. So we were talking a minute ago about wireless. There is huge demand for the spectrum, the air waves that wireless rides on. And we have to look at the limited amount of spectrum that is available and say is it put to its best purpose?</p><p>So what we`re doing is we`re going to run an auction next year, starts March of next year that`s a two-sided market. First time it`s ever been tried, where we will turn to broadcasters and say, if you want to sell us your air waves, we will buy them, then we repackage them so that they are in a format that works for wireless, and we turn around to the mobile companies and say, OK, now you buy them. Nobody --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You bid on them.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Nobody has ever tried. You bid on them and pay the government. And nobody has ever tried that. But that`s really -- it is letting the market work to put spectrum to its highest and best use. And it`s going to be ground-breaking, and I think it will be the future of how --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: How will you mark success?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: We`ll mark success by whether new spectrum gets opened, you know. I mean there will be multiples tens of billions of dollars that will change hands here, but I think the key is, is there new spectrum that is going to be able to be repurposed for 21st century applications in the mobile world?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Where -- back to my question about South Korea and Japan and Europe -- you know, what can we learn by what`s going on around the world?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Oh, that`s a great question because the world is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. And one of the things that the Internet has done is to make us all share common experiences.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It changed time and distance.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Totally. I mean it`s the death of distance. There is no such thing as distance.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Go ahead.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: So I think that we have been the world leaders in innovation, in digital activity because we had the home field advantage of the Internet starting here. And we want to make sure that that continues, and that`s both for wired and for wireless. There are some great things as you point out that are happening in Japan and that are happening in Korea and China and elsewhere. But I think that we need to make sure that we are tending to our knitting, making sure that we have the environment.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I assume your argument is that we have to create an environment for innovation so that whatever the lead we got from being a founder, an initiator will continue.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: That`s what we mean by permissionless innovation. That`s why open Internet is so important, Charlie, because we have to create an environment where this wonderful thing called the Internet which just allows everybody to reach the world overnight, where there aren`t gatekeepers there. Because if there`s somebody who is saying, no, I`m not so sure or you pay me to get on or things like this, then we`re going to inhibit innovation, and innovation is the driver of this economy.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Can China innovate?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: I think that they clearly are making efforts to do that. I think they`re what you might call fast followers at this point in time, but they`re looking to say how can we take this fifth generation and make it work to our advantage?</p><p>So one of the things we`ve done at the FCC is we`ve said that we want to be out front in allocating spectrum so that first in the world spectrum that can be used for fifth generation is here in the United States. And that we want to be allowing flexible use of that spectrum so it`s not some bureaucrat in Washington like me making the decision as how it gets used. It`s the people who are innovating. It`s the people who are going to try the new ideas who are making those decisions, and that is exactly the formula that made us the world leader in fourth generation. And I think it will work for fifth generation, too.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: One risk people see is the possibilities of sabotage of undersea cables. That`s an issue for you?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: It`s the new style of wiretapping, isn`t that right?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. But I think we have to understand that networks have always been attack paths -- I don`t care whether it`s a road network or a sea network or whatever -- it`s the way people have mounted attacks. We have a new network in the 21st century. It would be naive to say that somebody`s not going to do it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: To say someone would not figure out how they could do that.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: That`s right. That`s right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And then we have the possibilities -- my friend Ted Koppel has a book out which is called \"Lights Out\" --</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- which is about the capacity to do huge damage to America and its economy, you know, by attacking the Internet.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The electric grid.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: We`ve taken that real seriously. I mean if we have responsibility for public safety and the functioning of our networks, then we need to make sure that we are doing the right kind of cyber hygiene, if you will.</p><p>So what we did was we brought the experts, including the network companies, together and said, let`s agree on a common set of standards for hygiene that you will have in your network. Then let`s have a regular visit to your network to find out what`s the experience you`re having. A -- are you doing it, and B -- is it working?</p><p>Because the thing we can absolutely guarantee is that what works today is going to have to change to work tomorrow, OK? And, so, we want to put in place a structure that evolves so that as technology as different ways of hacking things evolve that our networks can evolve, too.</p><p>But cyber security is an essential component of what we do and a very important thing. And it`s also something that you and I as citizens and everybody watching this needs to think about because the way in which it starts is it normally comes in through somebody doing something and that gives somebody access. So we need to have good hygiene ourselves.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And as you know the problem with that kind of attack, is you don`t know where it`s coming from. It`s not like a nation state. An attack through the Internet, you can`t necessarily, because they`re so ingenious about where they go from A to Z.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: You can do some good inferences, but yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So finally there is this. There is this debate that goes on between security and privacy. Where are you on that and where is the balance?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Clearly, the two relate. Clearly we`re existing in a world where the capital asset of the 21st century is information. And it ends up being information about you and me. And you and I --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Some people collect that as a matter of business and then sell it.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: And you and I -- correct. You and I ought to have a voice in the collection of information about us. You know, nothing about me without me, is what the expression is. And so, this is a very important thing and this is something that`s on our agenda as well.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That`s interesting because that`s about the future. It`s on your agenda meaning what?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: So you will see us -- I`ve told the Congress and others that you will see us within the next several months, addressing the question of privacy of those who provide the networks -- the privacy practices of those who provide the network services and how it affects you and me.</p><p>In other words, do I know what information`s being collected? Do I have a voice in whether or not that`s going to be used in one way or another? And those are two very important baseline rights that individuals ought to have.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The other thing that`s interesting to me is that these companies are all mostly out in Silicon Valley. Many of them, you know, particularly the founding ones there -- Microsoft, Apple, Amazon -- all out from the West Coast from either Seattle or Silicon Valley. And for a long time they said to the government, leave us alone -- almost libertarian, right?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Now it is said that they have as intense lobbying effort in Washington as anybody. Is that fair?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: There is nothing in the corporate culture that argues against eventually saying how does policy affect what I do in my business? And so what we at the FCC do is do we get lobbied by Google? Yes. Do we get lobbied by AT&amp;T? Yes.</p><p>So what our challenge is how do you find the common good? I mean the interesting thing you said a minute ago, you talked about earlier in my career that I had been an advocate for various businesses.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: And the way you tend -- things tend to work in an advocacy role is you come in and you say, unless you do this my way, it`s going to be the end of western civilization as we know it. And the other side comes in and says exactly the same thing.</p><p>And the job of people like me and my colleagues at the commission is to say, OK, where is it -- I understand why this position is good for them, and I understand why this is good for them -- where is the solution that has the common good in it? You know, what we call public interest, but the public interest is vague.</p><p>What`s the common good? How can you structure things so that, again -- and you come back to basic principles like competition. How do you make sure that that which serves the common good survives?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But also the common good is to stimulate innovation to push forward.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Absolutely. Then again, that`s why we wanted permissionless innovation with the open Internet. We didn`t want the Internet to get choked down so that somebody else was deciding what two guys, and a dog in a garage came up with and whether you and I were going to get to see it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Is this the best job of your life?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Yes, I`m having a great time. I`m a really fortunate person.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Thanks for coming.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Thanks -- Charlie.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p>Back in a moment. Stay with us.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: <person><nameText>Meg Whitman </nameText></person>is here. She has been CEO of Hewlett Packard since 2011. The technology icon was created more than 75 years ago in a Palo Alto garage. For decades it led in the business of selling computers and printers. The growth of enterprise services has forced HP to evolve. The company`s reinvented itself with aspirations to capitalize in both the PC and networking solutions arena.</p><p>On Sunday HP split into two separate pieces: Hewlett Packard Enterprise will primarily sell computer service, data storage and consulting servings. HP, Inc. will largely consist of personal computers and printers.</p><p>I`m pleased to have <person><nameText>Meg Whitman </nameText></person>back on this program. Welcome.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Thank you very much.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: it`s great to have you here.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Happy to be here.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is the ad that was in yesterday`s paper and today`s paper. \"The company that started Silicon Valley is making history again.\"</p><p>I want to talk about how you`re going to make history. But tell me what happened to Hewlett Packard. How did the company that Bill Hewlett and David Packard create that was the admiration of the world and certainly the Valley, the company that in terms of values, in terms of culture, in terms of success was looked on with huge admiration?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. The last decade was a tough decade. And I would actually chalk it up to too much turnover at the CEO level. CEOs -- when you have different CEOs who have different strategies -- it`s very hard on a company particularly one as large as HP.</p><p>And so I can now see as we`re turning the corner with people who have been in role three or four years, you`re starting to see it gel again. So I think the root of the challenge was in many ways too many CEOs in too short a period of a time.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And did it therefore miss huge opportunities that others saw?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Sure, absolutely it did. You know, mobile phones was an opportunity that HP missed and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, yes, certainly many others. But, you know, the technology business is incredibly dynamic, and it`s hard to catch every wave. And obviously the bigger you are, the more challenging it is -- right. I mean bigger companies just don`t move quite as fast as smaller companies. So part of the separation is about being more nimble and more focused on two entirely different markets so that HP cannot miss the trends and, in fact, can invent the trends.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So now you come along.</p><p>How did they get you to do this? Because you had had a remarkable career - -</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You`d even made a venture into politics which you said was a great learning experience even though you lost.</p><p>You learned how to communicate, learn the demands of the modern world in terms of what we expect from people in the public eye whether it`s a CEO or an aspirant to be governor of California. You were on the board at HP.</p><p>That`s been a board that`s often been rancorous.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And they convinced you to take over as CEO.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, I`ll tell you how it happened because I had no intention of being the CEO. So I lost the governor`s race in the fall of 2010. And I was trying to decide what I was going to do. I was working on our family foundation and I was sort of searching for the next thing.</p><p>And it`s very difficult when you lose these elections. As an aside, we should be really grateful for people who run because it`s really tough when you lose because it`s like a personal referendum in some ways.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. So did you -- was it depressing for you?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It was very hard. If you think about it, when you`re part of a company, you know, there`s you and the company. When you run for public office, it`s a vote on you.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You felt rejected.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: You feel rejected. I mean it`s very challenging.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Did you question your own abilities at all?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Sure you think gosh, you know, could have, would have, should have, you know, that whole thing.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: But, so it`s February and I`m at home one afternoon watching an afternoon daytime talk show at 4:00. And my husband who is a neurosurgeon comes home early from work. He walks in and he sees me in the family room at 4:00 in the afternoon watching an afternoon talk show and he goes oh, this is really not good. This is really not good. You`ve got to pull your socks up and you`ve got to figure out what you`re going to do.</p><p>Just as if on cue that afternoon I got a call from an HP board member, Marc Andreessen --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: -- who said we`re looking for some new board members for HP, you would be perfect. It will be so much fun. We`ll sit on the tech committee. And, you know, it`s just in the neighborhood and it`s a chance to help reinvent a Silicon Valley icon.</p><p>I said, this is great, what could go wrong? 12 minutes from my house.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But you`re a board member. That`s all you are.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: That`s right. But I`m thinking what could go wrong. Twelve minutes from my house, it will be fun.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And it became quite apparent soon that the company had a lot of challenges and then of course, we as the board had the do the most difficult thing that a board does, which is remove the CEO. That was in some ways the easy thing.</p><p>The next was who`s going to run HP and the board sort of looked at me and I said, oh, no, no, no. We are definitely not doing this. We are definitely not doing this.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Been there, done that.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. But over time, I began to feel -- you know, it matters what happens to HP. HP is important to California. It`s important, I would argue, to the tech industry and the United States and important globally. We are often the largest private employer in many countries in which we do business.</p><p>So ultimately, I decided, OK, I`ll see -- we`ll do the best I can and I will see if I can be helpful here.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Well, they made the argument you were on a plane ride back from somewhere.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. We had a board meeting on the East Coast. And on the way back a number of them really were very persuasive and said we need you to do this. It`s an opportunity to make a big change to a big company that`s important and struggling. And the scale was interesting to me.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So the challenge was interesting and the scale in which they existed was interesting.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. Exactly. And you know me well enough to know I love a challenge. And so they hooked me on the challenge.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. And so tell me, when you got there, you had seen it up close as a member of the board.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But then you had to get into the weeds of this company.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What did you find?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: So I found a very proud company with incredible founder DNA. The a-ha here is -- and this is great news for any founder that`s watching your program -- it is really hard to kill founder DNA. And for HP, that was a very good thing because the core of this company through all the acquisitions and all the board drama was around innovation and focus on customers.</p><p>And so I made the decision let`s do more of what we do well and then we`ll work on the to-do list of things that need to be fixed. And there were a number of things that need to be fixed. But I went right to innovation, right to the customer.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But was it looking at making a decision about what product lines you should have?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, the first decision I made -- remember my predecessor had said maybe they should spin off the PC business. Not PCs and printers but just PCs. So I put together a 60-day study and said we can`t do this right now. We can`t afford to build another brand.</p><p>And because printing was going to stay with the big company we would have to build a new brand for the PC company. The company wasn`t in shape to split. As it turns out, and I know this now first hand, when you separate a company of this size and scale, everything from IT to legal entities to tax ID codes to all kinds of things, you have to be strong to do it. And I don`t think we would have been able to pull it off back then.</p><p>So I made the decision, let`s stay together. Let`s rebuild the company. Let`s strengthen the company. Let`s reconnect with partners and customers. Let`s, you know, focus on making this company as great as we can with the businesses that we are in.</p><p>And it`s been quite a turnaround journey. I mean we went from almost $12 billion of debt on the operating company to a positive net cash on the operating company. We really changed that much of the leadership team. We reignited the innovation engine to capitalize on the trends and the market like all flash array, a modern kind of storage.</p><p>And we revamped in many ways the whole company. And then we said how do we accelerate into this turnaround? And we decided, the board and I, to separate into two Fortune 50 companies. Can you imagine? There`s two Fortune 50 --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Separate, they`re both within the top 50.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It`s amazing.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It is amazing. And so you make this distinction between HP, Inc. and --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Hewlett Packard Enterprise.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I mean everybody -- there are a lot of people getting in the enterprise business. I mean from IBM to Amazon to Hewlett Packard at different levels.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why did you think you could win at that business?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, first of all, HP, Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are really quite different businesses.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I know.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: In the classic case, you know -- with different customers, different competitors, different cost structure --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But the same thing is true with Amazon in terms of the retail business and their enterprise business.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. But we had a company that needed to reinvent itself again. And we just though, you know what, let`s separate these into two different companies so we can focus on these two most important markets. Because HP Inc. has one-third of their business is to consumers. You can go buy an HP printer at Staples or wherever. You can go buy an HP PC someplace.</p><p>And so we thought, let`s get to really focus on the enterprise and what we can do for the IT professionals in small to medium to big companies and really help them do a number of things that are very top of mind. I mean every CIO now is thinking, I have a legacy IT infrastructure. I`ve got to get to the new world order. I`ve got to get to the new style of IT, the cloud. I`ve got to be more agile.</p><p>And we are uniquely suited to help companies on that transformation journey because those big companies, they`ve got to keep running their legacy IT systems while they get to the --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So who are you going to serve? Who are your customers?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Largely CIOs and VP of Ops, VP of Apps, VP of VAP, you know, operations for anywhere from small to very large companies. Remember we have a very robust channel that helps serve our customers. So we call them value-added resellers. They will serve the small to medium size customers with our products and services and software. And then we sell direct to the biggest customers.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why did you decide to be the CEO of the enterprise?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. And someone asked me that question because in some ways it would have been more natural for me to go to the part with the consumer because I`m a consumer technologist really. But I had a great executive named Dion Weisler (ph) who really knew the PC business. He`d run PCs and printers in Asia-Pacific for us. We brought him back. He was doing a great job running PCs and printers at corporate.</p><p>And I said, you`re fantastic for this job. He`s got a lot of runway. He`s a young man. And I said I`ll take the enterprise side. There`s more work to do. And I`ve actually become quite enamored with the enterprise side. Get back to the challenge and learning -- I had to learn a lot about the enterprise side.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why have you become enamored?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: You know, there -- I love disruption and I love the opportunity that creates. And think about what our business has been through -- the industry. From mainframe to client servers, you know, PCs; from client server to Web 1.0 where I had a front seat at the revolution at eBay; from the first generation of the Internet to web services.</p><p>Now we`re on the cusp of another huge change about what`s possible for IT at a large company.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And that`s because of the Cloud? What is it?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It`s because of the Cloud. It`s because of the way applications are now written.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right. When you were back at Princeton did you imagine that you would be a corporate manager?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: No.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What did you think you were going to be?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, I went to Princeton as a pre-med.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I know. I know. Is that where you met your husband?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: No, I actually met -- he was at Harvard Medical School when I was at Harvard Business School. But, you know, I took a lot of science courses a Princeton for which I am deeply grateful but ultimately decided that there was a better fit for me in business. And, you know, as a 21- year-old, what did I know? Not much.</p><p>But I sold advertising for a magazine at Princeton and I thought selling advertising, business, that`s sort of alike, you know, and then I applied to Harvard Business School.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Was it at Bane that you walked into the office of the CEO and said to him let me tell you what`s wrong with the way you`re running your business? You have no idea of how the employees think about you.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, I did. Can you imagine that I did that?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I can.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I don`t know what I was thinking. I was young and naive and enthusiastic. But Tom Tierney was his name who was the managing director - -</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: He thanked you for doing this.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: He did and he was an incredible mentor to me. In fact, he came on the board of eBay and was a big -- he might be one of the best strategists in America today, business strategist. And he was a huge help to me at Bane and actually made an enormous difference to us.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: but what`s the philosophy here that people need -- somebody come in to the door and say this is what you`re not doing and this is what you don`t perceive and this is an intervention moment?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Well, I think sometimes and I think all of us are guilty of this at one time or another is, you begin to drink your own Kool- Aid and you don`t see yourself and your leadership style as it really is. And sometimes you need a friend or someone who works for you or a colleague to say do you see what you`re doing here? Do you see what you are doing?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Was it the right idea to run for governor? Was that a mistake? Did somebody not come in to you and say Meg, this is a different game?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is a political game?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: They did say that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And why did you ignore that?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I think for a couple of reasons. One I saw the state that I loved, the state that had been my home for nearly 30 years was in real trouble. You might recall we had a huge budget deficit. We had a massive unfunded pension liability which by the way the state still has. Our education system had gone from number one in the country in the 50s to number 48 or 49 in, you know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- and others were --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I mean and you just --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: At the university level.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: -- yes and you have all kinds of challenges. I said maybe I can apply some of what I learned in my career both at eBay and other places to help solve some these problems. So I dove in with 100 percent of my effort, and I worked at it very had for almost two and a half years.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But were you prepared to spend your own money as you are as Donald Trump is spending his own money?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I was prepared to do that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You spent a lot of your money.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I did. And I thought, you know, that -- and I also raised a lot of money. So I had a lot of support from people around the state, but I did spend some of my own money because it was important. I had to learn a lot, right. You know, I had to learn water policy. I had to learn education policy and it was an experience of a lifetime, Charlie.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: How`s Governor Brown doing?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Listen, he`s raised taxes, obviously, on a number of folks. The budget deficit is more in line than it was. It`s much smaller than it was. Silicon Valley has been a big help to that, right. Silicon Valley right now is the economic engine of California.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. And it`s the place that every foreign head of state wants to go because they want to create their own Silicon Valley.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Silicon Valley -- exactly.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Xi Jinping went from Seattle, Washington before he went to Washington, D.C.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. Exactly. Because everyone loves this notion of how do you -- how could you possibly create Silicon Valley in China and --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Can you? Or is that something you could do with America`s culture?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I don`t know. It`s really hard -- Charlie. It`s alchemy, almost. It`s the -- you have to have a great company like Hewlett-Packard which was the founder of Silicon Valley, a fantastic university or universities -- Stanford being the anchor, but Berkeley, Santa Clara, you know, U.C. Santa Cruz are all part of that ecosystem now. And then you have to have that venture capital where risk is rewarded.</p><p>And so it`s -- the more entrepreneurs you have, the more venture capital that`s attracted, the more great companies that start. And you start a positive -- it`s almost an ecosystem and it`s very hard to create.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Do you worry that somehow there is the seed within the tech world today for overheating and a bubble that would burst?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Sure, I do. I do. I mean we lived through -- when I was at eBay, we lived through the 2001 bubble that burst. Frankly, eBay was fine because we had real revenues and real profits. And while our market cap went down a bit, we just kept on kept on going. But you know, you see a lot of very high multiples, young companies today. And so I worry about it.</p><p>And you`ve seen a pullback actually in the last six to eight weeks. You`ve seen a pullback in the valuation of some of these younger companies. So the multiples have gone down -- you know, we`ll see. I think the goodness is there is enough people who lived through 2001 who know what can happen.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Who raised the questions?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: But there is a whole generation that didn`t live through 2001 and sometimes you have to have -- you know, your question about running for governor -- you have to be a product of your experiences.</p><p>And by the way, I think I`m a better CEO because I ran.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Because you understand the public dimension.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I understand the public dimension but also I learned a lot about communicating with large groups of people. And as it turned out by complete coincidence, when I came to HP, it happened to be about the same size as the government of California. And what I learned about communicating in politics is -- and I bet you know this -- it is not always about the left brain, the facts and the figures and all of this. It is about the emotion, the stories you tell and how you connect.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Absolutely. It`s the emotional level that you connect and then people are there. If you connect on the emotional level then they`re open to your arguments.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. And I don`t think I completely understood that because when you grow a big business you are trained to be very analytical. I mean can you imagine being the CEO of a public company, going in front of your investors and telling them stories? I mean you would be thrown out on your ear. They want to know the numbers. They want to know the return on investment capital.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And so we`re trained --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: If you say, let me tell you my narrative they say, what`s your bottom line?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: They feel like excuse me. And so I was a very left-brained, trained individual, we all are. And, so, I had to learn a lot about communication. And so when I came to HP I learned about that and I did quite a different style of communication when I was trying to rally the whole company and the importance of symbolic value.</p><p>I`ll tell you a story about Jerry Brown and this is a story I admire him. When the state was in tremendous financial difficulty, he said you know what we`re going to do. We`re going to take the cell phones away from all the civil servants in the state of California. I remember thinking, OK, that`s all very interesting but it is 0.01 percent of the budget.</p><p>It wasn`t about the money. It was about the symbol and symbolism and the story he was telling which was he`s going to be tougher on the budget.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- and demand sacrifice.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. If you had asked the man on the street, you know, how do you think Jerry Brown is doing with the budget? He would have said doing great, taking away the cell phones from those civil servants.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It was a symbolic act --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: that connected and resonated.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And so I learned while -- when I watched him. And so when I came to HP, I said what`s a symbolic act that I can do that will communicate to the company about why this is different. So the very first thing we did we tore town the executive parking lot and the barbed wire that surrounded the executive parking lot and I moved the entire leadership team to cubicles out of their wooden offices.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: They`re no longer behind closed doors or whatever?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: We were out in the open just like everybody else. And we didn`t write about that. We didn`t make a publicity statement. 250,000 -- 300,000 HP people knew that within about 24 hours. And that made a statement.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Breaking down the barriers between --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And I learned that from running for office.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- employer and employee.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You are supporting Governor Christie.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I am.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I know Governor Christie quite well and I have admired what he has been able to do as a Republican governor in a blue state with a Democratically-controlled legislature. And my view is we have to have people who have learned to reach across the aisle and get things done. And he hasn`t gotten --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That`s what`s needed in Washington, you`re suggesting?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I think that`s what`s needed in Washington because I think that it`s likely that the president will be one party and the congress will be of another. And so he didn`t get everything he wanted in New Jersey but sometimes in politics perfect is the enemy of really pretty good.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: How do you ascertain how he`s doing?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, he`s working very hard. And I think he is a fantastic retail politician. You know when we were talking about how you reach in and connect? No one`s better than Chris Christie at reaching in and connecting with people. When people interact with him, they feel like they know him and they understand his heart.</p><p>And so he`s been putting a lot of shoe leather into Iowa, into Nevada, into New Hampshire and I think he`s making progress. You can see him begin to inch up at the polls, you know. His favorables are turning. So I`m optimistic. But it`s a tough, tough slog. But I think he`s doing everything he knows how to do and I admire him a lot for doing it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Look at where we are in terms of technology. What`s next if you`re asked?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: We`re still at the beginning of the mobile revolution. That sounds crazy because we`ve all had mobile phones for a long time but pretty soon almost everyone on the planet may have a mobile phone and it`s changing every element of life and I think we`re at the beginning of that impact not at the end.</p><p>And you think about how people use their phone in developing countries to, you know, trade commodities, to you know, sell their goods on the Internet to countries around the world. I mean it`s really phenomenal.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And it gives people in faraway places access to all kinds of information.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It does and it has a political, you know, undercurrent as well. So I think we`re at the beginning of that revolution.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- which includes social media.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, social media is its home. Its first home really in many ways today is on your mobile. Yes, you know, Facebook was invented for the desktop but now there`s more people who access Facebook on their mobile than on their desktop.</p><p>So I just think you`re at the beginning of a tremendous revolution. When you think about a PC, per se, think about it, what you have in your hand is more powerful than a PC was ten years ago, it`s maybe more powerful than a PC was five years ago. Think about what you can do on your mobile, what you can do on your tablet.</p><p>Now, when you`ve got a lot of work to do, you really do want a full-fledged PC, but I think we`re at the beginning of that revolution.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Is there a lesson to be learned from what Lou Gerstner did at IBM?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. So I read his book with great interest as you will recall it was called \"Who Says Elephants Can`t Dance\". He said when he came to IBM at the end of his book he said when I came to IBM I thought culture was important. When I left IBM, he said I thought culture maybe was the only thing that`s important. And I can see exactly what he means.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why does it take so hard to learn that? I mean --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: You know, because you think that other things can make a difference, but in the end when you run these big-scale operations, people on the frontlines, the sales person in New York for the server business has to know what to do, has to know what the ethics and the value and the ethos of the company is. And people have to -- it cannot be a command and control environment. People have to know what to do on the front lines. And how do they know what to do? It`s not through policy and procedures and handbooks, it`s through the culture.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What did you learn from Steve Jobs at Apple, going back to a company that was on his --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Steve Jobs may well be the genius in business of my generation. I mean this guy was amazingly creative, and the ability to invent category.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The company was near bankruptcy and now the largest company in the world.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It`s amazing. I mean it`s the biggest turnaround if you will that I`ve ever seen in my career. And they continue to amaze. And kudos to Tim Cook for being able to continue that legacy because it`s not easy to follow Steve Jobs.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why was it a mistake for Dell to buy EMC? That`s what you said to your employees. They gave you guys an opportunity.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, exactly.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Figuring out how to put cultures together and all that and you guys would go out there and start innovating.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. So listen it`s a fascinating time in history because two companies who are quite similar in many ways, HP was a larger company than Dell, but we were in largely the same businesses. We have taken took diametrically opposed strategies with the same set of facts. Right? So we decided --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What were the facts?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, the industry and incredible tectonic plate shifts from, if you will, the old style of IT to the next generation. One of these inflection points for our industry where a lot of the old proud companies were under pressure. Our strategy was de-lever the balance sheet so you have no debt on the operating company, in fact you have cash on the operating company.</p><p>Lean in to new technology like three par, like our networking business, like Cloud. Make sure we pivoted to solution selling with our enterprise services business and really focus on revenue growth.</p><p>And their strategy was lever up the balance sheet, put old technology together, take out the costs and then try to make your way that way. I mean two diametrically opposed strategies.</p><p>Listen, I`m going to vote for Hewlett Packard Enterprise all day long because I think fast is important, speed is important where we live. And I`ll tell you -- they have a year to close the deal and another year to integrate. And we have an opportunity I think to explain to customers our solutions and why we are, you know, a stable, great company to do business with.</p><p>And it is pretty funny, Charlie, because you think back in 2011 we looked pretty unstable, right?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Of course.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And now we`re looking like the paragon of stability.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Was than when -- when did Fiorina leave?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Much earlier. I think 2005 --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You went through her then you went through before that --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Right. I think Carly left in 2005, 2006 -- something like that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So has she taken an unfair hit or is it simply a product of she happened to be not the right person at the right time for Hewlett Packard?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: So listen, politics is tough, right. We covered this. I mean it is tough. You`ve got to have a rhinoceros skin, and people will try to take you on. I would like to say no good deed goes unpunished. And I said before in public, I think the Compaq acquisition was the right thing. We have the position that we have today in PCs and in servers thank you to the Compaq acquisition.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: She drove that.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And she drove that. And she drove that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And it was right thing?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I think it was the right thing. With 20/20 hindsight looking back, I`m glad we have the position that we have in those two businesses because fundamentally they are the bedrock now of HP, Inc. and Hewlett Packard enterprises.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: When you buy a business, I mean you see people -- they`ll buy company just to get the CEO -- to get the executive talent.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Yes. In Silicon Valley, they`re called acqui-hires, you know, acquisition of hires.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right, right. Acqui-hire.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: An acqui-hire. People would say for the most part these big tech acquisitions are very tough to pull off and usually there is a challenge before, you know, the sun rises again. So, you know, listen I think we`re super well-prepared in these two companies to go own innovate, deliver for customers in a changing world, while we`re not trying to integrate another company. We`re not trying to, you know, fundamentally remake the sales force and take out hundreds of millions of dollars of cost.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Thank you for coming.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Great to see you.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Great to see you again. Thank you -- Charlie.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: <person><nameText>Meg Whitman.</nameText></person></p><p>Thank you for joining us.

I ran the cellular industry, you know, a dozen  years ago when it was an entirely different business.  I've started my own  businesses.  I have been a partner to venture capital firm helping start  businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So I come to this job with an understanding of both business and policy and  how it works with the people that we regulate.

The a-ha here is, and this is great news for any  founder that's watching your program, it is really hard to kill founder  DNA.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Yes.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  And for HP, that was a very good thing because the core of  this company through all the acquisitions and all the board drama was  around innovation and focus on customers.</p><p>And so I made the decision, let's do more of what we do well, and then  we'll work on the to-do list of things that need to be fixed.  And there  were a number of things that need to be fixed.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Tom Wheeler and Meg Whitman, when we continue.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  From our studios in New York City, this is CHARLIE ROSE.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Tom Wheeler is here.  He is chairman of the Federal  Communications Commission.  The agency adopted net neutrality rules earlier  this year.  The new regulations treat Internet service as a public utility.   The commissioner has also been active in reviewing media and  telecommunications mergers.</p><p>This summer it approved AT&amp;T's takeover of DirecTV which created the  largest television distributor in the United States.  Next year the FCC  will hold an auction to coordinate the sale of television air waves.</p><p>For all those reasons I'm pleased to have Chairman Tom Wheeler at this  table for the first time.  It seems like I've known him for 100 years.   It's a pleasure to have you.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Charlie -- thank you.  It's great to be here.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And we had your favorite Ohio State coach here the other day  and -- </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  From the Ohio State University.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  From the Ohio State University.  My impression is they have  no bigger or stronger fan than you.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  I think that's a true statement.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Yes.  And you used to work with Woody Hayes.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Yes, way back when, when I was in graduate school I had the  privilege of being able to rub shoulders with Coach Hayes and some of the  things he was doing in the state.  He was a great -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  I would imagine you had lots to talk about military history  and all the things that he taught there.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Yes.  And three yards and a cloud of dust -- that's the way  he ran.  You know, three things can -- why don't you pass coach?  Three  things can happen and two of them were bad.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  So what can happen to the FCC?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Well, you know, Charlie we're sitting at a really exciting  time in history if you stop and think about it.  The most important  external force in our daily lives are the networks that connect us, and we  at the FCC get the privilege to be involved in the evolution of those  networks into the digital era, whether it's broadcasting or cable or  satellite or telephone networks or the Internet.  That's our jurisdiction.</p><p>It's about a sixth of the economy that we get a chance to participate with  as they're evolving from the old analog world to the new digital world.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And so -- but what do you do?  I mean you obviously hear  important arguments and make rulings on them.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Well, you know, the really interesting thing about this job  is that the statute was written in 1934.  It was updated in 1996.  And even  from 1996, a lot has changed.  So the challenge that we have is to say, OK,  let's look at the basic four corners that the Congress has laid down and  said this is what we think is in the public interest, and then make  interpretations as to how that statutory responsibility works in the new  digital world.</p><p>And so we're dealing with everything from mergers to competitive issues and  how do you make sure that there is competition in these markets?  How do  you make sure that there is consumer protection?  How do you make sure that  national security is protected?  So it's a very broad palette that we have  to work with.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  This is what predecessor Michael Powell, president of the  National Cable Communications Association and the chairman of the FCC in  the Bush administration said quote, \"The commission has breathed new life  into the decayed telephone regulatory model and applied it to the most  dynamic free wheeling and innovative platform in history.\"</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Well, I agree totally with him.  The Internet is the most  dynamic and free wheeling platform in history.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  It's the most powerful and pervasive platform in history.  </p><p>I disagree entirely with him because on his other part because, basically,  what the cable industry and the telephone industry and those who provide  Internet service, last-mile service, have been saying is, oh, leave us  alone, leave us alone.</p><p>What we did was we said, wait a minute -- there is a basic responsibility  that people who are providing Internet service have to make sure that  consumers have unfettered access to the content they want to go to on the  web and that those who are creating content have unfettered access to  consumers, and that's some basic things.</p><p>There should be no blocking.  You should not be able to say you can get  through when you can't.  There should be no throttling.  You shouldn't be  able to say, well, your service, I'm not going to allow it to go as fast as  another service.  There should be no paid prioritization.  You shouldn't be  able to say well, you're a fast lane and you're a slow lane, because you're  paying me more.</p><p>And then what you need to have in place is I think the thing that they're  really most concerned about and that is you need to have a referee on the  field.  We were talking about Woody Hayes and Urban Meyer a minute ago.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  You need to have a set of rules that says is this just  unreasonable and you need to have somebody who can throw the flag if it  isn't.  We don't know what the Internet is going to become five years from  now.  I mean think back five years and where we are today.  We had no idea  it would end up today.  What we don't want to have happen as a regulatory  agency is to thwart innovation.  But at the same point in time, we don't  want those who are -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  That's one of the arguments they made.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  But the other part is we don't want people who are running  the networks to have to be the ones who provide permission for innovators  and entrepreneurs to provide new services.  So it's the concept of  permissionless innovation and making sure that there is somebody to say  does this make sense?  Is this just and reasonable?</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  OK.  But their argument is that you inhibit innovation.   That's where they -- </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  But I think that that is easily refuted by you look at the  tremendous growth in investment that has taken place in entrepreneurial  activities since we put the rules in place.  You look at how the industry,  the cable industry, the telephone industry, the wireless industry have  unprecedented levels of investment since we put the rules in place.  I mean  the network itself is growing and those who serve the network is growing  since we put in the rules.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  So if you make a huge capital investment to provide the  fastest Internet service somewhere, you now simply have to make that  available to everybody.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Correct.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  When John Oliver was on this program he talked about the  story of someone with your experience becoming the FCC chairman.  You have  said that experience provided you with all that was necessary to do a good  job.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  He said, why would we let someone who's been trying to lobby  the FCC become the person who chairs the FCC?  Is that some inherent  conflict?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Well, I think that, you know, if you go back and you look --  and, Charlie, I ran the Cable Television Association when it was an up and  coming industry being and fighting for its survival.  I ran the cellular  industry, you know, a dozen years ago when it was an entirely different  business. </p><p>I've started my own businesses.  I have been a partner to venture capital  firm helping start businesses.  So I come to this job with an understanding  of both business and policy and how it works with the people that we  regulate.  So I actually think I come with a leg up.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  What do you hope you accomplish while you're chairman of the  FCC?  You addressed net neutrality.  You have some mergers you have  addressed.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  At the core, it is competition, you know.  I mean the  consumer's best friend is a competitive market, and our broadband market  isn't as competitive as it could be.  So, one of the reasons that you have  an open Internet rule is to increase competition. </p><p>One of the reasons that we turned down the Comcast merger was to increase  competition.  One of the reasons that we have encouraged -- we pre-empted  states -- let me just say -- one of the things the big providers were doing  were going to state legislatures and getting them to pass laws that  prohibited cities from building a competitive product if their people  wanted them to.  And we said no.  That's anti-competitive and so we pre- empted that.</p><p>And we have a whole series of actions that are saying how do we increase  competition?  You know, the joke around the commission is that my mantra is  competition, competition, competition, which is normally said \"competition- competition-competition\".  And that's the goal that we're working on.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  So let me just jump ahead to some mergers.  So the Comcast  merger you said does not increase competition.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Right.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  If those two giants get together, Time Warner and Comcast -- </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Right.  So we turned that down.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  You turned that down.  But when AT&amp;T came along, buying  DirecTV, a satellite company -- you said that's fine.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Because we put in the terms and conditions of that agreement  specific pro competitive activities.  For instance, AT&amp;T is required to  bring fiber service -- high-speed fiber service to 12.5 million new  American homes.  That's a 40 percent increase in the number of homes  reached by fiber.  And guess who they're -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  They'll get faster service.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  They'll get faster service.  And guess who they're competing  with for that?  The cable companies -- OK.  So that was a key part of that.   We put in there some other rules to make sure that there was pro  competition coming out of it.</p><p>Here's the key statistic -- 83 percent of Americans can access high-speed  broadband service.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  83 percent?</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  83 percent.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  But two-thirds of those can get it from only one company.  So  the goal is how do you facilitate competition?  Because competition drives  prices down, competition incentivizes better service, competition is a  consumer's friend with innovation.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Speaking of mergers -- trying to understand how you approach  these and how you make a judgment about competition, there was a merger  between Sprint and T-Mobile.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Right, and we actively discouraged that, that four wireless  carriers is a good and vibrant market, and if you were to take number three  and number four and allow them to merge to go to three, that would have  hurt -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  But would it have made them stronger and therefore be more  competitive because there is a difference.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  But look at what's happened -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  there is a difference between those four.  And if three and  four could combine and therefore be more competitive with one and two, why  isn't at that a good idea?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Look at what T-Mobile has done since we didn't allow them to  merge.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  What have they done.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  And they have become the most innovative, the most price- competitive, and they're forcing the market to respond to them, including  Sprint respond to them with good old American competition.  That's what we  were trying to stand for.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  OK.  Let me talk about something else you wrote.  You said  \"We need to continue looking to the future and act now to facilitate the  fifth generation of mobile technology.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  What is that?  So we're right now going through the fourth  generation of mobile technology that you've seen in the ads called LTE.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Right.  And we're now -- we're heading towards the fifth  generation.  The fifth generation is going to be a new level of service.   It will be different from what you're used to right now.  It will be the  enabler of what they call the Internet of things.</p><p>You know, by 2020, there are going to be 50 billion connected things,  everything from your washing machine to, you know, your trash can.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  From your cell phone -- from your smart phone, you can run  everything?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  You can run everything and they will talk to each other and  you won't even know it.  But you need to have an infrastructure that has  what the technologists call very low latency which means that they interact  real quickly and you need to have new spectrum that that works over.</p><p>So I leave for instance from this to go to Geneva where we're engaged in  international negotiations to make sure that we have spectrum that is  harmonized around the world for the next generation.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  We have not had that?</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  No, we always -- we have that but -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  No, we have not had harmonization with the rest of the world  in some cases -- have we?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Well, you know, in some cases but for the most part it's  harmonized and because it's important.  That's how you get to drive down  the cost of infrastructure and the insets. </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  OK.  </p><p>I'm sure you thought of this and done this.  If you go to Korea, or go to  Japan -- </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Right.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  -- everybody says they're so far ahead of us in terms of  broadband and its possibilities and its speed and what it's doing.  Is that  true?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  They have very innovative ideas but we're the world leader in  4G technology.  There are more -- 98 percent of the American population now  has access to an LTE wireless signal and a competitive LTE wireless signal.   You look at Europe, you look at Asia, nobody has those kinds of statistics  like we do.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Is the television business as we know it healthy?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  I think the television business is in the process of  evolving.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  To what?</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  So it used to be that there were special networks for special  kinds of video.  You had the movie networks, if you will -- the theaters,  OK, for movies.  Then you had the television networks, and really they  never really meshed with each other.</p><p>Now you have the digital world in which everything is the same in terms of  being digitized and can be distributed over a common network.  And that  challenges everybody to evolve.  And I think the television industry is  evolving just like everybody else is evolving.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  To what though?</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  To a broadband video business is one.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Exactly.  Yes, right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  And -- but I also think -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  It's a content company.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  But I also think that there is going to be a fine future for  broadcast -- traditional broadcast television.  But I think it will also be  redefined.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  What is that future?</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  I think continuing to provide local service, continuing to be  a way that in a local market you can reach all of the people at one time.   But that content continues to sector markets and slice them down and that  ends up being over on the Internet.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  You've called next year's auction of wireless air waves  quote, \"a once in a lifetime opportunity\".  Define what a once in a  lifetime opportunity is.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Well, there is going to be one auction.  But let's talk about  what that auction is.  So we were talking a minute ago about wireless.   There is huge demand for the spectrum, the air waves that wireless rides  on.  And we have to look at the limited amount of spectrum that is  available and say is it put to its best purpose? </p><p>So what we're doing is we're going to run an auction next year, starts  March of next year that's a two-sided market.  First time it's ever been  tried, where we will turn to broadcasters and say, if you want to sell us  your air waves, we will buy them, then we repackage them so that they are  in a format that works for wireless, and we turn around to the mobile  companies and say, OK, now you buy them.  Nobody -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  You bid on them.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Nobody has ever tried.  You bid on them and pay the  government.  And nobody has ever tried that.  But that's really -- it is  letting the market work to put spectrum to its highest and best use.  And  it's going to be ground-breaking, and I think it will be the future of how  -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  How will you mark success?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  We'll mark success by whether new spectrum gets opened, you  know.  I mean there will be multiples tens of billions of dollars that will  change hands here, but I think the key is, is there new spectrum that is  going to be able to be repurposed for 21st century applications in the  mobile world?  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Where -- back to my question about South Korea and Japan and  Europe -- you know, what can we learn by what's going on around the world?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Oh, that's a great question because the world is getting  smaller and smaller and smaller.  And one of the things that the Internet  has done is to make us all share common experiences.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  It changed time and distance.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Totally.  I mean it's the death of distance.  There is no  such thing as distance. </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Go ahead.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  So I think that we have been the world leaders in innovation,  in digital activity because we had the home field advantage of the Internet  starting here.  And we want to make sure that that continues, and that's  both for wired and for wireless.  There are some great things as you point  out that are happening in Japan and that are happening in Korea and China  and elsewhere.  But I think that we need to make sure that we are tending  to our knitting, making sure that we have the environment.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  I assume your argument is that we have to create an  environment for innovation so that whatever the lead we got from being a  founder, an initiator will continue.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  That's what we mean by permissionless innovation.  That's why  open Internet is so important, Charlie, because we have to create an  environment where this wonderful thing called the Internet which just  allows everybody to reach the world overnight, where there aren't  gatekeepers there.  Because if there's somebody who is saying, no, I'm not  so sure or you pay me to get on or things like this, then we're going to  inhibit innovation, and innovation is the driver of this economy.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Can China innovate?</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  I think that they clearly are making efforts to do that.  I  think they're what you might call fast followers at this point in time, but  they're looking to say how can we take this fifth generation and make it  work to our advantage?</p><p>So one of the things we've done at the FCC is we've said that we want to be  out front in allocating spectrum so that first in the world spectrum that  can be used for fifth generation is here in the United States.  And that we  want to be allowing flexible use of that spectrum so it's not some  bureaucrat in Washington like me making the decision as how it gets used.   It's the people who are innovating.  It's the people who are going to try  the new ideas who are making those decisions, and that is exactly the  formula that made us the world leader in fourth generation.  And I think it  will work for fifth generation, too.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  One risk people see is the possibilities of sabotage of  undersea cables.  That's an issue for you?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  It's the new style of wiretapping, isn't that right?  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Yes.  But I think we have to understand that networks have  always been attack paths -- I don't care whether it's a road network or a  sea network or whatever -- it's the way people have mounted attacks.  We  have a new network in the 21st century.  It would be naive to say that  somebody's not going to do it. </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  To say someone would not figure out how they could do that.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  That's right.  That's right.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And then we have the possibilities -- my friend Ted Koppel  has a book out which is called \"Lights Out\" -- </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Right.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE: -- which is about the capacity to do huge damage to America  and its economy, you know, by attacking the Internet.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Right.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  The electric grid.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  We've taken that real seriously.  I mean if we have  responsibility for public safety and the functioning of our networks, then  we need to make sure that we are doing the right kind of cyber hygiene, if  you will.</p><p>So what we did was we brought the experts, including the network companies,  together and said, let's agree on a common set of standards for hygiene  that you will have in your network.  Then let's have a regular visit to  your network to find out what's the experience you're having.  A -- are you  doing it, and B -- is it working?</p><p>Because the thing we can absolutely guarantee is that what works today is  going to have to change to work tomorrow, OK?  And, so, we want to put in  place a structure that evolves so that as technology as different ways of  hacking things evolve that our networks can evolve, too.</p><p>But cyber security is an essential component of what we do and a very  important thing.  And it's also something that you and I as citizens and  everybody watching this needs to think about because the way in which it  starts is it normally comes in through somebody doing something and that  gives somebody access.  So we need to have good hygiene ourselves.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And as you know the problem with that kind of attack, is you  don't know where it's coming from.  It's not like a nation state.  An  attack through the Internet, you can't necessarily, because they're so  ingenious about where they go from A to Z.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  You can do some good inferences, but yes.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  So finally there is this.  There is this debate that goes on  between security and privacy.  Where are you on that and where is the  balance?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Clearly, the two relate.  Clearly we're existing in a world  where the capital asset of the 21st century is information.  And it ends up  being information about you and me.  And you and I -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Some people collect that as a matter of business and then  sell it.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  And you and I -- correct.  You and I ought to have a voice in  the collection of information about us.  You know, nothing about me without  me, is what the expression is.  And so, this is a very important thing and  this is something that's on our agenda as well.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  That's interesting because that's about the future.  It's on  your agenda meaning what?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  So you will see us -- I've told the Congress and others that  you will see us within the next several months, addressing the question of  privacy of those who provide the networks -- the privacy practices of those  who provide the network services and how it affects you and me.</p><p>In other words, do I know what information's being collected?  Do I have a  voice in whether or not that's going to be used in one way or another?  And  those are two very important baseline rights that individuals ought to  have.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  The other thing that's interesting to me is that these  companies are all mostly out in Silicon Valley.  Many of them, you know,  particularly the founding ones there -- Microsoft, Apple, Amazon -- all out  from the West Coast from either Seattle or Silicon Valley.  And for a long  time they said to the government, leave us alone -- almost libertarian,  right?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Right.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Now it is said that they have as intense lobbying effort in  Washington as anybody.  Is that fair?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  There is nothing in the corporate culture that argues against  eventually saying how does policy affect what I do in my business?  And so  what we at the FCC do is do we get lobbied by Google?  Yes.  Do we get  lobbied by AT&amp;T?  Yes.</p><p>So what our challenge is how do you find the common good?  I mean the  interesting thing you said a minute ago, you talked about earlier in my  career that I had been an advocate for various businesses.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  And the way you tend -- things tend to work in an advocacy  role is you come in and you say, unless you do this my way, it's going to  be the end of western civilization as we know it.  And the other side comes  in and says exactly the same thing. </p><p>And the job of people like me and my colleagues at the commission is to  say, OK, where is it -- I understand why this position is good for them,  and I understand why this is good for them -- where is the solution that  has the common good in it?  You know, what we call public interest, but the  public interest is vague.</p><p>What's the common good?  How can you structure things so that, again -- and  you come back to basic principles like competition.  How do you make sure  that that which serves the common good survives?  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  But also the common good is to stimulate innovation to push  forward.  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Absolutely.  Then again, that's why we wanted permissionless  innovation with the open Internet.  We didn't want the Internet to get  choked down so that somebody else was deciding what two guys, and a dog in  a garage came up with and whether you and I were going to get to see it.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Is this the best job of your life?  </p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Yes, I'm having a great time.  I'm a really fortunate person.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Thanks for coming.</p><p>TOM WHEELER:  Thanks -- Charlie.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications  Commission.</p><p>Back in a moment.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Meg Whitman is here.  She has been CEO of Hewlett Packard  since 2011.  The technology icon was created more than 75 years ago in a  Palo Alto garage.  For decades it led in the business of selling computers  and printers.  The growth of enterprise services has forced HP to evolve.   The company's reinvented itself with aspirations to capitalize in both the  PC and networking solutions arena.</p><p>On Sunday HP split into two separate pieces: Hewlett Packard Enterprise  will primarily sell computer service, data storage and consulting servings.   HP, Inc. will largely consist of personal computers and printers. </p><p>I'm pleased to have Meg Whitman back on this program.  Welcome.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  it's great to have you here.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Happy to be here.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  This is the ad that was in yesterday's paper and today's  paper.  \"The company that started Silicon Valley is making history again.\"</p><p>I want to talk about how you're going to make history.  But tell me what  happened to Hewlett Packard.  How did the company that Bill Hewlett and  David Packard create that was the admiration of the world and certainly the  Valley, the company that in terms of values, in terms of culture, in terms  of success was looked on with huge admiration?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  The last decade was a tough decade.  And I would  actually chalk it up to too much turnover at the CEO level.  CEOs -- when  you have different CEOs who have different strategies -- it's very hard on  a company particularly one as large as HP. </p><p>And so I can now see as we're turning the corner with people who have been  in role three or four years, you're starting to see it gel again.  So I  think the root of the challenge was in many ways too many CEOs in too short  a period of a time.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And did it therefore miss huge opportunities that others  saw?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Sure, absolutely it did.  You know, mobile phones was an  opportunity that HP missed and -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Well, yes, certainly many others.  But, you know, the  technology business is incredibly dynamic, and it's hard to catch every  wave.  And obviously the bigger you are, the more challenging it is --  right.  I mean bigger companies just don't move quite as fast as smaller  companies.  So part of the separation is about being more nimble and more  focused on two entirely different markets so that HP cannot miss the trends  and, in fact, can invent the trends.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  So now you come along.  </p><p>How did they get you to do this?  Because you had had a remarkable career - - </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  You'd even made a venture into politics which you said was a  great learning experience even though you lost.  </p><p>You learned how to communicate, learn the demands of the modern world in  terms of what we expect from people in the public eye whether it's a CEO or  an aspirant to be governor of California.  You were on the board at HP.</p><p>That's been a board that's often been rancorous.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes, yes.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And they convinced you to take over as CEO.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Well, I'll tell you how it happened because I had no  intention of being the CEO.  So I lost the governor's race in the fall of  2010.  And I was trying to decide what I was going to do.  I was working on  our family foundation and I was sort of searching for the next thing.</p><p>And it's very difficult when you lose these elections.  As an aside, we  should be really grateful for people who run because it's really tough when  you lose because it's like a personal referendum in some ways.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Yes.  So did you -- was it depressing for you?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  It was very hard.  If you think about it, when you're part of  a company, you know, there's you and the company.  When you run for public  office, it's a vote on you.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  You felt rejected.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  You feel rejected.  I mean it's very challenging.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Did you question your own abilities at all?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Sure you think gosh, you know, could have, would have, should  have, you know, that whole thing.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Yes.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  But, so it's February and I'm at home one afternoon watching  an afternoon daytime talk show at 4:00.  And my husband who is a  neurosurgeon comes home early from work.  He walks in and he sees me in the  family room at 4:00 in the afternoon watching an afternoon talk show and he  goes oh, this is really not good.  This is really not good.  You've got to  pull your socks up and you've got to figure out what you're going to do.</p><p>Just as if on cue that afternoon I got a call from an HP board member, Marc  Andreessen -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Right.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  -- who said we're looking for some new board members for HP,  you would be perfect.  It will be so much fun.  We'll sit on the tech  committee.  And, you know, it's just in the neighborhood and it's a chance  to help reinvent a Silicon Valley icon. </p><p>I said, this is great, what could go wrong?  12 minutes from my house.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  But you're a board member.  That's all you are.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  That's right.  But I'm thinking what could go wrong.  Twelve  minutes from my house, it will be fun.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Right.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  And it became quite apparent soon that the company had a lot  of challenges and then of course, we as the board had the do the most  difficult thing that a board does, which is remove the CEO.  That was in  some ways the easy thing. </p><p>The next was who's going to run HP and the board sort of looked at me and I  said, oh, no, no, no.  We are definitely not doing this.  We are definitely  not doing this.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Been there, done that.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  But over time, I began to feel -- you know, it matters  what happens to HP.  HP is important to California.  It's important, I  would argue, to the tech industry and the United States and important  globally.  We are often the largest private employer in many countries in  which we do business.</p><p>So ultimately, I decided, OK, I'll see -- we'll do the best I can and I  will see if I can be helpful here.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Well, they made the argument you were on a plane ride back  from somewhere.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  We had a board meeting on the East Coast.  And on the  way back a number of them really were very persuasive and said we need you  to do this.  It's an opportunity to make a big change to a big company  that's important and struggling.  And the scale was interesting to me.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  So the challenge was interesting and the scale in which they  existed was interesting.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And you know me well enough to know I  love a challenge.  And so they hooked me on the challenge.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Yes.  And so tell me, when you got there, you had seen it up  close as a member of the board.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  But then you had to get into the weeds of this company.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  What did you find?</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  So I found a very proud company with incredible founder DNA.   The a-ha here is -- and this is great news for any founder that's watching  your program -- it is really hard to kill founder DNA.  And for HP, that  was a very good thing because the core of this company through all the  acquisitions and all the board drama was around innovation and focus on  customers.  </p><p>And so I made the decision let's do more of what we do well and then we'll  work on the to-do list of things that need to be fixed.  And there were a  number of things that need to be fixed.  But I went right to innovation,  right to the customer.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  But was it looking at making a decision about what product  lines you should have?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Well, the first decision I made -- remember my predecessor  had said maybe they should spin off the PC business.  Not PCs and printers  but just PCs.  So I put together a 60-day study and said we can't do this  right now.  We can't afford to build another brand.  </p><p>And because printing was going to stay with the big company we would have  to build a new brand for the PC company.  The company wasn't in shape to  split.  As it turns out, and I know this now first hand, when you separate  a company of this size and scale, everything from IT to legal entities to  tax ID codes to all kinds of things, you have to be strong to do it.  And I  don't think we would have been able to pull it off back then.</p><p>So I made the decision, let's stay together.  Let's rebuild the company.   Let's strengthen the company.  Let's reconnect with partners and customers.   Let's, you know, focus on making this company as great as we can with the  businesses that we are in. </p><p>And it's been quite a turnaround journey.  I mean we went from almost $12  billion of debt on the operating company to a positive net cash on the  operating company.  We really changed that much of the leadership team.  We  reignited the innovation engine to capitalize on the trends and the market  like all flash array, a modern kind of storage.</p><p>And we revamped in many ways the whole company.  And then we said how do we  accelerate into this turnaround?  And we decided, the board and I, to  separate into two Fortune 50 companies.  Can you imagine?  There's two  Fortune 50 -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Separate, they're both within the top 50.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  It's amazing.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  It is amazing.  And so you make this distinction between HP,  Inc. and -- </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  -- and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  I mean everybody --  there are a lot of people getting in the enterprise business.  I mean from  IBM to Amazon to Hewlett Packard at different levels.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Why did you think you could win at that business?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Well, first of all, HP, Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise  are really quite different businesses.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  I know.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  In the classic case, you know -- with different customers,  different competitors, different cost structure -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  But the same thing is true with Amazon in terms of the  retail business and their enterprise business.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  But we had a company that needed to reinvent itself  again.  And we just though, you know what, let's separate these into two  different companies so we can focus on these two most important markets.   Because HP Inc. has one-third of their business is to consumers.  You can  go buy an HP printer at Staples or wherever.  You can go buy an HP PC  someplace.</p><p>And so we thought, let's get to really focus on the enterprise and what we  can do for the IT professionals in small to medium to big companies and  really help them do a number of things that are very top of mind.  I mean  every CIO now is thinking, I have a legacy IT infrastructure.  I've got to  get to the new world order.  I've got to get to the new style of IT, the  cloud.  I've got to be more agile. </p><p>And we are uniquely suited to help companies on that transformation journey  because those big companies, they've got to keep running their legacy IT  systems while they get to the -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  So who are you going to serve?  Who are your customers?</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Largely CIOs and VP of Ops, VP of Apps, VP of VAP, you know,  operations for anywhere from small to very large companies.  Remember we  have a very robust channel that helps serve our customers.  So we call them  value-added resellers.  They will serve the small to medium size customers  with our products and services and software.  And then we sell direct to  the biggest customers.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Why did you decide to be the CEO of the enterprise?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  And someone asked me that question because in some ways  it would have been more natural for me to go to the part with the consumer  because I'm a consumer technologist really.  But I had a great executive  named Dion Weisler (ph) who really knew the PC business.  He'd run PCs and  printers in Asia-Pacific for us.  We brought him back.  He was doing a  great job running PCs and printers at corporate.</p><p>And I said, you're fantastic for this job.  He's got a lot of runway.  He's  a young man.  And I said I'll take the enterprise side.  There's more work  to do.  And I've actually become quite enamored with the enterprise side.   Get back to the challenge and learning -- I had to learn a lot about the  enterprise side.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Why have you become enamored?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  You know, there -- I love disruption and I love the  opportunity that creates.  And think about what our business has been  through -- the industry.  From mainframe to client servers, you know, PCs;  from client server to Web 1.0 where I had a front seat at the revolution at  eBay; from the first generation of the Internet to web services.</p><p>Now we're on the cusp of another huge change about what's possible for IT  at a large company.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And that's because of the Cloud?  What is it?</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  It's because of the Cloud.  It's because of the way  applications are now written.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Right.  When you were back at Princeton did you imagine that  you would be a corporate manager?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  No.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  What did you think you were going to be?</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Well, I went to Princeton as a pre-med.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  I know.  I know.  Is that where you met your husband?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  No, I actually met -- he was at Harvard Medical School when I  was at Harvard Business School.  But, you know, I took a lot of science  courses a Princeton for which I am deeply grateful but ultimately decided  that there was a better fit for me in business.  And, you know, as a 21- year-old, what did I know?  Not much.</p><p>But I sold advertising for a magazine at Princeton and I thought selling  advertising, business, that's sort of alike, you know, and then I applied  to Harvard Business School.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Was it at Bane that you walked into the office of the CEO  and said to him let me tell you what's wrong with the way you're running  your business?  You have no idea of how the employees think about you.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN: Yes, I did.  Can you imagine that I did that?</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  I can.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  I don't know what I was thinking.  I was young and naive and  enthusiastic.  But Tom Tierney was his name who was the managing director - - </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  He thanked you for doing this.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  He did and he was an incredible mentor to me.  In fact, he  came on the board of eBay and was a big -- he might be one of the best  strategists in America today, business strategist.  And he was a huge help  to me at Bane and actually made an enormous difference to us.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  but what's the philosophy here that people need -- somebody  come in to the door and say this is what you're not doing and this is what  you don't perceive and this is an intervention moment?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  Well, I think sometimes and I think all of us are  guilty of this at one time or another is, you begin to drink your own Kool- Aid and you don't see yourself and your leadership style as it really is.   And sometimes you need a friend or someone who works for you or a colleague  to say do you see what you're doing here?  Do you see what you are doing?  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Was it the right idea to run for governor?  Was that a  mistake?  Did somebody not come in to you and say Meg, this is a different  game?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  This is a political game?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  They did say that.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And why did you ignore that?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  I think for a couple of reasons.  One I saw the state that I  loved, the state that had been my home for nearly 30 years was in real  trouble.  You might recall we had a huge budget deficit.  We had a massive  unfunded pension liability which by the way the state still has.  Our  education system had gone from number one in the country in the 50s to  number 48 or 49 in, you know -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  -- and others were -- </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  I mean and you just -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  At the university level.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  -- yes and you have all kinds of challenges.  I said maybe I  can apply some of what I learned in my career both at eBay and other places  to help solve some these problems.  So I dove in with 100 percent of my  effort, and I worked at it very had for almost two and a half years.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  But were you prepared to spend your own money as you are as  Donald Trump is spending his own money?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  I was prepared to do that.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  You spent a lot of your money.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  I did.  And I thought, you know, that -- and I also raised a  lot of money.  So I had a lot of support from people around the state, but  I did spend some of my own money because it was important.  I had to learn  a lot, right.  You know, I had to learn water policy.  I had to learn  education policy and it was an experience of a lifetime, Charlie.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  How's Governor Brown doing?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Listen, he's raised taxes, obviously, on a number of folks.   The budget deficit is more in line than it was.  It's much smaller than it  was.  Silicon Valley has been a big help to that, right.  Silicon Valley  right now is the economic engine of California.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Yes.  And it's the place that every foreign head of state  wants to go because they want to create their own Silicon Valley.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Silicon Valley -- exactly.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Xi Jinping went from Seattle, Washington before he went to  Washington, D.C.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Because everyone loves this notion of how  do you -- how could you possibly create Silicon Valley in China and -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Can you?  Or is that something you could do with America's  culture?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  I don't know.  It's really hard -- Charlie.  It's alchemy,  almost.  It's the -- you have to have a great company like Hewlett-Packard  which was the founder of Silicon Valley, a fantastic university or  universities -- Stanford being the anchor, but Berkeley, Santa Clara, you  know, U.C. Santa Cruz are all part of that ecosystem now.  And then you  have to have that venture capital where risk is rewarded.</p><p>And so it's -- the more entrepreneurs you have, the more venture capital  that's attracted, the more great companies that start.  And you start a  positive -- it's almost an ecosystem and it's very hard to create.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Do you worry that somehow there is the seed within the tech  world today for overheating and a bubble that would burst?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Sure, I do.  I do.  I mean we lived through -- when I was at  eBay, we lived through the 2001 bubble that burst.  Frankly, eBay was fine  because we had real revenues and real profits.  And while our market cap  went down a bit, we just kept on kept on going.  But you know, you see a  lot of very high multiples, young companies today.  And so I worry about  it. </p><p>And you've seen a pullback actually in the last six to eight weeks.  You've  seen a pullback in the valuation of some of these younger companies.  So  the multiples have gone down -- you know, we'll see.  I think the goodness  is there is enough people who lived through 2001 who know what can happen.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Who raised the questions?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  But there is a whole generation that didn't live through 2001  and sometimes you have to have -- you know, your question about running for  governor -- you have to be a product of your experiences.</p><p>And by the way, I think I'm a better CEO because I ran.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Because you understand the public dimension.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  I understand the public dimension but also I learned a lot  about communicating with large groups of people.  And as it turned out by  complete coincidence, when I came to HP, it happened to be about the same  size as the government of California.  And what I learned about  communicating in politics is -- and I bet you know this -- it is not always  about the left brain, the facts and the figures and all of this.  It is  about the emotion, the stories you tell and how you connect.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Absolutely.  It's the emotional level that you connect and  then people are there.  If you connect on the emotional level then they're  open to your arguments.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Exactly.  And I don't think I completely understood that  because when you grow a big business you are trained to be very analytical.   I mean can you imagine being the CEO of a public company, going in front of  your investors and telling them stories?  I mean you would be thrown out on  your ear.  They want to know the numbers.  They want to know the return on  investment capital.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Right.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  And so we're trained -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE: If you say, let me tell you my narrative they say, what's  your bottom line?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  They feel like excuse me.  And so I was a very left-brained,  trained individual, we all are.  And, so, I had to learn a lot about  communication.  And so when I came to HP I learned about that and I did  quite a different style of communication when I was trying to rally the  whole company and the importance of symbolic value.</p><p>I'll tell you a story about Jerry Brown and this is a story I admire him.   When the state was in tremendous financial difficulty, he said you know  what we're going to do.  We're going to take the cell phones away from all  the civil servants in the state of California.  I remember thinking, OK,  that's all very interesting but it is 0.01 percent of the budget. </p><p>It wasn't about the money.  It was about the symbol and symbolism and the  story he was telling which was he's going to be tougher on the budget.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  -- and demand sacrifice.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Exactly.  If you had asked the man on the street, you know,  how do you think Jerry Brown is doing with the budget?  He would have said  doing great, taking away the cell phones from those civil servants.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  It was a symbolic act -- </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Exactly.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  that connected and resonated.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  And so I learned while -- when I watched him.  And so when I  came to HP, I said what's a symbolic act that I can do that will  communicate to the company about why this is different.  So the very first  thing we did we tore town the executive parking lot and the barbed wire  that surrounded the executive parking lot and I moved the entire leadership  team to cubicles out of their wooden offices.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  They're no longer behind closed doors or whatever?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  We were out in the open just like everybody else.  And we  didn't write about that.  We didn't make a publicity statement.  250,000 --  300,000 HP people knew that within about 24 hours.  And that made a  statement.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Breaking down the barriers between -- </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  And I learned that from running for office.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  -- employer and employee.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  You are supporting Governor Christie.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  I am.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Why?</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  I know Governor Christie quite well and I have admired what  he has been able to do as a Republican governor in a blue state with a  Democratically-controlled legislature.  And my view is we have to have  people who have learned to reach across the aisle and get things done.  And  he hasn't gotten -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  That's what's needed in Washington, you're suggesting?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  I think that's what's needed in Washington because I think  that it's likely that the president will be one party and the congress will  be of another.  And so he didn't get everything he wanted in New Jersey but  sometimes in politics perfect is the enemy of really pretty good.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  How do you ascertain how he's doing?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Well, he's working very hard.  And I think he is a fantastic  retail politician.  You know when we were talking about how you reach in  and connect?  No one's better than Chris Christie at reaching in and  connecting with people.  When people interact with him, they feel like they  know him and they understand his heart.</p><p>And so he's been putting a lot of shoe leather into Iowa, into Nevada, into  New Hampshire and I think he's making progress.  You can see him begin to  inch up at the polls, you know.  His favorables are turning.  So I'm  optimistic.  But it's a tough, tough slog.  But I think he's doing  everything he knows how to do and I admire him a lot for doing it.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Look at where we are in terms of technology.  What's next if  you're asked?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  We're still at the beginning of the mobile revolution.  That  sounds crazy because we've all had mobile phones for a long time but pretty  soon almost everyone on the planet may have a mobile phone and it's  changing every element of life and I think we're at the beginning of that  impact not at the end.</p><p>And you think about how people use their phone in developing countries to,  you know, trade commodities, to you know, sell their goods on the Internet  to countries around the world.  I mean it's really phenomenal.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And it gives people in faraway places access to all kinds of  information.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  It does and it has a political, you know, undercurrent as  well.  So I think we're at the beginning of that revolution.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  -- which includes social media.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Well, social media is its home.  Its first home really in  many ways today is on your mobile.  Yes, you know, Facebook was invented  for the desktop but now there's more people who access Facebook on their  mobile than on their desktop.</p><p>So I just think you're at the beginning of a tremendous revolution.  When  you think about a PC, per se, think about it, what you have in your hand is  more powerful than a PC was ten years ago, it's maybe more powerful than a  PC was five years ago.  Think about what you can do on your mobile, what  you can do on your tablet.  </p><p>Now, when you've got a lot of work to do, you really do want a full-fledged  PC, but I think we're at the beginning of that revolution. </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Is there a lesson to be learned from what Lou Gerstner did  at IBM?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  So I read his book with great interest as you will  recall it was called \"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance\".  He said when he  came to IBM at the end of his book he said when I came to IBM I thought  culture was important.  When I left IBM, he said I thought culture maybe  was the only thing that's important.  And I can see exactly what he means.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Why does it take so hard to learn that?  I mean -- </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  You know, because you think that other things can make a  difference, but in the end when you run these big-scale operations, people  on the frontlines, the sales person in New York for the server business has  to know what to do, has to know what the ethics and the value and the ethos  of the company is.  And people have to -- it cannot be a command and  control environment.  People have to know what to do on the front lines.   And how do they know what to do?  It's not through policy and procedures  and handbooks, it's through the culture.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  What did you learn from Steve Jobs at Apple, going back to a  company that was on his -- </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  Steve Jobs may well be the genius in business of my  generation.  I mean this guy was amazingly creative, and the ability to  invent category.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  The company was near bankruptcy and now the largest company  in the world.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  It's amazing.  I mean it's the biggest turnaround if you will  that I've ever seen in my career.  And they continue to amaze.  And kudos  to Tim Cook for being able to continue that legacy because it's not easy to  follow Steve Jobs.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Why was it a mistake for Dell to buy EMC?  That's what you  said to your employees.  They gave you guys an opportunity. </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Figuring out how to put cultures together and all that and  you guys would go out there and start innovating.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Exactly.  So listen it's a fascinating time in history  because two companies who are quite similar in many ways, HP was a larger  company than Dell, but we were in largely the same businesses.  We have  taken took diametrically opposed strategies with the same set of facts.   Right?  So we decided -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  What were the facts?</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Well, the industry and incredible tectonic plate shifts from,  if you will, the old style of IT to the next generation.  One of these  inflection points for our industry where a lot of the old proud companies  were under pressure.  Our strategy was de-lever the balance sheet so you  have no debt on the operating company, in fact you have cash on the  operating company.</p><p>Lean in to new technology like three par, like our networking business,  like Cloud.  Make sure we pivoted to solution selling with our enterprise  services business and really focus on revenue growth.</p><p>And their strategy was lever up the balance sheet, put old technology  together, take out the costs and then try to make your way that way.  I  mean two diametrically opposed strategies.</p><p>Listen, I'm going to vote for Hewlett Packard Enterprise all day long  because I think fast is important, speed is important where we live.  And  I'll tell you -- they have a year to close the deal and another year to  integrate.  And we have an opportunity I think to explain to customers our  solutions and why we are, you know, a stable, great company to do business  with.</p><p>And it is pretty funny, Charlie, because you think back in 2011 we looked  pretty unstable, right?  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Of course.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  And now we're looking like the paragon of stability.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Was than when -- when did Fiorina leave?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Much earlier.  I think 2005 -- </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  You went through her then you went through before that -- </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Right.  I think Carly left in 2005, 2006 -- something like  that.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  So has she taken an unfair hit or is it simply a product of  she happened to be not the right person at the right time for Hewlett  Packard?  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  So listen, politics is tough, right.  We covered this.  I  mean it is tough.  You've got to have a rhinoceros skin, and people will  try to take you on.  I would like to say no good deed goes unpunished.  And  I said before in public, I think the Compaq acquisition was the right  thing.  We have the position that we have today in PCs and in servers thank  you to the Compaq acquisition.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  She drove that.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  And she drove that.  And she drove that.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And it was right thing?</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  I think it was the right thing.  With 20/20 hindsight looking  back, I'm glad we have the position that we have in those two businesses  because fundamentally they are the bedrock now of HP, Inc. and Hewlett  Packard enterprises.  </p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  When you buy a business, I mean you see people -- they'll  buy company just to get the CEO -- to get the executive talent.  </p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  In Silicon Valley, they're called acqui-hires,  you know, acquisition of hires.</p><p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Right, right.  Acqui-hire.</p><p>MEG WHITMAN:  An acqui-hire.  People would say for the most part these big  tech acquisitions are very tough to pull off and usually there is a  challenge before, you know, the sun rises again.  So, you know, listen I  think we're super well-prepared in these two companies to go own innovate,  deliver for customers in a changing world, while we're not trying to  integrate another company.

He is chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. The agency adopted net neutrality rules earlier this year. The new regulations treat Internet service as a public utility. The commissioner has also been active in reviewing media and telecommunications mergers.</p><p>This summer it approved AT&amp;T's takeover of DirecTV which created the largest television distributor in the United States. Next year the FCC will hold an auction to coordinate the sale of television air waves.</p><p>For all those reasons I'm pleased to have Chairman Tom Wheeler at this table for the first time. It seems like I've known him for 100 years. It's a pleasure to have you.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Charlie -- thank you. It's great to be here.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And we had your favorite Ohio State coach here the other day and --</p><p>TOM WHEELER: From the Ohio State University.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: From the Ohio State University. My impression is they have no bigger or stronger fan than you.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: I think that's a true statement.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. And you used to work with Woody Hayes.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Yes, way back when, when I was in graduate school I had the privilege of being able to rub shoulders with Coach Hayes and some of the things he was doing in the state. He was a great --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I would imagine you had lots to talk about military history and all the things that he taught there.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Yes. And three yards and a cloud of dust -- that's the way he ran. You know, three things can -- why don't you pass coach? Three things can happen and two of them were bad.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So what can happen to the FCC?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, you know, Charlie we're sitting at a really exciting time in history if you stop and think about it. The most important external force in our daily lives are the networks that connect us, and we at the FCC get the privilege to be involved in the evolution of those networks into the digital era, whether it's broadcasting or cable or satellite or telephone networks or the Internet. That's our jurisdiction.</p><p>It's about a sixth of the economy that we get a chance to participate with as they're evolving from the old analog world to the new digital world.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And so -- but what do you do? I mean you obviously hear important arguments and make rulings on them.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, you know, the really interesting thing about this job is that the statute was written in 1934. It was updated in 1996. And even from 1996, a lot has changed. So the challenge that we have is to say, OK, let's look at the basic four corners that the Congress has laid down and said this is what we think is in the public interest, and then make interpretations as to how that statutory responsibility works in the new digital world.</p><p>And so we're dealing with everything from mergers to competitive issues and how do you make sure that there is competition in these markets? How do you make sure that there is consumer protection? How do you make sure that national security is protected? So it's a very broad palette that we have to work with.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is what predecessor Michael Powell, president of the National Cable Communications Association and the chairman of the FCC in the Bush administration said quote, \"The commission has breathed new life into the decayed telephone regulatory model and applied it to the most dynamic free wheeling and innovative platform in history.\"</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, I agree totally with him. The Internet is the most dynamic and free wheeling platform in history.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: It's the most powerful and pervasive platform in history.</p><p>I disagree entirely with him because on his other part because, basically, what the cable industry and the telephone industry and those who provide Internet service, last-mile service, have been saying is, oh, leave us alone, leave us alone.</p><p>What we did was we said, wait a minute -- there is a basic responsibility that people who are providing Internet service have to make sure that consumers have unfettered access to the content they want to go to on the web and that those who are creating content have unfettered access to consumers, and that's some basic things.</p><p>There should be no blocking. You should not be able to say you can get through when you can't. There should be no throttling. You shouldn't be able to say, well, your service, I'm not going to allow it to go as fast as another service. There should be no paid prioritization. You shouldn't be able to say well, you're a fast lane and you're a slow lane, because you're paying me more.</p><p>And then what you need to have in place is I think the thing that they're really most concerned about and that is you need to have a referee on the field. We were talking about Woody Hayes and Urban Meyer a minute ago.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: You need to have a set of rules that says is this just unreasonable and you need to have somebody who can throw the flag if it isn't. We don't know what the Internet is going to become five years from now. I mean think back five years and where we are today. We had no idea it would end up today. What we don't want to have happen as a regulatory agency is to thwart innovation. But at the same point in time, we don't want those who are --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That's one of the arguments they made.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: But the other part is we don't want people who are running the networks to have to be the ones who provide permission for innovators and entrepreneurs to provide new services. So it's the concept of permissionless innovation and making sure that there is somebody to say does this make sense? Is this just and reasonable?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: OK. But their argument is that you inhibit innovation. That's where they --</p><p>TOM WHEELER: But I think that that is easily refuted by you look at the tremendous growth in investment that has taken place in entrepreneurial activities since we put the rules in place. You look at how the industry, the cable industry, the telephone industry, the wireless industry have unprecedented levels of investment since we put the rules in place. I mean the network itself is growing and those who serve the network is growing since we put in the rules.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So if you make a huge capital investment to provide the fastest Internet service somewhere, you now simply have to make that available to everybody.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Correct.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: When John Oliver was on this program he talked about the story of someone with your experience becoming the FCC chairman. You have said that experience provided you with all that was necessary to do a good job.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Absolutely.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: He said, why would we let someone who's been trying to lobby the FCC become the person who chairs the FCC? Is that some inherent conflict?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, I think that, you know, if you go back and you look -- and, Charlie, I ran the Cable Television Association when it was an up and coming industry being and fighting for its survival. I ran the cellular industry, you know, a dozen years ago when it was an entirely different business.</p><p>I've started my own businesses. I have been a partner to venture capital firm helping start businesses. So I come to this job with an understanding of both business and policy and how it works with the people that we regulate. So I actually think I come with a leg up.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What do you hope you accomplish while you're chairman of the FCC? You addressed net neutrality. You have some mergers you have addressed.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: At the core, it is competition, you know. I mean the consumer's best friend is a competitive market, and our broadband market isn't as competitive as it could be. So, one of the reasons that you have an open Internet rule is to increase competition.</p><p>One of the reasons that we turned down the Comcast merger was to increase competition. One of the reasons that we have encouraged -- we pre-empted states -- let me just say -- one of the things the big providers were doing were going to state legislatures and getting them to pass laws that prohibited cities from building a competitive product if their people wanted them to. And we said no. That's anti-competitive and so we pre- empted that.</p><p>And we have a whole series of actions that are saying how do we increase competition? You know, the joke around the commission is that my mantra is competition, competition, competition, which is normally said \"competition- competition-competition\". And that's the goal that we're working on.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So let me just jump ahead to some mergers. So the Comcast merger you said does not increase competition.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: If those two giants get together, Time Warner and Comcast --</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right. So we turned that down.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You turned that down. But when AT&amp;T came along, buying DirecTV, a satellite company -- you said that's fine.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Because we put in the terms and conditions of that agreement specific pro competitive activities. For instance, AT&amp;T is required to bring fiber service -- high-speed fiber service to 12.5 million new American homes. That's a 40 percent increase in the number of homes reached by fiber. And guess who they're --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: They'll get faster service.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: They'll get faster service. And guess who they're competing with for that? The cable companies -- OK. So that was a key part of that. We put in there some other rules to make sure that there was pro competition coming out of it.</p><p>Here's the key statistic -- 83 percent of Americans can access high-speed broadband service.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: 83 percent?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: 83 percent.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: But two-thirds of those can get it from only one company. So the goal is how do you facilitate competition? Because competition drives prices down, competition incentivizes better service, competition is a consumer's friend with innovation.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Speaking of mergers -- trying to understand how you approach these and how you make a judgment about competition, there was a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right, and we actively discouraged that, that four wireless carriers is a good and vibrant market, and if you were to take number three and number four and allow them to merge to go to three, that would have hurt --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But would it have made them stronger and therefore be more competitive because there is a difference.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: But look at what's happened --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: there is a difference between those four. And if three and four could combine and therefore be more competitive with one and two, why isn't at that a good idea?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Look at what T-Mobile has done since we didn't allow them to merge.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What have they done.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: And they have become the most innovative, the most price- competitive, and they're forcing the market to respond to them, including Sprint respond to them with good old American competition. That's what we were trying to stand for.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: OK. Let me talk about something else you wrote. You said \"We need to continue looking to the future and act now to facilitate the fifth generation of mobile technology.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right. Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What is that? So we're right now going through the fourth generation of mobile technology that you've seen in the ads called LTE.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right. And we're now -- we're heading towards the fifth generation. The fifth generation is going to be a new level of service. It will be different from what you're used to right now. It will be the enabler of what they call the Internet of things.</p><p>You know, by 2020, there are going to be 50 billion connected things, everything from your washing machine to, you know, your trash can.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: From your cell phone -- from your smart phone, you can run everything?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: You can run everything and they will talk to each other and you won't even know it. But you need to have an infrastructure that has what the technologists call very low latency which means that they interact real quickly and you need to have new spectrum that that works over.</p><p>So I leave for instance from this to go to Geneva where we're engaged in international negotiations to make sure that we have spectrum that is harmonized around the world for the next generation.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: We have not had that?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: No, we always -- we have that but --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: No, we have not had harmonization with the rest of the world in some cases -- have we?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, you know, in some cases but for the most part it's harmonized and because it's important. That's how you get to drive down the cost of infrastructure and the insets.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: OK.</p><p>I'm sure you thought of this and done this. If you go to Korea, or go to Japan --</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- everybody says they're so far ahead of us in terms of broadband and its possibilities and its speed and what it's doing. Is that true?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: They have very innovative ideas but we're the world leader in 4G technology. There are more -- 98 percent of the American population now has access to an LTE wireless signal and a competitive LTE wireless signal. You look at Europe, you look at Asia, nobody has those kinds of statistics like we do.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Is the television business as we know it healthy?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: I think the television business is in the process of evolving.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: To what?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: So it used to be that there were special networks for special kinds of video. You had the movie networks, if you will -- the theaters, OK, for movies. Then you had the television networks, and really they never really meshed with each other.</p><p>Now you have the digital world in which everything is the same in terms of being digitized and can be distributed over a common network. And that challenges everybody to evolve. And I think the television industry is evolving just like everybody else is evolving.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: To what though?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: To a broadband video business is one.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Exactly. Yes, right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: And -- but I also think --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It's a content company.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: But I also think that there is going to be a fine future for broadcast -- traditional broadcast television. But I think it will also be redefined.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What is that future?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: I think continuing to provide local service, continuing to be a way that in a local market you can reach all of the people at one time. But that content continues to sector markets and slice them down and that ends up being over on the Internet.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You've called next year's auction of wireless air waves quote, \"a once in a lifetime opportunity\". Define what a once in a lifetime opportunity is.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, there is going to be one auction. But let's talk about what that auction is. So we were talking a minute ago about wireless. There is huge demand for the spectrum, the air waves that wireless rides on. And we have to look at the limited amount of spectrum that is available and say is it put to its best purpose?</p><p>So what we're doing is we're going to run an auction next year, starts March of next year that's a two-sided market. First time it's ever been tried, where we will turn to broadcasters and say, if you want to sell us your air waves, we will buy them, then we repackage them so that they are in a format that works for wireless, and we turn around to the mobile companies and say, OK, now you buy them. Nobody --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You bid on them.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Nobody has ever tried. You bid on them and pay the government. And nobody has ever tried that. But that's really -- it is letting the market work to put spectrum to its highest and best use. And it's going to be ground-breaking, and I think it will be the future of how --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: How will you mark success?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: We'll mark success by whether new spectrum gets opened, you know. I mean there will be multiples tens of billions of dollars that will change hands here, but I think the key is, is there new spectrum that is going to be able to be repurposed for 21st century applications in the mobile world?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Where -- back to my question about South Korea and Japan and Europe -- you know, what can we learn by what's going on around the world?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Oh, that's a great question because the world is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. And one of the things that the Internet has done is to make us all share common experiences.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It changed time and distance.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Totally. I mean it's the death of distance. There is no such thing as distance.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Go ahead.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: So I think that we have been the world leaders in innovation, in digital activity because we had the home field advantage of the Internet starting here. And we want to make sure that that continues, and that's both for wired and for wireless. There are some great things as you point out that are happening in Japan and that are happening in Korea and China and elsewhere. But I think that we need to make sure that we are tending to our knitting, making sure that we have the environment.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I assume your argument is that we have to create an environment for innovation so that whatever the lead we got from being a founder, an initiator will continue.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: That's what we mean by permissionless innovation. That's why open Internet is so important, Charlie, because we have to create an environment where this wonderful thing called the Internet which just allows everybody to reach the world overnight, where there aren't gatekeepers there. Because if there's somebody who is saying, no, I'm not so sure or you pay me to get on or things like this, then we're going to inhibit innovation, and innovation is the driver of this economy.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Can China innovate?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: I think that they clearly are making efforts to do that. I think they're what you might call fast followers at this point in time, but they're looking to say how can we take this fifth generation and make it work to our advantage?</p><p>So one of the things we've done at the FCC is we've said that we want to be out front in allocating spectrum so that first in the world spectrum that can be used for fifth generation is here in the United States. And that we want to be allowing flexible use of that spectrum so it's not some bureaucrat in Washington like me making the decision as how it gets used. It's the people who are innovating. It's the people who are going to try the new ideas who are making those decisions, and that is exactly the formula that made us the world leader in fourth generation. And I think it will work for fifth generation, too.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: One risk people see is the possibilities of sabotage of undersea cables. That's an issue for you?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: It's the new style of wiretapping, isn't that right?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. But I think we have to understand that networks have always been attack paths -- I don't care whether it's a road network or a sea network or whatever -- it's the way people have mounted attacks. We have a new network in the 21st century. It would be naive to say that somebody's not going to do it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: To say someone would not figure out how they could do that.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: That's right. That's right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And then we have the possibilities -- my friend Ted Koppel has a book out which is called \"Lights Out\" --</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- which is about the capacity to do huge damage to America and its economy, you know, by attacking the Internet.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The electric grid.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: We've taken that real seriously. I mean if we have responsibility for public safety and the functioning of our networks, then we need to make sure that we are doing the right kind of cyber hygiene, if you will.</p><p>So what we did was we brought the experts, including the network companies, together and said, let's agree on a common set of standards for hygiene that you will have in your network. Then let's have a regular visit to your network to find out what's the experience you're having. A -- are you doing it, and B -- is it working?</p><p>Because the thing we can absolutely guarantee is that what works today is going to have to change to work tomorrow, OK? And, so, we want to put in place a structure that evolves so that as technology as different ways of hacking things evolve that our networks can evolve, too.</p><p>But cyber security is an essential component of what we do and a very important thing. And it's also something that you and I as citizens and everybody watching this needs to think about because the way in which it starts is it normally comes in through somebody doing something and that gives somebody access. So we need to have good hygiene ourselves.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And as you know the problem with that kind of attack, is you don't know where it's coming from. It's not like a nation state. An attack through the Internet, you can't necessarily, because they're so ingenious about where they go from A to Z.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: You can do some good inferences, but yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So finally there is this. There is this debate that goes on between security and privacy. Where are you on that and where is the balance?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Clearly, the two relate. Clearly we're existing in a world where the capital asset of the 21st century is information. And it ends up being information about you and me. And you and I --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Some people collect that as a matter of business and then sell it.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: And you and I -- correct. You and I ought to have a voice in the collection of information about us. You know, nothing about me without me, is what the expression is. And so, this is a very important thing and this is something that's on our agenda as well.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That's interesting because that's about the future. It's on your agenda meaning what?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: So you will see us -- I've told the Congress and others that you will see us within the next several months, addressing the question of privacy of those who provide the networks -- the privacy practices of those who provide the network services and how it affects you and me.</p><p>In other words, do I know what information's being collected? Do I have a voice in whether or not that's going to be used in one way or another? And those are two very important baseline rights that individuals ought to have.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The other thing that's interesting to me is that these companies are all mostly out in Silicon Valley. Many of them, you know, particularly the founding ones there -- Microsoft, Apple, Amazon -- all out from the West Coast from either Seattle or Silicon Valley. And for a long time they said to the government, leave us alone -- almost libertarian, right?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Now it is said that they have as intense lobbying effort in Washington as anybody. Is that fair?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: There is nothing in the corporate culture that argues against eventually saying how does policy affect what I do in my business? And so what we at the FCC do is do we get lobbied by Google? Yes. Do we get lobbied by AT&amp;T? Yes.</p><p>So what our challenge is how do you find the common good? I mean the interesting thing you said a minute ago, you talked about earlier in my career that I had been an advocate for various businesses.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: And the way you tend -- things tend to work in an advocacy role is you come in and you say, unless you do this my way, it's going to be the end of western civilization as we know it. And the other side comes in and says exactly the same thing.</p><p>And the job of people like me and my colleagues at the commission is to say, OK, where is it -- I understand why this position is good for them, and I understand why this is good for them -- where is the solution that has the common good in it? You know, what we call public interest, but the public interest is vague.</p><p>What's the common good? How can you structure things so that, again -- and you come back to basic principles like competition. How do you make sure that that which serves the common good survives?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But also the common good is to stimulate innovation to push forward.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Absolutely. Then again, that's why we wanted permissionless innovation with the open Internet. We didn't want the Internet to get choked down so that somebody else was deciding what two guys, and a dog in a garage came up with and whether you and I were going to get to see it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Is this the best job of your life?</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Yes, I'm having a great time. I'm a really fortunate person.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Thanks for coming.</p><p>TOM WHEELER: Thanks -- Charlie.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p>Back in a moment. Stay with us.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: <person><nameText>Meg Whitman </nameText></person>is here. She has been CEO of Hewlett Packard since 2011. The technology icon was created more than 75 years ago in a Palo Alto garage. For decades it led in the business of selling computers and printers. The growth of enterprise services has forced HP to evolve. The company's reinvented itself with aspirations to capitalize in both the PC and networking solutions arena.</p><p>On Sunday HP split into two separate pieces: Hewlett Packard Enterprise will primarily sell computer service, data storage and consulting servings. HP, Inc. will largely consist of personal computers and printers.</p><p>I'm pleased to have <person><nameText>Meg Whitman </nameText></person>back on this program. Welcome.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Thank you very much.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: it's great to have you here.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Happy to be here.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is the ad that was in yesterday's paper and today's paper. \"The company that started Silicon Valley is making history again.\"</p><p>I want to talk about how you're going to make history. But tell me what happened to Hewlett Packard. How did the company that Bill Hewlett and David Packard create that was the admiration of the world and certainly the Valley, the company that in terms of values, in terms of culture, in terms of success was looked on with huge admiration?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. The last decade was a tough decade. And I would actually chalk it up to too much turnover at the CEO level. CEOs -- when you have different CEOs who have different strategies -- it's very hard on a company particularly one as large as HP.</p><p>And so I can now see as we're turning the corner with people who have been in role three or four years, you're starting to see it gel again. So I think the root of the challenge was in many ways too many CEOs in too short a period of a time.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And did it therefore miss huge opportunities that others saw?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Sure, absolutely it did. You know, mobile phones was an opportunity that HP missed and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, yes, certainly many others. But, you know, the technology business is incredibly dynamic, and it's hard to catch every wave. And obviously the bigger you are, the more challenging it is -- right. I mean bigger companies just don't move quite as fast as smaller companies. So part of the separation is about being more nimble and more focused on two entirely different markets so that HP cannot miss the trends and, in fact, can invent the trends.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So now you come along.</p><p>How did they get you to do this? Because you had had a remarkable career - -</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You'd even made a venture into politics which you said was a great learning experience even though you lost.</p><p>You learned how to communicate, learn the demands of the modern world in terms of what we expect from people in the public eye whether it's a CEO or an aspirant to be governor of California. You were on the board at HP.</p><p>That's been a board that's often been rancorous.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And they convinced you to take over as CEO.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, I'll tell you how it happened because I had no intention of being the CEO. So I lost the governor's race in the fall of 2010. And I was trying to decide what I was going to do. I was working on our family foundation and I was sort of searching for the next thing.</p><p>And it's very difficult when you lose these elections. As an aside, we should be really grateful for people who run because it's really tough when you lose because it's like a personal referendum in some ways.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. So did you -- was it depressing for you?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It was very hard. If you think about it, when you're part of a company, you know, there's you and the company. When you run for public office, it's a vote on you.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You felt rejected.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: You feel rejected. I mean it's very challenging.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Did you question your own abilities at all?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Sure you think gosh, you know, could have, would have, should have, you know, that whole thing.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: But, so it's February and I'm at home one afternoon watching an afternoon daytime talk show at 4:00. And my husband who is a neurosurgeon comes home early from work. He walks in and he sees me in the family room at 4:00 in the afternoon watching an afternoon talk show and he goes oh, this is really not good. This is really not good. You've got to pull your socks up and you've got to figure out what you're going to do.</p><p>Just as if on cue that afternoon I got a call from an HP board member, Marc Andreessen --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: -- who said we're looking for some new board members for HP, you would be perfect. It will be so much fun. We'll sit on the tech committee. And, you know, it's just in the neighborhood and it's a chance to help reinvent a Silicon Valley icon.</p><p>I said, this is great, what could go wrong? 12 minutes from my house.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But you're a board member. That's all you are.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: That's right. But I'm thinking what could go wrong. Twelve minutes from my house, it will be fun.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And it became quite apparent soon that the company had a lot of challenges and then of course, we as the board had the do the most difficult thing that a board does, which is remove the CEO. That was in some ways the easy thing.</p><p>The next was who's going to run HP and the board sort of looked at me and I said, oh, no, no, no. We are definitely not doing this. We are definitely not doing this.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Been there, done that.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. But over time, I began to feel -- you know, it matters what happens to HP. HP is important to California. It's important, I would argue, to the tech industry and the United States and important globally. We are often the largest private employer in many countries in which we do business.</p><p>So ultimately, I decided, OK, I'll see -- we'll do the best I can and I will see if I can be helpful here.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Well, they made the argument you were on a plane ride back from somewhere.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. We had a board meeting on the East Coast. And on the way back a number of them really were very persuasive and said we need you to do this. It's an opportunity to make a big change to a big company that's important and struggling. And the scale was interesting to me.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So the challenge was interesting and the scale in which they existed was interesting.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. Exactly. And you know me well enough to know I love a challenge. And so they hooked me on the challenge.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. And so tell me, when you got there, you had seen it up close as a member of the board.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But then you had to get into the weeds of this company.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What did you find?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: So I found a very proud company with incredible founder DNA. The a-ha here is -- and this is great news for any founder that's watching your program -- it is really hard to kill founder DNA. And for HP, that was a very good thing because the core of this company through all the acquisitions and all the board drama was around innovation and focus on customers.</p><p>And so I made the decision let's do more of what we do well and then we'll work on the to-do list of things that need to be fixed. And there were a number of things that need to be fixed. But I went right to innovation, right to the customer.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But was it looking at making a decision about what product lines you should have?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, the first decision I made -- remember my predecessor had said maybe they should spin off the PC business. Not PCs and printers but just PCs. So I put together a 60-day study and said we can't do this right now. We can't afford to build another brand.</p><p>And because printing was going to stay with the big company we would have to build a new brand for the PC company. The company wasn't in shape to split. As it turns out, and I know this now first hand, when you separate a company of this size and scale, everything from IT to legal entities to tax ID codes to all kinds of things, you have to be strong to do it. And I don't think we would have been able to pull it off back then.</p><p>So I made the decision, let's stay together. Let's rebuild the company. Let's strengthen the company. Let's reconnect with partners and customers. Let's, you know, focus on making this company as great as we can with the businesses that we are in.</p><p>And it's been quite a turnaround journey. I mean we went from almost $12 billion of debt on the operating company to a positive net cash on the operating company. We really changed that much of the leadership team. We reignited the innovation engine to capitalize on the trends and the market like all flash array, a modern kind of storage.</p><p>And we revamped in many ways the whole company. And then we said how do we accelerate into this turnaround? And we decided, the board and I, to separate into two Fortune 50 companies. Can you imagine? There's two Fortune 50 --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Separate, they're both within the top 50.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It's amazing.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It is amazing. And so you make this distinction between HP, Inc. and --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Hewlett Packard Enterprise.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I mean everybody -- there are a lot of people getting in the enterprise business. I mean from IBM to Amazon to Hewlett Packard at different levels.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why did you think you could win at that business?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, first of all, HP, Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are really quite different businesses.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I know.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: In the classic case, you know -- with different customers, different competitors, different cost structure --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But the same thing is true with Amazon in terms of the retail business and their enterprise business.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. But we had a company that needed to reinvent itself again. And we just though, you know what, let's separate these into two different companies so we can focus on these two most important markets. Because HP Inc. has one-third of their business is to consumers. You can go buy an HP printer at Staples or wherever. You can go buy an HP PC someplace.</p><p>And so we thought, let's get to really focus on the enterprise and what we can do for the IT professionals in small to medium to big companies and really help them do a number of things that are very top of mind. I mean every CIO now is thinking, I have a legacy IT infrastructure. I've got to get to the new world order. I've got to get to the new style of IT, the cloud. I've got to be more agile.</p><p>And we are uniquely suited to help companies on that transformation journey because those big companies, they've got to keep running their legacy IT systems while they get to the --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So who are you going to serve? Who are your customers?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Largely CIOs and VP of Ops, VP of Apps, VP of VAP, you know, operations for anywhere from small to very large companies. Remember we have a very robust channel that helps serve our customers. So we call them value-added resellers. They will serve the small to medium size customers with our products and services and software. And then we sell direct to the biggest customers.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why did you decide to be the CEO of the enterprise?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. And someone asked me that question because in some ways it would have been more natural for me to go to the part with the consumer because I'm a consumer technologist really. But I had a great executive named Dion Weisler (ph) who really knew the PC business. He'd run PCs and printers in Asia-Pacific for us. We brought him back. He was doing a great job running PCs and printers at corporate.</p><p>And I said, you're fantastic for this job. He's got a lot of runway. He's a young man. And I said I'll take the enterprise side. There's more work to do. And I've actually become quite enamored with the enterprise side. Get back to the challenge and learning -- I had to learn a lot about the enterprise side.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why have you become enamored?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: You know, there -- I love disruption and I love the opportunity that creates. And think about what our business has been through -- the industry. From mainframe to client servers, you know, PCs; from client server to Web 1.0 where I had a front seat at the revolution at eBay; from the first generation of the Internet to web services.</p><p>Now we're on the cusp of another huge change about what's possible for IT at a large company.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And that's because of the Cloud? What is it?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It's because of the Cloud. It's because of the way applications are now written.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right. When you were back at Princeton did you imagine that you would be a corporate manager?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: No.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What did you think you were going to be?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, I went to Princeton as a pre-med.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I know. I know. Is that where you met your husband?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: No, I actually met -- he was at Harvard Medical School when I was at Harvard Business School. But, you know, I took a lot of science courses a Princeton for which I am deeply grateful but ultimately decided that there was a better fit for me in business. And, you know, as a 21- year-old, what did I know? Not much.</p><p>But I sold advertising for a magazine at Princeton and I thought selling advertising, business, that's sort of alike, you know, and then I applied to Harvard Business School.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Was it at Bane that you walked into the office of the CEO and said to him let me tell you what's wrong with the way you're running your business? You have no idea of how the employees think about you.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, I did. Can you imagine that I did that?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I can.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I don't know what I was thinking. I was young and naive and enthusiastic. But Tom Tierney was his name who was the managing director - -</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: He thanked you for doing this.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: He did and he was an incredible mentor to me. In fact, he came on the board of eBay and was a big -- he might be one of the best strategists in America today, business strategist. And he was a huge help to me at Bane and actually made an enormous difference to us.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: but what's the philosophy here that people need -- somebody come in to the door and say this is what you're not doing and this is what you don't perceive and this is an intervention moment?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Well, I think sometimes and I think all of us are guilty of this at one time or another is, you begin to drink your own Kool- Aid and you don't see yourself and your leadership style as it really is. And sometimes you need a friend or someone who works for you or a colleague to say do you see what you're doing here? Do you see what you are doing?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Was it the right idea to run for governor? Was that a mistake? Did somebody not come in to you and say Meg, this is a different game?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is a political game?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: They did say that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And why did you ignore that?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I think for a couple of reasons. One I saw the state that I loved, the state that had been my home for nearly 30 years was in real trouble. You might recall we had a huge budget deficit. We had a massive unfunded pension liability which by the way the state still has. Our education system had gone from number one in the country in the 50s to number 48 or 49 in, you know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- and others were --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I mean and you just --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: At the university level.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: -- yes and you have all kinds of challenges. I said maybe I can apply some of what I learned in my career both at eBay and other places to help solve some these problems. So I dove in with 100 percent of my effort, and I worked at it very had for almost two and a half years.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But were you prepared to spend your own money as you are as Donald Trump is spending his own money?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I was prepared to do that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You spent a lot of your money.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I did. And I thought, you know, that -- and I also raised a lot of money. So I had a lot of support from people around the state, but I did spend some of my own money because it was important. I had to learn a lot, right. You know, I had to learn water policy. I had to learn education policy and it was an experience of a lifetime, Charlie.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: How's Governor Brown doing?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Listen, he's raised taxes, obviously, on a number of folks. The budget deficit is more in line than it was. It's much smaller than it was. Silicon Valley has been a big help to that, right. Silicon Valley right now is the economic engine of California.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. And it's the place that every foreign head of state wants to go because they want to create their own Silicon Valley.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Silicon Valley -- exactly.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Xi Jinping went from Seattle, Washington before he went to Washington, D.C.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. Exactly. Because everyone loves this notion of how do you -- how could you possibly create Silicon Valley in China and --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Can you? Or is that something you could do with America's culture?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I don't know. It's really hard -- Charlie. It's alchemy, almost. It's the -- you have to have a great company like Hewlett-Packard which was the founder of Silicon Valley, a fantastic university or universities -- Stanford being the anchor, but Berkeley, Santa Clara, you know, U.C. Santa Cruz are all part of that ecosystem now. And then you have to have that venture capital where risk is rewarded.</p><p>And so it's -- the more entrepreneurs you have, the more venture capital that's attracted, the more great companies that start. And you start a positive -- it's almost an ecosystem and it's very hard to create.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Do you worry that somehow there is the seed within the tech world today for overheating and a bubble that would burst?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Sure, I do. I do. I mean we lived through -- when I was at eBay, we lived through the 2001 bubble that burst. Frankly, eBay was fine because we had real revenues and real profits. And while our market cap went down a bit, we just kept on kept on going. But you know, you see a lot of very high multiples, young companies today. And so I worry about it.</p><p>And you've seen a pullback actually in the last six to eight weeks. You've seen a pullback in the valuation of some of these younger companies. So the multiples have gone down -- you know, we'll see. I think the goodness is there is enough people who lived through 2001 who know what can happen.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Who raised the questions?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: But there is a whole generation that didn't live through 2001 and sometimes you have to have -- you know, your question about running for governor -- you have to be a product of your experiences.</p><p>And by the way, I think I'm a better CEO because I ran.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Because you understand the public dimension.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I understand the public dimension but also I learned a lot about communicating with large groups of people. And as it turned out by complete coincidence, when I came to HP, it happened to be about the same size as the government of California. And what I learned about communicating in politics is -- and I bet you know this -- it is not always about the left brain, the facts and the figures and all of this. It is about the emotion, the stories you tell and how you connect.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Absolutely. It's the emotional level that you connect and then people are there. If you connect on the emotional level then they're open to your arguments.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. And I don't think I completely understood that because when you grow a big business you are trained to be very analytical. I mean can you imagine being the CEO of a public company, going in front of your investors and telling them stories? I mean you would be thrown out on your ear. They want to know the numbers. They want to know the return on investment capital.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And so we're trained --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: If you say, let me tell you my narrative they say, what's your bottom line?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: They feel like excuse me. And so I was a very left-brained, trained individual, we all are. And, so, I had to learn a lot about communication. And so when I came to HP I learned about that and I did quite a different style of communication when I was trying to rally the whole company and the importance of symbolic value.</p><p>I'll tell you a story about Jerry Brown and this is a story I admire him. When the state was in tremendous financial difficulty, he said you know what we're going to do. We're going to take the cell phones away from all the civil servants in the state of California. I remember thinking, OK, that's all very interesting but it is 0.01 percent of the budget.</p><p>It wasn't about the money. It was about the symbol and symbolism and the story he was telling which was he's going to be tougher on the budget.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- and demand sacrifice.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. If you had asked the man on the street, you know, how do you think Jerry Brown is doing with the budget? He would have said doing great, taking away the cell phones from those civil servants.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It was a symbolic act --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: that connected and resonated.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And so I learned while -- when I watched him. And so when I came to HP, I said what's a symbolic act that I can do that will communicate to the company about why this is different. So the very first thing we did we tore town the executive parking lot and the barbed wire that surrounded the executive parking lot and I moved the entire leadership team to cubicles out of their wooden offices.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: They're no longer behind closed doors or whatever?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: We were out in the open just like everybody else. And we didn't write about that. We didn't make a publicity statement. 250,000 -- 300,000 HP people knew that within about 24 hours. And that made a statement.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Breaking down the barriers between --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And I learned that from running for office.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- employer and employee.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You are supporting Governor Christie.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I am.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I know Governor Christie quite well and I have admired what he has been able to do as a Republican governor in a blue state with a Democratically-controlled legislature. And my view is we have to have people who have learned to reach across the aisle and get things done. And he hasn't gotten --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That's what's needed in Washington, you're suggesting?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I think that's what's needed in Washington because I think that it's likely that the president will be one party and the congress will be of another. And so he didn't get everything he wanted in New Jersey but sometimes in politics perfect is the enemy of really pretty good.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: How do you ascertain how he's doing?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, he's working very hard. And I think he is a fantastic retail politician. You know when we were talking about how you reach in and connect? No one's better than Chris Christie at reaching in and connecting with people. When people interact with him, they feel like they know him and they understand his heart.</p><p>And so he's been putting a lot of shoe leather into Iowa, into Nevada, into New Hampshire and I think he's making progress. You can see him begin to inch up at the polls, you know. His favorables are turning. So I'm optimistic. But it's a tough, tough slog. But I think he's doing everything he knows how to do and I admire him a lot for doing it.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Look at where we are in terms of technology. What's next if you're asked?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: We're still at the beginning of the mobile revolution. That sounds crazy because we've all had mobile phones for a long time but pretty soon almost everyone on the planet may have a mobile phone and it's changing every element of life and I think we're at the beginning of that impact not at the end.</p><p>And you think about how people use their phone in developing countries to, you know, trade commodities, to you know, sell their goods on the Internet to countries around the world. I mean it's really phenomenal.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And it gives people in faraway places access to all kinds of information.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It does and it has a political, you know, undercurrent as well. So I think we're at the beginning of that revolution.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- which includes social media.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, social media is its home. Its first home really in many ways today is on your mobile. Yes, you know, Facebook was invented for the desktop but now there's more people who access Facebook on their mobile than on their desktop.</p><p>So I just think you're at the beginning of a tremendous revolution. When you think about a PC, per se, think about it, what you have in your hand is more powerful than a PC was ten years ago, it's maybe more powerful than a PC was five years ago. Think about what you can do on your mobile, what you can do on your tablet.</p><p>Now, when you've got a lot of work to do, you really do want a full-fledged PC, but I think we're at the beginning of that revolution.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Is there a lesson to be learned from what Lou Gerstner did at IBM?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. So I read his book with great interest as you will recall it was called \"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance\". He said when he came to IBM at the end of his book he said when I came to IBM I thought culture was important. When I left IBM, he said I thought culture maybe was the only thing that's important. And I can see exactly what he means.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why does it take so hard to learn that? I mean --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: You know, because you think that other things can make a difference, but in the end when you run these big-scale operations, people on the frontlines, the sales person in New York for the server business has to know what to do, has to know what the ethics and the value and the ethos of the company is. And people have to -- it cannot be a command and control environment. People have to know what to do on the front lines. And how do they know what to do? It's not through policy and procedures and handbooks, it's through the culture.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What did you learn from Steve Jobs at Apple, going back to a company that was on his --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Steve Jobs may well be the genius in business of my generation. I mean this guy was amazingly creative, and the ability to invent category.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The company was near bankruptcy and now the largest company in the world.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It's amazing. I mean it's the biggest turnaround if you will that I've ever seen in my career. And they continue to amaze. And kudos to Tim Cook for being able to continue that legacy because it's not easy to follow Steve Jobs.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why was it a mistake for Dell to buy EMC? That's what you said to your employees. They gave you guys an opportunity.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, exactly.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Figuring out how to put cultures together and all that and you guys would go out there and start innovating.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. So listen it's a fascinating time in history because two companies who are quite similar in many ways, HP was a larger company than Dell, but we were in largely the same businesses. We have taken took diametrically opposed strategies with the same set of facts. Right? So we decided --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What were the facts?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, the industry and incredible tectonic plate shifts from, if you will, the old style of IT to the next generation. One of these inflection points for our industry where a lot of the old proud companies were under pressure. Our strategy was de-lever the balance sheet so you have no debt on the operating company, in fact you have cash on the operating company.</p><p>Lean in to new technology like three par, like our networking business, like Cloud. Make sure we pivoted to solution selling with our enterprise services business and really focus on revenue growth.</p><p>And their strategy was lever up the balance sheet, put old technology together, take out the costs and then try to make your way that way. I mean two diametrically opposed strategies.</p><p>Listen, I'm going to vote for Hewlett Packard Enterprise all day long because I think fast is important, speed is important where we live. And I'll tell you -- they have a year to close the deal and another year to integrate. And we have an opportunity I think to explain to customers our solutions and why we are, you know, a stable, great company to do business with.</p><p>And it is pretty funny, Charlie, because you think back in 2011 we looked pretty unstable, right?</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Of course.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And now we're looking like the paragon of stability.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Was than when -- when did Fiorina leave?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Much earlier. I think 2005 --</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You went through her then you went through before that --</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Right. I think Carly left in 2005, 2006 -- something like that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So has she taken an unfair hit or is it simply a product of she happened to be not the right person at the right time for Hewlett Packard?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: So listen, politics is tough, right. We covered this. I mean it is tough. You've got to have a rhinoceros skin, and people will try to take you on. I would like to say no good deed goes unpunished. And I said before in public, I think the Compaq acquisition was the right thing. We have the position that we have today in PCs and in servers thank you to the Compaq acquisition.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: She drove that.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And she drove that. And she drove that.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And it was right thing?</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I think it was the right thing. With 20/20 hindsight looking back, I'm glad we have the position that we have in those two businesses because fundamentally they are the bedrock now of HP, Inc. and Hewlett Packard enterprises.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: When you buy a business, I mean you see people -- they'll buy company just to get the CEO -- to get the executive talent.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Yes. In Silicon Valley, they're called acqui-hires, you know, acquisition of hires.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right, right. Acqui-hire.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: An acqui-hire. People would say for the most part these big tech acquisitions are very tough to pull off and usually there is a challenge before, you know, the sun rises again. So, you know, listen I think we're super well-prepared in these two companies to go own innovate, deliver for customers in a changing world, while we're not trying to integrate another company. We're not trying to, you know, fundamentally remake the sales force and take out hundreds of millions of dollars of cost.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Thank you for coming.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Great to see you.</p><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Great to see you again. Thank you -- Charlie.</p><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: <person><nameText>Meg Whitman.</nameText></person></p><p>Thank you for joining us. See you next time.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 <person><nameText>Charlie Rose </nameText></person>Inc. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

And there were a number of things that need to be fixed.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Tom Wheeler and <person><nameText>Meg Whitman, </nameText></person>when we continue.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: From our studios in New York City, this is <person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE.</nameText></person></p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Tom Wheeler is here. He is chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. The agency adopted net neutrality rules earlier this year. The new regulations treat Internet service as a public utility. The commissioner has also been active in reviewing media and telecommunications mergers.</p><p/><p>This summer it approved AT&amp;T's takeover of DirecTV which created the largest television distributor in the United States. Next year the FCC will hold an auction to coordinate the sale of television air waves.</p><p/><p>For all those reasons I'm pleased to have Chairman Tom Wheeler at this table for the first time. It seems like I've known him for 100 years. It's a pleasure to have you.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Charlie -- thank you. It's great to be here.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And we had your favorite Ohio State coach here the other day and --</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: From the Ohio State University.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: From the Ohio State University. My impression is they have no bigger or stronger fan than you.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: I think that's a true statement.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. And you used to work with Woody Hayes.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Yes, way back when, when I was in graduate school I had the privilege of being able to rub shoulders with Coach Hayes and some of the things he was doing in the state. He was a great --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I would imagine you had lots to talk about military history and all the things that he taught there.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Yes. And three yards and a cloud of dust -- that's the way he ran. You know, three things can -- why don't you pass coach? Three things can happen and two of them were bad.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So what can happen to the FCC?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, you know, Charlie we're sitting at a really exciting time in history if you stop and think about it. The most important external force in our daily lives are the networks that connect us, and we at the FCC get the privilege to be involved in the evolution of those networks into the digital era, whether it's broadcasting or cable or satellite or telephone networks or the Internet. That's our jurisdiction.</p><p/><p>It's about a sixth of the economy that we get a chance to participate with as they're evolving from the old analog world to the new digital world.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And so -- but what do you do? I mean you obviously hear important arguments and make rulings on them.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, you know, the really interesting thing about this job is that the statute was written in 1934. It was updated in 1996. And even from 1996, a lot has changed. So the challenge that we have is to say, OK, let's look at the basic four corners that the Congress has laid down and said this is what we think is in the public interest, and then make interpretations as to how that statutory responsibility works in the new digital world.</p><p/><p>And so we're dealing with everything from mergers to competitive issues and how do you make sure that there is competition in these markets? How do you make sure that there is consumer protection? How do you make sure that national security is protected? So it's a very broad palette that we have to work with.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is what predecessor Michael Powell, president of the National Cable Communications Association and the chairman of the FCC in the Bush administration said quote, \"The commission has breathed new life into the decayed telephone regulatory model and applied it to the most dynamic free wheeling and innovative platform in history.\"</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, I agree totally with him. The Internet is the most dynamic and free wheeling platform in history.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: It's the most powerful and pervasive platform in history.</p><p/><p>I disagree entirely with him because on his other part because, basically, what the cable industry and the telephone industry and those who provide Internet service, last-mile service, have been saying is, oh, leave us alone, leave us alone.</p><p/><p>What we did was we said, wait a minute -- there is a basic responsibility that people who are providing Internet service have to make sure that consumers have unfettered access to the content they want to go to on the web and that those who are creating content have unfettered access to consumers, and that's some basic things.</p><p/><p>There should be no blocking. You should not be able to say you can get through when you can't. There should be no throttling. You shouldn't be able to say, well, your service, I'm not going to allow it to go as fast as another service. There should be no paid prioritization. You shouldn't be able to say well, you're a fast lane and you're a slow lane, because you're paying me more.</p><p/><p>And then what you need to have in place is I think the thing that they're really most concerned about and that is you need to have a referee on the field. We were talking about Woody Hayes and Urban Meyer a minute ago.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: You need to have a set of rules that says is this just unreasonable and you need to have somebody who can throw the flag if it isn't. We don't know what the Internet is going to become five years from now. I mean think back five years and where we are today. We had no idea it would end up today. What we don't want to have happen as a regulatory agency is to thwart innovation. But at the same point in time, we don't want those who are --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That's one of the arguments they made.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: But the other part is we don't want people who are running the networks to have to be the ones who provide permission for innovators and entrepreneurs to provide new services. So it's the concept of permissionless innovation and making sure that there is somebody to say does this make sense? Is this just and reasonable?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: OK. But their argument is that you inhibit innovation. That's where they --</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: But I think that that is easily refuted by you look at the tremendous growth in investment that has taken place in entrepreneurial activities since we put the rules in place. You look at how the industry, the cable industry, the telephone industry, the wireless industry have unprecedented levels of investment since we put the rules in place. I mean the network itself is growing and those who serve the network is growing since we put in the rules.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So if you make a huge capital investment to provide the fastest Internet service somewhere, you now simply have to make that available to everybody.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Correct.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: When John Oliver was on this program he talked about the story of someone with your experience becoming the FCC chairman. You have said that experience provided you with all that was necessary to do a good job.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Absolutely.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: He said, why would we let someone who's been trying to lobby the FCC become the person who chairs the FCC? Is that some inherent conflict?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, I think that, you know, if you go back and you look -- and, Charlie, I ran the Cable Television Association when it was an up and coming industry being and fighting for its survival. I ran the cellular industry, you know, a dozen years ago when it was an entirely different business.</p><p/><p>I've started my own businesses. I have been a partner to venture capital firm helping start businesses. So I come to this job with an understanding of both business and policy and how it works with the people that we regulate. So I actually think I come with a leg up.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What do you hope you accomplish while you're chairman of the FCC? You addressed net neutrality. You have some mergers you have addressed.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: At the core, it is competition, you know. I mean the consumer's best friend is a competitive market, and our broadband market isn't as competitive as it could be. So, one of the reasons that you have an open Internet rule is to increase competition.</p><p/><p>One of the reasons that we turned down the Comcast merger was to increase competition. One of the reasons that we have encouraged -- we pre-empted states -- let me just say -- one of the things the big providers were doing were going to state legislatures and getting them to pass laws that prohibited cities from building a competitive product if their people wanted them to. And we said no. That's anti-competitive and so we pre- empted that.</p><p/><p>And we have a whole series of actions that are saying how do we increase competition? You know, the joke around the commission is that my mantra is competition, competition, competition, which is normally said \"competition- competition-competition\". And that's the goal that we're working on.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So let me just jump ahead to some mergers. So the Comcast merger you said does not increase competition.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: If those two giants get together, Time Warner and Comcast --</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Right. So we turned that down.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You turned that down. But when AT&amp;T came along, buying DirecTV, a satellite company -- you said that's fine.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Because we put in the terms and conditions of that agreement specific pro competitive activities. For instance, AT&amp;T is required to bring fiber service -- high-speed fiber service to 12.5 million new American homes. That's a 40 percent increase in the number of homes reached by fiber. And guess who they're --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: They'll get faster service.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: They'll get faster service. And guess who they're competing with for that? The cable companies -- OK. So that was a key part of that. We put in there some other rules to make sure that there was pro competition coming out of it.</p><p/><p>Here's the key statistic -- 83 percent of Americans can access high-speed broadband service.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: 83 percent?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: 83 percent.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: But two-thirds of those can get it from only one company. So the goal is how do you facilitate competition? Because competition drives prices down, competition incentivizes better service, competition is a consumer's friend with innovation.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Speaking of mergers -- trying to understand how you approach these and how you make a judgment about competition, there was a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Right, and we actively discouraged that, that four wireless carriers is a good and vibrant market, and if you were to take number three and number four and allow them to merge to go to three, that would have hurt --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But would it have made them stronger and therefore be more competitive because there is a difference.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: But look at what's happened --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: there is a difference between those four. And if three and four could combine and therefore be more competitive with one and two, why isn't at that a good idea?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Look at what T-Mobile has done since we didn't allow them to merge.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What have they done.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: And they have become the most innovative, the most price- competitive, and they're forcing the market to respond to them, including Sprint respond to them with good old American competition. That's what we were trying to stand for.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: OK. Let me talk about something else you wrote. You said \"We need to continue looking to the future and act now to facilitate the fifth generation of mobile technology.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Right. Right.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What is that? So we're right now going through the fourth generation of mobile technology that you've seen in the ads called LTE.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right. And we're now -- we're heading towards the fifth generation. The fifth generation is going to be a new level of service. It will be different from what you're used to right now. It will be the enabler of what they call the Internet of things.</p><p/><p>You know, by 2020, there are going to be 50 billion connected things, everything from your washing machine to, you know, your trash can.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: From your cell phone -- from your smart phone, you can run everything?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: You can run everything and they will talk to each other and you won't even know it. But you need to have an infrastructure that has what the technologists call very low latency which means that they interact real quickly and you need to have new spectrum that that works over.</p><p/><p>So I leave for instance from this to go to Geneva where we're engaged in international negotiations to make sure that we have spectrum that is harmonized around the world for the next generation.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: We have not had that?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: No, we always -- we have that but --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: No, we have not had harmonization with the rest of the world in some cases -- have we?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, you know, in some cases but for the most part it's harmonized and because it's important. That's how you get to drive down the cost of infrastructure and the insets.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: OK.</p><p/><p>I'm sure you thought of this and done this. If you go to Korea, or go to Japan --</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- everybody says they're so far ahead of us in terms of broadband and its possibilities and its speed and what it's doing. Is that true?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: They have very innovative ideas but we're the world leader in 4G technology. There are more -- 98 percent of the American population now has access to an LTE wireless signal and a competitive LTE wireless signal. You look at Europe, you look at Asia, nobody has those kinds of statistics like we do.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Is the television business as we know it healthy?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: I think the television business is in the process of evolving.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: To what?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: So it used to be that there were special networks for special kinds of video. You had the movie networks, if you will -- the theaters, OK, for movies. Then you had the television networks, and really they never really meshed with each other.</p><p/><p>Now you have the digital world in which everything is the same in terms of being digitized and can be distributed over a common network. And that challenges everybody to evolve. And I think the television industry is evolving just like everybody else is evolving.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: To what though?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: To a broadband video business is one.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Exactly. Yes, right.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: And -- but I also think --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It's a content company.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: But I also think that there is going to be a fine future for broadcast -- traditional broadcast television. But I think it will also be redefined.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What is that future?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: I think continuing to provide local service, continuing to be a way that in a local market you can reach all of the people at one time. But that content continues to sector markets and slice them down and that ends up being over on the Internet.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You've called next year's auction of wireless air waves quote, \"a once in a lifetime opportunity\". Define what a once in a lifetime opportunity is.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Well, there is going to be one auction. But let's talk about what that auction is. So we were talking a minute ago about wireless. There is huge demand for the spectrum, the air waves that wireless rides on. And we have to look at the limited amount of spectrum that is available and say is it put to its best purpose?</p><p/><p>So what we're doing is we're going to run an auction next year, starts March of next year that's a two-sided market. First time it's ever been tried, where we will turn to broadcasters and say, if you want to sell us your air waves, we will buy them, then we repackage them so that they are in a format that works for wireless, and we turn around to the mobile companies and say, OK, now you buy them. Nobody --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You bid on them.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Nobody has ever tried. You bid on them and pay the government. And nobody has ever tried that. But that's really -- it is letting the market work to put spectrum to its highest and best use. And it's going to be ground-breaking, and I think it will be the future of how --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: How will you mark success?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: We'll mark success by whether new spectrum gets opened, you know. I mean there will be multiples tens of billions of dollars that will change hands here, but I think the key is, is there new spectrum that is going to be able to be repurposed for 21st century applications in the mobile world?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Where -- back to my question about South Korea and Japan and Europe -- you know, what can we learn by what's going on around the world?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Oh, that's a great question because the world is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. And one of the things that the Internet has done is to make us all share common experiences.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It changed time and distance.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Totally. I mean it's the death of distance. There is no such thing as distance.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Go ahead.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: So I think that we have been the world leaders in innovation, in digital activity because we had the home field advantage of the Internet starting here. And we want to make sure that that continues, and that's both for wired and for wireless. There are some great things as you point out that are happening in Japan and that are happening in Korea and China and elsewhere. But I think that we need to make sure that we are tending to our knitting, making sure that we have the environment.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I assume your argument is that we have to create an environment for innovation so that whatever the lead we got from being a founder, an initiator will continue.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: That's what we mean by permissionless innovation. That's why open Internet is so important, Charlie, because we have to create an environment where this wonderful thing called the Internet which just allows everybody to reach the world overnight, where there aren't gatekeepers there. Because if there's somebody who is saying, no, I'm not so sure or you pay me to get on or things like this, then we're going to inhibit innovation, and innovation is the driver of this economy.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Can China innovate?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: I think that they clearly are making efforts to do that. I think they're what you might call fast followers at this point in time, but they're looking to say how can we take this fifth generation and make it work to our advantage?</p><p/><p>So one of the things we've done at the FCC is we've said that we want to be out front in allocating spectrum so that first in the world spectrum that can be used for fifth generation is here in the United States. And that we want to be allowing flexible use of that spectrum so it's not some bureaucrat in Washington like me making the decision as how it gets used. It's the people who are innovating. It's the people who are going to try the new ideas who are making those decisions, and that is exactly the formula that made us the world leader in fourth generation. And I think it will work for fifth generation, too.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: One risk people see is the possibilities of sabotage of undersea cables. That's an issue for you?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: It's the new style of wiretapping, isn't that right?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. But I think we have to understand that networks have always been attack paths -- I don't care whether it's a road network or a sea network or whatever -- it's the way people have mounted attacks. We have a new network in the 21st century. It would be naive to say that somebody's not going to do it.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: To say someone would not figure out how they could do that.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: That's right. That's right.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And then we have the possibilities -- my friend Ted Koppel has a book out which is called \"Lights Out\" --</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- which is about the capacity to do huge damage to America and its economy, you know, by attacking the Internet.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The electric grid.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: We've taken that real seriously. I mean if we have responsibility for public safety and the functioning of our networks, then we need to make sure that we are doing the right kind of cyber hygiene, if you will.</p><p/><p>So what we did was we brought the experts, including the network companies, together and said, let's agree on a common set of standards for hygiene that you will have in your network. Then let's have a regular visit to your network to find out what's the experience you're having. A -- are you doing it, and B -- is it working?</p><p/><p>Because the thing we can absolutely guarantee is that what works today is going to have to change to work tomorrow, OK? And, so, we want to put in place a structure that evolves so that as technology as different ways of hacking things evolve that our networks can evolve, too.</p><p/><p>But cyber security is an essential component of what we do and a very important thing. And it's also something that you and I as citizens and everybody watching this needs to think about because the way in which it starts is it normally comes in through somebody doing something and that gives somebody access. So we need to have good hygiene ourselves.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And as you know the problem with that kind of attack, is you don't know where it's coming from. It's not like a nation state. An attack through the Internet, you can't necessarily, because they're so ingenious about where they go from A to Z.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: You can do some good inferences, but yes.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So finally there is this. There is this debate that goes on between security and privacy. Where are you on that and where is the balance?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Clearly, the two relate. Clearly we're existing in a world where the capital asset of the 21st century is information. And it ends up being information about you and me. And you and I --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Some people collect that as a matter of business and then sell it.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: And you and I -- correct. You and I ought to have a voice in the collection of information about us. You know, nothing about me without me, is what the expression is. And so, this is a very important thing and this is something that's on our agenda as well.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That's interesting because that's about the future. It's on your agenda meaning what?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: So you will see us -- I've told the Congress and others that you will see us within the next several months, addressing the question of privacy of those who provide the networks -- the privacy practices of those who provide the network services and how it affects you and me.</p><p/><p>In other words, do I know what information's being collected? Do I have a voice in whether or not that's going to be used in one way or another? And those are two very important baseline rights that individuals ought to have.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The other thing that's interesting to me is that these companies are all mostly out in Silicon Valley. Many of them, you know, particularly the founding ones there -- Microsoft, Apple, Amazon -- all out from the West Coast from either Seattle or Silicon Valley. And for a long time they said to the government, leave us alone -- almost libertarian, right?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Right.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Now it is said that they have as intense lobbying effort in Washington as anybody. Is that fair?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: There is nothing in the corporate culture that argues against eventually saying how does policy affect what I do in my business? And so what we at the FCC do is do we get lobbied by Google? Yes. Do we get lobbied by AT&amp;T? Yes.</p><p/><p>So what our challenge is how do you find the common good? I mean the interesting thing you said a minute ago, you talked about earlier in my career that I had been an advocate for various businesses.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: And the way you tend -- things tend to work in an advocacy role is you come in and you say, unless you do this my way, it's going to be the end of western civilization as we know it. And the other side comes in and says exactly the same thing.</p><p/><p>And the job of people like me and my colleagues at the commission is to say, OK, where is it -- I understand why this position is good for them, and I understand why this is good for them -- where is the solution that has the common good in it? You know, what we call public interest, but the public interest is vague.</p><p/><p>What's the common good? How can you structure things so that, again -- and you come back to basic principles like competition. How do you make sure that that which serves the common good survives?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But also the common good is to stimulate innovation to push forward.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Absolutely. Then again, that's why we wanted permissionless innovation with the open Internet. We didn't want the Internet to get choked down so that somebody else was deciding what two guys, and a dog in a garage came up with and whether you and I were going to get to see it.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Is this the best job of your life?</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Yes, I'm having a great time. I'm a really fortunate person.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Thanks for coming.</p><p/><p>TOM WHEELER: Thanks -- Charlie.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p/><p>Back in a moment. Stay with us.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: <person><nameText>Meg Whitman </nameText></person>is here. She has been CEO of Hewlett Packard since 2011. The technology icon was created more than 75 years ago in a Palo Alto garage. For decades it led in the business of selling computers and printers. The growth of enterprise services has forced HP to evolve. The company's reinvented itself with aspirations to capitalize in both the PC and networking solutions arena.</p><p/><p>On Sunday HP split into two separate pieces: Hewlett Packard Enterprise will primarily sell computer service, data storage and consulting servings. HP, Inc. will largely consist of personal computers and printers.</p><p/><p>I'm pleased to have <person><nameText>Meg Whitman </nameText></person>back on this program. Welcome.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Thank you very much.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: it's great to have you here.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Happy to be here.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is the ad that was in yesterday's paper and today's paper. \"The company that started Silicon Valley is making history again.\"</p><p/><p>I want to talk about how you're going to make history. But tell me what happened to Hewlett Packard. How did the company that Bill Hewlett and David Packard create that was the admiration of the world and certainly the Valley, the company that in terms of values, in terms of culture, in terms of success was looked on with huge admiration?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. The last decade was a tough decade. And I would actually chalk it up to too much turnover at the CEO level. CEOs -- when you have different CEOs who have different strategies -- it's very hard on a company particularly one as large as HP.</p><p/><p>And so I can now see as we're turning the corner with people who have been in role three or four years, you're starting to see it gel again. So I think the root of the challenge was in many ways too many CEOs in too short a period of a time.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And did it therefore miss huge opportunities that others saw?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Sure, absolutely it did. You know, mobile phones was an opportunity that HP missed and --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, yes, certainly many others. But, you know, the technology business is incredibly dynamic, and it's hard to catch every wave. And obviously the bigger you are, the more challenging it is -- right. I mean bigger companies just don't move quite as fast as smaller companies. So part of the separation is about being more nimble and more focused on two entirely different markets so that HP cannot miss the trends and, in fact, can invent the trends.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So now you come along.</p><p/><p>How did they get you to do this? Because you had had a remarkable career - -</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You'd even made a venture into politics which you said was a great learning experience even though you lost.</p><p/><p>You learned how to communicate, learn the demands of the modern world in terms of what we expect from people in the public eye whether it's a CEO or an aspirant to be governor of California. You were on the board at HP.</p><p/><p>That's been a board that's often been rancorous.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, yes.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And they convinced you to take over as CEO.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, I'll tell you how it happened because I had no intention of being the CEO. So I lost the governor's race in the fall of 2010. And I was trying to decide what I was going to do. I was working on our family foundation and I was sort of searching for the next thing.</p><p/><p>And it's very difficult when you lose these elections. As an aside, we should be really grateful for people who run because it's really tough when you lose because it's like a personal referendum in some ways.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. So did you -- was it depressing for you?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It was very hard. If you think about it, when you're part of a company, you know, there's you and the company. When you run for public office, it's a vote on you.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You felt rejected.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: You feel rejected. I mean it's very challenging.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Did you question your own abilities at all?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Sure you think gosh, you know, could have, would have, should have, you know, that whole thing.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: But, so it's February and I'm at home one afternoon watching an afternoon daytime talk show at 4:00. And my husband who is a neurosurgeon comes home early from work. He walks in and he sees me in the family room at 4:00 in the afternoon watching an afternoon talk show and he goes oh, this is really not good. This is really not good. You've got to pull your socks up and you've got to figure out what you're going to do.</p><p/><p>Just as if on cue that afternoon I got a call from an HP board member, Marc Andreessen --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: -- who said we're looking for some new board members for HP, you would be perfect. It will be so much fun. We'll sit on the tech committee. And, you know, it's just in the neighborhood and it's a chance to help reinvent a Silicon Valley icon.</p><p/><p>I said, this is great, what could go wrong? 12 minutes from my house.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But you're a board member. That's all you are.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: That's right. But I'm thinking what could go wrong. Twelve minutes from my house, it will be fun.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And it became quite apparent soon that the company had a lot of challenges and then of course, we as the board had the do the most difficult thing that a board does, which is remove the CEO. That was in some ways the easy thing.</p><p/><p>The next was who's going to run HP and the board sort of looked at me and I said, oh, no, no, no. We are definitely not doing this. We are definitely not doing this.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Been there, done that.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. But over time, I began to feel -- you know, it matters what happens to HP. HP is important to California. It's important, I would argue, to the tech industry and the United States and important globally. We are often the largest private employer in many countries in which we do business.</p><p/><p>So ultimately, I decided, OK, I'll see -- we'll do the best I can and I will see if I can be helpful here.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Well, they made the argument you were on a plane ride back from somewhere.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. We had a board meeting on the East Coast. And on the way back a number of them really were very persuasive and said we need you to do this. It's an opportunity to make a big change to a big company that's important and struggling. And the scale was interesting to me.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So the challenge was interesting and the scale in which they existed was interesting.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. Exactly. And you know me well enough to know I love a challenge. And so they hooked me on the challenge.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. And so tell me, when you got there, you had seen it up close as a member of the board.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But then you had to get into the weeds of this company.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, yes.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What did you find?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: So I found a very proud company with incredible founder DNA. The a-ha here is -- and this is great news for any founder that's watching your program -- it is really hard to kill founder DNA. And for HP, that was a very good thing because the core of this company through all the acquisitions and all the board drama was around innovation and focus on customers.</p><p/><p>And so I made the decision let's do more of what we do well and then we'll work on the to-do list of things that need to be fixed. And there were a number of things that need to be fixed. But I went right to innovation, right to the customer.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But was it looking at making a decision about what product lines you should have?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, the first decision I made -- remember my predecessor had said maybe they should spin off the PC business. Not PCs and printers but just PCs. So I put together a 60-day study and said we can't do this right now. We can't afford to build another brand.</p><p/><p>And because printing was going to stay with the big company we would have to build a new brand for the PC company. The company wasn't in shape to split. As it turns out, and I know this now first hand, when you separate a company of this size and scale, everything from IT to legal entities to tax ID codes to all kinds of things, you have to be strong to do it. And I don't think we would have been able to pull it off back then.</p><p/><p>So I made the decision, let's stay together. Let's rebuild the company. Let's strengthen the company. Let's reconnect with partners and customers. Let's, you know, focus on making this company as great as we can with the businesses that we are in.</p><p/><p>And it's been quite a turnaround journey. I mean we went from almost $12 billion of debt on the operating company to a positive net cash on the operating company. We really changed that much of the leadership team. We reignited the innovation engine to capitalize on the trends and the market like all flash array, a modern kind of storage.</p><p/><p>And we revamped in many ways the whole company. And then we said how do we accelerate into this turnaround? And we decided, the board and I, to separate into two Fortune 50 companies. Can you imagine? There's two Fortune 50 --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Separate, they're both within the top 50.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It's amazing.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It is amazing. And so you make this distinction between HP, Inc. and --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Hewlett Packard Enterprise.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I mean everybody -- there are a lot of people getting in the enterprise business. I mean from IBM to Amazon to Hewlett Packard at different levels.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why did you think you could win at that business?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, first of all, HP, Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are really quite different businesses.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I know.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: In the classic case, you know -- with different customers, different competitors, different cost structure --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But the same thing is true with Amazon in terms of the retail business and their enterprise business.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. But we had a company that needed to reinvent itself again. And we just though, you know what, let's separate these into two different companies so we can focus on these two most important markets. Because HP Inc. has one-third of their business is to consumers. You can go buy an HP printer at Staples or wherever. You can go buy an HP PC someplace.</p><p/><p>And so we thought, let's get to really focus on the enterprise and what we can do for the IT professionals in small to medium to big companies and really help them do a number of things that are very top of mind. I mean every CIO now is thinking, I have a legacy IT infrastructure. I've got to get to the new world order. I've got to get to the new style of IT, the cloud. I've got to be more agile.</p><p/><p>And we are uniquely suited to help companies on that transformation journey because those big companies, they've got to keep running their legacy IT systems while they get to the --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So who are you going to serve? Who are your customers?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Largely CIOs and VP of Ops, VP of Apps, VP of VAP, you know, operations for anywhere from small to very large companies. Remember we have a very robust channel that helps serve our customers. So we call them value-added resellers. They will serve the small to medium size customers with our products and services and software. And then we sell direct to the biggest customers.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why did you decide to be the CEO of the enterprise?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. And someone asked me that question because in some ways it would have been more natural for me to go to the part with the consumer because I'm a consumer technologist really. But I had a great executive named Dion Weisler (ph) who really knew the PC business. He'd run PCs and printers in Asia-Pacific for us. We brought him back. He was doing a great job running PCs and printers at corporate.</p><p/><p>And I said, you're fantastic for this job. He's got a lot of runway. He's a young man. And I said I'll take the enterprise side. There's more work to do. And I've actually become quite enamored with the enterprise side. Get back to the challenge and learning -- I had to learn a lot about the enterprise side.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why have you become enamored?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: You know, there -- I love disruption and I love the opportunity that creates. And think about what our business has been through -- the industry. From mainframe to client servers, you know, PCs; from client server to Web 1.0 where I had a front seat at the revolution at eBay; from the first generation of the Internet to web services.</p><p/><p>Now we're on the cusp of another huge change about what's possible for IT at a large company.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And that's because of the Cloud? What is it?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It's because of the Cloud. It's because of the way applications are now written.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right. When you were back at Princeton did you imagine that you would be a corporate manager?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: No.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What did you think you were going to be?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, I went to Princeton as a pre-med.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I know. I know. Is that where you met your husband?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: No, I actually met -- he was at Harvard Medical School when I was at Harvard Business School. But, you know, I took a lot of science courses a Princeton for which I am deeply grateful but ultimately decided that there was a better fit for me in business. And, you know, as a 21- year-old, what did I know? Not much.</p><p/><p>But I sold advertising for a magazine at Princeton and I thought selling advertising, business, that's sort of alike, you know, and then I applied to Harvard Business School.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Was it at Bane that you walked into the office of the CEO and said to him let me tell you what's wrong with the way you're running your business? You have no idea of how the employees think about you.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, I did. Can you imagine that I did that?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: I can.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I don't know what I was thinking. I was young and naive and enthusiastic. But Tom Tierney was his name who was the managing director - -</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: He thanked you for doing this.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: He did and he was an incredible mentor to me. In fact, he came on the board of eBay and was a big -- he might be one of the best strategists in America today, business strategist. And he was a huge help to me at Bane and actually made an enormous difference to us.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: but what's the philosophy here that people need -- somebody come in to the door and say this is what you're not doing and this is what you don't perceive and this is an intervention moment?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Well, I think sometimes and I think all of us are guilty of this at one time or another is, you begin to drink your own Kool- Aid and you don't see yourself and your leadership style as it really is. And sometimes you need a friend or someone who works for you or a colleague to say do you see what you're doing here? Do you see what you are doing?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Was it the right idea to run for governor? Was that a mistake? Did somebody not come in to you and say Meg, this is a different game?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: This is a political game?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: They did say that.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And why did you ignore that?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I think for a couple of reasons. One I saw the state that I loved, the state that had been my home for nearly 30 years was in real trouble. You might recall we had a huge budget deficit. We had a massive unfunded pension liability which by the way the state still has. Our education system had gone from number one in the country in the 50s to number 48 or 49 in, you know --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- and others were --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I mean and you just --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: At the university level.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: -- yes and you have all kinds of challenges. I said maybe I can apply some of what I learned in my career both at eBay and other places to help solve some these problems. So I dove in with 100 percent of my effort, and I worked at it very had for almost two and a half years.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: But were you prepared to spend your own money as you are as Donald Trump is spending his own money?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I was prepared to do that.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You spent a lot of your money.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I did. And I thought, you know, that -- and I also raised a lot of money. So I had a lot of support from people around the state, but I did spend some of my own money because it was important. I had to learn a lot, right. You know, I had to learn water policy. I had to learn education policy and it was an experience of a lifetime, Charlie.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: How's Governor Brown doing?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Listen, he's raised taxes, obviously, on a number of folks. The budget deficit is more in line than it was. It's much smaller than it was. Silicon Valley has been a big help to that, right. Silicon Valley right now is the economic engine of California.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Yes. And it's the place that every foreign head of state wants to go because they want to create their own Silicon Valley.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Silicon Valley -- exactly.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Xi Jinping went from Seattle, Washington before he went to Washington, D.C.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. Exactly. Because everyone loves this notion of how do you -- how could you possibly create Silicon Valley in China and --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Can you? Or is that something you could do with America's culture?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I don't know. It's really hard -- Charlie. It's alchemy, almost. It's the -- you have to have a great company like Hewlett-Packard which was the founder of Silicon Valley, a fantastic university or universities -- Stanford being the anchor, but Berkeley, Santa Clara, you know, U.C. Santa Cruz are all part of that ecosystem now. And then you have to have that venture capital where risk is rewarded.</p><p/><p>And so it's -- the more entrepreneurs you have, the more venture capital that's attracted, the more great companies that start. And you start a positive -- it's almost an ecosystem and it's very hard to create.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Do you worry that somehow there is the seed within the tech world today for overheating and a bubble that would burst?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Sure, I do. I do. I mean we lived through -- when I was at eBay, we lived through the 2001 bubble that burst. Frankly, eBay was fine because we had real revenues and real profits. And while our market cap went down a bit, we just kept on kept on going. But you know, you see a lot of very high multiples, young companies today. And so I worry about it.</p><p/><p>And you've seen a pullback actually in the last six to eight weeks. You've seen a pullback in the valuation of some of these younger companies. So the multiples have gone down -- you know, we'll see. I think the goodness is there is enough people who lived through 2001 who know what can happen.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Who raised the questions?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: But there is a whole generation that didn't live through 2001 and sometimes you have to have -- you know, your question about running for governor -- you have to be a product of your experiences.</p><p/><p>And by the way, I think I'm a better CEO because I ran.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Because you understand the public dimension.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I understand the public dimension but also I learned a lot about communicating with large groups of people. And as it turned out by complete coincidence, when I came to HP, it happened to be about the same size as the government of California. And what I learned about communicating in politics is -- and I bet you know this -- it is not always about the left brain, the facts and the figures and all of this. It is about the emotion, the stories you tell and how you connect.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Absolutely. It's the emotional level that you connect and then people are there. If you connect on the emotional level then they're open to your arguments.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. And I don't think I completely understood that because when you grow a big business you are trained to be very analytical. I mean can you imagine being the CEO of a public company, going in front of your investors and telling them stories? I mean you would be thrown out on your ear. They want to know the numbers. They want to know the return on investment capital.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And so we're trained --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: If you say, let me tell you my narrative they say, what's your bottom line?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: They feel like excuse me. And so I was a very left-brained, trained individual, we all are. And, so, I had to learn a lot about communication. And so when I came to HP I learned about that and I did quite a different style of communication when I was trying to rally the whole company and the importance of symbolic value.</p><p/><p>I'll tell you a story about Jerry Brown and this is a story I admire him. When the state was in tremendous financial difficulty, he said you know what we're going to do. We're going to take the cell phones away from all the civil servants in the state of California. I remember thinking, OK, that's all very interesting but it is 0.01 percent of the budget.</p><p/><p>It wasn't about the money. It was about the symbol and symbolism and the story he was telling which was he's going to be tougher on the budget.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- and demand sacrifice.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. If you had asked the man on the street, you know, how do you think Jerry Brown is doing with the budget? He would have said doing great, taking away the cell phones from those civil servants.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: It was a symbolic act --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: that connected and resonated.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And so I learned while -- when I watched him. And so when I came to HP, I said what's a symbolic act that I can do that will communicate to the company about why this is different. So the very first thing we did we tore town the executive parking lot and the barbed wire that surrounded the executive parking lot and I moved the entire leadership team to cubicles out of their wooden offices.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: They're no longer behind closed doors or whatever?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: We were out in the open just like everybody else. And we didn't write about that. We didn't make a publicity statement. 250,000 -- 300,000 HP people knew that within about 24 hours. And that made a statement.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Breaking down the barriers between --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And I learned that from running for office.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- employer and employee.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You are supporting Governor Christie.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I am.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I know Governor Christie quite well and I have admired what he has been able to do as a Republican governor in a blue state with a Democratically-controlled legislature. And my view is we have to have people who have learned to reach across the aisle and get things done. And he hasn't gotten --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: That's what's needed in Washington, you're suggesting?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I think that's what's needed in Washington because I think that it's likely that the president will be one party and the congress will be of another. And so he didn't get everything he wanted in New Jersey but sometimes in politics perfect is the enemy of really pretty good.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: How do you ascertain how he's doing?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, he's working very hard. And I think he is a fantastic retail politician. You know when we were talking about how you reach in and connect? No one's better than Chris Christie at reaching in and connecting with people. When people interact with him, they feel like they know him and they understand his heart.</p><p/><p>And so he's been putting a lot of shoe leather into Iowa, into Nevada, into New Hampshire and I think he's making progress. You can see him begin to inch up at the polls, you know. His favorables are turning. So I'm optimistic. But it's a tough, tough slog. But I think he's doing everything he knows how to do and I admire him a lot for doing it.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Look at where we are in terms of technology. What's next if you're asked?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: We're still at the beginning of the mobile revolution. That sounds crazy because we've all had mobile phones for a long time but pretty soon almost everyone on the planet may have a mobile phone and it's changing every element of life and I think we're at the beginning of that impact not at the end.</p><p/><p>And you think about how people use their phone in developing countries to, you know, trade commodities, to you know, sell their goods on the Internet to countries around the world. I mean it's really phenomenal.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And it gives people in faraway places access to all kinds of information.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It does and it has a political, you know, undercurrent as well. So I think we're at the beginning of that revolution.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: -- which includes social media.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, social media is its home. Its first home really in many ways today is on your mobile. Yes, you know, Facebook was invented for the desktop but now there's more people who access Facebook on their mobile than on their desktop.</p><p/><p>So I just think you're at the beginning of a tremendous revolution. When you think about a PC, per se, think about it, what you have in your hand is more powerful than a PC was ten years ago, it's maybe more powerful than a PC was five years ago. Think about what you can do on your mobile, what you can do on your tablet.</p><p/><p>Now, when you've got a lot of work to do, you really do want a full-fledged PC, but I think we're at the beginning of that revolution.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Is there a lesson to be learned from what Lou Gerstner did at IBM?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. So I read his book with great interest as you will recall it was called \"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance\". He said when he came to IBM at the end of his book he said when I came to IBM I thought culture was important. When I left IBM, he said I thought culture maybe was the only thing that's important. And I can see exactly what he means.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why does it take so hard to learn that? I mean --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: You know, because you think that other things can make a difference, but in the end when you run these big-scale operations, people on the frontlines, the sales person in New York for the server business has to know what to do, has to know what the ethics and the value and the ethos of the company is. And people have to -- it cannot be a command and control environment. People have to know what to do on the front lines. And how do they know what to do? It's not through policy and procedures and handbooks, it's through the culture.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What did you learn from Steve Jobs at Apple, going back to a company that was on his --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Steve Jobs may well be the genius in business of my generation. I mean this guy was amazingly creative, and the ability to invent category.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: The company was near bankruptcy and now the largest company in the world.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: It's amazing. I mean it's the biggest turnaround if you will that I've ever seen in my career. And they continue to amaze. And kudos to Tim Cook for being able to continue that legacy because it's not easy to follow Steve Jobs.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Why was it a mistake for Dell to buy EMC? That's what you said to your employees. They gave you guys an opportunity.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes, exactly.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Figuring out how to put cultures together and all that and you guys would go out there and start innovating.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Exactly. So listen it's a fascinating time in history because two companies who are quite similar in many ways, HP was a larger company than Dell, but we were in largely the same businesses. We have taken took diametrically opposed strategies with the same set of facts. Right? So we decided --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: What were the facts?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Well, the industry and incredible tectonic plate shifts from, if you will, the old style of IT to the next generation. One of these inflection points for our industry where a lot of the old proud companies were under pressure. Our strategy was de-lever the balance sheet so you have no debt on the operating company, in fact you have cash on the operating company.</p><p/><p>Lean in to new technology like three par, like our networking business, like Cloud. Make sure we pivoted to solution selling with our enterprise services business and really focus on revenue growth.</p><p/><p>And their strategy was lever up the balance sheet, put old technology together, take out the costs and then try to make your way that way. I mean two diametrically opposed strategies.</p><p/><p>Listen, I'm going to vote for Hewlett Packard Enterprise all day long because I think fast is important, speed is important where we live. And I'll tell you -- they have a year to close the deal and another year to integrate. And we have an opportunity I think to explain to customers our solutions and why we are, you know, a stable, great company to do business with.</p><p/><p>And it is pretty funny, Charlie, because you think back in 2011 we looked pretty unstable, right?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Of course.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And now we're looking like the paragon of stability.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Was than when -- when did Fiorina leave?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Much earlier. I think 2005 --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: You went through her then you went through before that --</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Right. I think Carly left in 2005, 2006 -- something like that.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: So has she taken an unfair hit or is it simply a product of she happened to be not the right person at the right time for Hewlett Packard?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: So listen, politics is tough, right. We covered this. I mean it is tough. You've got to have a rhinoceros skin, and people will try to take you on. I would like to say no good deed goes unpunished. And I said before in public, I think the Compaq acquisition was the right thing. We have the position that we have today in PCs and in servers thank you to the Compaq acquisition.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: She drove that.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: And she drove that. And she drove that.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: And it was right thing?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: I think it was the right thing. With 20/20 hindsight looking back, I'm glad we have the position that we have in those two businesses because fundamentally they are the bedrock now of HP, Inc. and Hewlett Packard enterprises.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: When you buy a business, I mean you see people -- they'll buy company just to get the CEO -- to get the executive talent.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Yes. In Silicon Valley, they're called acqui-hires, you know, acquisition of hires.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Right, right. Acqui-hire.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: An acqui-hire. People would say for the most part these big tech acquisitions are very tough to pull off and usually there is a challenge before, you know, the sun rises again. So, you know, listen I think we're super well-prepared in these two companies to go own innovate, deliver for customers in a changing world, while we're not trying to integrate another company. We're not trying to, you know, fundamentally remake the sales force and take out hundreds of millions of dollars of cost.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Thank you for coming.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Thank you.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: Great to see you.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MEG WHITMAN</nameText></person>: Great to see you again. Thank you -- Charlie.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>CHARLIE ROSE</nameText></person>: <person><nameText>Meg Whitman.</nameText></person></p><p/><p>Thank you for joining us.

You can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">sign up here</url> to receive it weekdays.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg likes to say that Facebook does more good than harm in the world. But Facebook\u2019s effect on the world is multifaceted and complicated, and the good can\u2019t simply make us forget the bad.</p><p>Without Facebook or a digital hangout like it, we might never have seen the bystander <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">video</url> of George Floyd pinned under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">undermining the official account</url> of Floyd\u2019s death. Facebook gives everyone \u2014 even a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">17-year-old</url> \u2014 a printing press. Yes, that is often very good.</p><p>But on the flip side I think about the Philippines, where Facebook has been weaponized by powerful people to vilify and harass their enemies, and where the social network has contributed to a poisoned atmosphere in which even basic facts are in doubt. It is in poorer countries without strong democratic institutions where the good but also the harm of Facebook has been magnified.</p><p>Facebook has acknowledged that is has been slow to act in some countries and has more work to do to stop harmful abuses of its hangouts. But Zuckerberg\u2019s mathematical equation \u2014 the good outweighs the bad \u2014 is too simplistic. </p><p>Every time I think something positive about Facebook, I also hold in my mind the profound damage the company has done \u2014 and that too should be an indelible part of Zuckerberg\u2019s legacy.</p><p>I am grappling with this again now because on Monday a court in Manila <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">convicted a prominent journalist</url> in the Philippines, Maria Ressa, and a former colleague of cyber libel.</p><p>Ressa and her <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">defenders</url> have said the legal case was an effort to silence news publications like Rappler, which she co-founded, that have been critical of President Rodrigo Duterte and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">war on drugs</url> that has left thousands of people <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">dead and disappeared</url>.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Davey Alba</url>, my New York Times colleague, wrote a must-read <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">article</url> two years ago about the ways that Duterte and his allies employed Facebook to build a large base of supporters, smear opponents like Ressa and spread hoaxes.</p><p>Davey explained to me that Facebook gave Duterte the means to disseminate his message quickly and broadly. And the company\u2019s computer-rigged system that is programmed to circulate the most engaging (and often divisive) material lined up perfectly with the fear, outrage and anger that fueled Duterte\u2019s political campaign and then his presidency.</p><p>There were violent world leaders before Facebook, but as in other countries, the social network and an authoritarian were a match.</p><p>Ressa used Facebook to build an audience for her fledgling news organization. But she and other Rappler staff were also targeted on Facebook, and the news outlet <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">devoted its time and resources</url> to combat false information there. As an official Facebook partner, Rappler was tasked by Facebook to protect the Philippines from the worst of Facebook.</p><p>Alone, the Philippines shows the worst side of Facebook. But this is not an isolated case. </p><p>In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Myanmar</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Sri Lanka</url> and beyond, there\u2019s a repeated pattern of Facebook\u2019s system rewarding the most outrageous or fear-mongering messages with more distribution, to grave consequence. And Facebook fails to address warnings about the abuses happening under its nose.</p><p>Yes, we want and need to bear witness to police brutality videos. But we shouldn\u2019t accept a genocide in Myanmar or the targeting of a journalist in the Philippines in exchange for it.</p><p>Big tech accountability is too important to botch</p><p>Members of Congress have been trying to get Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, to testify in an ongoing investigation into whether big technology companies wield their power fairly. Amazon\u2019s lawyer said on Monday that Bezos was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">willing to appear at a House hearing alongside other C.E.O.s</url>. (You\u2019ll notice that is hardly an unqualified yes.)</p><p>Bezos is rarely in a position like this, facing questions that he is compelled to answer. I\u2019ll be watching eagerly, if it happens. But I can already tell you that it will be frustrating and pointless.</p><p>What I\u2019ve learned from congressional fact-finding sessions like this is that they are theater on both sides.</p><p>Too often, our elected officials use these moments to grandstand or catch executives in a lie, and corporate leaders \u2014 just as powerful but unelected by the public \u2014 say things that might be technically true but not all that revealing.</p><p>Both lawmakers and tech companies share the blame here.</p><p>There\u2019s a false idea inside tech companies that members of Congress are too old or clueless to understand how tech companies work. But in one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">hearings last year</url> of the House panel investigating competition in technology, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers asked important, probing questions. It was the executives from Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon who mostly dodged those questions.</p><p>I\u2019m not a congressional expert, but I wonder if the format of these legislative accountability sessions needs some tweaks. One critic of tech companies has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">suggested</url> having congressional staff members tape interviews with witnesses so there would be no time limits and less inclination to show off. A Washington veteran suggested to me that investigative hearings need to happen more frequently because there is a cumulative impact.</p><p>The power of big tech companies is an important matter of public policy. We should hold both our elected officials and the big companies we rely on accountable for what they do. The hearings as they exist now are unlikely to do this.</p><p>Before we go \u2026</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Speaking of investigations into big tech power \u2026 : European regulators are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">questioning whether Apple abuses its power</url> by setting onerous terms for app makers who want to reach iPhone and iPad users, my colleague <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Adam Satariano</url> writes.

Additional court rulings last year have further finessed guidance around online tracking - clarifying pre-checked consent boxes aren't valid, for example.<br/>Yet the DPC still found examples of cookie banners that offer no actual choice at all. Such as those which serve a dummy banner with a cookie notice that users can only meaningless click 'Got it!'. ('Gotcha data' more like.. )<br/>In fact the watchdog writes that it found 'implied' consent being relied upon by around two-thirds of the controllers, based on the wording of their cookie banners (e.g. notices such as: \"by continuing to browse this site you consent to the use of cookies\") - despite this no longer meeting the required legal standard.<br/>\"Some appeared to be drawing on older, but no longer extant, guidance published by the DPC that indicated consent could be obtained 'by implication', where such informational notices were put in place,\" it writes, noting that current guidance on its website \"does not make any reference to implied consent, but it also focuses more on user controls for cookies rather than on controller obligations\".<br/>Another finding was that all but one website set cookies immediately on landing - with \"many\" of these found to have no legal justification for not asking first, as the DPC determined they fall outside available consent exemptions in the relevant regulations.<br/>It also identified widespread abuse of the concept of 'strictly necessary' where the use of trackers are concerned. \"Many controllers categorised the cookies deployed on their websites as having a 'necessary' or 'strictly necessary' function, where the stated function of the cookie appeared to meet neither of the two consent exemption criteria set down in the ePrivacy Regulations/ePrivacy Directive,\" it writes in the report. \"These included cookies used to establish chatbot sessions that were set prior to any request by the user to initiate a chatbot function. In some cases, it was noted that the chatbot function on the websites concerned did not work at all.<br/>\"It was clear that some controllers may either misunderstand the 'strictly necessary' criteria, or that their definitions of what is strictly necessary are rather more expansive than the definitions provided in Regulation 5(5),\" it adds.<br/>Another problem the report highlights is a lack of tools for users to vary or withdraw their consent choices, despite some of the reviewed sites using so called 'consent management platforms' (CMPs) sold by third-party vendors.<br/>This chimes with a recent independent study of CPMs - which earlier this year\u00a0found illegal practices to be widespread, with \"dark patterns and implied consent... ubiquitous\", as the researchers put it.<br/>\"Badly designed - or potentially even deliberately deceptive - cookie banners and consent-management tools were also a feature on some sites,\" the DPC writes in its report, detailing some examples of Quantcast's CPM which had been implemented in such a way as to make the interface \"confusing and potentially deceptive\" (such as unlabelled toggles and a 'reject all' button that had no effect).<br/>Pre-checked boxes/sliders were also found to be common, with the DPC finding ten of the 38 controllers used them - despite 'consent' collected like that not actually being valid consent.<br/>\"In the case of most of the controllers, consent was also 'bundled' - in other words, it was not possible for users to control consent to the different purposes for which cookies were being used,\" the DPC also writes. \"This is not permitted, as has been clarified in the Planet49 judgment. Consent does not need to be given for each cookie, but rather for each purpose. Where a cookie has more than one purpose requiring consent, it must be obtained for all of those purposes separately.\"<br/>In another finding, the regulator came across instances of websites that had embedded tracking technologies, such as Facebook pixels, yet their operators did not list these in responses to the survey, listing only HTTP browser cookies instead. The DPC suggests this indicates some controllers aren't even aware of trackers baked into their own sites.<br/>\"It was not clear, therefore, whether some controllers were aware of some of the tracking elements deployed on their websites - this was particularly the case where small controllers had outsourced their website management and development to a third-part,\" it writes.<br/>The worst sector of its targeted sweep - in terms of \"poor practices and, in particular, poor understanding of the ePrivacy Regulations and their purpose\" - was the restaurants and food-ordering sector, per the report. (Though the finding is clearly based on a small sampling across multiple sectors.)<br/>Despite encountering near blanket failure to actually comply with the law, the DPC, which also happens to be the lead regulator for much of big tech in Europe, has responded by issuing, er, further guidance.<br/>This includes specifics such as pre-checked consent boxes must be removed; cookie banners can't be designed to 'nudge' users to accept and a reject option must have equal prominence; and no non-necessary cookies be set on landing. It also stipulates there must always be a way for users to withdraw consent - and doing so should be as easy as consenting.<br/>All stuff that's been clear and increasingly so at least since the GDPR came into application in May 2018. Nonetheless the regulator is giving the website operators in question a further six months' grace to get their houses in order - after which it has raised the prospect of actually enforcing the EU's ePrivacy Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation.<br/>\"Where controllers fail to voluntarily make changes to their user interfaces and/or their processing, the DPC has enforcement options available under both the ePrivacy Regulations and the GDPR and will, where necessary, examine the most appropriate enforcement options in order to bring controllers into compliance with the law,\" it warns.<br/>The report is just the latest shot across the bows of the online tracking industry in Europe.<br/>The UK's Information Commission's Office (ICO) has been issuing sternly worded blog posts for months. Its own report last summer found illegal profiling of Internet users by the programmatic ad industry to be rampant - also giving the industry six months to reform.<br/>However the ICO still hasn't done anything about the adtech industry's legal blackhole - leading to privacy experts to denouncing the lack of any \"substantive action to end the largest data breach ever recorded in the UK\", as one put it at the start of this year.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Ireland's DPC, meanwhile, has yet to put the decision trigger on multiple cross-border investigations into the data-mining business practices of tech giants including Facebook and Google, following scores of GDPR complaints - including several targeting their legal base to process people's data.<br/>A two-year review of the pan-EU regulation, set for May 2020, provides one hard deadline that might concentrate minds.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-805703</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YN8-D1R1-DYDW-74PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1416\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009PXO</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION LAW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp;

Resources &amp; Env't 23\"/>On January 30, 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a proposed rulemaking designed to \"Modernize and Enhance\" Regulation S-K, with a stated intent to eliminate duplicative disclosures for the benefit of investors and simplify filings for registrants.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">See</emphasis><citation type=\"case\" id=\"I60X73C728T5360020000400\"><content>Management's Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information, <span normalizedCite=\"85 FR 12068\">85 Fed.

Not all SEC Commissioners were in complete agreement with key provisions of the proposed action. In fact, in a concurrently issued statement, Commissioner Allison Herren Lee criticized the proposed rulemaking's failure to address matters associated with certain environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns, specifically calling out the issue of climate change. Going further, the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee issued a report on May 20, 2020, that recommended the SEC adopt disclosure policies regarding ESG issues. In addition, the focus of ESG concerns were echoed in certain comments filed on the proposed rulemaking. For example, one notable set of comments came from the office of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who, among other matters, added that the current global COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the purported need for explicit climate change requirements in the SEC's reporting requirements.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">See</emphasis> Letter from E. Warren to Chairman Clayton (Apr. 28, 2020).  </p><p>  Commissioner Lee's statement underscores the past decade's advancing trend in corporate institutional investing regarding the examination of corporate valuation and investment risk within the context of ESG issues, or sustainable investing. ESG criteria are a set of standards for a company's operations that some investors use to screen potential investments. Environmental criteria generally consider how a company performs as a steward of nature and the impacts from its operations on the environment. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. Governance deals with a company's leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights. ESG considerations for publicly traded companies have become more focused, and companies find themselves confronted with inquiries and performance demands from the investment community that involve wideranging ESG concerns, including those specific to climate change; stakeholder outreach and advocacy; and internal policies, procedures, and management systems associated with ESG matters. Many, if not most, companies now voluntarily report, to some degree, on ESG matters and performance in various publications, such as corporate sustainability reports. Publicly traded companies also are required to address and assess to what extent ESG issues, such as climate change, implicate a \"material\" concern or risk in required financial reporting.  </p><p>  In recent months, the issue of material financial risks has been significantly influenced by the economic outfalls of the global pandemic. In many cases, ESG-focused commenters have responded to the crisis of the pandemic by highlighting the exacerbation of ESG concerns from the effects of the pandemic and stressing recovery actions should align with ESG principles to provide for a sustainable economic recovery. In addition, and despite the clear economic challenges that have resulted from the pandemic, commenters indicate that research from the first four months of 2020 suggests that investments in funds that invest in ESG practices have continued to perform well with better-than-average returns relative to counterparts, regardless of the asset classes of the funds. Caitlin McCabe,   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ESG Investing Shines in Market Turmoil, with Help from Big Tech</emphasis>, Wall St. J., May 12, 2020.  </p><p>  No longer is it viable for regulators or publicly traded companies to avoid the issue of climate change in the evaluation and disclosure of potential material impacts and risks from products, projects, and/or operations on long-term   <page number=\"24\" pageScheme=\"35 Nat. Resources &amp; Env't 23\"/>sustainability. As state and federal policy agendas move to counter or mitigate the impacts from climate change, more and more arguments are made to suggest that governing agencies should promote regulatory actions to meaningfully address the risk of climate change. As highlighted by Commissioner Lee with respect to her concerns with the proposed rulemaking, \"much has changed in the last decade with respect to what we know about climate change and the financial risks it creates for global markets. Investors have increased their demands on companies and regulators for consistent, reliable, and comparable disclosures . . . and regulators around the globe are taking action.\"   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">See</emphasis> Allison Herren Lee,   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Modernizing\" Regulation S-K: Ignoring the Elephant in the Room</emphasis>, U.S. Sec. &amp; Exch.

The Securities Act and the Exchange Act were passed in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929 to ensure the integrity of capital markets. The Securities Act requires companies to register securities with the SEC prior to offering for sale and to provide certain disclosures in connection with the offerings for sale or registration of securities. The Exchange Act requires publicly traded companies to file certain periodic reports and provides the statutory requirements for annual, periodic, and episodic reports.  </p><p>  The Securities and Exchange Acts require public companies generally to do the following with respect to environmental issues: (1) present material environmental financial information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); (2) present narrative and quantitative environmental information in the nonfinancial section of financial filings; (3) provide additional information, either within financial statements or outside, as necessary to enable investors to make informed decisions; and (4) implement and maintain a reporting system capable of providing reasonable assurance the foregoing requirements are met. Importantly, the statutes collectively provide the enabling framework for regulatory standards associated with what is material for the purpose of corporate disclosures in financial filings. Materiality, or what constitutes material information for disclosure purposes, is a frequent consideration and issue in securities litigation. As stated by the U.S. Supreme Court:  <excerpt><bodyText><p><br/>  \u00a0  <br/>  The question of materiality, it is universally agreed, is an objective one, involving the significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor.

For example, recent research from Morningstar indicates that asset-manager proxy voting support for ESG-related shareholder resolutions has increased considerably over the past five years--with support at 46% in 2019, up from 27% in 2015.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">See</emphasis> Jackie Cook,   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How Fund Families Support ESG-Related Shareholder Proposals</emphasis>, Morningstar (Feb. 13, 2020).  <br/>  \u00a0  <br/>  Evolving SEC Approach  <br/>  In 2010, the SEC made its first meaningful effort to address issues regarding climate change through its guidance document titled \"Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change.\" <citation type=\"case\" id=\"I60X73C728T5360120000400\"><content><span normalizedCite=\"75 FR 6290\">75 Fed.

Following the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's newly released greenhouse gas reporting rules, the SEC sought to align its reporting standards to address regulatory, legislative, and other developments associated with climate change. The SEC guidance for the first time specifically identified varied climate change impacts as implicated under the reporting standards, noting, \"in addition to legislative, regulatory, business and market impacts related to climate change, there may be significant physical effects of climate change that have the potential to have a material effect on a registrant's business and operations.\"   <citation type=\"case\" id=\"I60X73C728T5360140000400\"><content><span normalizedCite=\"75 FR 6290\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Id.</emphasis> at 6291<locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"citeReference\"/><keyValue value=\"#17869#3#000075#006290#\"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation>. The effects noted by the SEC can impact a registrant's personnel, physical assets, supply chain, and distribution chain. Notably, the SEC observed that much of the climate change-related information companies disclose is found outside of formal financial filings.   <citation type=\"case\" id=\"I60X73C728T5360160000400\"><content><span normalizedCite=\"75 FR 6290\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Id.</emphasis> at 6292<locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"citeReference\"/><keyValue value=\"#17869#3#000075#006290#\"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation>. Taking specific notice of reporting platforms such as the Carbon Disclosure Project (now known as CDP) and reporting standards developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the SEC found although much of this reporting is provided voluntarily, registrants should be aware that some of the information they may be reporting pursuant to these mechanisms also may be required to be disclosed in filings with the Commission pursuant to existing disclosure requirements. In the 2010 guidance, the SEC devoted its attention to the specific concern of climate change under the regulatory reporting requirements in Items 101, 103, 105, and 303.  </p><p>  Under the current administration, the SEC has holistically amended its regulatory reporting standards. In April 2019, the SEC amended Regulation S-K and simplified its reporting requirements. <citation type=\"case\" id=\"I60X73C728T5360180000400\"><content>FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, <span normalizedCite=\"84 FR 12674\">84 Fed.

The proposal was a departure from the 2010 Guidance, which arguably complicated the nature of a company's financial disclosures, by specifically seeking to have climate change-focused matters addressed in a registrant's filings.  </p><p>  In August 2019, the SEC also issued a proposed rule to amend the regulatory requirements of Regulation S-K for the first time in 30 years. Without any specific identification or discussion of ESG concerns, the SEC's proposed amendments sought to emphasize the principles-based approach \"because the current disclosure requirements may not reflect what is material to every business, and, as past developments have demonstrated, disclosure requirements, and in particular prescriptive disclosure requirements can become outdated.\" <citation type=\"case\" id=\"I60X73C728T53601D0000400\"><content><span normalizedCite=\"84 FR 44358\">84 Fed.

Although facially designed to take advantage of technological advancements and changes to GAAP standards, SEC stated its proposal also \"considered the benefits and appropriateness of a principles-based approach in reviewing [MD&amp;A] items and our proposals are intended to promote the principles-based nature of MD&amp;A.\"   <citation type=\"case\" id=\"I60X73C728T53601J0000400\"><content><span normalizedCite=\"85 FR 12068\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Id.</emphasis> at 12,070<locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"citeReference\"/><keyValue value=\"#17869#3#000085#012068#\"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation>. Combined with the August 2019 proposed amendments to Items 101, 103, and 105, the February 2020 proposal reflects a codification of preexisting instructions for certain disclosures and a streamlining of Item 303's requirements.   <citation type=\"case\" id=\"I60X73C728T53601M0000400\"><content><span normalizedCite=\"85 FR 12068\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Id.</emphasis> at 12,075-91<locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"citeReference\"/><keyValue value=\"#17869#3#000085#012068#\"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation>. Notably, and as lamented by Commissioner Lee in her statement regarding the proposal, the proposed MD&amp;A revisions seem to support a need for more robust climate change disclosures but do not directly address the issue. The proposed revisions to Item 303's provisions around \"known trends or uncertainties,\" for example, seek to provide for a corporation to discuss and analyze \"events that are reasonably likely to cause (as opposed to will cause) a material change in the relationship between costs or revenues.\"   <citation type=\"case\" id=\"I60X73C728T53601P0000400\"><content><span normalizedCite=\"85 FR 12068\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Id.</emphasis> at 12,080<locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"citeReference\"/><keyValue value=\"#17869#3#000085#012068#\"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation>.  </p><p>  The revised proposed standards seem to more appropriately provide for climate change discussions in a MD&amp;A narrative. Although the proposed rulemaking was silent on the issue of ESG concerns, it was not a topic that went unaddressed. In addition to Commissioner Lee's criticism, Chairman Clayton issued a lengthy statement in support of the proposed rule and the manner in which the SEC staff and Commissioners evaluate ESG issues and interact with stakeholders, the regulated community, and international counterparts to assess ESG and climate change-related issues. Likewise, Commissioner Hester Pierce issued a statement in which she supported the rulemaking and responded to the repeated calls for ESG-related adjustments to the disclosure requirements. The collective focus of the Commissioners' statements on ESG matters, and specifically climate change concerns, features clearly the importance of these issues and the continued support they receive from the broader stakeholder community. This importance was made clear with the May 20, 2020, report from the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee calling for specific disclosure requirements around ESG issues and climate change specifically. Tom Zanki,   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SEC Urged to Establish ESG Disclosure Policies</emphasis>, Law 360, May 21, 2020.  <br/>  \u00a0  <br/>  Climate Change and Corporate Reporting  <br/>  Climate change disclosures are a topic that will continue to receive heightened attention and scrutiny from the investment community. How a company goes about framing and structuring its risk statements and considerations for climate change in its financial filings, for example, can potentially leave a company in the crosshairs for negative actions from external stakeholders and shareowners. Many commenters highlight the importance that ESG considerations make in disclosures and that the divergence between SEC requirements and other   <page number=\"26\" pageScheme=\"35 Nat. Resources &amp; Env't 23\"/>nonregulatory standards can make the issue difficult to assess from a standardized baseline. Advocates for more transparent and clearer reporting around climate change impacts in financial filings claim historical attempts to integrate sustainability factors in nonfinancial filings, as disclosed in a corporate sustainability report, with financial factors disclosed in SEC reports have proved inadequate.  </p><p>  These concerns are precisely the reason why Commissioner Lee took issue with the recent proposed amendments to the MD&amp;A requirements. Commissioner Lee echoed the common frustration of commenters over the need for consistent, reliable, and comparable disclosures of the risks and opportunities related to sustainability measures, particularly climate risk. As stated by Commissioner Lee, \"the broad, principles-based 'materiality' standard has not produced sufficient disclosure to ensure that investors are getting the information they need--that is, disclosures that are consistent, reliable and comparable.\" Commissioner Lee bemoans the SEC's routine disclosure review process and the lack of attention to improving the standard for comment on climate disclosure. She notes what she terms the \"unprecedented and massive campaign to obtain climate-related disclosure from issuers\" undertaken by investors and shareholders, and the result of most large public companies providing some sustainability disclosure, including in reports separate and apart from the SEC's required disclosure regime. Lee,   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">supra</emphasis>.  </p><p>  There are numerous reporting tools and programs available to companies to begin to gauge or incorporate ESG-related topics into management programs and disclosures, including those associated with climate change. Three of the most commonly employed and long-standing reporting structures are provided by GRI, SASB, and the Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI). Although the focus of these reporting platforms varies, generally the programs are designed to provide nongovernmental standards for the reporting of ESG risks and how a company's management of ESG risks relates to industry peers.  </p><p>  Companies are commonly asked to consider or are confronted with participation in ratings disclosures that provide the investment community with ready-made sources of information on a company's ESG performance and undertakings. Programs and services such as CDP or the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes are frequently used for such evaluations. The degree to which companies are responsive to or involve themselves in these programs can dictate to what extent the company becomes subject to further specific stakeholder actions, such as shareholder proposals designed to influence and change corporate focus or action.  </p><p>  A recent example of how ESG concerns are becoming a main driver behind investment scrutiny can be seen in the annual letter to CEOs from BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink. In the communication, Mr. Fink expresses his belief that climate change and sustainability were paramount considerations in investment risk assessments. Mr. Fink posits that ESG matters \"are driving a profound reassessment of risk and asset values. And, because capital markets pull future risk forward, we will see changes in capital allocation more quickly than we see changes to the climate itself.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">In the near future--and sooner than most anticipate--there will be a significant reallocation of capital</emphasis>.\" Larry Fink,   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Letter to CEOs: A Fundamental Reshaping of Finance</emphasis>, BlackRock (2020) (emphasis in original). Mr. Fink specifically highlights potential impacts from climate change as an investment risk, such as the concerns around the unknown scale and scope of government action on climate change, which will generally define the speed with which a move to a low carbon economy occurs. Mr. Fink also acknowledges that \"[u]nder any scenario, the energy transition will still take decades . . . [and] despite recent advances, the technology does not yet exist to cost-effectively replace many of today's essential hydrocarbons.\"   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Id.</emphasis> He stresses the need for government and the private sector to work together to pursue a \"fair and just\" transition that does not come at the cost of certain parts of society or countries in developing parts of the world.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Id.</emphasis></p><p>  The general investment thesis assumes that the promotion of ESG performance and initiatives not only supports the ethical management of social considerations but also sustainable profitability. As stated by Mr. Fink, \"a company cannot achieve long-term profits without embracing purpose and considering the needs of a broad range of stakeholders.\"   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Id.</emphasis> Investment analysts seek information or confirmation from companies on topics that range from how a company incorporates ESG concerns in its risk management programs or presents the issues to senior management and boards of directors, to what efforts companies take to measure or reduce emissions from its operations. Frequently, investment analysts consider whether companies tie executive compensation to ESG-related performance and the degree with which corporate governance and structures are designed to promote transparency of ESG factors.  </p><p>  Planning and executing on ESG-focused materiality assessments necessitate a systematic approach, with consistent controls to address and account for the legal issues that can be presented. Companies should cautiously review the inclusion or mention of activities or programs that they may not, or only half-heartedly, adhere to or employ in normal practice. It is essential that companies employ processes available to protect the development of information and data collected during these reviews because the results can implicate any number of deeper legal concerns. For instance, what if the results of the review reveal a systemic issue across an entire subsidiary or operations unit? Planning and execution on ESG assessments require thoughtful collaborations between counsel, internal subject matter experts, corporate operations personnel, and/or external consultants that a company may retain to conduct the review.  </p><p>  Companies that purposely include ESG-related issues and disclosures in external facing presentations and websites have begun to distinguish themselves from their industry peers in other ways beyond favorable financial performance. In as much as certain ESG ratings are relative to other companies within the same industry, companies can distance themselves from industry peers by employing and adhering to best ESG practices and reporting.  </p><p><page number=\"27\" pageScheme=\"35 Nat. Resources &amp; Env't 23\"/>Recent legislative efforts have added to the pressures around corporate ESG disclosure requirements. On September 20, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee passed H.R. 4329, the ESG Disclosure Simplification Act of 2019. The legislation would have public companies provide a \"clear\" description of both the connection between ESG metrics and long-term business strategies and the process used to determine how ESG metrics affect the long-term business strategies of the issuer. It would also require the SEC to establish a permanent advisory committee, called the \"Sustainable Finance Advisory Committee,\" comprising up to 20 members who may serve for up to four years. While it is unlikely that the law will be passed and signed into law under the current administration, the bill itself stands as a good example of the continuing efforts designed to force reporting companies to issue more meaningful and additional ESG disclosures.  </p><p>  The concerns over ESG-related disclosures have been implicated in recent months from the continued economic impacts from the global coronavirus pandemic. Some commenters, in support of ESG principles in investment disclosures, offer that recovery efforts should align with ESG principles, and not forsake the influence that the economic downturn can have on global ESG risks and opportunities.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How Responsible Investors Should Respond to the COVID-19 Coronavirus Crisis</emphasis>, PRI Bull., Mar. 27, 2020. As included in PRI's Bulletin, when the public health emergency of COVID-19 starts to subside, \"government support should be prioritized for companies, sectors and business activities that help respond to crises such as the climate emergency and inequality, rather than those that risk exacerbating them.\"   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Id.</emphasis> The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance also recently addressed the matter in a guidance and identified how the risks of the virus must be accounted for in corporate filings.  </p><p>  The Division of Corporation Finance's guidance documents state the Commission has made clear that its disclosure requirements can apply to a broad range of evolving business risks, even in the absence of a specific line-item requirement that names the particular risk presented. As a result, disclosure of these risks and COVID-19-related effects may be necessary or appropriate under several of the reporting standards in Regulation S-K. Div. of Corp. Fin., Secs. &amp; Exch. Comm'n,   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Coronavirus (COVID-19) CF Disclosure Guidance: Topic No. 9</emphasis> (Mar. 25, 2020).  </p><p>  The changing reporting standards of the SEC, and the current importance of ESG matters in relation to these standards, are an important area of concern for publicly traded companies in the United States. The at-times competing dynamics between private reporting protocols, voluntary sustainability reporting by companies, and the SEC requirements for reporting forecast a continued debate over the need for enhanced disclosure requirements devoted to ESG issues by the SEC. As ESG focuses will remain a primary component of how external stakeholders--most importantly, investors--view a company, it stands to reason that calls for more specific regulation around the subject of ESG performance will continue to permeate until more robust regulatory standards are advanced. Resolute and prudent efforts by companies to address these issues are paramount as they advance and respond to stakeholder ESG concerns because the reputational harm and impacts that may result from failing to do otherwise can make the difference for long-term sustainability of a business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-2RY1-JSC5-M49Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">226415</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><paginationScheme pageScheme=\"35 Nat.

It will sell the creative sector down the river and, if anything, benefit big tech companies that want to have a free ride on creative content. The bill will also cause SA to breach its international obligations, so the process as well as the outcome of adopting the bill will cause unnecessary diplomatic stress.</p><p>You may say: \"Why should I care, we have so many other problems?\" Or: \"What is copyright anyway?\" Or: \"SA first, who cares about international copyright laws?\"</p><p>Let me try and answer these valid questions.</p><p>You should care if you care for your children's job opportunities and for SA's future. Rapid technological progress means fierce competition for knowledge and knowledge workers, people who know how to thrive in and leverage the fourth industrial revolution with artificial intelligence and the internet of things.</p><p>South Africans will simply be denied access to the best jobs around the world if creativity and investment in copyright-protected content are unavailable due to bad legislation or over-regulation. The net effect will be that jobs existing will be lost to others and jobs that do not exist as yet will fail to land on South African shores.</p><p>What is \"copyright\"? Copyright is a form of intellectual property that protects expressions of ideas and benefits those who provide a diversity of cultural resources that are valuable in society.</p><p>These content items are determinants of the future success of any nation or region to become a strong player in the knowledge economy. Copyright is the rock on which both creative people (writers, musicians, actors, filmmakers) and producers (film, TV, music and book publishers, software houses) stand, the currency in which they trade.</p><p>\"Access\" in the 21st century is no longer just access to information but access to creative opportunity: the chance to express yourself and showcase your creativity and earn a living from it.</p><p>Adoption of the copyright bill will make it a lot harder for local publishers to publish authors, let alone offer decent advances or royalties, because the bill, with its overbroad exceptions that allow free copying, creates so much uncertainty over what copyright really protects.</p><p>The bill also threatens to invalidate contracts, so much so that record companies will be forced to turn many more new artists down. Ministerial regulations, if ever drafted, will force rigid, bureaucratic and inflexible terms and conditions over which parties will have no say. So, better to wait for those terms than to offer a fairly negotiated set of terms and conditions or agree on contracts in other countries for other audiences - a knowledge emigration in the making.</p><p>Agreements will also be limited to 25 years, when the average writer needs four to six books to break through and perhaps only that sixth book becomes a long-seller and the basis for a film or TV series. By then all the years spent on promoting the first five books will have been wasted and the time to recoup investment that much shorter.</p><p>What is wrong with exceptions from copyright, allowing \"free access\"?</p><p>Copyright should be the mechanism by which readers, viewers and listeners pay for books, films, music and other creative productions and their dissemination. \"Free access\" through exceptions or forced free use is in truth an \"author pays\" model. If authors choose to donate their work, that is admirable, but is different from taking it from them - which is what the copyright bill is doing in effect by legislating unworkable terms for contracts and peppering the copyright of authors with so many exceptions that they are the rule.</p><p>Why are international standards important?</p><p>First, let me spell out what \"breaching international standards\" means in practice: the bill, translated into the real world, will damage filmmakers, musicians, authors, TV productions and software businesses by diminishing access to publishing for authors locally, forcing them to publish for overseas audiences; it will reduce opportunities to receive royalties for future music and cause havoc for those composers and musicians who do in fact receive royalties now.</p><p>Second, respecting international standards and putting SA first actually go together. For SA to come \"first\", it needs to have a first-rate, up-to-date copyright act that benefits the creative sector.

It will sell the creative sector down the river and, if anything, benefit big tech companies that want to have a free ride on creative content. The bill will also cause SA to breach its international obligations, so the process as well as the outcome of adopting the bill will cause unnecessary diplomatic stress.</p><p>You may say: \"Why should I care, we have so many other problems?\" Or: \"What is copyright anyway?\" Or: \"SA first, who cares about international copyright laws?\"</p><p>Let me try and answer these valid questions.</p><p>You should care if you care for your children's job opportunities and for SA's future. Rapid technological progress means fierce competition for knowledge and knowledge workers, people who know how to thrive in and leverage the fourth industrial revolution with artificial intelligence and the internet of things.</p><p>South Africans will simply be denied access to the best jobs around the world if creativity and investment in copyright-protected content are unavailable due to bad legislation or over-regulation. The net effect will be that jobs existing will be lost to others and jobs that do not exist as yet will fail to land on South African shores.</p><p>What is \"copyright\"? Copyright is a form of intellectual property that protects expressions of ideas and benefits those who provide a diversity of cultural resources that are valuable in society.</p><p>These content items are determinants of the future success of any nation or region to become a strong player in the knowledge economy. Copyright is the rock on which both creative people (writers, musicians, actors, filmmakers) and producers (film, TV, music and book publishers, software houses) stand, the currency in which they trade.</p><p>\"Access\" in the 21st century is no longer just access to information but access to creative opportunity: the chance to express yourself and showcase your creativity and earn a living from it.</p><p>Adoption of the copyright bill will make it a lot harder for local publishers to publish authors, let alone offer decent advances or royalties, because the bill, with its overbroad exceptions that allow free copying, creates so much uncertainty over what copyright really protects.</p><p>The bill also threatens to invalidate contracts, so much so that record companies will be forced to turn many more new artists down. Ministerial regulations, if ever drafted, will force rigid, bureaucratic and inflexible terms and conditions over which parties will have no say. So, better to wait for those terms than to offer a fairly negotiated set of terms and conditions or agree on contracts in other countries for other audiences - a knowledge emigration in the making.</p><p>Agreements will also be limited to 25 years, when the average writer needs four to six books to break through and perhaps only that sixth book becomes a long-seller and the basis for a film or TV series. By then all the years spent on promoting the first five books will have been wasted and the time to recoup investment that much shorter.</p><p>What is wrong with exceptions from copyright, allowing \"free access\"?</p><p>Copyright should be the mechanism by which readers, viewers and listeners pay for books, films, music and other creative productions and their dissemination. \"Free access\" through exceptions or forced free use is in truth an \"author pays\" model. If authors choose to donate their work, that is admirable, but is different from taking it from them - which is what the copyright bill is doing in effect by legislating unworkable terms for contracts and peppering the copyright of authors with so many exceptions that they are the rule.</p><p>Why are international standards important?</p><p>First, let me spell out what \"breaching international standards\" means in practice: the bill, translated into the real world, will damage filmmakers, musicians, authors, TV productions and software businesses by diminishing access to publishing for authors locally, forcing them to publish for overseas audiences; it will reduce opportunities to receive royalties for future music and cause havoc for those composers and musicians who do in fact receive royalties now.</p><p>Second, respecting international standards and putting SA first actually go together. For SA to come \"first\", it needs to have a first-rate, up-to-date copyright act that benefits the creative sector. Having sound laws on copyright is simply the price of entry a nation pays to compete for talent. Respecting world standards of copyright protection in the digital world is no contradiction to offering world-class opportunities for creators and knowledge workers: it is a precondition.</p><p>Ironically, the bill's contradicting of international norms is directly contrary to the cabinet's aspirations as decided on December 5 2018 - a decision to ratify three treaties on copyright (known as WCT, WPPT and the Beijing Treaty). Also, in the words of the National Development Plan: \"The creative sector should be supported by government and by the private sector as a sector that has great potential for growth and job creation over and above its role of facilitating dialogue for nation building.\" But the DTI, unperturbed, ploughs on with its defective copyright bill that goes the other way.</p><p>You may say: \"So what? Why should I care when SA has so many other issues to address?\"</p><p>The answer is that everything in this 21st century is connected: it is the key to employment, the economy, progress and - crucially for SA - a constructive way out of the identity politics and ghosts of SA's past. All depends on getting SA's copyright legislation right. Withdraw the bill and redraft a bill that respects international standards and benefits creators, producers and society.</p><p>Lavizzari is an attorney specialising in copyright law, licensing and litigation</p><p>The bill contradicts the National Development Plan, says the author.

It will sell the creative sector down the river and, if anything, benefit big tech companies that want to have a free ride on creative content. The bill will also cause SA to breach its international obligations, so the process as well as the outcome of adopting the bill will cause unnecessary diplomatic stress.</p><p>You may say: \"Why should I care, we have so many other problems?\" Or: \"What is copyright anyway?\" Or: \"SA first, who cares about international copyright laws?\"</p><p>Let me try and answer these valid questions.</p><p>You should care if you care for your children's job opportunities and for SA's future. Rapid technological progress means fierce competition for knowledge and knowledge workers, people who know how to thrive in and leverage the fourth industrial revolution with artificial intelligence and the internet of things.</p><p>South Africans will simply be denied access to the best jobs around the world if creativity and investment in copyright-protected content are unavailable due to bad legislation or over-regulation. The net effect will be that jobs existing will be lost to others and jobs that do not exist as yet will fail to land on South African shores.</p><p>What is \"copyright\"? Copyright is a form of intellectual property that protects expressions of ideas and benefits those who provide a diversity of cultural resources that are valuable in society.</p><p>These content items are determinants of the future success of any nation or region to become a strong player in the knowledge economy. Copyright is the rock on which both creative people (writers, musicians, actors, filmmakers) and producers (film, TV, music and book publishers, software houses) stand, the currency in which they trade.</p><p>\"Access\" in the 21st century is no longer just access to information but access to creative opportunity: the chance to express yourself and showcase your creativity and earn a living from it.</p><p>Adoption of the copyright bill will make it a lot harder for local publishers to publish authors, let alone offer decent advances or royalties, because the bill, with its overbroad exceptions that allow free copying, creates so much uncertainty over what copyright really protects.</p><p>The bill also threatens to invalidate contracts, so much so that record companies will be forced to turn many more new artists down. Ministerial regulations, if ever drafted, will force rigid, bureaucratic and inflexible terms and conditions over which parties will have no say. So, better to wait for those terms than to offer a fairly negotiated set of terms and conditions or agree on contracts in other countries for other audiences - a knowledge emigration in the making.</p><p>Agreements will also be limited to 25 years, when the average writer needs four to six books to break through and perhaps only that sixth book becomes a long-seller and the basis for a film or TV series. By then all the years spent on promoting the first five books will have been wasted and the time to recoup investment that much shorter.</p><p>What is wrong with exceptions from copyright, allowing \"free access\"?</p><p>Copyright should be the mechanism by which readers, viewers and listeners pay for books, films, music and other creative productions and their dissemination. \"Free access\" through exceptions or forced free use is in truth an \"author pays\" model. If authors choose to donate their work, that is admirable, but is different from taking it from them - which is what the copyright bill is doing in effect by legislating unworkable terms for contracts and peppering the copyright of authors with so many exceptions that they are the rule.</p><p>Why are international standards important?</p><p>First, let me spell out what \"breaching international standards\" means in practice: the bill, translated into the real world, will damage filmmakers, musicians, authors, TV productions and software businesses by diminishing access to publishing for authors locally, forcing them to publish for overseas audiences; it will reduce opportunities to receive royalties for future music and cause havoc for those composers and musicians who do in fact receive royalties now.</p><p>Second, respecting international standards and putting SA first actually go together. For SA to come \"first\", it needs to have a first-rate, up-to-date copyright act that benefits the creative sector. Having sound laws on copyright is simply the price of entry a nation pays to compete for talent. Respecting world standards of copyright protection in the digital world is no contradiction to offering world-class opportunities for creators and knowledge workers: it is a precondition.</p><p>Ironically, the bill's contradicting of international norms is directly contrary to the cabinet's aspirations as decided on December 5 2018 - a decision to ratify three treaties on copyright (known as WCT, WPPT and the Beijing Treaty). Also, in the words of the National Development Plan: \"The creative sector should be supported by government and by the private sector as a sector that has great potential for growth and job creation over and above its role of facilitating dialogue for nation building.\" But the DTI, unperturbed, ploughs on with its defective copyright bill that goes the other way.</p><p>You may say: \"So what? Why should I care when SA has so many other issues to address?\"</p><p>The answer is that everything in this 21st century is connected: it is the key to employment, the economy, progress and - crucially for SA - a constructive way out of the identity politics and ghosts of SA's past. All depends on getting SA's copyright legislation right. Withdraw the bill and redraft a bill that respects international standards and benefits creators, producers and society.</p><p>Lavizzari is an attorney specialising in copyright law, licensing and litigation</p><p>The bill contradicts the National Development Plan, says the author.

It's become clear, watching these lobbyists in action, that they will say absolutely anything, no matter how ridiculous, if they think it will lead to getting their beloved Article 13, where the sole purpose is to fundamentally change the internet from a communications medium, in which anyone can share anything they create, to a fully broadcast medium, where everything must first be licensed. Obviously, the legacy copyright companies want this badly, because they're in the business of licensing. And, if everyone suddenly needs to get licenses, suddenly they become relevant again. But, as we mentioned last week, those same lobbyists are freaking out[2] that EU regulators might possibly add a \"safe harbor\" to Article 13. Even with a safe harbor, Article 13 is a problem, but without a safe harbor it's a disaster. </p><p>The \"safe harbor\" would just mean that if internet companies follow specific steps to rid their platforms of infringing works, then they can't get sued. But the copyright players badly want to be able to sue, because that's how they rid the internet of this amateur competition -- by making it too costly to continue to host. But in one of the letters sent last week, by the movie and sports industries, they made an odd argument against the safe harbor. Hilariously, they claim that a safe harbor would change copyright law, and the purpose of Article 13 is to codify existing case law. Really:The initial goal of Article 13 was to codify the existing case-law in a way that would enable right holders to better control the exploitation of their content vis a vis certain OCSSPs which currently wrongfully claim they benefit from the liability privilege of Article 14 ECD. Unfortunately, the Value Gap provision has mutated in such a way that it now creates a new liability privilege for big platforms and therefore even further strengthens the role of OCSSPs to the direct detriment of rightholders.First of all, this is a completely laughable attempt to rewrite history. The E-Commerce Directive's Article 14 contains safe harbors that have always been held to apply to internet service providers. But, still, it's odd to see them claiming that Article 13 isn't supposed to do anything new. Apparently, however, this new message didn't make it to all the lobbyists working on this thing (either that, or they just don't care one bit if they give conflicting messages, as long as they get what they want). Neil Turkewitz, a former RIAA VP, who was a huge part of the RIAA push to dismantle the internet bit by bit over the past few decades, has written up some crazy rant about Article 13, where he makes exactly the opposite argument[3] that his buddies in the film and TV industries were making. Rather than merely codifying existing law, Turkewitz wants you to know that Article 13 is a wonderful new idea:Articles 11 and 13 are designed to create markets where none presently exist, or are marred by unfair competition\u200a\u2014\u200ato breathe life into property interests that are themselves protected under international law.This is obviously crazy as well and has no basis in reality. There is no \"unfair competition.\" What Neil and his buddies consider \"unfair competition\" is any competition in which the deck isn't stacked in massive favor for the record labels. Anything that allows an open internet, where there is competition and artists can (*gasp*) go direct to the audiences they want, and explore new business models, is an abomination that must be destroyed. And the best way is to call it \"unfair competition.\" Still, these two arguments can't go together. Is Article 13 codifying existing law, as the MPA says? Or is it creating new markets where none presently exist, as per the ex(?) RIAA guy? Once again, these guys are showing why you can't trust a single word that they say. They will say absolutely anything to get their way and fundamentally take away the open internet. On a separate note, Turkewitz's laughable article gets more laughable the more you read. I particularly enjoy this part:But regardless on one's views of existing safe harbors, one thing is clear\u200a\u2014\u200aCongress and the Administration should refrain from locking in what is essentially the beta version of internet governance\u200a\u2014\u200arules adopted at the dawn of the commercial internet.If you know anything about the past three decades that Turkewitz spent at the RIAA, one of his focuses was doing exactly what he's now complaining should not be done. He was a key player in pushing the worst aspects of copyright law into every international trade agreement, locking in bad ideas such that they couldn't be changed -- in particular the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA. For him to now whine about an attempt to use the same mechanisms to include the \"protective\" elements for user-rights and free speech in the form of the safe harbors of the DMCA is particularly bold. It's amazing anyone takes him seriously.Permalink[4] | Comments[5] | Email This Story[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181212/07074641205/legacy-copyright-industries-lobbying-hard-eu-copyright-directive-while-pretending-that-only-google-is-lobbying.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181212/07074641205/legacy-copyright-industries-lobbying-hard-eu-copyright-directive-while-pretending-that-only-google-is-lobbying.shtml</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181212/07323441206/tv-sports-movie-companies-still-freaking-out-that-eu-copyright-directive-might-include-safe-harbor-internet-platforms.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181212/07323441206/tv-sports-movie-companies-still-freaking-out-that-eu-copyright-directive-might-include-safe-harbor-internet-platforms.shtml</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@nturkewitz_56674/a-master-class-in-deception-analysis-of-ccias-submission-on-a-possible-us-eu-trade-agreement-a66ac85fd572\">https://medium.com/@nturkewitz_56674/a-master-class-in-deception-analysis-of-ccias-submission-on-a-possible-us-eu-trade-agreement-a66ac85fd572</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181220/23104941277/copyright-industry-lobbyists-cant-even-get-their-story-straight-article-13-does-it-expand-copyright-keep-it-same.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181220/23104941277/copyright-industry-lobbyists-cant-even-get-their-story-straight-article-13-does-it-expand-copyright-keep-it-same.shtml</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181220/23104941277/copyright-industry-lobbyists-cant-even-get-their-story-straight-article-13-does-it-expand-copyright-keep-it-same.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181220/23104941277/copyright-industry-lobbyists-cant-even-get-their-story-straight-article-13-does-it-expand-copyright-keep-it-same.shtml#comments</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181220/23104941277/copyright-industry-lobbyists-cant-even-get-their-story-straight-article-13-does-it-expand-copyright-keep-it-same.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181220/23104941277/copyright-industry-lobbyists-cant-even-get-their-story-straight-article-13-does-it-expand-copyright-keep-it-same.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT1023051545430051201251764500124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V18-TTN1-F03R-N2C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1109\"/><timeReceived>10:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 21, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Other ideas include a 'digital licence fee' - paid for by big tech companies and internet providers - and publishing data on BBC employees' social class. </p><p>The Conservatives said the 'internet tax' would increase consumers' bills. Corbyn attacks press over spy 'smears'[2] Corbyn wreath row explained[3] Speaking on Thursday (23 August) in the Alternative MacTaggart lecture, Corbyn said the British press is 'the least trusted press in Europe'. He said he wants greater investment in investigative, public interest journalism. Existing not-for-profit news organizations, like the Bureau for Investigative Journalism, could be given charitable status, he said. This 'public interest media fund' could be paid for either through a content sharing and advertising revenue agreement with Google, similar to that agreed in France or Belgium in 2013. Or, if it is not possible, he said a Labour government would be prepared to explore a one-off tax on the profits of the market-leading search engine and other platforms. Corbyn also said: He wants a 'dogged' local media with the 'money and time' to work on stories. He said quality journalism 'requires decent pay', citing statistics which show 24% of journalists earn less than 20,000 a year; journalists in the private sector could elect their editors to help 'make them accountable to their staff' as well as corporate bosses, and; new 'news co-operatives' could be created to report on local government, private contractors operating public services, and regulated bodies. 'The best journalism takes on the powerful, in the corporate world as well as government and helps create an informed public,' he said. The Labour leader, who has been subject to fierce attacks by sections of the British press and has criticised leading tech firms over tax avoidance and data misuse, claimed journalists are being 'held back' by media tycoons and, in the case of the BBC, by excessive state influence. Corbyn also suggested a series of proposals for the BBC, including publishing the social class of 'all creators of BBC content, whether in-house or external'. Responsibility for deciding the licence fee could be taken away from ministers and handed to an independent body. And he said the digital top-up to the licence fee from tech giants could help reduce the cost of the licence fee for poorer households. He also suggested: BBC staff and licence-fee payers could elect some BBC Board members which he said would reduce political influence; national and regional BBC boards could be expanded with quotas for women and minority groups to 'help decentralise the BBC', and; a publicly-owned 'sister organisation to the BBC' could be created called the British Digital Corporation, to provide information and entertainment to rival Netflix and Amazon.

This could dovetail nicely with global politics as a few key leaders -Putin, Xi and Trump come to mind -might create a global oligarchy, dividing up the pie as they see fit. After a while it would be hard to tell them apart, so closely aligned might they be.</p><p>Of course, nothing is for sure, but if you follow the trends, big brother will be manifest. Take Microsoft. It is the most valuable firm in America with a global reach, long enough to write a new constitution both politically and economically if it sees the need.</p><p>Cut a deal with the tech lads and they, too, will be able to control their citizens down to the toilet paper they use. It really is incredible.</p><p>Because, once a government has the wherewithal to track the virus and deal with it accordingly, it will then have the clout to muscle in new laws of regulation and control. What is currently called exploitative capitalism, will be re-labelled as essential capitalism.</p><p>Power will no longer be with the people. Only a few will command the destinies of the many.</p><p>Take Donald Trump - the world's most unpopular leader. But, imagine, never before has one man so firmly established his reach everywhere. He is effectively remaking the American government into his image, What have been mainstays with the American way of life for the past 250 years are coming to an end, never to return. This coming election will be his to lose for in many ways he has already won, his methods and techniques largely invisible to the public eye.</p><p>It's scary, but already, things are falling into place to make it a possibility, the coronavirus being a priceless gift to make it real.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>/ (See hardcopy for photo); </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAILYM-406777761KEDM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAILYM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYB-DJX1-JC4C-T10G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Daily Miner &amp; News (Kenora) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Miner &amp; News (Kenora)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 21, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>great,event,winners,losers,without,shadow</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST0008XMR</classCode><className>LAW &amp; LEGAL SYSTEM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The data would be strictly used for the benefit of public organizations combating the virus, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Several other countries have debatedsimilar measures. </p><p>The head of Germany's public healthorganization, the Robert Koch Institute, has suggested[3] that collecting the data could be an effective approach to beating the virusbut this would likely conflict with European Union data privacy regulations.The Attorney General of Israel has [4]'approved the use of cyber measures to track patients' phones,' which would allow the country's domestic intelligence agency to monitor cases by geolocating their smartphones.Iran introduced a mobile app[5] to help individuals check for coronavirus symptoms. It was later learned thatthe app was used by the Iranian government to spy on its citizens and collect their smartphone data. Google removed the app from the Play Store. There have been over 196,000 coronavirus cases around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University[6], with the global death tollat more than 7,869. In the United States, there have been over 5,000 cases, with at least 100 deaths.
