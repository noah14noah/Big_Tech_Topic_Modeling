American Express,</emphasis> and the court ruled that American Express's attempts to keep merchants from discouraging use of Amex cards, and thus saving the Amex merchant card fees over competitors with lesser merchant fees, was not a violation of antitrust.</p><p>The decision upheld a ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had overturned a district court decision.</p><p>It was another antitrust court defeat for the federal government (joined by some states), which had argued that Amex's anti-steering (nondis-crimination) provisions in contracts with merchants violated the antitrust. Justice also recently lost its challenge to the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger.</p><p>Sandeep Vaheesan, policy counsel at the Open Markets Institute (OMI), said that for antitrust plaintiffs, \"the new legal burdens further reduce the already slim chances of success in court. The costs and complexity plaguing antitrust litigation will only become significantly worse following [the] decision.\"</p><p>The court said Amex's policy of preventing merchants from steering customers to other cards without fees did not unreasonably restrain trade. In fact, they said, anti-steering provisions \"can prevent retailers from free-riding and thus increase the availability of 'tangible or intangible services or promotional efforts'\" that enhance competition and consumer welfare.</p><p>\"Perhaps most importantly, anti-steering provisions do not prevent Visa, MasterCardor Discover from competing against Amex by offering lower merchant fees or promoting their broader merchant acceptance.\"</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"p181\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>A Supreme Court ruling on credit card fees could lead to lead to less antitrust scrutiny for big tech firms.</p><p>Writing for the four dissenting liberal justices, Steven Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, <person><nameText>Sonya Sotomayor </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Elena Kagan, </nameText></person>Breyer wrote that the majority decision was contrary to basic antitrust law and ignores evidence from the district trial.</p><p>\"If American Express's merchant fees are so high that merchants successfully induce their customers to use other cards, American Expresscan remedy that problem by lowering those fees or by spending more on cardholder rewards so that cardholders decline such requests,\" Breyer wrote. \"What it may not do is demand contractual protection from price competition.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Party Line Ruling</emphasis></p><p>If that is how the anti-steering provisions work, then yes they can, according to the majority, which obviously did not see it that way.</p><p>\"U.S. law has traditionally viewed credit card corporations (such as American Express) and communications corporations (like AT&amp;T) as intermediaries and facilitators of other people's business,\" OMI said. \"This decision, however, establishes these platforms as de facto regulators of these markets.\"</p><p>Gene Kimmelman, CEO of Public Knowledge, said the decision will \"open the door for communications and internet platforms to continue building dominant market positions virtually impenetrable to innovation from smaller competitors.\" It puts an exclamation point on the need for Congress to step in, given that it will make it \"significantly\" tougher to police tech platforms for antitrust, he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCHNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCHNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SP5-M261-DY5H-1182-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241792</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Multichannel News</publicationName><volume>Vol. XXXIX</volume><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 2, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00023A6</classCode><className>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000266V</classCode><className>VISA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6141 PERSONAL CREDIT INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE &amp;

The spray and pray approach saw marketers complete their market research, create the message they wanted to send, and then fire out an email to everyone on their list, with no attempt to personalize the messages. The uptake of artificial intelligence (AI), however, in targeting and personalizing messages has been changing this practice. Now, when marketers send out an email, says Pratap Khedkar, managing principal, ZS Associates, \"they can actually tell who opened it, when they opened it, whether they clicked through to the second page or click on any of the links.\" Accordingly, the ability to use these data and insights to understand what customers need, what kinds of information they want, and how they want to consume is driving a marked improvement in the way pharma engages with physicians.</p><p>For James Anderson, chief customer officer at Aktana, a company providing AI-enabled decision support for the global life sciences industry, \"the growth in this area has been insane.\" Aktana's biggest challenge, he says, \"is keeping up with the increase in customers we have.\" While the use of AI in marketing is not a new concept, what has changed over the last couple of years, explains Paul Shawah, senior VP of commercial strategy at Veeva, is the ability \"to bring data together from multiple different sources and in a way that's ready for AI to generate insights and guidance on messaging for specific customers.\" Anderson agrees: \"Ten years or so ago, pharma companies were starting to get their data warehouses together. Now the large companies, especially, have a lot of data that is ready to use. Combine that with the advances in AI, analytics, our ability to compute things quickly, and that leads to the big rush we're seeing now.\"</p><p>For Khedkar, harmonizing the way the marketing channels are managed has become a crucial factor. \"The job of sending these things out channel by channel used to be outsourced. You had an email vendor - all the emails got sent to them along with the target list and they managed it.\" But with another party dealing with, say, iPhone alerts and another dealing with the reps, there were two or three other channels being managed independently.</p><p>\"Companies have realized that you have to harmonize, which means one entity has to be in control of all these different channels to the same doctor,\" says Khedkar. This is where AI is beginning to help, he adds. \"The technology has given pharma back the control of how it can actually modulate when different channels get used, and in what order they get used with the same doctor. You cannot harmonize manually, because you don't know what type of cadence, what type of timing, what type of sequences actually work with this particular HCP-that's all data driven.\"</p><p>With healthcare practitioners increasingly composed of millennials-for whom digital technology has long been not just a tool of work but, in many respects, a way of life-it should perhaps follow that the new developments in messaging are met with more active engagement by the younger generation than the baby boomers of old.</p><p>Khedkar has found, however, that \"it's much more about how many years the physician has been in practice, rather than the physician's age.\" Anderson adds, \"I know physicians who are older and more tech savvy than me; I know younger physicians who aren't as tech savvy. It all comes back to the individual preference. And we're getting to the point where you don't have to use proxies like age to figure those things out.\"</p><p>A more digitally savvy audience is by no means an \"easier\" one, however. According to Krishna Kadiyala, vice president, head of commercial operations and innovation at therapeutic antibody company MorphoSys, \"customers have raised expectations in terms of how they consume and how they disseminate knowledge.\" The explosion of digital and social media channels, he says, is forcing companies to redefine their engagement strategies and shaping how they can be better partners to their customers.</p><p>Khedkar has observed variances in specialty more than in the ages of healthcare professionals (HCPs). \"For example, rheumatologists and dermatologists remain very accessible to sales reps,\" he says. \"On the flip side, oncologists are much less accessible. They are much more likely to open emails and much less inclined to talk to sales reps.\" Khedkar notes that dermatologists are still \"very open to talking to sales reps, but their email open rate is only around 4.9%.\" He adds: \"AI and data has to be able to exploit all this information.\"</p><p>The evolving rep (and MSL)</p><p>Sales reps may be relieved to hear that certain specialty physicians still very much value their physical presence. Indeed, in the face of increasingly sophisticated automated marketing, reports of the sales rep's death have been greatly exaggerated. Large pharma is getting more comfortable with the idea that this technology is helping to make the rep more effective, says Khedkar.</p><p>While sales rep numbers have dropped compared with a decade ago, he doesn't see any further major disruption to the numbers. \"The access situation has stabilized, and the number of reps now is about 70,000,\" explains Khedkar. \"The peak used to be about 103,000, so it has come down a lot. I don't think the numbers will continue to drop- the 60,000-70,000 is here to stay.\" But with AI's mark on the sales and medical field teams proving to be an indelible one, the rep role will have to evolve. \"Not by leaps and bounds,\" Khedkar goes on. \"Maybe 20% to 30% of the reps will not be able to do their job all that well. But I think the majority of them will have to adopt this technology so they can use it as an additional arrow in their quiver.\"</p><p>Indeed, at the heart of the pharma-physician relationship, the rep's role will remain vital. Khedkar points to a statistic about emails sent to doctors. If the email is forwarded to a doctor by a rep-with the rep's email address and signature-instead of a third party, the doctor is six times more likely to open it.</p><p>For Shawah, AI is having two big, positive effects on the sales role. One is the \"reinforcing of good behaviors.\" He explains, \"The AI initiatives that have sprung up over the last four to five years have generally coincided with field teams having access to more digital ways of engaging with their customers, like remote meetings. Before that, most field personnel did not engage with their customers digitally. AI has reinforced the use of these new channels and when to use them, how to use them, and how they become part of their customer engagement process.\"</p><p>The second impact is where AI surfaces insights that the customer account team \"would never have known,\" says Shawah. As an example, \"a key account manager may not be aware of something that has happened with their customer, or even the patient; perhaps they get an alert that patients associated with a particular specialty pharmacy are delayed receiving their medications because of a reimbursement issue. Using AI to surface those insights, the account manager can then intervene and becomes more of a trusted advisor.\"</p><p>Salvatore Paolozza, director of sales operations at Antares Pharma, agrees. \"Basically, the intelligence that we're giving to our reps is a lot further advanced than it was before,\" he says. Antares is an adopter of Andi, Veeva's AI application for customer relationship management. \"What the application brings,\" Paolozza explains, \"is greater flexibility and greater interoperability between sources. It completes the picture, if you like.\" Crucial here is AI's ability to learn, he says. \"We're moving out of a coding environment to more of a learning environment. These applications can learn with time what they should and shouldn't surface up.\"</p><p>What to adopt next?</p><p>To stay in tune with the advances and possibilities of new applications and algorithms, pharma is keeping a close eye on the activities of the big tech companies.</p><p>No one can attend a conference on using technology to communicate with HCPs without hearing about Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Google, or, to a lesser extent, Facebook. Pharma is some way behind these digitally native companies, of course; says Khedkar, \"that's partly why the industry is looking to them. The question is, what else can it adopt?\"</p><p>Some of the algorithms coming into pharma marketing and medical communications are indeed being adopted from Netflix and the like. Khedkar points to an algorithm called collaborative filtering, which is the way Netflix figures out what movie to recommend to individual viewers. \"We took that algorithm, which is in the public domain, and modified it to work for pharma to identify specifically what type of content to send to a particular physician,\" he says. \"As well as figuring out which channel you like, it's crucial to figure out what content to send. Should you send an efficacy message? An affordability message? A safety message?\"</p><p>The problem with adopting such an approach, however, is that pharma \"has gotten spoiled with sales data; they think that if they don't have 90% of the data right, then nothing can be done,\" says Khedkar. This is a mindset that needs to change, the executive believes. \"What data do you think Netflix has?\" he says. \"When Netflix looks at the ratings from people who watched a certain movie, they have 2% of the data. What they're doing is extrapolating the 98% they don't know from the 2% they do know.\"</p><p>Pharma has to get more comfortable working with \"poorer or incomplete data,\" says Khedkar, and let AI do its work. \"The AI team is important because the data is not going to be perfect. Pharma needs to be a little bit more courageous in using AI on the data it has, because AI will compensate for the holes in the data.\"</p><p>Of course, pharma marketers are dealing with a considerably smaller audience than Netflix, maybe a pool of 10,000 physicians rather than millions of viewers. But for Khedkar, the \"spray and pray\" approach that turns physicians off is a much bigger risk in the smaller pool. \"Both extremes are bad-hesitating and not doing anything because it's a limited pool or opting for spray and pray,\" he says. \"You have to avoid both extremes and find the happy medium, which is where AI and data comes in.\"</p><p>While attempting to emulate some of the Netflix or Amazon methods is ambitious, pharma can look to other, more regulated industries for a more cautious approach. Says Shawah, \"We often look to financial services because they are one of the best industries at identifying really valuable, high-net-worth customers and then managing them through the relationship life cycle.\"</p><p>He adds that in the telecom industry, the wireless service providers, for example, have a wealth of information about a customer before that customer walks into a physical store. \"They know everything the customer's been doing on their phone; they may know if the customer is at risk of moving to a different carrier, or whether the customer is over or under his or her data limits,\" says Shawah. \"They're able to use that information to have very targeted conversations.\"</p><p>Some industries are not always relevant, adds Shawah, \"but it's important to look outside of life sciences as much as we like to look inside of the life sciences,\" he points out. \"There's no monopoly on good ideas and where they come from.\"</p><p>All the advancing algorithms and technologies notwithstanding, the pharma industry must remain mindful of \"the human being in the middle.\" In engaging HCPs, drugmakers are not dealing with a machine-to-machine interface; it is machine to human. \"Because of this linkage, the data, the interactions, and the nuances will never be perfectly captured,\" contends Khedkar. AI provides \"just a different model.\"</p><p>There will always be an element of complexity and imperfection, he adds. \"It's about balancing the personal and the non-personal.\"</p><p>The key to success in using AI to engage physicians is making that marriage more fruitful.</p><p>\"Pharma needs to be a little bit more courageous in using AI on the data it has, because AI will compensate for the holes.\"</p><p>JULIAN UPTON is Pharm Exec's European and Online Editor.

After years of huge private funding rounds, many of the so-called tech disruptors are expected to launch initial public offerings (IPOs). These listings are some of the most anticipated deals of the decade, but they are not without controversy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most of the tech disruptors have yet to turn a profit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although revenues have grown at staggering rates, they have invariably been eaten up by swelling costs, raising questions about whether they can ever turn this trend around. Regulators have taken note. As governance has become an increasingly important factor for investors, the 'key man' risk - whereby the company's fortunes are intrinsically linked to a high-profile CEO - and propensity for 'dual-class' share set-ups are red flags for many investors.</p><p>More so than for any other type of IPO, big tech offers the chance to enter the next $100bn-plus market cap tech giant at a juicy discount. But in a sector where the divide between the nags and the thoroughbreds is at its widest, investors need to consider carefully which horse to bet on.</p><p>\"There has been a tendency to lump the tech disruptors together in a group, but this is very misleading. They have very individual profiles, capital needs and business models, so it is important to consider them company by company,\" says James Gautrey, an international equities portfolio manager and tech specialist at Schroders.</p><p>FEAR OF MISSING OUT Ride-hailing apps Lyft and Uber, social media platform Pinterest, home rental marketplace Airbnb, and work messaging board Slack. These apps have been a part of many people's daily routine for years and it has become difficult to imagine life without them. Despite their highly public profile, none of them were publicly listed as of early March 2019.</p><p>In a sense, these companies have been 'semi-private' for years. \"They are already doing the majority of what listed companies do; they produce annual reports, their merger and acquisition [M&amp;A] actions are highly scrutinised and their CEOs have star quality,\" says Sebastian Lawrence, a banker on Investec's telecommunications, media and technology team.</p><p>There has been much ado about valuations, both during private funding rounds and in the lead-up to an IPO. \"The valuations for these businesses are pretty transparent, which is unusual, and they have been in the limelight for so long that people are very familiar with the brands,\" says Tom Johnson, head of equity capital markets (ECM) for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Barclays.</p><p>Lyft wrapped up its IPO in late March, raising more than $2bn, Pinterest had wrapped up bookbuilding in mid-April, while Uber and Slack have filed listing documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But why are they all coming to market now? \"A lot of these names have been in the pipeline for a long time; these IPOs have been anticipated for a couple of years,\" says Mark Hantho, chairman of global investment banking and global head of ECM at Deutsche Bank. After what have sometimes been record-breaking private funding rounds, many of the tech unicorns have reached a point in their lifecycle where an exit is the logical - or only - next step. \"A huge amount of capital has been brought in from various investors at different times, so eventually they will want liquidity,\" says Mr Johnson.</p><p>In the IPO market, it is not uncommon to see several similar companies come to the market at the same time. \"There is a feeling of needing to get on the merry-goround before the music stops. The fear of missing out can be a driver in this sense,\" says Maegen Morrison, a corporate finance partner at Hogan Lovells, who specialises in ECM. Though if one such company performs badly in the aftermarket, it can cast a pall over other upcoming listings, she cautions.</p><p>EUROPE'S SLOW GOING Economic pressures in Europe have led to the worst start of the year for IPOs in a decade in 2019 and the government shutdown in the US stopped issuers from coming to market. Yet, if even half of the anticipated floats happen, 2019 could be a record year in terms of global volume.</p><p>IPOs are a lagging indicator of the wider economy, according to Mr Hantho, who says: \"Pundits are predicting a slowdown, which has hampered ECM activity somewhat, but it hasn't hit yet. Markets are still strong, so the wave of tech IPOs in this window is not so surprising in this context.\" Mr Johnson agrees that economic forecasts are not ideal, but that the market is still good. The growth for the big tech companies is structural and therefore less reliant on macro conditions, he adds.</p><p>\"We are 10 years into a bull market; the odds of a major correction occurring in the next few years are increasing materially. It makes sense to list now as the window may well shut in a year's time,\" says Mr Gautrey.</p><p>There will be cross-comparisons between some of the tech companies if they have converging business models. \"If the comparison is not favourable, then there is still a very supportive M&amp;A market, ready to scoop up businesses,\" says Mr Hantho. Big tech has frequently used M&amp;A as a way to 'stay on top' by buying competitors or bolting on new products developed by others.</p><p>WEATHER GAUGE The first big tech company out of the gates with regards to an IPO was ride-hailing app Lyft, towards the end of the first quarter of 2019. Smaller than its direct competitor Uber and geographically restricted to North America, Lyft was keen to list first. Demand for shares went through the roof as soon as the bookbuild opened, allowing the syndicate to price the deal at $72 per share, well above the initial top range $68.</p><p>Aftermarket trading started well, with a nice pop on the first day, trading mostly 10% higher than the debut price. However, since the start of April the stock has mostly declined and now stands at $56.</p><p>The IPO market has been relatively fragile recently and if a few companies perform badly in the aftermarket, it can quickly put a damper on future listings, according to Mr Johnson. Uber has since filed for an IPO and is aiming to list in the second week of May. It is difficult to gauge at this stage whether Lyft's less than stellar performance is helpful or a hindrance to Uber.</p><p>For IPOs in this sector at these high valuations to do well post-IPO, they tend to require sustained investment from institutional investors. Lower quality accounts typically sell as soon as the deal is printed, to cash in if it pops or to cut losses if it does not. \"Speaking from experience, big institutional investors need to be prepared to pay 30% to 40% more on an already high IPO valuation in the aftermarket in order to fill their orders. So you need to be very convinced of the five-to 10-year prospects and real structural growth to do that,\" says Mr Gautrey.</p><p>Many of the IPO candidates are maturing and getting into lower growth patterns, according to Mr Hantho. \"Many of the IPOs will no doubt be successful, but the question is: realistically how much upside is there?\" he asks. Other tech giants listed at an earlier stage in their lifecycle, such as Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Google, so their growth curve has been long and steep.</p><p>ROAD TO PROFITABILITY So long as interest rates remain low, investors are more likely to take a punt on a hot tech disruptor, given that it may well end the year over 50% higher than its IPO price. Big sell-offs in 2018, first in February and then again in December, have reined in some of the more fanciful valuations, but new tech shares still do not come cheap. With such a full pipeline, opportunity cost is higher than ever, so fund managers are having to be careful in who they back.</p><p>Valuations on big tech companies are incredibly attractive, partly driven by the scarcity of high-growth companies coming to market, according to Mr Hantho. However, investors are looking at business models with more scrutiny than ever before, especially if companies are unproven and not yet profitable, he admits.</p><p>Lyft was hit by questions about its ability to turn a profit post-listing, bringing down its market value. Pinterest put out a price range which valued it slightly below its last funding round, but managed to price the IPO just above the $12bn valuation. \"When listed, there will be more pressure for these companies to have a clear path to profitability and to eventually self-fund growth,\" says Ms Morrison.</p><p>Investec's Mr Lawrence agrees that investors are increasingly concerned about future profitability, but argues that so long as the losses are incurred in the service of growth, they are less of an issue. \"Losses can be, and have been, turned into profits with relative ease before, especially when revenues are still growing very fast,\" he says. \"Investors are very pragmatic. They judge a company on its merits and tend to be tolerant if they understand the story and what the company is trying to achieve - it is all about the growth,\" Mr Johnson concurs.</p><p>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? Some unicorns may be closer to profitability than others. There has been a tendency to lump tech platforms together as if they all operate in the same way. In reality, they all operate in different sectors with different business models. As most of these businesses immediately reinvest most of their revenues after costs into marketing and sales efforts, margins are very important. And it turns out that not all unicorns are created equal.</p><p>\"The underlying economics and business models are very different in terms of margins and supplier power,\" says Mr Gautrey. Businesses such as Spotify and Apple Music come in at the bottom end of the margin ladder, as they rely on just three music suppliers that can tightly control pricing. Companies such as Uber come in the middle of the pack as they have relatively high costs and headcount, while the highest margins are to be found at the Appstore, because of Apple's ties to the iPhone, and Airbnb, which works with more than 3 million hosts and can set its own pricing.</p><p>The nature of cost bases also differs wildly among tech disruptors. Lyft has been subsidising rides for all of its seven-year existence, making investors question the sustainability of this practice. Uber has struggled with the same sort of questions, as well as the rising cost of drivers, who have pushed for more workers' rights. In the gig economy, the line between flexibility of employment and exploitation can be wafer-thin.</p><p>Regulators have been alarmed by the astronomical growth of the tech unicorns and the speed at which they are changing the landscape. In the wake of the recent terror attack in New Zealand, where footage of the massacre was live-streamed on Facebook and shared on YouTube, there have been calls for more regulation. The weight of regulatory pressure is so enormous that both Facebook and Google have hired tens of thousands of staff to manage and curate content, according to Mr Gautrey, who asks: \"How can a smaller company possibly afford that and stay on top of regulations?\" Uber and Airbnb have both fallen foul of local regulators, banning them from operating in certain regions, and regulators have turned their attention towards online marketplace monopolies, including platform goliath Amazon. Investors are concerned that regulators could take steps that would hamper future growth.</p><p>DISRUPTORS DISRUPTED A lot of capital is also being thrown at the development of new products, which can be hit or miss. Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork have often been referred to as 'disruptive tech', because they undercut traditional players in their respective sectors.</p><p>\"Switching costs for customers are really low, so it often comes down to which interface is more swish to sway customers,\" says Mr Gautrey. And there is always fresh venture capital available for the next disruptor. There is nothing to stop another disruptor from coming in and doing the same thing, according to Ms Morrison.</p><p>Some of the 'old guard' are using the disruptors' tactics to make a comeback. For instance, London black cabs have a ride hailing app of their own. \"Uber makes slim margins on its rides. If it needs to raise prices, then the main difference with traditional black cabs is that Uber can't move through traffic as fast,\" says Ms Morrison.</p><p>Uber's foray into self-driving cars has also been questioned by the investor community. It is hugely capital intensive and success is by no means guaranteed. It would be a huge win, however, if Uber could beat competitors to using driverless vehicles as it would eliminate its biggest cost: the drivers. However, as a recent fatal accident with a test-driver shows, important questions about who is liable for accidents and how to account for this risk are still to be answered.</p><p>The market has not yet forgotten the debacle around social media company Snap in March 2017. It listed at $17 per share, above its initial range, but plunged to as low as $5 in late 2018. The stock rallied by more than 100% this year, but is still hovering at 30% of its IPO price. Snap fell apart almost as soon as it listed, one banker says, adding that the market fundamentally underestimated how thoroughly Instagram's stories feature would undercut Snap's customer base from the start.</p><p>Smaller social media companies suffer from a lack of scope compared with a big player such as Facebook.</p><p>\"Twitter and Snap both cornered quite a niche audience, without expanding or growing their user bases much,\" says Mr Gautrey. Pinterest has sown-up the US stay-athome mum market, but in order for it to continue growing, it will need to appeal to other audiences, he adds. Even Facebook's top dog position is not guaranteed. The company has been hit by back-to-back scandals and privacy issues, from its Cambridge Analytica data revelation to a huge data breach that saw hackers obtain the personal information of 50 million users. Usage in Europe and the US dipped briefly, and though it has again picked up, questions remain about Facebook's long-term attraction, especially for younger generations who may not want to share a platform with parents and grandparents.</p><p>KEY MAN RISK Not long ago, Uber was Silicon Valley's biggest problem child. In 2017, co-founder and CEO at the time Travis Kalanick, known for his abrasive leadership style, was caught up in a storm of negative press over his bad behaviour. The company was accused of inaction on sexual harassment allegations, and of fostering a toxic macho culture. It was slapped with a fraud lawsuit by one of its early investors. Mr Kalanick stepped down in favour of Dara Khosrowshahi, formerly CEO at Expedia, who has steered the company into a more mature stage.</p><p>Uber is not the only big tech company that has been beleaguered on account of its CEO: Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook was called in front of the US Congress to testify on the topic of the right to privacy in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and several tweets have landed Tesla's 'top man', Elon Musk, in hot water with the SEC. In an age of engaged and aggressive activist investors, governance is top of the list of investor concerns. \"The cult around CEOs of start-ups is important for attracting private equity and venture capital funds, but they may not always have the most suitable personality type for a large listed company,\" says Ms Morrison.</p><p>Should investors pay a premium for the visionary entrepreneur at the helm or should they get a discount to account for the key man risk? \"Investors understand that a big reason the unicorns are famous is the brains behind them,\" says Mr Lawrence.</p><p>Mr Gautrey argues there needs to be a balance, which can be achieved by having a good bench of people behind the CEO. Key man risk is often overplayed in his opinion: Apple did not fall apart after the death of Steve Jobs, as he had a circle of strong people at the top to take over. Many tech companies have independent directors in place to prove good governance, Mr Hantho agrees.</p><p>DUAL-CLASS STRUGGLE Key man risk is more of a factor when companies decide to list with a dual-class share structure, whereby the class of shares sold in an IPO typically carry fewer voting rights, allowing entrepreneurs to retain an iron grip on control. Lyft employed this tactic in its recent listing, as did more established tech companies Facebook, Google and Alibaba.</p><p>Tellingly, Uber has opted not to use dual-class shares in its IPO filing. The company has been eager to show it has shrugged off the worst excesses some tech unicorns have been accused of. Rather than battling every competitor for market share in different geographies, current CEO Mr Khosrowshahi decided to acquire the market leader in the Middle East, Careem, for example.</p><p>While unloved and uncommon in Europe - the London Stock Exchange has refused to even consider introducing weighted voting rights - the practice is much more accepted among US investors. Yet even across the Atlantic investors have pushed back on dual-class share structures, according to Mr Hantho. \"Not enough to make it difficult for tech companies to list at the valuation they have been targeting,\" he adds: \"If it is a good investment, then investors will accept it.\"</p><p>\"This structure appeals to entrepreneurs as a tool for taking the company from private to public and managing that transition. In many cases, I don't think the founders necessarily see it as a permanent measure,\" says Mr Johnson.</p><p>This may be wishful thinking, according to Mr Gautrey. However, he says: \"It is a risk I am willing to take, if I trust the people in charge.\" It can be an advantageous set-up. He points to Google, which made two acquisitions in 2006 of little-known loss-making companies, paying a combined $1.7bn. \"Without the dualclass share structure in place, shareholders would have almost certainly voted both deals down,\" he says.</p><p>The acquisitions in question? YouTube and Android. \"Without these fabulous decisions, Google would only be half the company it is today,\" he concludes.</p><p>WHEN LISTED, THERE WILL BE MORE PRESSURE FOR THESE COMPANIES TO HAVE A CLEAR PATH TO PROFITABILITY AND TO EVENTUALLY SELF-FUND GROWTH Maegen Morrison</p><p>MARKETS ARE STILL STRONG, SO THE WAVE OF TECH IPOS THIS WINDOW IS NOT SO SURPRISING IN THIS CONTEXT Mark Hantho</p><p>THE VALUATIONS FOR THESE BUSINESSES ARE PRETTY TRANSPARENT, WHICH IS UNUSUAL, AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE LIMELIGHT FOR SO LONG THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BRANDS Tom Johnson</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANKER-148870680</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANKER2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W17-BWH1-DYTY-C4FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234197</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3084\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Banker</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59210\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

He's well known there from eight years as the governor next door. Patrick has to act fast: the deadline for entering the NH primary is this Friday, Nov. 15. We'll know soon if he's in or out.What Patrick obviously shares with Bloomberg (and millions of other Democrats) is a concern that Warren is like someone Trump would order up from Rent-a-Candidate, that is, she's the perfect size for the socialist clown costume Trump has ready for her in his armoire.Now, I have great respect for Warren. </p><p>I love the way she clawed her way up from near-poverty in Oklahoma. I admire her greatly for being super-intelligent, unpretentious, tough-minded and pretty much invincible on a Democratic debate stage.So, I'll let someone else's words encapsulate why she would likely not stand a chance in November of 2020 against Trump. Here's New York Times columnist Bret Stephens in an October 25 piece titled, \"Elizabeth Warren Wants to Lose Your Vote\":\"You don't have to think that fracking is an unalloyed blessing -- much less deny that tough safety standards are necessary -- to acknowledge its benefits. You might also argue that curbs on oil and gas production are needed both to preserve the environment and accelerate a transition to renewables. Fine.\"Yet it takes a peculiar sort of political audacity to pledge, as the Massachusetts senator did last month, to 'ban fracking -- everywhere.' Warren also favors a ban on fossil-fuel exports -- another U.S. industry that has seen dramatic growth in recent years -- and a 'total moratorium' on new fossil fuel leases on federal lands, which generate billions every year in federal and state tax revenue.\"American Indian tribes also got about $1 billion from those leases in 2018. Isn't the Warren campaign supposed to be about sticking it to richer Americans instead of poorer ones?\"That's a question that would-be Warren supporters might ask a little more insistently as she approaches front-runner status.\"Take health care. As an ethical matter, it may be defensible for Warren to argue that Medicare for All is fairer than the current system. As an economic matter, she could be right that overall costs will come down under her scheme. And as a political matter, it isn't surprising that she has been less than forthright about the middle-class tax increases her plan will require.\"But what about the fact that Warren isn't merely proposing a dramatic change in the way 170 million or so Americans obtain health insurance? She is advocating the abolition of an entire industry, one that employs approximately 550,000 people. Whatever one thinks of health-insurance companies (and most Americans seem satisfied with the coverage they have), isn't it worth wondering what these half-million workers might do with themselves after being put out of work -- or, as voters, what they might think of Warren's designs for their future?\"Then there's big tech, another industry Warren doesn't like and promises to 'break up' by turning Facebook, Amazon and Google into regulated utilities. For this task, involving some 800,000 workers and companies with about $500 billion in revenues, she has...a 1,700-word plan.\"Democrats ought not give Trump what he most desires in a Democratic opponent. That Deval Patrick feels that way -- and that he is seriously contemplating a leap into the race at this late date -- suggests that Warren's candidacy may never get stronger than it is today.And it seems that Democratic primary voters next year seem determined to oblige the presidentin November 2020 than Joe Biden or even Bernier Sanders.And Democrats; hence, Trump's squeeze play on UIt will be easier for Donald Trump to demonize Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders as Hence, he put the squeeze on Ukraine squeezed Ukraine to come up with dirt on Joe Biden because he'd like nothing better than to run against Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-MAPO1176591573529154393258762900218</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAPO-117659</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGK-CD71-F03R-N2P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><timeReceived>3:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Massachusetts Politics Blog</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Authority &amp;

Deval Patrick May Lead Strike from the Center Against Warren.</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nov 12, 2019( Massachusetts Politics Blog: <url normalizedValue=\"http://pretiminahan.blogspot.com/Delivered\">http://pretiminahan.blogspot.com/Delivered</url> by Newstex)  The reason for President Trump's Ukraine caper can be summed up in 10 words: Trump would rather run against Elizabeth Warren than Joe Biden.Amazingly, Democratic primary voters may grant the president his wish -- but not if the Mike Bloombergs and Deval Patricks of the world have their way.Yes, I said Deval Patrick.There were reports just a few hours ago that our former governor is reconsidering his decision not to seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, his good relationship with our senior U.S. Senator, Ms. Warren, notwithstanding.Were he to declare, Patrick would immediately become a contender in New Hampshire's first primary. He's well known there from eight years as the governor next door. Patrick has to act fast: the deadline for entering the NH primary is this Friday, Nov. 15. We'll know soon if he's in or out.What Patrick obviously shares with Bloomberg (and millions of other Democrats) is a concern that Warren is like someone Trump would order up from Rent-a-Candidate, that is, she's the perfect size for the socialist clown costume Trump has ready for her in his armoire.Now, I have great respect for Warren. </p><p>I love the way she clawed her way up from near-poverty in Oklahoma. I admire her greatly for being super-intelligent, unpretentious, tough-minded and pretty much invincible on a Democratic debate stage.So, I'll let someone else's words encapsulate why she would likely not stand a chance in November of 2020 against Trump. Here's New York Times columnist Bret Stephens in an October 25 piece titled, \"Elizabeth Warren Wants to Lose Your Vote\":\"You don't have to think that fracking is an unalloyed blessing -- much less deny that tough safety standards are necessary -- to acknowledge its benefits. You might also argue that curbs on oil and gas production are needed both to preserve the environment and accelerate a transition to renewables. Fine.\"Yet it takes a peculiar sort of political audacity to pledge, as the Massachusetts senator did last month, to 'ban fracking -- everywhere.' Warren also favors a ban on fossil-fuel exports -- another U.S. industry that has seen dramatic growth in recent years -- and a 'total moratorium' on new fossil fuel leases on federal lands, which generate billions every year in federal and state tax revenue.\"American Indian tribes also got about $1 billion from those leases in 2018. Isn't the Warren campaign supposed to be about sticking it to richer Americans instead of poorer ones?\"That's a question that would-be Warren supporters might ask a little more insistently as she approaches front-runner status.\"Take health care. As an ethical matter, it may be defensible for Warren to argue that Medicare for All is fairer than the current system. As an economic matter, she could be right that overall costs will come down under her scheme. And as a political matter, it isn't surprising that she has been less than forthright about the middle-class tax increases her plan will require.\"But what about the fact that Warren isn't merely proposing a dramatic change in the way 170 million or so Americans obtain health insurance? She is advocating the abolition of an entire industry, one that employs approximately 550,000 people. Whatever one thinks of health-insurance companies (and most Americans seem satisfied with the coverage they have), isn't it worth wondering what these half-million workers might do with themselves after being put out of work -- or, as voters, what they might think of Warren's designs for their future?\"Then there's big tech, another industry Warren doesn't like and promises to 'break up' by turning Facebook, Amazon and Google into regulated utilities. For this task, involving some 800,000 workers and companies with about $500 billion in revenues, she has...a 1,700-word plan.\"Democrats ought not give Trump what he most desires in a Democratic opponent. That Deval Patrick feels that way -- and that he is seriously contemplating a leap into the race at this late date -- suggests that Warren's candidacy may never get stronger than it is today.And it seems that Democratic primary voters next year seem determined to oblige the presidentin November 2020 than Joe Biden or even Bernier Sanders.And Democrats; hence, Trump's squeeze play on UIt will be easier for Donald Trump to demonize Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders as Hence, he put the squeeze on Ukraine squeezed Ukraine to come up with dirt on Joe Biden because he'd like nothing better than to run against Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCNBLG-MAPO1176591573529154393258762900218</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAPO-117659</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV0-J0J1-DXKX-001T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401995</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><timeReceived>3:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>State Capital Newsfeed <br/>Massachusetts Politics Blog( Massachussets)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Authority &amp;

The US state passed the strictest data protection law in the United States, which is intended to give consumers more control over their personal data. In doing so, the state made its capital Sacramento one of the strictest regulators in the global tech industry overnight. While California legislators drafted the law and set the course for the digital age, most Internet companies took little notice of the burgeoning threat and therefore brought only a few of their considerable lobbying resources into the process of drafting the law.</p><p>Google, Facebook and two leading tech trade associations together invested only $235,000 in lobbying in the three months leading up to the vote on the bill. Facebook, which at the time was concentrating all its resources on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, spent less than $18,000 on lobbying around the Data Protection Act during the period, according to official documents. Recent attempts by the tech industry to prevent parts of the data protection law that will come into force in January were not exactly successful. They show how far apart Silicon Valley and its two hour drive away neighbour Sacramento actually are. Mark Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley kings are taking a lot of trouble to lobby Washington. And they have also been struggling with the European regulatory authorities for years, defending themselves against the strict restrictions. After all, the European Union has the strictest data protection law in the world. But it is precisely the reticence in Californian politics that has deeply affected the tech companies, experts say.</p><p>The Silicon Valley giants are now fighting California's legislators, including the election initiatives that have launched two privacy campaigns in less than three years. \"People think that Sacramento is on the other side of the moon,\" says democratic strategist Andrew Acosta. The tech companies are now spinning their previously thin threads to Sacramento into a dense web. This is all the more so because the legislators are looking more closely at data protection provisions. Facebook, Google and the industry associations TechNet and The Internet Association have dramatically increased their joint lobbying budget in California: in 2019 and 2020 by more than 80 percent compared to the previous two-year term.</p><p>The four actors spent a total of 1.3 million US dollars between January and September 2019 to influence political decision-makers in Sacramento. Facebook has just engaged the excellently networked Sacramento insider Mona Pasquil Rogers, who is now responsible for the company's California strategy. But is it too late for the offensive? Tech companies have already fallen into the public eye. The latter is increasingly critical of the role of technology in society and daily life. This could undermine lobbying efforts in Sacramento, where even business-minded Republicans have already sounded the alarm. The electoral initiative in California, in which citizens can put bills to the vote without the support of the governor, could create further imponderables.</p><p>To the surprise of many, this year's offensive by the tech industry has not resulted in any significant changes in the new data protection law. On the contrary, consumer protection lawyer Alastair Mactaggart, who helped draft the law, was so concerned that lobbying efforts could dilute the Data Protection Act that he directly pushed for a second election initiative for 2020. The revised version of the law would further tighten consumer protection - and discourage legislators from making changes that would weaken the Data Protection Act. This might explain why tech companies - who don't like California's new privacy laws - are now counting on Washington's support. Their last hope are state regulations that repeal or replace the laws of the individual states.</p><p>Last month, a foundation funded by technology and telecommunications companies helped send a delegation of California legislators to Washington. In talks with colleagues in the US Congress, a committee discussed the weaknesses in California law and pointed out the advantages of Washington's preferential treatment over the states, one of the organizers told \"Politico \".</p><p>However, a closer look at the financial data from campaigns shows that \"big tech\" did not play a major role in the candidates' election campaigns. Facebook spends by far the most money in the tech industry for the election campaign, since 2009 already 1.7 million US dollars. This sum does not even include the amount paid by a former senior executive of the company for his own campaign for the post of Attorney General in 2010. According to government documents, Google spent 959,000 US dollars, while Apple spent only 256,000 US dollars. By way of comparison, the telecommunications group AT&amp;T flushed $5.3 million into the pockets of the candidates during this period, and the SEIU union even $6.2 million.</p><p>In fact, strategists say, some progressive legislators may even welcome the headwind from companies like Facebook. If Facebook were to donate a large sum of money to Congresswoman Buffy Wicks, who is a privacy advocate, says strategist Acosta, she would probably say, \"Keep it coming,\" he adds: \"It's significant that presidential candidates bad-mouth Mark Zuckerberg in their campaigns. Facebook is down and everyone's stepping up to the company. \"</p><p>Amazon has already ventured into local politics and experienced a PR disaster. The company invested almost 1.5 million US dollars in a so-called Political Action Committee, a private political organization that collected votes for business-related members of Seattle City Council. Strategist Steve Maviglio, a consultant for voter initiatives, however, considers it even riskier if tech companies do not get involved in the political race at all. He says: \"The fact that everyone does their own thing would have made the data protection law in California possible.</p><p>Maviglio was engaged by a technology and telecommunications coalition to fight the legislative initiative. But instead of promising him millions of dollars if he stopped the initiative, the companies waited. No one wanted to make the first move. It was not until February 2018, four months after the petition for a referendum was submitted, that the first financial contribution was made. In April 2018, however, Facebook, shaken by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, announced that it no longer wanted to fight the data protection law. The draft law of the citizens' initiative scored highly in opinion polls. In June, the government unanimously adopted the Data Protection Act before the referendum. This means that Washington can continue to make changes to it without having to present it to the electorate again beforehand. \"There was a fundamental misunderstanding about how the election initiative worked and who had to do what,\" says Maviglio. \"It was not easy to convince the legislators to interfere. And frankly, that was exactly the reason why the bill was passed in the first place. The government simply did not know how it could have got involved and taken the law in another direction. \"</p><p>Former Democratic advisor Roger Salazar highlights a contrast between today's technology start-ups and the hardware and software giants like Hewlett Packard and Apple that dominated Silicon Valley in the 1980s. He recalls that first generation companies usually hired old school managers. Those who knew how to \"deal with the government\". Younger technology companies would have different protection mechanisms and maintain different relationships. Possibly because they're growing at a dizzying rate, Salazar says, \"I think they were taken by surprise.\"</p><p> In collaboration with POLITICO  </p><p>Note: This article has been translated automatically.</p><p> Translated from the English by Anna Friedrich. </p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Document original</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVWE20191231DWBEHPWIRTSCHAFT8U63Q0F51TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Reminiscent of Washington: The Capitol in California's capital Sacramento is the seat of the state government</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DIEWEN-168721706</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIEWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW2-2T41-DY2B-S554-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465485</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1356\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Axel Springer SE All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Die Welt (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12658\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>No. 304</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 31, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We will have a special report from the town.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is LOU DOBBS TONIGHT for Friday, April 2. Sitting in for Lou Dobbs for an hour of news, debate and opinion, John King.</p><p>KING: Good evening.  Tonight, employment is growing at the fastest pace in nearly four years.  There were 300,000 new jobs in march, Far more than economists forecast.  The numbers could indicate that economic expansion is finally leading to major jobs growth.  The data is, of course, welcome news for the White House after months of anemic job growth and sharp Democratic attacks on the president's economic record.  Peter Viles reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At last, good news on jobs.  The government says there were 308,000 new jobs in March, a big surprise to investors, the best job numbers in almost four years.</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, BOND TRADER, ALARON TRADING: It's almost like this is the missing piece of the puzzle.  The ship has come in, and everything has changed.  And so we're living in a new world.  So happy Easter, I guess.</p><p>VILES: Seventy-one thousand new construction jobs last month, forty-seven thousand new jobs in retail boosted by workers returning after the California grocery strike.  The jobless rate did tick up to 5.7 percent, but most economists agreed the labor market is improving.</p><p>CHARLES LIEBERMAN, ADVISORS FINANCIAL: There's no question in my mind that the job market is getting substantially better, and it's not just this month alone taken out of context.  You got to put it into context.  All of the other data on the economy has been strong for quite a while now.</p><p>VILES: Over the first three months of the year, half a million new jobs.  That's a pace of 2.1 million new jobs per year.  But many caution not to read too much into a single report that still shows plenty of slack in the labor market.</p><p>WILLIAM DUDLEY, GOLDMAN SACHS: While the headline payroll number was very gratifying, especially to the White House, underneath the report, things were less robust.  For example, total hours worked actually slipped a tenth of a percent this month, and there wasn't much in the way of wage growth, up only a tenth of a percent.  So average hourly earnings are not growing very fast.</p><p>VILES: And for nearly 15 million Americans, the job market isn't working at all: 8.3 million are unemployed, 1.6 million want a job but don't qualify for unemployment, 4.7 million work part time but want a full-time job.  That's 14.7 million.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: One other headline today, that brutal slump in manufacturing employment came to an end in March.  After 43 months in a row of lost factory jobs, factory employment was flat in March.  All in all, John, that's good news -- John.</p><p>KING: Good news in the economic numbers, Pete.  One of the major political numbers is what is the total number of jobs lost during the Bush presidency? It's a moving target, of course.  Where are we now?</p><p>VILES: Moving target and shrinking.  It's 1.8 million now.  Now, you may hear higher numbers than that. If it's higher than 1.8 million, they're either talking about an old number or they're talking about some other number, lost manufacturing jobs or lost private sector jobs.  All in all, counting the growth in government jobs, we're down 1.8 million since January of '01 -- John.</p><p>KING: Peter Viles in New York, thank you very much.</p><p>And as Pete just reported, the jobs rebound is encouraging to President Bush as he fights Democratic charges he has failed the American people on employment and overseas outsourcing.  Today the president said the economy is strong and getting stronger.  Suzanne Malveaux is traveling with the president.  She joins us now from Augusta, Georgia, with more on how the administration quickly sought to gain politically from the jobs report -- Suzanne.</p><p>SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, this is certainly good news for the White House.  We saw early today President Bush giving the thumbs-up after he heard those good numbers.  Earlier today, he was in Huntington, West Virginia, at Marshall University. That is where he was highlighting his economic policy, talking about $250 million for community college partnerships, $500 million for job training and education programs.  And the president really using these new numbers today to make the case to the American people that it's his economic policy that is working.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BUSH: The economy is growing, and people are finding work. Today the statistics show that we added 308,000 jobs for the month of March.  We've added 759,000 jobs since August.  This economy is strong.  It is getting stronger.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: And the president delivering that message in the key battleground state of West Virginia.  That is where 20,000 West Virginians have lost their jobs under President Bush's watch, 10,000 of that from the manufacturing sector.  And John, as you know, Democrats were quick to point out that millions of dollars -- millions of jobs, rather, have been lost under President Bush's term, and that only one month really does not make a trend -- John.</p><p>KING: And Suzanne, what is the latest tonight on this dispute over the Bush White House turning over to the 9/11 commission documents dating back from the Clinton administration?</p><p>MALVEAUX: Well, there seems to be a compromise tonight, John. You have the counsel from the White House, as well as the counsel from the 9/11 commission have both agreed that on Monday, they'll go to the National Archives.  That is where they're going to sit with boxes and boxes of these Clinton documents, go over what are duplicates, what's relevant, what's classified and what's appropriate to send to the 9/11 commission -- John.</p><p>KING: Suzanne Malveaux with the president in Augusta, Georgia. Thank you very much, Suzanne.</p><p>Senator John Kerry and his top economic advisers today held a strategy meeting at the senator's home in Boston.  After that meeting, the Democratic presidential candidate told reporters, in his view, Mr. Bush has little reason to celebrate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KERRY (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Obviously, all of us are pleased with the job numbers for this month.  But there's almost no way this administration will avoid having lost two million jobs.  And the fact is that the deficits, which go out as far as the eye can see, the lack of any one single manufacturing job in those jobs, and the huge numbers of jobs that are leaving for overseas tells the real story of the economy of our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Later in the broadcast, I will talk with treasury secretary John Snow about the economy and the political impact of this new employment report.  I will also talk with presidential adviser Karen Hughes.</p><p>Turning now to the new warnings about the threat of terrorism in this country.  There was a government alert today about possible terrorist attacks this summer against buses and trains in major U.S. cities.  The FBI and Homeland Security Department called on local law enforcement agencies to step up security in transportation centers. Justice correspondent Kelli Arena has that story -- Kelli.</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: John, the intelligence is uncorroborated and very general in nature.  Still, no one is taking any chances, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI alerting state and local partners and industry officials about a possible plot to attack buses and trains here in the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASA HUTCHINSON, UNDERSECRETARY, DEPT. OF HOMELAND SECURITY: The information that we receive, intelligence-wise, with the reality of the bombings overseas in transit -- this is an area of concern.  We're working with our transit authorities to enhance that security, put the appropriate protective measures in place, public awareness, as well, alerting law enforcement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARENA: In an advisory, officials say the intelligence points to a plan to attack commercial transportation systems in major U.S. cities, but it doesn't name the cities, and the only timeframe that's offered is the summer.</p><p>But officials do get a little more specific when they're writing about explosives that could possibly be used.  They say the plot calls for use of improvised explosive devices, possibly made of ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel.  The intelligence, of course, coming on the heels of last month's train bombings in Madrid and the discovery today of another bomb under Spain's high-speed rail system.  Plus, there was a seizure this week in London of 1,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate. Now, there's nothing to suggest, according to officials, that there's any relation to this latest intelligence, but pieced together, John, it all explains how concerned they are.</p><p>KING: Concerned -- help our viewers understand whether they should be afraid, in the sense that this is called an inlet (ph), the document you obtained.</p><p>ARENA: Right.</p><p>KING: It goes out only to law enforcement.  It's not meant for public consumption.</p><p>ARENA: It is not meant for public consumption, but it is definitely targeted at the industries involved, the local and state law enforcement officials involved.  But it is good for people to know, so that they are aware, if they see suspicious packages, if they see suspicious behavior, they can report it and it will be taken care of.</p><p>KING: Kelli Arena, thank you very much.</p><p>ARENA: You're welcome.</p><p>KING: And as Kelli just reported, hours before that warning here in the United States, authorities in Spain found a bomb under a high- speed rail line.  The bomb was discovered three weeks after radical Islamists killed nearly 200 train commuters in Madrid.  Kitty Pilgrim reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Spanish authorities say they believe the bomb is the same type that was used in the deadly attacks Spanish rail lines last month.</p><p>CRISPIN BLACK, DIR., RISK ADVISORY GROUP: The Spanish did not have much intelligence warning about what went on in Madrid, which is perhaps temporarily making people rely less on the intelligence they can receive and more on what they can actually see going on on the ground.</p><p>PILGRIM: In France in recent weeks, a search after the Madrid bombing also turned up bombs along French rail lines.  Disaster averted.  In Britain, a massive plot foiled.  The ninth suspect this week was arrested.  Authorities say a half ton of bomb-making materials recovered earlier this week was going to be used to blow up rail lines and shopping malls.  In Canada, Mohammed Momen Kuadja (ph), a Canadian of Pakistani descent, was arrested just before the raids in Britain. He's charged with terrorist activities on Ottawa and London, but police won't say if his arrest is linked to the London bomb plot. Attacks also stopped in the Philippines this week.  The Philippine president said they stopped what could have been a, quote, \"Madrid- like\" attack, a plan to blow up trains and shopping malls.</p><p>Terrorism experts say the change in tactics reflect certain successes on the war on terror.  Simpler operations are planned, like rail and car bombings, rather than the highly coordinated operations of 9/11.</p><p>MICHAEL O'HANLON, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: It took a year or more to plan 9/11, and al Qaeda doesn't have the kind of apparatus and kind of sanctuary needed to do that sort of planning right now.  So you're seeing the al Qaeda affiliates are behaving more like organizations in the past that simply did simple things that were at their disposal.</p><p>PILGRIM: For example, the bomb material in England was fertilizer ammonium nitrate.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Now, there are a couple of big events coming up that have authorities concerned about security.  This is the beginning of Easter week.  It's a big holiday in Europe, where large crowds gather in public places to celebrate -- John.</p><p>KING: Kitty Pilgrim, thank you very much.</p><p>New anti-terrorist measures here in this country.  The federal government plans to extend tough border controls to travelers from close allies, such as Britain, Australia and Japan.  Immigration agents at airports and seaports will fingerprint and photograph citizens from 27 countries who do not require visas under the existing rules.  Agents already take photographs and fingerprints of citizens from other countries.</p><p>And still to come: a stunning end to the Tyco corporate corruption trial.  We will have a live report from the courthouse, and I will be joined by CNN's senior legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin.</p><p>In \"Exporting America,\" a small town in Virginia faces economic collapse after its biggest private employer says it will ship 250 jobs to India.  And in \"Heroes,\" the extraordinary story of a U.S. military policeman who went to Baghdad to train Iraqi police officers.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KING: A stunning end to one of the biggest corporate corruption trials.  On what would have been day 12 of deliberations, outside pressure on the jury prompted the judge in the Tyco case to declare a mistrial.  Mary Snow has the story from Manhattan State Supreme Court in Lower Manhattan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The former titans of Tyco walked out of court with a big question mark hanging over charges they looted $600 million, using Tyco as a piggy bank to live a life that pegged them the poster boys for corporate greed.  After six months, the judge declared a mistrial after what happened following a single supposed \"OK\" hand gesture juror No. 4 supposedly made to the defense.</p><p>CHARLES STILLMAN, SWARTZ'S ATTORNEY: Look, I've been doing this 40 years.  I will tell you, if I piled up all the experiences top to bottom, I ain't seen nothing like this yet.</p><p>SNOW: An audible gasp was heard in the courtroom when Judge Michael Ovis (ph) said he had no other choice but to end the case because of efforts to pressure the jury from the outside.  A source close to the Tyco case tells CNN that a coercive letter was sent to juror No. 4.  In the end, the judge said there's no proof she did anything wrong, but in a departure from the norm, her name was published in two newspapers and she became the subject of what was described as venomous attacks on the Internet.</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFMAN, KOZLOWSKI'S ATTORNEY: We're disappointed because of events that occurred outside of the courtroom that this case did not reach verdict.</p><p>BRUCE SCHAEFFER, ATTORNEY/TRIAL OBSERVER: It had a circus atmosphere by the end.  It was a case that probably could have been concluded in six weeks instead of six months.</p><p>SNOW: A $2 million birthday bash in Sardinia, complete with gladiators, was part of the prosecution's proof that former CEO Dennis Kozlowski and former CFO Mark Swartz misused company money to live extravagantly.  Tyco footed half the tab for the party for Kozlowski's wife, and it also paid for a $6,000 shower curtain in a maid's bathroom at Kozlowski's home.  The defendants say they never hid anything, that the company's board knew about all of it.  But one juror says the prosecution appeared to make its case on some counts.</p><p>PETER MCENTEGART, TYCO JUROR: It's just so frustrating because we virtually had a verdict yesterday afternoon.  We were that close. And then to come in this morning, and we're not allowed to deliberate today at all.</p><p>SNOW: The juror said it appeared there would be a mixed verdict.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Now, the juror we spoke with said that the panel appeared to convict or be ready to convict on several counts.  And unlike some high-profile corporate trials we've seen recently handled by the federal court system, this one was handled by the Manhattan DA's office, which calls this trial a disappointment and says it will retry the case -- John.</p><p>KING: Now, Mary, not to be flippant, but in a retrial, does the defense have an edge, essentially having had a practice run here?</p><p>SNOW: Some legal experts say, yes, they do, especially after hearing from some of the jurors about what would have led them to a conviction.  But also, some legal experts say that the prosecution may really have an advantage, as well, because critics have said that this case went on too long, so this will give them a chance to fine-tune their case for the next time.</p><p>KING: Mary Snow, thank you very much.</p><p>And joining me now with more on this amazing case is CNN's senior legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin.  Jeff, let's follow up on that point. Who has the edge after a disaster like this?</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I think the defense, by and large.  Any time a defendant leaves the courtroom through the front door instead of through the back door into jail, the defense wins.  And cases tend not to get better with age.  Defense lawyers are always looking to delay.  Evidence gets lost. Memories fade.  The opportunity to cross-examine witnesses for a second time, based on what they said in a first trial -- it does help the defense, by and large.  That isn't to say that they won't ultimately be convicted, but certainly, today is a victory for the defense.</p><p>KING: And is it a logical extension, then, to say, in your view, that the prosecution made mistakes here?</p><p>TOOBIN: I think they can't be blamed for the crazy way this ended, in terms of a juror getting a letter that had to result in a mistrial.  But certainly, taking a case that took this long, six months, and a case that was so difficult for the jurors that it took them 12 days and still couldn't resolve it, I do think it calls into question whether this was a successful prosecution effort. But they will have the opportunity to learn from those mistakes, and they'll get to do it again, in all likelihood.</p><p>KING: There are occasions when, after a mistrial, there is a plea deal.  Do you see any likelihood of that in this case?</p><p>TOOBIN: Boy, it certainly seems unlikely in these circumstances because what you have here is a prosecution team that virtually is certain to insist on serious jail time.  And here you have two-white collar defendants who are not at all interested in going to jail.  It doesn't seem like there's the kind of possibility of common ground that would exist.  And also, both sides seem to think they had a shot with this jury.  Every reason to think they will think they will have a shot at the next jury.</p><p>KING: And finally, Jeff, our business, the news media, does not come out of this trial unblemished, do we.</p><p>TOOBIN: A big, big question mark here.  \"The New York Post\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\" identified this juror.  This juror was then approached.  This is why there is a custom observed by CNN here, and most other news outlets, of not identifying jurors during a trial, because they might be approached.  I think there are going so be some really hard questions about \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"New York Post.\" They didn't do anything illegal.  There's no question there. but on the question of journalistic ethics, that's -- that's there are going to be some hard questions for them to answer.</p><p>KING: Jeff Toobin, thanks for your time tonight.</p><p>And still to come, we'll talk with treasury secretary John Snow about today's jobs report.

STEPHEN RICE, ILLINOIS NATIONAL GUARD: I've always been an active person, and the prospect of not walking again or being able to run again -- it's rough.  It's definitely rough.</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Military policeman Stephen Rice is struggling to stay in shape.  Six months ago, he was in Baghdad leading a platoon of 33 soldiers teaching Iraqis how to be cops. Three months ago, a roadside bomb shattered everything.</p><p>RICE: We were going on shift about 7:00 o'clock in the morning, and I received a call on the radio saying that a soldier was injured in a roadside bombing and they needed help securing the scene.  And I was running to that soldier's location, and a secondary device detonated on my left side.</p><p>WIAN: The blast knocked Rice to the ground.</p><p>RICE: And I knew there was quite a bit of damage there.</p><p>WIAN: Since then, he's had numerous surgeries.</p><p>RICE: They pulled shrapnel out of my knee and also had to remove a piece of my quad.  There's also a scar right here from an operation they did, and there's an entrance and entry wound here on the left side of my ankle, and an exit wound right here.  And also, my big toe is missing a middle bone.</p><p>WIAN: Rice will be back in surgery again in a couple of weeks, but he's confident he'll not only walk again but run and be able to do the martial arts he loves.</p><p>RICE: I'm still the same person, and there's just one more thing to overcome.  Life's full of little obstacles, and we just have to get by all that.</p><p>WIAN: The bomb may have shredded Rice's leg but not his mind or his determination to stay in the National Guard and become a cop.

Here again from Washington with more news, debate and opinion, John King.</p><p>KING: The exporting of America tonight is devastating one small Virginia town.  One of its largest employers is laying off hundreds of workers and shipping their jobs to a cheaper labor market overseas. Louise Schiavone has the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LOUISE SCHIAVONE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Two hundred and fifty of Clintwood, Virginia's best jobs are being outsourced to India, and the town only has a population of 1,800.</p><p>DONALD BAKER, CLINTWOOD, VA, MAYOR: In my opinion, if something doesn't happen, it's not going to be too long until we'll be a third world country instead of some of these other countries being third world.</p><p>SCHIAVONE: Online travel service Travelocity is pulling the plug on its call center here, where workers had been pleased to start at $8 plus training and benefits.</p><p>ANGIE ELLIOTT, TRAVELOCITY EMPLOYEE: Well, me and my husband, we just bought a new home in August, so that's putting it, you know, really rough on us right now.</p><p>VERONICA PORTER, TRAVELOCITY EMPLOYEE: For anyone to understand it, I think you honestly need to live it.  They'd have to live the week that I lose my job and see, you know, what the week before, what I feed my kids, compared to the week after, what I feed my kids.</p><p>SCHIAVONE: Having lost $55 million last year, the company expects to save $10 million with the change.  Travelocity has told CNN, quote, \"We made a difficult decision to outsource following significant losses last year. Our costs were significantly higher than our major competitors, who had chosen long ago to outsource to the Philippines, India and elsewhere.\"</p><p>With 11 months' notice, possible interviews at their two remaining U.S. call centers, Travelocity wants these workers to have a soft landing.</p><p>STEVE HORNE, TRAVELOCITY SITE MANAGER: We'll be working with local Virginia employment commission and resume writing, things of that nature, as time progresses.</p><p>SCHIAVONE: Clintwood, meanwhile, is going back to its roots, marketing what you can't outsource: tourism, local crafts and a mountain music museum dedicated to a local artist, Grammy Award-winner Ralph Stanley, who sees a bit of Clintwood in his song, \"Oh, Death.\"</p><p>RALPH STANLEY, GRAMMY WINNER AND CLINTWOOD, VA, NATIVE: (SINGING) Well, what is this that I can't see, with ice-cold hands taking hold of me?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCHIAVONE: John, things change fast these days when it comes to information technology jobs.  Just before Travelocity came to town, Nexus (ph) Communications shut down their operation in Clintwood. That leaves the residents there wondering what might come next and how long it might last -- John.</p><p>KING: And Louise, when we go out and cover these stories like this, the companies get a little up tight, don't they.</p><p>SCHIAVONE: They get very nervous about us looking into this, especially a big-name company like Travelocity.  Got a lot of calls from them. How did we get in?  How did we get those pictures? They're just very concerned that they're going to get a black eye for this because the focus so much, especially in this political climate, is on outsourcing American jobs.</p><p>KING: Well, we're glad you did get in.  Louise Schiavone, thank you very much.</p><p>The White House says the new employment report is proof that more jobs are on the way.  The economy created 308,000 jobs last month. The best showing in four years.  Earlier I discussed the economy with Treasury Secretary John Snow and I began by asking him if this new job growth is sustainable.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN SNOW, TREASURY SECRETARY: Well, I think it will be sustainable and I'm encouraged by that number.  And I am encouraged by the fact that January and February were both revised upward.  So suggesting that the first quarter is stronger than had been indicated by prior numbers.</p><p>KING: As you know, in the political debate in this campaign much has been made of the administration's prediction at the beginning of the year that the economy would create 2.6 million new jobs this year. Do you feel vindicated and is reaching that number possible?</p><p>SNOW: I'm not focused on any one number, John, but rather seeing the economy generate as many jobs as possible.  When the economy is growing, like it is now, last half of last year, at 6 percent, this year at well over 4 percent.  We should create a lot of jobs.  A growing and expanding economy historically creates jobs.  And I'm confident we'll see a lot of jobs created in the months ahead.</p><p>KING: You say a lot of jobs.  Let me try it one more time this way.  Senator Kerry, the president's Democratic opponent says his economic program would create 10 million jobs over the next four years if he's elected president.  Do you believe that if Mr. Bush is re-elected that the economy would create that many or more jobs.</p><p>SNOW: I can't give you a precise number.  But I would say this, that there will be a lot more jobs created under a Bush administration than otherwise.  Because the job creation process is directly tied to the president's tax cuts.  And as I understand it, Senator Kerry would raise taxes and raising taxes would be the last thing you should do in a recovering economy.</p><p>KING: In this new report, for the first time in, I believe, 44 months, the manufacturing sector in the United States did not lose jobs.  It is flat, it did not gain jobs but it did not lose jobs. There's a new survey for first time in 20 years, a survey of the manufacturing sector indicates some mood to perhaps expand a little bit.  What are your thoughts on the state of the manufacturing sector right now.  Do you foresee job growth there?</p><p>SNOW: Yes, I do.  I think we finally turned the corner in the long beleaguered manufacturing sector.  It turned down in the summer of 2000.  And has been through a rough ride.  I think we finally turned the corner which is a very hopeful note.  And in the months ahead, the expectation would be to see manufacturing pick up on the jobs front.  It's already picked up on the output front. Manufacturing output is showing some nice upward numbers now.</p><p>KING: Let me ask you then to follow up on that.  Some comments you have made recently about trade and outsourcing have been seized by the president's critics on the issue.  You said, I believe, in this past week that outsourcing, the shipping of American jobs overseas is, quote, part of trade and there can't be any doubt about the fact that trade makes the economy stronger.  Explain for us, sir, what you mean by that in your views on outsourcing.  Is it not damaging to the American worker?</p><p>SNOW: What I was talking about, of course, was the importance of the United States staying engaged in the global economy. We're only 5 percent of the world's population which means that 95 percent of the potential customers, for products and services produced in the United States lie outside our borders.  We need to continue to engage the world economy.  It seems to me pretty clear that trade, opening -- taking down trade barriers is good for America, good for American workers and I'd be strongly opposed to anything that would have us turn our back on what has made us a success.</p><p>KING: As you also know, we are in the middle of a political campaign and there are some Democrats questioning why your department did an analysis of Senator Kerry's proposal or analysis of a proposal very similar to Senator Kerry's anyway but if you took away the Bush tax cut for the upper bracket what effect that would have.  Then the Republican National Committee began using those figures.  Some questioning whether the government is involved in politics, political campaigns here?</p><p>SNOW: John, nothing could be further from the truth on that score.  The Treasury Department conducts analysis of tax proposals. We got a request for analysis of a proposal.  We conducted the request.  And everything was done in accordance with standard procedures.</p><p>KING: The Secretary of the Treasury John Snow.  Sir, we thank you very much for your time today.</p><p>SNOW: Thank you, good to be with you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KING: And we want to hear your opinion about the strong jobs report.  Do you believe the economy has turned the corner on job creation?  Yes, no, or too soon to tell.  Cast your vote at CNN.com/lou.  We'll bring you the results later in the show.</p><p>Still ahead here tonight, I'll talk with presidential adviser Karen Hughes about her decision to return from Texas to help President Bush win re-election.</p><p>And then Israeli forces clash with Muslim worshipers at one of the holiest sites in Jerusalem.  Those stories and much more still ahead.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KING: A tense standoff today at a disputed holy site in Jerusalem between Israeli police and Muslim worshipers. Israeli police stormed the al-Aqsa mosque using stun grenades and bullets to break up a group of Palestinian protesters that were throwing rocks at them. Police say there were at least 14 arrests and Palestinians report dozens of injuries.</p><p>Police in Wisconsin have ended their search for a suspect in the case of a student who said she was kidnapped.  Police site inconsistencies and say there was lack of evidence to support the claims of 20-year-old Audrey Seiler.</p><p>And the House today passed a record $275 billion transportation bill despite a veto threat from the White House.  The legislation boosts funding for federal highway, transit and safety programs for over six years.</p><p>One of President Bush's most trusted advisers is assuming a more prominent role as the re-election campaign intensifies.  Karen Hughes left Washington to return to Texas with her family but is making more frequent appearances at the White House these days and will assume a full-time campaign role this summer after touring the country to promote her new book \"Ten Minutes From Normal.\" I spoke with Karen Hughes earlier today at the White House and began by noting her book is in more ways than one competing against the new book by former White House counterterrorism czar and now Bush critic Richard Clarke.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAREN HUGHES, WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Well that is an irony.  And I have to tell you, it's not what I would have chosen, because my book is very different really.  It's not a typical Washington political book.  It's really a book -- I mean, obviously, my life has been lived largely in the political context in the last 20 years of so, but it's really a personal story.  It's about the struggle we all face to balance career and family.  In may case, the highest level of our government.</p><p>It's a story of how we set priorities in life and how we choose to use our time.  In my case, my faith helps me make those kinds of decisions.  So, it's really personal look at what it feels like to be a normal person whose boss suddenly runs for president and becomes the president.  And you find yourself having lunch with the Queen of England. Thrilling things like that.  I hope it's a book that Americans who ever think about what it is like to be inside the White House will enjoy.</p><p>KING: In a sense it's also a competition over the credibility of this president.  Richard Clarke says he ignores the terrorist threat. You paint the picture of a very different president.</p><p>HUGHES: Well, and I think my picture was much more accurate, because I was there, I was in the room.  It's ironic in hindsight. Of course, I didn't know about Mr. Clarke's book when I wrote mine.  And I mentioned him once in my book.  It was because he came -- he was sent to my office the week after September 11 by Condi Rice to brief me on Afghanistan.</p><p>Now interestingly, that's the time when he says when we were focused on Iraq, but he came to my office to brief me on Afghanistan because the president had told me on Sunday night, September 16 that he had determined al Qaeda was responsible and he was going after al Qaeda in Afghanistan and I needed to know more about al Qaeda and Afghanistan.</p><p>KING: What is your sense -- you mentioned Mr. Clarke in the competition of the bookstore will have a dramatic rebuttal from Condi Rice next week when she testifies to the commission.  A lot of people say why.  It's not just the Bush administration, this executive privilege or the right of a president to with hold information to protect his staff and in the end almost always somebody has to go public or the documents have to be released.  From a communication standpoint, do you sit and you just think, just get the lawyers out of this?</p><p>HUGHES: From a purely communication standpoint, my goal is always to get as much out as quickly as possible.  I think someone in the former administration Lenny Davis who I think highly of, tell the truth and tell it fast and quick.</p><p>I really think in this case, though, in the White House, what I experienced is you have to balance a lot of competing interests.  When we came into the White House we were told that the steadily, the executive power of the presidency had been eroded by Congress over the course of the last 20 or 25 years.</p><p>All of us stood in the east room and raised our hand to protect the constitution, which clearly talks about the separation of powers between the 3 branches of government.  So we felt that was an important principle.  The president felt that was an opinion principle.</p><p>But I'm very glad, again, as a communicator and as an American that he was able to resolve it in a way that protects the constitutional principle by stating clearly in writing that this is exceptional, that this is an extraordinary set of circumstances, but also allows Dr. Rice to do what I know she wants to do and that is publicly share the facts with the American people. I think that's particularly important now they have seen the facts in somewhat a distorted perspective.</p><p>KING: The president says 9/11 is the day that changed everything.  Why not from a communication standpoint find a way for the president to make a public statement to the 9/11 commission.  Meet with them in private, deal with the classified information, but at a time when your critics say the administration is trying to hide something or stonewall the commission, wouldn't that be a way for the president to go out and say, yes, we're going to waive the rules for this 1 day because this was the 1 day that changed everything.</p><p>HUGHES: Well, I think -- I don't really know all the concerns about that.  But I understand that would just be totally unprecedented.  The most -- the most famous commission I can remember in my lifetime, the Warren commission, President Johnson did not even appear before it because he said presidents don't do that.  I think the president clearly has other ways of communicating with the American people.</p><p>KING: One of the big fights of course is about the economy. Some good news for the administration today, the unemployment report says 308,000 jobs created last month.</p><p>HUGHES: About three times as many as were expected, and more than any time in the last four years.  I think what that says, we're finally back.  We've been through a lot, the economy has been through a lot.  I think we underestimate sometimes the impact September 11 had on the economy.</p><p>I patronize a travel related business in Austin that about two months ago finally closed and the woman owner told me that she never could get it back after September 11.  You know the tourism industry is such a huge part of our economy.</p><p>And then we had after that first of all we were in a recession, President Bush inherited a recession, then we had the terror attacks then we had the stock market declines, then we had the corporate scandals.  That's a lot to go through.  But I think today's job numbers are proof positive the president's economic plan is working and that the economy is on it's way, roaring back.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KING: Karen Hughes earlier today at the White House.  She says if the president wins reelection she will say congratulations sir and head back to Austin.</p><p>And now a look at some of your thoughts.  Many of you wrote about securing our nation's border and my interview last night with Robert Bonner the head of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>Janice Moore of Waverly, Virginia, \"what has happened to our immigration system?  I believe that it is not fair that so many have had to study so hard to become citizens of our great country, now all they have to do is cross a border illegally and our president seems to be giving them the green light.\"</p><p>David Rieger of Mundelheim, Illinois, \"If Bonner is so concerned about our broken borders, why has he not started arresting and prosecuting the CEO's of the corporations that are hiring illegal aliens?\"</p><p>And Rick of Pheonix, Arizona, \"while Bush says he's fighting terror, our borders are wide open.

The Dow rose 97 points, the Nasdaq surged 42, the S&amp;P added 9.  Christine Romans is here with the market now -- Christine.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: John, stocks rallied and bonds fell sharply.  One sideshow today, some wild swings just before the jobs number was released got the attention of market regulators and the labor department.  They are probing any possible leak of the jobs data early, but a Labor Department spokesman said it's not unusual for big last minute bets before important economic reports.</p><p>John in true Wall Street form, as stocks rallied because the economy added jobs, two big tech names rose as their cutting jobs. Sun Microsystems will layoff 3,500 workers, that's 9 percent of its work force.  And Gateway shares rallied 11 percent today.  As we told you last night, 2,500 get pink slips there.</p><p>Overall John, a good week for stocks.  For the S&amp;P 500, it was the best weekly gain in more than a year -- John.</p><p>KING: And so, Christine, this has been the question on Wall Street all year.  Is the market now convinced, the street now convinced that the economy has turned the corner when it comes to job growth?</p><p>ROMANS: Basically they are saying it's a start, but they are not convinced.  They want to see several months in a row of strong jobs gains.  And John, Wall Street has a pretty short attention span, now that this jobs report is behind it, the focus becomes quarterly earnings and if companies are starting to earn more money, there's the hope that they will be able to hire more workers.</p><p>KING: Christine Romans in New York.  Thank you very much.  Have a great weekend.</p><p>We're joined now by Jim Ellis chief of correspondents at \"Businessweek\" and Ron Brownstein national political correspondent for \"The Los Angeles Times.\"</p><p>Jim Ellis, let me start with you, and let's pick up where we just left off with Christine.  If you look at this unemployment report today and the employment data, pretty strong across the economy, even manufacturing breaking even.  What is your sense of what it tells about looking forward?  Have we turned the corner?</p><p>JIM ELLIS, \"BUSINESSWEEK\": Well, it tells us we have definitely passed the lows.  We had already seen that with the strength in the economy in the last couple of months.  We'd known that corporate profits are extremely high.  Sooner or later companies were going to have to start taking some of that out of profits and throwing it back into employment.  It is happening now.</p><p>The big issue as we go forward, though, is just how sustainable is it.  I think the market was quite excited about this today.  But the big thing to keep in mind is that the recovery has been one that sort of fits and starts.  And it hasn't responded as in the past -- as we had in the past recoveries.  So, we have to be very careful to take this one month's report and extrapolate too much from it.  Instead, it's a good start, but it's just that.</p><p>KING: Jim talking very cautious man.  Politicians aren't that way, Ron.  Karen Hughes saying, finally back, turned the corner.  Does the Bush White House need to be a little careful until they see more of this?</p><p>RON BROWNSTEIN, \"LOS ANGELES TIMES\": Absolutely.  Look, and I think the political people around the president understand that what they need here is both length and breadth.  They need both to sustain and go on for a while.  And they also need it to be widely shared.</p><p>The state by state job numbers come out about a full month later. And on Wednesday, only two days ago they came out for February of this year and they showed a real divergence, John, beginning to pick up in a number of battleground states like Florida, Wisconsin and Oregon, but still dropping in places like Missouri and Ohio that are going to be very hotly contested.</p><p>So, the White House wants to see, I think, both this go on for a while, but also to see that it is shared across the country.</p><p>KING: And Jim Ellis, as this political debate goes on, what is the sense of the confidence in the business community and across corporate America?  If they believe the economy has turned the corner and they are more confident they be inclined to hire people.  Do you believe the confidence is out there?</p><p>ELLIS: I think that they are very confidence that there has been a real turn around in the economy, that there is a recovery there and that we have seen the worst.</p><p>I am not so certain they are ready to go out and start hiring willy nilly.  I think that one of the real reasons so many companies have been blessed with strong profit growth is that they have really kept the lid on expenses, particularly hiring expenses.</p><p>And so one of the things that sort of helped them is not hiring. They found ways to outsource.  They found ways to basically wring more work out of the present employee base, sort of increasing productivity there.  And they are not about to give that up until they have to.</p><p>So I think for the administration to seem to think people are going to start running out now and putting up sort of help wanted signs everywhere, that's not going to happen.  People are going to be extremely cautious because they don't want to give up the earning gains unless they have to.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: I have to say, one thing this is going to test in the next few months and this election is going to test the assumption among most political scientists, and indeed most political strategists, that trend matters more than the absolute level of an economic indicator.</p><p>I mean the odds are still high, John, that George W. Bush will get to the end of this term with a net loss or a break even on jobs. He is still down 1.8 million jobs since he took office, which puts him as risk of being the first president since the depression to do that. But they believe in the campaign if they are showing sustained growth, month to month to month leading into the summer, leading into the election season, that will matter more to voters than the absolute level from the beginning of the term.</p><p>One said to me, voters assess the president more on the last year than the last four years.  They may be right.</p><p>KING: And Jim Ellis, how does this complicate things then for Senator Kerry.  He met with his economic team today.  He is planning a series of major economic speeches.  Just yesterday, began an advertisement slamming the president on outsourcing.  When the newspaper tomorrow and programs like this, have 300,000 new jobs and good news, how does that complicate Senator Kerry's task?</p><p>ELLIS: I think what it has done with Kerry now, is it's forcing him to change his message into one that's not so much where are the jobs, but he's going to have to shift to whether the number of jobs that are being created are really the number that we need.  And then more importantly, whether the jobs that are being created are the jobs that are really going to sort of give people the kind of lifestyles that they would like in the future.</p><p>I mean, there's a real sort of split in the numbers now that certain types of jobs, you know, people are doing quite well in, but for a lot of people, you know, they are underemployed.  A lot of people are finding now, as we saw in the latest report, the number of hours worked actually dropped slightly, also wages are not going up any faster than inflation.  So, you are actually not getting wealthier than you were, even know the job numbers are going up.</p><p>So, I think that for the Democrats now they most likely will have to shift and start saying, jobs are coming back but they are not the quality jobs you want.  And that, we have to -- they have to talk a lot more about underemployment and also the fact that the long-term unemployed, people who have been out of work for at least 6 months, is not at a, I guess, at a 24 year high.</p><p>There are still a lot of problems on the job front that are sort of going to be debated in Washington.  I mean this is not a slam dunk for the administration.</p><p>KING: Let me ask you as you jump in.  We had a senior Kerry economic adviser booked on the program and they canceled that booking. Do they need to recalibrate?</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Well, they may need to recalibrate.  And I agree with Jim, if the job growth is sustained they are going to have to find other arguments.  But that is going to be a very big hole right in the middle of your presidential campaign.</p><p>I think most analysts would argue the biggest obstacle President Bush faces to a second term has been the anxiety over the inability of the economy to create jobs.  If that turns around on a sustained basis, you would probably see his approval rating rise a few points. And if it does of course, it puts him in a much stronger position for reelection.</p><p>So sure, they will find other arguments, but there is no good substitute from the Kerry campaign from an argument about job growth under Bush.</p><p>KING; Well change the subject in closing, one final question, horrific pictures out of Fallujah this week of the killings, the mutilations of the American contractors.  Three months from now, the United States is supposed to hand over sovereignty.  Jim Ellis, do those pictures do anything in terms of public support in this country?</p><p>ELLIS: I think that the pictures are very damming for public support here.  I think a lot of people are going to say -- how in the world did we get to this?  They are going to start asking a lot more questions about the intelligence we had going in and maybe whether the administration was being completely forthcoming in the immediate nature of the weapons of mass destruction danger, especially now that we know that there were no weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Iraq has become a real wild card in this election. Bush gets consistently negative ratings on the economy, consistently positive on terrorism.  Iraq itself is a 50/50 proposition for this country.  There isn't an ideological majority against the war, there is not, but there can be an operational majority at various points and people may be cool toward it if things seem to be going badly.</p><p>KING: Ron Brownstein of the \"Los Angeles Times,\" Jim Ellis in New York from \"Businessweek\" thank you both very much.</p><p>And when we return we'll have the results of tonight's poll question.  But first, a reminder to check our Web site for the complete list of companies we've confirmed to be exporting America: cnn.com/lou.  We'll continue in just a moment.  Please stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KING: Now the results of tonight's poll question: 81 percent of you believe the economy has not turned the corner on job creation. Skeptical bunch.</p><p>That's our show tonight. Thanks for being with us. Lou will be back Monday. And he'll be talking with John McArthur, publisher of \"Harpers\" magazine and author of \"The Selling of Free Trade.\" Good night from Washington. Have a great weekend.

(This is putting to one side the shortcomings of these particular categories.) On the Right, this has meant allegations of Google's bias against conservatives. In the center, it has included allegations of Google's power against competition. </p><p>On the Left, it has meant allegations of Google's exploitation of just about everybody.The latter came to the fore again last year in the wake of Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff's book entitledThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power[1](January 2019[2]). The Amazon entry for this book in part reads: \"[T]he first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called 'surveillance capitalism,' and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control our behavior.\"As a starting point, one ought to be skeptical of any explicit or implied claims of \"game changers\" and \"new economics.\" One ought also to be suspicious of any explicit or implied assertion that \"out-of-control\" capitalism is, once again, the problem and that the solution, yet again, is government \"in greater control.\" Finally, one's BS detector ought to be on high alert when reading such doublespeak as ascribes to capitalism the hallmarks of statism\u2014i.e., \"powerful,\" \"control,\" and, of course, \"surveillance.\"What the Left Is SayingSam Biddle quickly gives away the anticapitalist agenda of those on the Left in his article forThe Intercept(February 2019[3]) by favorably \"drawing comparisons to seminal socioeconomic investigations like Rachel Carson'sSilent Springand Karl Marx'sCapital.\" He also interviewed Zuboff, who explained that Google and others are \"just secretly scraping your private experience as raw material, and [selling] predictions of what you're gonna do.\" And Zuboff alarmingly concluded: #8216;These are bald-faced interventions in the exercise of human autonomy,the 'right to the future tense',[and] the very material essence of the idea of free will.\"In another interview,this time by John Laidler of theHarvard Gazette(March 2019[4]), Zuboff expanded on this: I define surveillance capitalism as the unilateral claiming of private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. These data are then computed and packaged as prediction products and sold into behavioral futures markets. She also boldly asserted that: \"this [is] actually a new variant of capitalism,\" which supposedly \"has now spread beyond the tech companies to new surveillance-based ecosystems in virtually every economic sector\" and purportedly \"arose in the era of a neoliberal consensus around the superiority of self-regulating companies and markets.\"Katie Fitzpatrick starts her review of Zuboff's book forThe Nation(April 2019[5]) with more subtle anticapitalism than Biddle did: By resisting Go365 [a health monitoring app], the West Virginia teachers waged two battles at once: They fought in the trenches of state austerity and on the front lines of private digital surveillance. Although Fitzpatrick doesn't mention Marx as Biddle did, she uses Marxist language throughout to describe \"earlier capitalism\" and \"surveillance capitalism,\" such as \"exploitation,\" \"surplus,\" and \"extraction,\" not to mention postmodern statist concepts such as \"free will illusion,\" \"individual freedom chaos,\" and \"conditioned social engineering.\" She revealingly concluded, and lamented that Zuboff did not, that: The problem with surveillance capitalism is as much the capitalism as it is the surveillance. Two new attempts to regulate \"the problem\" of \"surveillance capitalism,\" and thus \"capitalism\" as well, come from Europe and California. Regarding the former, theFinancial Times(FT) reported onDecember 2019[6]that #8216;the EU's landmarkGeneral Data Protection Regulation[GDPR], [was] six years in the making before coming into force in May 2018.\" They also, as the mainstream media (MSM) almost always does, inappropriately mixed in plenty of subjective prostatism opinions, such as: \"There is no doubt that GDPR has already done a lot of good\" and \"But GDPR is deficient in several respects.It should be looking to reshape data markets, rather than just regulate them as they are.\"Slatereported on similar regulations that recently passed in California, and they wasted no time with subtleties, putting their opinion right in the subtitle:\"Thanks, California!\" (December 2019[7]). They then described how TheCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act[CCPA] essentiallyempowersconsumers [starting on New Year's Day 2020] to access the personal data that companies have collected on them, to demand that it be deleted, and to prevent it from being sold to third parties. They also optimistically opine: Since it's a lot more work to create a separate infrastructure just for California residents to opt out of, these requirements will transform the internet for everyone. As if that were not enough, they start, as theFTdid for GDPR, the process of lobbying for more market intervention: \"The law is vague on how much power and transparency companies must offer to consumers in this process.\"What the Center Is SayingIn an article forTruth on the Market, Alec Stapp states his thesis in the title itself: \"Any Way You Measure It, Warren Is Wrong to Claim #8216;Facebook and Google Account for 70% of All Internet Traffic\" (October 2019[8]). In countering Senator Elizabeth Warren's statistic about Facebook and Google's combined 70 percent market share of traffic, Stapp provides the following alternative stats: 20 percent of volume; 21 percent of time; 38 percent of connections; 33 percent of referrals; 32 percent of all advertising; and 59 percent of online advertising. And he, very importantly, notes that online advertising prices have fallen 42 percent over the past decade as volume has increased.Adam Candeub and Mark Epstein address a key legal question about Google, and others, such as Facebook and Twitter, in an article forCity Journalasking the question, \"Platform or Publisher?\" (May 2018[9]). They write: \"Section 230 of theCommunications Decency Actimmunizes online platforms for their users' defamatory, fraudulent, or otherwise unlawful contentbut the law was not intended to facilitate political censorship.\" They also importantly note that Section 230 was a response to a judicial decision, under the common law, that concluded that utilizing technology and the manpower to delete objectionable content made [one] more like publisher[s] thannewsstands, bookstores, and libraries. Michael Dougherty provides some further background to Section 230 in theNational Review(June 2019[10]). He writes that it was passed: \"in part to allow Internet servicesto block pornography[and not be] treated in the law as publishers[which are] liable for whatever libels and slanders users posted on them.\" Section 230: \"allows proprietors of websites and forums to set standards\u2014to edit and moderate their content without becoming a publisher of them.\" But also, Section 230: \"is now the legal remit under which social-media giants shadow-ban, block, and censor conservative speech.\"What the Right Is SayingIn his article entitled \"Google Marxism\" (December 2019[11]), Michael Rectenwald asserted that there is nowadays a \"Google Archipelago,\" which \"is guided by aleft authoritarianism.\" He described this as: \"the most developed set of technological apparatuses for disciplinary and governmental power and control in the world,\" including \"The principals of what I call Big Digital\u2014the purveyors of mega-data services, media, cable, and internet services, social media platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, apps, and the developing Internet of Things.\" He thus warned that \"Socialism has always had global pretensions. OnlyGoogle Marxismis capable of creating it, albeit in corporate socialist form.\"William Anderson has also written about Google for the Mises Institute on a number of occasions over the years, including in the context of woke capitalism (July 2019[12]), economy bureaucratization (July 2018[13]) and antitrust law (December 2005[14]). Regarding the latter, he wrote: \"Google's search policies are decidedly left-wing,\" but \"[n]o one is forced to use the Internet at all and, thus, can avoid Google altogether if that is their choice.\" Nevertheless, Anderson warned, \"The vagueness ofAntitrust Lawmakes it easy for government to heap abuse upon those firms that are out of favor at any given time, as no real legal proof is needed for the courts to act against the alleged monopolist.#8217; And he added: \"despite the millions of dollars that the company's leaders and employees have raised for the Democrats, it is doubtful that many Democrats would be willing to stand up for a firm that is accused of being a monopolist.\"Writing for Antiwar.com (August 2018[15]), Justin Raimondo reminded that: \"TheCommunications Decency Actimmunizes these companies against any [common law] torts,#8217; and that #8216;[t]his two-tiered system is responsible for the cartel-like conditions enjoyed by Facebook, Google, Twitter, and the rest of the Silicon Valley crowd.#8217; He added that, this plus \"[t]he vast wealth poured into this new technology by investors buoyed by historically low interest rates, has resulted in the enrichment of Big Data beyond the dreams ofCroesus[16].\" The result is that #8216;In recognition of [these] government-granted privilegestheLords of the Internethave agreed to become the regime's enforcers.#8217;ConclusionThese organizations that allegedly practice \"surveillance capitalism\" have become seemingly inescapable in our modern economy. This has led to a host of critics attempting to identify and explain the many ways that organizations like Facebook and Google have become damaging to our everyday lives and freedoms.Many of these critics get it wrong, though.On the Left, the reports and commentary about Google's so-called surveillance capitalism were more about the capitalism than the surveillance. As they've done many times in the past (such as during theGFC[17](Global Financial Crisis) of the late 2000s, theDot-com collapse[18]of the early 2000s, and theMicrosoft dominance[19]of the 1990s), they call for failed and selfish markets to be heavily regulated or even replaced by successful and selfless government. And emotion-laden stories, from the edges of thebell curve[20], are once again trotted out to bolster their case.In the center, there is largely an acceptance of the mixed economy (of markets and government) as it currently stands, and, in at least two cases, some pushback on further government intervention. Although these two do not seem to grasp the significance, they imply that government may be the source of a \"market structure,\" resulting in \"market power,\" and that regardless of that, \"market conduct\" includes \"market performance\" resulting in falling prices. (For more on structure-conduct-performance, seeRegulated Monopolies are not \"Natural,\"April 2018[21].)Some conservatives get closer to the mark in their concern for free speech and the potential for abuse of government power through crony capitalism.Yet, only the free market critics cut through to the most important problem\u2014namely that the state's antitrust legislation has provided legal advantages against competitors while providing legal immunity to these firms. The size and power of the \"surveillance capitalists\" has allowed the industry to escape the brunt of antitrust legislation. Many of their competitors have not been so lucky, and this an unfair advantage, to say the least. Meanwhile, as Raimondo notes, federal law protects these firms from being called to account in the civil courts.The result is a legal landscape that favors some at the expense of others. But as Anderson concludes, no one is forced to use the services of these firms, so claims of \"monopoly\" are questionable. Ultimately, it is this lack of true monopoly that illustrates the weakness of many claims that government action is necessary to rein in firms that are powerfulprecisely becauseso many voluntarily use their services.[Originally Published at The Mises Institute[22]] [ 1]: <url

(This is putting to one side the shortcomings of these particular categories.) On the Right, this has meant allegations of Google's bias against conservatives. In the center, it has included allegations of Google's power against competition. </p><p>On the Left, it has meant allegations of Google's exploitation of just about everybody. The latter came to the fore again last year in the wake of Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff's book entitledThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power[1](January 2019[2]). The Amazon entry for this book in part reads: '[T]he first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called 'surveillance capitalism,' and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control our behavior.' As a starting point, one ought to be skeptical of any explicit or implied claims of 'game changers' and 'new economics.' One ought also to be suspicious of any explicit or implied assertion that 'out-of-control' capitalism is, once again, the problem and that the solution, yet again, is government 'in greater control.' Finally, one's BS detector ought to be on high alert when reading such doublespeak as ascribes to capitalism the hallmarks of statism i.e., 'powerful,' 'control,' and, of course, 'surveillance.' What the Left Is Saying Sam Biddle quickly gives away the anticapitalist agenda of those on the Left in his article forThe Intercept(February 2019[3]) by favorably 'drawing comparisons to seminal socioeconomic investigations like Rachel Carson'sSilent Springand Karl Marx'sCapital.' He also interviewed Zuboff, who explained that Google and others are 'just secretly scraping your private experience as raw material, and [selling] predictions of what you're gonna do.' And Zuboff alarmingly concluded: 'These are bald-faced interventions in the exercise of human autonomy,the 'right to the future tense',[and] the very material essence of the idea of free will.' In another interview,this time by John Laidler of theHarvard Gazette(March 2019[4]), Zuboff expanded on this:I define surveillance capitalism as the unilateral claiming of private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. These data are then computed and packaged as prediction products and sold into behavioral futures markets.She also boldly asserted that: 'this [is] actually a new variant of capitalism,' which supposedly 'has now spread beyond the tech companies to new surveillance-based ecosystems in virtually every economic sector' and purportedly 'arose in the era of a neoliberal consensus around the superiority of self-regulating companies and markets.' Katie Fitzpatrick starts her review of Zuboff's book forThe Nation(April 2019[5]) with more subtle anticapitalism than Biddle did:By resisting Go365 [a health monitoring app], the West Virginia teachers waged two battles at once: They fought in the trenches of state austerity and on the front lines of private digital surveillance.Although Fitzpatrick doesn't mention Marx as Biddle did, she uses Marxist language throughout to describe 'earlier capitalism' and 'surveillance capitalism,' such as 'exploitation,' 'surplus,' and 'extraction,' not to mention postmodern statist concepts such as 'free will illusion,' 'individual freedom chaos,' and 'conditioned social engineering.' She revealingly concluded, and lamented that Zuboff did not, that:The problem with surveillance capitalism is as much the capitalism as it is the surveillance.Two new attempts to regulate 'the problem' of 'surveillance capitalism,' and thus 'capitalism' as well, come from Europe and California. Regarding the former, theFinancial Times(FT) reported onDecember 2019[6]that 'the EU's landmarkGeneral Data Protection Regulation[GDPR], [was] six years in the making before coming into force in May 2018.' They also, as the mainstream media (MSM) almost always does, inappropriately mixed in plenty of subjective prostatism opinions, such as: 'There is no doubt that GDPR has already done a lot of good' and 'But GDPR is deficient in several respects.It should be looking to reshape data markets, rather than just regulate them as they are.' Slatereported on similar regulations that recently passed in California, and they wasted no time with subtleties, putting their opinion right in the subtitle:'Thanks, California!' (December 2019[7]). They then described howTheCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act[CCPA] essentiallyempowersconsumers [starting on New Year's Day 2020] to access the personal data that companies have collected on them, to demand that it be deleted, and to prevent it from being sold to third parties.They also optimistically opine:Since it's a lot more work to create a separate infrastructure just for California residents to opt out of, these requirements will transform the internet for everyone.As if that were not enough, they start, as theFTdid for GDPR, the process of lobbying for more market intervention: 'The law is vague on how much power and transparency companies must offer to consumers in this process.' What the Center Is Saying In an article forTruth on the Market, Alec Stapp states his thesis in the title itself: 'Any Way You Measure It, Warren Is Wrong to Claim 'Facebook and Google Account for 70% of All Internet Traffic' (October 2019[8]). In countering Senator Elizabeth Warren's statistic about Facebook and Google's combined 70 percent market share of traffic, Stapp provides the following alternative stats: 20 percent of volume; 21 percent of time; 38 percent of connections; 33 percent of referrals; 32 percent of all advertising; and 59 percent of online advertising. And he, very importantly, notes that online advertising prices have fallen 42 percent over the past decade as volume has increased. Adam Candeub and Mark Epstein address a key legal question about Google, and others, such as Facebook and Twitter, in an article forCity Journalasking the question, 'Platform or Publisher?' (May 2018[9]). They write: 'Section 230 of theCommunications Decency Actimmunizes online platforms for their users' defamatory, fraudulent, or otherwise unlawful contentbut the law was not intended to facilitate political censorship.' They also importantly note that Section 230 was a response to a judicial decision, under the common law, that concluded thatutilizing technology and the manpower to delete objectionable content made [one] more like publisher[s] thannewsstands, bookstores, and libraries.Michael Dougherty provides some further background to Section 230 in theNational Review(June 2019[10]). He writes that it was passed: 'in part to allow Internet servicesto block pornography[and not be] treated in the law as publishers[which are] liable for whatever libels and slanders users posted on them.' Section 230: 'allows proprietors of websites and forums to set standards to edit and moderate their content without becoming a publisher of them.' But also, Section 230: 'is now the legal remit under which social-media giants shadow-ban, block, and censor conservative speech.' What the Right Is Saying In his article entitled 'Google Marxism' (December 2019[11]), Michael Rectenwald asserted that there is nowadays a 'Google Archipelago,' which 'is guided by aleft authoritarianism.' He described this as: 'the most developed set of technological apparatuses for disciplinary and governmental power and control in the world,' including 'The principals of what I call Big Digital the purveyors of mega-data services, media, cable, and internet services, social media platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, apps, and the developing Internet of Things.' He thus warned that 'Socialism has always had global pretensions. OnlyGoogle Marxismis capable of creating it, albeit in corporate socialist form.' William Anderson has also written about Google for the Mises Institute on a number of occasions over the years, including in the context of woke capitalism (July 2019[12]), economy bureaucratization (July 2018[13]) and antitrust law (December 2005[14]). Regarding the latter, he wrote: 'Google's search policies are decidedly left-wing,' but '[n]o one is forced to use the Internet at all and, thus, can avoid Google altogether if that is their choice.' Nevertheless, Anderson warned, 'The vagueness ofAntitrust Lawmakes it easy for government to heap abuse upon those firms that are out of favor at any given time, as no real legal proof is needed for the courts to act against the alleged monopolist.' And he added: 'despite the millions of dollars that the company's leaders and employees have raised for the Democrats, it is doubtful that many Democrats would be willing to stand up for a firm that is accused of being a monopolist.' Writing for Antiwar.com (August 2018[15]), Justin Raimondo reminded that: 'TheCommunications Decency Actimmunizes these companies against any [common law] torts,' and that '[t]his two-tiered system is responsible for the cartel-like conditions enjoyed by Facebook, Google, Twitter, and the rest of the Silicon Valley crowd.' He added that, this plus '[t]he vast wealth poured into this new technology by investors buoyed by historically low interest rates, has resulted in the enrichment of Big Data beyond the dreams ofCroesus[16].' The result is that 'In recognition of [these] government-granted privilegestheLords of the Internethave agreed to become the regime's enforcers.' Conclusion These organizations that allegedly practice 'surveillance capitalism' have become seemingly inescapable in our modern economy. This has led to a host of critics attempting to identify and explain the many ways that organizations like Facebook and Google have become damaging to our everyday lives and freedoms. Many of these critics get it wrong, though. On the Left, the reports and commentary about Google's so-called surveillance capitalism were more about the capitalism than the surveillance. As they've done many times in the past (such as during theGFC[17](Global Financial Crisis) of the late 2000s, theDot-com collapse[18]of the early 2000s, and theMicrosoft dominance[19]of the 1990s), they call for failed and selfish markets to be heavily regulated or even replaced by successful and selfless government. And emotion-laden stories, from the edges of thebell curve[20], are once again trotted out to bolster their case. In the center, there is largely an acceptance of the mixed economy (of markets and government) as it currently stands, and, in at least two cases, some pushback on further government intervention. Although these two do not seem to grasp the significance, they imply that government may be the source of a 'market structure,' resulting in 'market power,' and that regardless of that, 'market conduct' includes 'market performance' resulting in falling prices. (For more on structure-conduct-performance, seeRegulated Monopolies are not 'Natural,'April 2018[21].) Some conservatives get closer to the mark in their concern for free speech and the potential for abuse of government power through crony capitalism. Yet, only the free market critics cut through to the most important problem namely that the state's antitrust legislation has provided legal advantages against competitors while providing legal immunity to these firms. The size and power of the 'surveillance capitalists' has allowed the industry to escape the brunt of antitrust legislation. Many of their competitors have not been so lucky, and this an unfair advantage, to say the least. Meanwhile, as Raimondo notes, federal law protects these firms from being called to account in the civil courts. The result is a legal landscape that favors some at the expense of others. But as Anderson concludes, no one is forced to use the services of these firms, so claims of 'monopoly' are questionable. Ultimately, it is this lack of true monopoly that illustrates the weakness of many claims that government action is necessary to rein in firms that are powerfulprecisely becauseso many voluntarily use their services.

(David Becker/Getty Images) The computer scientist Jon Callas is a legend of the computer security world. For the last two years, he worked at Apple, where his job entailed breaking into the company's products to find holes in their security systems. Before that, he co-founded the companies Silent Circle and Blackphone\u2014purveyors of secure communications technology. </p><p>And earlier in his career, he served as the chief scientist at PGP, where he helped develop one of the world's most widely used encryption standards. So when Callas announced last year that he would be leaving Apple to take a two-year job as a technology fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), it raised a few eyebrows. Why would this computer security expert be leaving a high-paying job with huge responsibility for a fellowship at a liberal NGO? In an interview last week, Foreign Policy caught up with Callas to talk about technology, security, and the perils of Big Tech. Foreign Policy: Why are you making this move from Apple to ACLU? I'm guessing it was a bit of a pay cut for you. Jon Callas: Well, yes, working for an NGO doesn't pay as well as working for a large company. A bunch of friends told me, 'This is something you would be really good at.' This was in 2018, and if you look at the way the world is, it seems to me that being a technology fellow for the ACLU in 2019 and 2020 would be better for the world and more interesting than say in 2020 and 2021. The world has a set of issues that it is facing right now, and they are acutely compelling. I'm referring to government encroachment on civil rights, hacking all over the world, the political situation in the United States and other countries. I look at it from a broader viewpoint: that what we are going through in the United States and what's going on in the United Kingdom and going on in France are all reflections of a great uncertainty and turmoil. I am using surveillance as the umbrella for my work. Surveillance can be anything from the use of machine learning in picture and photo recognition to location privacy leaks to encryption and backdoors. All of these things have to do with surveillance and how much we are being tracked and by whom. FP: Do you think the tech industry is at all responsible for the kind of turmoil you are describing? JC: Yes, in a certain sense the tech industry is responsible, but changes in what's going on in media\u2014the way that it is developed and distributed\u2014are not simply the tech industry's responsibility. I don't know that what we are observing now is all that different from what we have seen in previous generations. Mass media in general has changed things, and this is the latest thing that's gone on with mass media. I think that consolidation is as much a problem as anything else. The problem with Big Tech is far more 'big' rather than 'tech.' FP: Why is bigness the problem rather than the technology side of the industry? JC: One major discussion today is: Where does free speech fit in the world? And what constitutes censorship? If an organization like Twitter says, 'No, we don't want this sort of thing on our platform,' and someone has somewhere else to go for that piece of content, then it is far less of a censorship issue than if there's only one outlet. Yes, they are a private company and can do what they want, but if Twitter is the only outlet for that content, then that means that somebody is having their speech repressed. Even though it isn't censorship, that has the same effects as censorship. FP: How are you planning on addressing these issues from your perch at the ACLU? What do you see as the way forward on these issues? JC: I am part of a growing group of people who believe that some of the issues are in fact not technical but policy. For example, every one of our cell phones\u2014because they have to connect to a set of towers\u2014radio data from those phones is a proxy for location. If that data is being given to companies or governments without the consent and control of users, I don't see a technical solution to that problem because the system definitionally knows where you are. FP: We're hearing similar arguments being made on Capitol Hill in terms of a general need for regulation of the tech industry. Where do you think that energy should be directed? JC:I am a fan of GDPR [the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which provides EU citizens with greater control over their data]. It's not perfect but is a huge step forward in how we want to get control of this larger issue that we all deal with. I like that some tech companies have responded by saying that GDPR is effectively the privacy policy that will apply everywhere. But there are also follow-on effects to the policy. For example, if someone gets control of your account, they can ask for all of your personal data under GDPR. They're impersonating you and with that data can learn how to better impersonate you. FP:Do you think that there's a need for the bigness of major technology companies to be reduced\u2014perhaps in the form of antitrust action against some of the large tech companies? JC:That is inevitably going to be discussed. It isn't just the tech companies. It isn't just the media companies. It isn't just the advertising companies. With there being fewer choices for us, it becomes harder for people to vote with their feet and their dollars. If you have only one internet service provider, your ability to negotiate with it is much less than it would be if you had four. There's not as much competition that's going on. The reason that the 'big' is a problem is that there is a place for both market solutions and government. If there isn't an effective market, then the only choice you have is a regulatory one. FP:Are there security and privacy implications to the bigness of the big tech companies at the moment? And do you consider antitrust action against them to be an effective solution? JC:Our notion of antitrust comes from the beginning of the 20th century, and it needs to be rethought. If you look at what's going on with bigness today, it isn't big in the same way that the railroads were a monopoly a century ago. My previous employer Apple has a market share that is well below half. Depending on who you talk to and how they count things, the company's market share is anywhere from one-sixth to one-third. From that view of the world, it is obviously not a monopoly. I'm not sure that I can effectively answer a question like, 'Is Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Apple a monopoly?' If you look at it one way, you think, 'Well, obviously it isn't.' And if you look at it another way, you say, 'Well, there are effects here that are as if they were a monopoly.' FP:In the early days of the internet, there was the hope that the widespread availability of cryptographic protocols and the internet generally would be a boon for individual privacy and liberty. Decades later, we are at a place where individual privacy has been stripped away in an effort to make huge gobs of money. You've been around the tech industry for a long time. You helped build some of its fundamental security protocols. Are you disappointed in the way that the tech industry has evolved from its early days? JC:I'm disappointed that we have not built as many privacy structures into things as possible. I'm very disappointed in things like advertising tracking. I have been one of the people who have said, 'If you're not the customer, you're the product.' Still, we've been given a lot of extraordinarily useful tools. What's on the internet right now is in some respects the world's greatest library. We've been given this, and it's been paid for by advertising. I remember many discussions over the last decade or so about the power of free. And the power of free is funded by the money of advertising. FP:You're one of the world's foremost computer experts alive today, and you work at a time that computer security feels like an absolute disaster. Do you have a theory on why it got so bad? JC:I don't think it's an absolute disaster. I think we're making progress. Years ago, one of the principles of computer security was that physical access is all\u2014that if the adversary has control of the device, then all bets are off. Now we are in a situation where we have reversed that discussion. The debate over government access to secure communications and devices is happening because Apple and Google are making technology that has made great progress in security. There are challenges ahead of us with things like the so-called 'internet of things.' It's very difficult to buy a television today that is not a smart television. At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, an executive from the television company Vizio explained[1] that if they weren't monetizing the customer through advertising, then prices for the television would go up. FP:Do you expect Silicon Valley to at all be responsive to the backlash against it? JC:I'm sometimes really irritated by the lumping together of many things in Silicon Valley. It's an easy thing to say and sometimes meaningless. The drive toward free services that are paid for by advertising encourages a style of developing things that people want in ways that create downstream effects. If Facebook was something that we all paid a monthly fee for and we could look at it in terms of what we as customers have as a relationship with our provider, it would be a different conversation than the one that we're having now, which is that we all feel helpless. And the problem is the helplessness. Some of the more traditional companies, such as Apple and Microsoft, are traditional customer-provider relationships. Other companies are kind of a hybrid. I'm pretty thoroughly in the Amazon world as well as the Apple one, because I really like my iPhone and I really like my Kindle. And I have my Kindle to be cheaper by showing me ads. Part of that is that I want to see ads about more books. Part of that is that I trust Amazon with my advertising data in a way that I do not trust Facebook. And that comes from my perceptions of what my relationship with Facebook is as opposed to my relationship with Amazon. Yet my relationship with both of those companies is different than it is with, say, Apple and Microsoft. I'm concerned about the creep of things like: Can I buy a television that is just a device and not connected to the internet? Can I buy a refrigerator that is just a device? FP:Do you think it's possible for companies like Google and Facebook to operate in China and live up to the aspirational ideals that they set out for themselves about working to change the world for the better? JC:I definitely am concerned about countries like China, but I'm someone who thinks that from a geopolitical standpoint, embargoes and boycotts on countries like Cuba and Iran were probably not as effective as they were sold to be. The Chinese people are only seeing what is being filtered through the Chinese government, and they're not getting any other outside voices. Having no Western companies there means that we are abdicating that information and those viewpoints to the Chinese government. I would like to see Western companies involved in China because Chinese companies are going to be involved here. FP:What do you think of the debate playing out in the United States about the national security threat posed by the Chinese telecom company Huawei? JC:I think that there are both kernels of truth in it and fearmongering. There is certainly some kernel of truth that Huawei is partially owned by the Chinese government. There certainly are risks. In the older days\u2014the '60s, '70s, and '80s\u2014we would have had restrictions on what foreign companies can do in telecommunications. We opened that up in the'90s, particularly after the fall of the Iron Curtain. The pendulum is now swinging back. That we ought to have these restrictions in place has a certain amount of merit. But it could be addressed through other ways than simply banning them. FP:Do you think there's a way for Huawei to prove that it is an honest player? JC:It could be done. I think that we want all of our providers to be able to do that, and we want them to do that because we've seen abuses. FP:What do you wish Washington understood about Silicon Valley? And vice versa: What do you wish Silicon Valley understood about Washington? JC:Washington needs to understand that small decisions on one end can have large effects on others. One of my bugaboos as a security person is that I want to create secure devices because I want to have things like my health data on my phone. I want to have many things that are pieces of paper sitting in my wallet on the electronic device that I have. I like being able to go to the airport and have my boarding pass on my phone. I would love to be able to go to my doctor and have my information there. We have a choice between designing for security and designing for surveillance, and the government needs to understand that we the people want to have security more than we want to have surveillance. In Silicon Valley, we need to understand what people think about things and where they will go to address them. In Europe, many people saw technology and the changes it would bring as something coming not only from outside their country but predominantly from the West Coast of the United States and the greater Hong Kong area. And they don't get to vote for that. But they do get to vote for their local government. And it is arrogant of us to presume that they would not appeal to the people that they do vote for, for relief from things that they find anything from abusive to creepy. And if we don't come up with a solution to these problems, then government will. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

It's also the NSA, Google, Facebook and credit card hackers.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Christine Romans.  This is YOUR MONEY.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When it comes to tests, your government is either too smart or back in the dark ages.  The rollout of healthcare.gov may have been a fiasco but America's fine capabilities are feared and envied by the rest of the world.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week a federal judge ruled the NSA's bulk collection of phone records is likely unconstitutional.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is the program essentially essential to security or an abuse of power? That's in the eye of the beholder.  Let's look at this from the perspective of the NSA director.  General Keith Alexander says the NSA's intelligence programs have helped prevent 54 terror attacks, 13 of those in the U.S. alone, including a threat to New York City subways.  </p><p>Now put on your Google glasses.  Google along with other major tech companies says the government has overstepped.  A report in the \"Washington Post\" alleged the NSA is tapping into links connected to the company's data centers giving the government access to users information.  The NSA denying those claims.  </p><p>Now tech companies are worried this could damage their businesses.  Of course their research says Cloud computing companies could lose a quarter of their businesses up to $180 billion by 2016 as companies and individuals put their data elsewhere.  </p><p>Tech company leaders have filed lawsuits against the NSA and written open letter calling for reform.  This week, they took their case to the White House.  </p><p>John Avlon is a CNN political analyst and executive director of \"The Daily Beast.\"  Shobhan MacDermott is chief policy officer at AVG Technologies and the author of Wide Open Privacy Strategies for the Digital Life.  </p><p>She says people should be afraid of Google spying on them and not the government, which brings me to the meeting this week from the tech executives and the White House.  You look at that sort of photo-op and I said, they know too much about you.  And who I'm talking about?  I'm talking about the tech companies and the government.  </p><p>Why should we even be so afraid of Google?  </p><p>SHOBHAN MACDERMOTT, CHIEF POLICY OFFICER, AVG TECHNOLOGIES:  Well, I think part of the reason we should be afraid of it is that they see everything, they see everything that you search for.  They see everything that you're looking at and people share a whole bunch of information online.  And they're not necessarily aware of the fact that that information isn't just disappearing after they look for something.  </p><p>ROMANS:  This is the way that Edward Snowden puts it.  Let's listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDWARD SNOWDEN, NSA LEAKER:  You're being watched and recorded.  And the storage capability of the systems increases every year consistently by orders of magnitude to where it is getting to the point you don't have to have done anything wrong.  You simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  Some privacy experts have sort of noted how rich it is really that you've got some of the big tech companies telling the White House they don't like their methods when it -- tech companies know an awful lot about you.  </p><p>MACDERMOTT:  Yes, I mean, that's true.  And if you look at social media networks, they probably know more about you because you're sharing information there that you're not necessarily conscious of all the time.  You're putting pictures of your kids up.  They know where they're going to school.  They know where you live.  They know when you're home, you're checking in on social media sites and saying, I'm either at home or I'm not at home.  You know all of these things open you up to all kinds of privacy issues.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Is this, John -- the revelations about the NSA and the problems with healthcare.gov, they creek this sort of this credibility gap for the president.  A recent ORC poll finds 53 percent of the Americans say the president is not honest or trustworthy.  Double what it was at the end of 2008.  </p><p>Can he regain the public's trust?  </p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  He can.  But you see that downward trend.  And it really is because of that core claim of his re-election campaign, if you like your health care, you can keep it.  And you take the screw-ups of healthcare.gov and then the revelation that that wasn't true.  And that hurts it.  But this president has always gotten high marks on that measure.  </p><p>The larger dynamic actually is a trap that the president is caught in. And it's a trap that Eisenhower began warning about 60 years ago with the military industrial complex.  We have seen the creation of a surveillance state, a national security state that has become unaccountable even to the commander in chief.  And that's one of the fascinating dynamics of our time and could be one of the major challenges of his second term.  </p><p>Can he dial that back?  Can he rein the surveillance state?  Or is the Genie out of the bottle because of both private and companies and their interaction with the government.  </p><p>ROMANS:  So let's go back to the big companies, the big tech companies, Shobhan.  Facebook, Google, they need users.  The public is essentially the product, not the consumer.  Really, right?  I mean, it's our information that they're dealing with.  </p><p>What kind of damage does it risk to these companies' reputation as a result of these I would say growing privacy concerns?  </p><p>MACDERMOTT:  Well, I think in my opinion one of the things that's always difficult to look at is the actual sheer amount of data that's been collected on people.  And the fact that all of this can be taken out of context.  There's no context put around it.  When you look at national surveillance, there's context around it in the fact that you're looking for, you know, a specific threat.  </p><p>ROMANS:  That's a really good point.  </p><p>MACDERMOTT:  As opposed to when somebody is collecting a bunch of data about an individual.  I may be searching, for instance, you know, presenting at a conference on child exploitation, now those are in my Google searches.  Well, somebody takes that out of context and looks at me and says, what kind of person are you?  And do I need to, you know, take a look at me in further detail.  </p><p>Again the issue of context, I think, is really important when it comes to the difference between the government watching what you're doing and the tech companies watching what you're doing.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Yes.  Everyone is watching.  There's so much information, it's insane.  </p><p>AVLON:  There is.  And you've got two motives.  You've got the profit motive, you've got the national security motive.  But I mean, the overall issue is technology outpacing our laws.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Yes.  </p><p>AVLON:  The growth of technology has so outpaced against our laws.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Absolutely.  </p><p>AVLON:  That until that accountability comes in, that gray area will be exploited by people pursuing their own self-interest.  </p><p>ROMANS:  And that's what the -- that's what the tech companies basically said to the president.  They want -- they want the rules of their own.  </p><p>AVLON:  Exactly.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Because we just have an archaic system.  </p><p>Shobhan MacDermott, John Avlon, nice to see both of you, guys.  Thank you.  </p><p>AVLON:  Merry Christmas.  </p><p>MACDERMOTT:  Thank you.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Coming up, even if you're not a Target shopper, even if you're not worried about the 40 million customers who fear their information was stolen, you should be.  Next, we'll show you how easy it is for hackers to get their hands on your credit card number.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PARK, TRUSTWAVE:  If I have access to the entire mag-stripe data that's on this device and I can -- I can get all of this and enough information to actually create a whole different card.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  It's not the news Target was hoping we'd be reporting this holiday season.  If you shopped at Target between November 27th and December 15th, your information may have been stolen.  </p><p>Right in the middle of Black Friday and the holiday shopping craziness, hackers hit those card readers that you use at checkout. So how could this have happened and what information can hackers steal from that little magnetic strip on your credit cards?  </p><p>CNNMoney tech correspondent Laurie Segall is here with some answers.  </p><p>Hi, Laurie.  </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY TECH CORRESPONDENT:  Hey.  Well, as you said, this hack is so widespread.  We wanted to take an inside look and see exactly the information these hackers could get if you were one of those unlucky folks that swiped your card at Target.  Check it out.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL (voice-over):  If you've done some holiday shopping at Target -- you might be wondering what a hacker could learn about you from your credit card.  </p><p>When you swipe, here's what a hacker could learn from the data in that magnetic strip.  Your name, your credit card number, the card's expiration date and the CVV code on the back.  </p><p>JOSE PAGLIERY, CNNMONEY:  All of these key data that can be used to falsify that card and go ahead and fraudulently use it online, they can access that just by taking what's on the strip.  </p><p>SEGALL:  In the case of the Target hack, that data may have been enough for hackers to make a counterfeit card.  One security researcher who showed us the different credit card hack explains.  To the employee, everything looks normal.  </p><p>MIKE PARK, TRUSTWAVE:  I just have to log in.  I could make a selection here.  And then I can do a credit card swipe.  It will ask me for the CVV.  I can put in a CVV.  Whatever numbers I want.  And then click pay.  Right?  Nothing seems untoward.  </p><p>SEGALL:  For the customer, pretty standard.  </p><p>PARK:  You're paid.  You get your receipt.  You move on.  </p><p>SEGALL:  But for the hacker.  </p><p>PARK:  I have access to the entire mag-stripe data that's on this device and I can -- I can get all of this and enough information to actually create a whole different card.  </p><p>SEGALL:  The Target hack has some saying that the U.S. is a little behind the times in terms of secure payments.  </p><p>PAGLIERY:  Well, one secure -- more secure solution that they have in Europe right now is this chip and PIN system in which the card doesn't actually have a strip.  It has a chip within it.  And every time you use it, you also have to use a pin.  </p><p>SEGALL:  According to the Federal Reserve, credit card fraud in England plummeted 34 percent in the six years after English banks and merchants implemented chip and PIN cards.  During a similar period in France, fraud from in-person card fell 35 percent.  But this holiday season, millions of American shoppers might have been the target.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL:  You know, the silver lining is we're having this discussion about what kind of technology can we invest in to ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen again.  But I'll tell you the -- the security researcher we spoke to, now he says, the major retailers are still at risk.  They have faulty software.  </p><p>ROMANS:  And not just when you're a consumer, you're just so bummed that you do everything that the retailer wants you to do.  You're going out there and spend.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Right.  </p><p>ROMANS:  I mean, that's what their advertising machine is trying to get you to do.  And then they can't keep a hold of your data.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Yes.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Frustrating.  </p><p>Laurie Segall, nice to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>For more stories that matter to YOUR MONEY, give me 60 seconds on the clock.  It's \"Money Time.\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS:  Drug giant GlaxoSmithKline will no longer pay drug reps based on their sales numbers.  It'll also stop paying doctors marking a big change in how the pharma company pushes its products.  </p><p>Vitamins are a waste of money.  Strong words from researchers studying long-term benefits in taking multivitamins.  The vitamin industry rakes in nearly $12 billion every year.  </p><p>Revenge of the nerds?  Or not so much.  A new study finds people who were attractive in high school end up making more money later.  An 8 percent bump for good-looking women and 4 percent more for men.  </p><p>Target is shunning Queen B.  The retailer will not sell Beyonce's album.  It was available digitally first.  Target says that hurt sales.  </p><p>Can you smell what the Rock is cooking?  \"Forbes\" named Dwayne Johnson this year's top grossing actor.  His movies including \"Fast and Furious 6\" and \"G.I. Joe\" brought in $1.3 billion at the global box office.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS:  Coming up, this economy is taking flight, but could Groundhog Day in Washington crush the recovery?  I'm going to go one-on-one with the Republican senator who says if Democrats want to talk debt ceiling, they better be prepared to bargain over Obamacare.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  Fact.  The economy is getting better in this country.  Stock market records, a housing recovery for those with cash and credit. Soaring corporate earnings.  The U.S. economy grew more than 4 percent in the third quarter.  More than 4 percent.  This recovery is benefitting the top 1 percent of households.  In the past three years, they've taken home 95 percent of the income gains.  </p><p>What does that say about where the country is headed?  </p><p>Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, joins me now.  </p><p>Senator, welcome back to the show.  So nice to see you.  Let me start with this economy.  It's taking flight.  No one -- no one wants to see the government ground the plane, but here comes Groundhog Day. Republicans say they want concessions in exchange for raising the debt ceiling early next year.  </p><p>The White House says it won't negotiate and the Treasury secretary Jack Lew can't, quote, \"foresee any reasonable scenario\" in which the government can keep paying all the bills past March.  </p><p>Senator, how does this end?   SEN. RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN:  Well, hello, Christine.  First of all, let's talk about what we just did.  We have, I believe, avoided government shutdowns at least through fiscal year 2015.  And that's a good thing.  You know, try and bring some certainty to our economy. Try and give some of these agencies and departments and committees in Congress the opportunity to rationally prioritize spending.  </p><p>So we have to return some certainly to our economy so it can continue to grow and create jobs.  But when it comes to the debt ceiling or let's put it another way, when the president comes to Congress, asking for the authority to increase the debt burden on our kids and grand kids.  You know, I think the American people do expect some additional fiscal reforms to be at that point.  </p><p>From my standpoint, what I'd like to do is I'd like to do is I'd like start taking a look at this health care law, taking -- hopefully our Democratic colleagues are listening to the pleas of Americans that are begging for relief that are -- you know, just -- they're unbelieving in terms of how harmful that --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS:  Are you -- wait, are you going to tie the health --  </p><p>JOHNSON:  How harmful -- that's what I would like to do.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Are you going to tie reforms to the health care law to raising the debt ceiling?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, that's what I'd like to do.  I'm not sure exactly, you know, what type of fiscal reforms, what type of fiscal discipline, what kind of, you know, you have to do something.  The American people expect us to do something.  </p><p>If we're going to increase the debt burden on our kids and grandkids, we have to do some kind of reforms to make Social Security and Medicare solvent for future generations to stop the bankrupt in this nation.  </p><p>ROMANS:  So --  </p><p>JOHNSON:  We have to do something. </p><p>ROMANS:  You talk about people crying, you talk about crying for relief from the health care law, but at the same time you have people crying for relief for a little more time on unemployment benefits.  </p><p>We'll talk about what the bill -- the budget bill doesn't do.  It doesn't extend the federal unemployment benefits.  1.3 million Americans are going to lose those benefits at the end of this month. And when you look at the economic data, as I do, Senator, you can see, for people newly unemployed, things are getting better.  Things really are.  </p><p>For people who've been out of work six months or longer, it's the same old story.  And those jobless benefits go right into the economy. Would you support putting more money into jobless benefits here?  If you're talking about crying for relief from health care reform, what about crying for relief for the long-term unemployed?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Let's talk about the health care law's effect on unemployment.  You know the 29ers.  The people who are now being put into part-time status so that their employers don't have to pay that fine.  You know, this health care law is doing a great deal of harm to job creation, but anybody that wants to increase or renew unemployment benefits, you've got to first say, well, what is the lower priority spending item that you're going to, you know, take off the table?  </p><p>You know what areas of the budget are you going to cut to make room for what you consider higher priority item?  So that's the -- that's the first table stakes.  Don't come and request some more government spending without showing us how you're going to reduce the deficit in another area.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Clearly, a lot of prioritizing to go for the next couple of years.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Absolutely.  </p><p>ROMANS:  You know, on this show, sir, we talk about one America but two economies.  Anger over income inequality.  Anger over a lack of a living wage.  It's really on the rise.  </p><p>I want you to listen to liberal comedian Bill Maher and then I want to give you a chance to respond.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL MAHER, HOST, \"REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER\":  When even working people can't make enough to live, they take money from the government in the form of food stamps, school lunches, housing assistance, daycare.  This is the welfare that conservatives hate, but they never stop to think, if we raise the minimum wage and force McDonald's and Wal-Mart to pay their employees enough to eat, we, the taxpayers, wouldn't have to pick up the slack.  </p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  I've got to ask you, does Bill Maher have a point?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  No, when you raise the minimum wage, you remove those entry level positions, you create more unemployment.  And that's not a good thing.  What you need to do is you need to actually make the manufacturing base of this country more robust.  How do you do that? You make America an attractive place for business investment, business expansion, job creation.  </p><p>We have an onerous regulatory environment in this country.  Obamacare is part of that.  We have uncompetitive tax rates.  I mean, if you're a German manufacturer who want to manufacture for the largest economy in the world, are you going to site your plant in Toronto at 15 percent, or Detroit at 35 percent?  </p><p>So it's not rocket science in terms of what we have to do to make America an attractive place for job creation.  We're just not doing it in this totally dysfunctional place called the federal government.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Well, at least we have the frameworks of a budget deal for the next couple of years.  We'll take that as nice starting point.  </p><p>Thank you, sir.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  That's a small little step.  Have a merry Christmas.  </p><p>ROMANS:  You, too.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>All right.  Coming up, who is your favorite CNN anchor?  No, he doesn't work for CNN, but he's probably your favorite, maybe your second favorite anchor of all time.  The business of being Will Ferrell, next.  </p><p>Plus, winning the lottery without buying a ticket.  An incredible moment.  So how much money does it take to elicit this reaction?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YOUNG SOO LEE, STORE OWNER:  Oh, my gosh. Oh, my -- I never that much money.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  This might just be the most valuable mustache around.  You might not be aware, but \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues\" is out this weekend.  It hasn't been heavily marketed or advertised, so you're excused for not knowing.  </p><p>Seriously, the man behind the mustache is everywhere.  He's everywhere.  Take a look at the business of being a comedy god.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over):  Ron Burgundy is back.  </p><p>WILL FERRELL, \"RON BURGUNDY\":  We haven't seen you in a while, America.  </p><p>ROMANS:  From your TV cabinet to your liquor cabinet, the business of being Will Ferrell is --  </p><p>DAVID KOECHNER, \"CHAMP KID\":  It's just refreshing.  </p><p>ROMANS:  During seven seasons on \"Saturday Night Live,\" he earned laughs.  Known for his impressions, from George W. Bush --  </p><p>FERRELL:  Strategery.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS:  To Janet Reno, to Saddam Hussein.  </p><p>FERRELL:  Monica, you never call me anymore.  </p><p>ROMANS:  In his last season, he reportedly became the highest paid cast member.  His salary: $350,000.  </p><p>FERRELL:  We're going streaking.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Before long, he went old school.  </p><p>FERRELL:  Yes.  </p><p>ROMANS:  The movie was a hit, box office take $87 million worldwide.  </p><p>FERRELL:  It's so good.  </p><p>ROMANS:  This funny man became a leading man.  There was \"Elf.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  Santa.  Oh, my gosh.  </p><p>ROMANS:  \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  You stay classy, San Diego.  </p><p>ROMANS:  \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.\"  \"Blades of Glory.  \"Stepbrothers.\"  The animated hit \"Mega Mind.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  Incredibly handsome, mater of all villainy.  </p><p>ROMANS:  And the \"Campaign.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  Let me hear a (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>ROMANS:  They haven't all been hits, and he was once named the most overpaid actor by \"Forbes.\"  But tallied all up, movies Will Ferrell has starred in have grossed almost $2 billion.  </p><p>FERRELL:  Massive amounts of money.  </p><p>ROMANS:  And that's before \"Anchorman 2.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  Why can't the news be fun?  </p><p>ROMANS:  Ron Burgundy does product placement very well.  Dodge commercials featuring the anchorman helped push Durango sales up almost 60 percent in October.  </p><p>FERRELL:  It makes you feel pretty dumb, doesn't it?  </p><p>ROMANS:  The fictional character has inspired a line of underwear, scotch, and an ice cream flavor.  </p><p>FERRELL:  I love scotch.  Scotchy, scotch, scotch.   ROMANS:  And Ferrell can also sell beer.  Apparently based on this ad for old Milwaukee that went viral.  Ferrell has also taken his talents to Broadway with a one-man show called \"You're Welcome, America: A final Night with George W. Bush.\"  He also he co-founded the comedy video Web site, \"Funny or Die.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  Don't make fun of me crying.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Don't worry.  The business of being Will Ferrell leaves very little to cry about.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS:  Wow.  And that \"Funny or Die\" Web site is no joke.  It gets millions of unique visitors every month.  It's got backers in Silicon Valley, lots of advertisers and partnerships with big media companies. Not bad for -- not bad an outlet for all of Will Ferrell's very funny videos.  The only coming I know who's got D.C. backing.  </p><p>All right.  It's not a movie but it's a Hollywood ending.  Young Soo Lee owns the Atlantic convenient Store that sold one of two winning Mega Millions tickets for Tuesday's monster jackpot.  She figured she'd be paid $25,000 for selling that ticket, but CNN's Martin Savidge delivered her quite a shock.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YOUNG:  Long time ago, I heard it's $25,000.  </p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  25,000.  Let me just tell you, it's a lot more than $25,000.  </p><p>YOUNG:  Really?  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  It is about $1 million that you get.  </p><p>YOUNG:  I do?  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my -- I never have that much money.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  Good for her.  What a stroke of luck.  </p><p>Thanks for starting Saturday smart with us.

It's also the <person><nameText>NSA, </nameText></person>Google, Facebook and credit card hackers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Christine Romans. This is YOUR MONEY.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When it comes to tests, your government is either too smart or back in the dark ages. The rollout of healthcare.gov may have been a fiasco but America's fine capabilities are feared and envied by the rest of the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week a federal judge ruled the <person><nameText>NSA's </nameText></person>bulk collection of phone records is likely unconstitutional.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is the program essentially essential to security or an abuse of power? That's in the eye of the beholder. Let's look at this from the perspective of the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>director. General Keith Alexander says the <person><nameText>NSA's </nameText></person>intelligence programs have helped prevent 54 terror attacks, 13 of those in the U.S. alone, including a threat to New York City subways.</p><p>Now put on your Google glasses. Google along with other major tech companies says the government has overstepped. A report in the \"Washington Post\" alleged the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>is tapping into links connected to the company's data centers giving the government access to users information. The <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>denying those claims.</p><p>Now tech companies are worried this could damage their businesses. Of course their research says Cloud computing companies could lose a quarter of their businesses up to $180 billion by 2016 as companies and individuals put their data elsewhere.</p><p>Tech company leaders have filed lawsuits against the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>and written open letter calling for reform. This week, they took their case to the White House.</p><p>John Avlon is a CNN political analyst and executive director of \"The Daily Beast.\" Shobhan MacDermott is chief policy officer at AVG Technologies and the author of Wide Open Privacy Strategies for the Digital Life.</p><p>She says people should be afraid of Google spying on them and not the government, which brings me to the meeting this week from the tech executives and the White House. You look at that sort of photo-op and I said, they know too much about you. And who I'm talking about? I'm talking about the tech companies and the government.</p><p>Why should we even be so afraid of Google?</p><p>SHOBHAN MACDERMOTT, CHIEF POLICY OFFICER, AVG TECHNOLOGIES: Well, I think part of the reason we should be afraid of it is that they see everything, they see everything that you search for. They see everything that you're looking at and people share a whole bunch of information online. And they're not necessarily aware of the fact that that information isn't just disappearing after they look for something.</p><p>ROMANS: This is the way that <person><nameText>Edward Snowden </nameText></person>puts it. Let's listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD SNOWDEN, </nameText></person><person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>LEAKER: You're being watched and recorded. And the storage capability of the systems increases every year consistently by orders of magnitude to where it is getting to the point you don't have to have done anything wrong. You simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Some privacy experts have sort of noted how rich it is really that you've got some of the big tech companies telling the White House they don't like their methods when it -- tech companies know an awful lot about you.</p><p>MACDERMOTT: Yes, I mean, that's true. And if you look at social media networks, they probably know more about you because you're sharing information there that you're not necessarily conscious of all the time. You're putting pictures of your kids up. They know where they're going to school. They know where you live. They know when you're home, you're checking in on social media sites and saying, I'm either at home or I'm not at home. You know all of these things open you up to all kinds of privacy issues.</p><p>ROMANS: Is this, John -- the revelations about the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>and the problems with healthcare.gov, they creek this sort of this credibility gap for the president. A recent ORC poll finds 53 percent of the Americans say the president is not honest or trustworthy. Double what it was at the end of 2008.</p><p>Can he regain the public's trust?</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: He can. But you see that downward trend. And it really is because of that core claim of his re-election campaign, if you like your health care, you can keep it. And you take the screw-ups of healthcare.gov and then the revelation that that wasn't true. And that hurts it. But this president has always gotten high marks on that measure.</p><p>The larger dynamic actually is a trap that the president is caught in. And it's a trap that Eisenhower began warning about 60 years ago with the military industrial complex. We have seen the creation of a surveillance state, a national security state that has become unaccountable even to the commander in chief. And that's one of the fascinating dynamics of our time and could be one of the major challenges of his second term.</p><p>Can he dial that back? Can he rein the surveillance state? Or is the Genie out of the bottle because of both private and companies and their interaction with the government.</p><p>ROMANS: So let's go back to the big companies, the big tech companies, Shobhan. Facebook, Google, they need users. The public is essentially the product, not the consumer. Really, right? I mean, it's our information that they're dealing with.</p><p>What kind of damage does it risk to these companies' reputation as a result of these I would say growing privacy concerns?</p><p>MACDERMOTT: Well, I think in my opinion one of the things that's always difficult to look at is the actual sheer amount of data that's been collected on people. And the fact that all of this can be taken out of context. There's no context put around it. When you look at national surveillance, there's context around it in the fact that you're looking for, you know, a specific threat.</p><p>ROMANS: That's a really good point.</p><p>MACDERMOTT: As opposed to when somebody is collecting a bunch of data about an individual. I may be searching, for instance, you know, presenting at a conference on child exploitation, now those are in my Google searches. Well, somebody takes that out of context and looks at me and says, what kind of person are you? And do I need to, you know, take a look at me in further detail.</p><p>Again the issue of context, I think, is really important when it comes to the difference between the government watching what you're doing and the tech companies watching what you're doing.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes. Everyone is watching. There's so much information, it's insane.</p><p>AVLON: There is. And you've got two motives. You've got the profit motive, you've got the national security motive. But I mean, the overall issue is technology outpacing our laws.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>AVLON: The growth of technology has so outpaced against our laws.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely.</p><p>AVLON: That until that accountability comes in, that gray area will be exploited by people pursuing their own self-interest.</p><p>ROMANS: And that's what the -- that's what the tech companies basically said to the president. They want -- they want the rules of their own.</p><p>AVLON: Exactly.</p><p>ROMANS: Because we just have an archaic system.</p><p>Shobhan MacDermott, John Avlon, nice to see both of you, guys. Thank you.</p><p>AVLON: Merry Christmas.</p><p>MACDERMOTT: Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: Coming up, even if you're not a Target shopper, even if you're not worried about the 40 million customers who fear their information was stolen, you should be. Next, we'll show you how easy it is for hackers to get their hands on your credit card number.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PARK, TRUSTWAVE: If I have access to the entire mag-stripe data that's on this device and I can -- I can get all of this and enough information to actually create a whole different card.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: It's not the news Target was hoping we'd be reporting this holiday season. If you shopped at Target between November 27th and December 15th, your information may have been stolen.</p><p>Right in the middle of Black Friday and the holiday shopping craziness, hackers hit those card readers that you use at checkout. So how could this have happened and what information can hackers steal from that little magnetic strip on your credit cards?</p><p>CNNMoney tech correspondent Laurie Segall is here with some answers.</p><p>Hi, Laurie.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY TECH CORRESPONDENT: Hey. Well, as you said, this hack is so widespread. We wanted to take an inside look and see exactly the information these hackers could get if you were one of those unlucky folks that swiped your card at Target. Check it out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL (voice-over): If you've done some holiday shopping at Target -- you might be wondering what a hacker could learn about you from your credit card.</p><p>When you swipe, here's what a hacker could learn from the data in that magnetic strip. Your name, your credit card number, the card's expiration date and the CVV code on the back.</p><p>JOSE PAGLIERY, CNNMONEY: All of these key data that can be used to falsify that card and go ahead and fraudulently use it online, they can access that just by taking what's on the strip.</p><p>SEGALL: In the case of the Target hack, that data may have been enough for hackers to make a counterfeit card. One security researcher who showed us the different credit card hack explains. To the employee, everything looks normal.</p><p>MIKE PARK, TRUSTWAVE: I just have to log in. I could make a selection here. And then I can do a credit card swipe. It will ask me for the CVV. I can put in a CVV. Whatever numbers I want. And then click pay. Right? Nothing seems untoward.</p><p>SEGALL: For the customer, pretty standard.</p><p>PARK: You're paid. You get your receipt. You move on.</p><p>SEGALL: But for the hacker.</p><p>PARK: I have access to the entire mag-stripe data that's on this device and I can -- I can get all of this and enough information to actually create a whole different card.</p><p>SEGALL: The Target hack has some saying that the U.S. is a little behind the times in terms of secure payments.</p><p>PAGLIERY: Well, one secure -- more secure solution that they have in Europe right now is this chip and PIN system in which the card doesn't actually have a strip. It has a chip within it. And every time you use it, you also have to use a pin.</p><p>SEGALL: According to the Federal Reserve, credit card fraud in England plummeted 34 percent in the six years after English banks and merchants implemented chip and PIN cards. During a similar period in France, fraud from in-person card fell 35 percent. But this holiday season, millions of American shoppers might have been the target.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL: You know, the silver lining is we're having this discussion about what kind of technology can we invest in to ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen again. But I'll tell you the -- the security researcher we spoke to, now he says, the major retailers are still at risk. They have faulty software.</p><p>ROMANS: And not just when you're a consumer, you're just so bummed that you do everything that the retailer wants you to do. You're going out there and spend.</p><p>SEGALL: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: I mean, that's what their advertising machine is trying to get you to do. And then they can't keep a hold of your data.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Frustrating.</p><p>Laurie Segall, nice to see you. Thank you.</p><p>For more stories that matter to YOUR MONEY, give me 60 seconds on the clock. It's \"Money Time.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: Drug giant GlaxoSmithKline will no longer pay drug reps based on their sales numbers. It'll also stop paying doctors marking a big change in how the pharma company pushes its products.</p><p>Vitamins are a waste of money. Strong words from researchers studying long-term benefits in taking multivitamins. The vitamin industry rakes in nearly $12 billion every year.</p><p>Revenge of the nerds? Or not so much. A new study finds people who were attractive in high school end up making more money later. An 8 percent bump for good-looking women and 4 percent more for men.</p><p>Target is shunning Queen B. The retailer will not sell Beyonce's album. It was available digitally first. Target says that hurt sales.</p><p>Can you smell what the Rock is cooking? \"Forbes\" named Dwayne Johnson this year's top grossing actor. His movies including \"Fast and Furious 6\" and \"G.I. Joe\" brought in $1.3 billion at the global box office.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: Coming up, this economy is taking flight, but could Groundhog Day in Washington crush the recovery? I'm going to go one-on-one with the Republican senator who says if Democrats want to talk debt ceiling, they better be prepared to bargain over Obamacare.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: Fact. The economy is getting better in this country. Stock market records, a housing recovery for those with cash and credit. Soaring corporate earnings. The U.S. economy grew more than 4 percent in the third quarter. More than 4 percent. This recovery is benefitting the top 1 percent of households. In the past three years, they've taken home 95 percent of the income gains.</p><p>What does that say about where the country is headed?</p><p>Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, joins me now.</p><p>Senator, welcome back to the show. So nice to see you. Let me start with this economy. It's taking flight. No one -- no one wants to see the government ground the plane, but here comes Groundhog Day. Republicans say they want concessions in exchange for raising the debt ceiling early next year.</p><p>The White House says it won't negotiate and the Treasury secretary Jack Lew can't, quote, \"foresee any reasonable scenario\" in which the government can keep paying all the bills past March.</p><p>Senator, how does this end? SEN. RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN: Well, hello, Christine. First of all, let's talk about what we just did. We have, I believe, avoided government shutdowns at least through fiscal year 2015. And that's a good thing. You know, try and bring some certainty to our economy. Try and give some of these agencies and departments and committees in Congress the opportunity to rationally prioritize spending.</p><p>So we have to return some certainly to our economy so it can continue to grow and create jobs. But when it comes to the debt ceiling or let's put it another way, when the president comes to Congress, asking for the authority to increase the debt burden on our kids and grand kids. You know, I think the American people do expect some additional fiscal reforms to be at that point.</p><p>From my standpoint, what I'd like to do is I'd like to do is I'd like start taking a look at this health care law, taking -- hopefully our Democratic colleagues are listening to the pleas of Americans that are begging for relief that are -- you know, just -- they're unbelieving in terms of how harmful that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: Are you -- wait, are you going to tie the health --</p><p>JOHNSON: How harmful -- that's what I would like to do.</p><p>ROMANS: Are you going to tie reforms to the health care law to raising the debt ceiling?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, that's what I'd like to do. I'm not sure exactly, you know, what type of fiscal reforms, what type of fiscal discipline, what kind of, you know, you have to do something. The American people expect us to do something.</p><p>If we're going to increase the debt burden on our kids and grandkids, we have to do some kind of reforms to make Social Security and Medicare solvent for future generations to stop the bankrupt in this nation.</p><p>ROMANS: So --</p><p>JOHNSON: We have to do something.</p><p>ROMANS: You talk about people crying, you talk about crying for relief from the health care law, but at the same time you have people crying for relief for a little more time on unemployment benefits.</p><p>We'll talk about what the bill -- the budget bill doesn't do. It doesn't extend the federal unemployment benefits. 1.3 million Americans are going to lose those benefits at the end of this month. And when you look at the economic data, as I do, Senator, you can see, for people newly unemployed, things are getting better. Things really are.</p><p>For people who've been out of work six months or longer, it's the same old story. And those jobless benefits go right into the economy. Would you support putting more money into jobless benefits here? If you're talking about crying for relief from health care reform, what about crying for relief for the long-term unemployed?</p><p>JOHNSON: Let's talk about the health care law's effect on unemployment. You know the 29ers. The people who are now being put into part-time status so that their employers don't have to pay that fine. You know, this health care law is doing a great deal of harm to job creation, but anybody that wants to increase or renew unemployment benefits, you've got to first say, well, what is the lower priority spending item that you're going to, you know, take off the table?</p><p>You know what areas of the budget are you going to cut to make room for what you consider higher priority item? So that's the -- that's the first table stakes. Don't come and request some more government spending without showing us how you're going to reduce the deficit in another area.</p><p>ROMANS: Clearly, a lot of prioritizing to go for the next couple of years.</p><p>JOHNSON: Absolutely.</p><p>ROMANS: You know, on this show, sir, we talk about one America but two economies. Anger over income inequality. Anger over a lack of a living wage. It's really on the rise.</p><p>I want you to listen to liberal comedian Bill Maher and then I want to give you a chance to respond.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL MAHER, HOST, \"REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER\": When even working people can't make enough to live, they take money from the government in the form of food stamps, school lunches, housing assistance, daycare. This is the welfare that conservatives hate, but they never stop to think, if we raise the minimum wage and force McDonald's and Wal-Mart to pay their employees enough to eat, we, the taxpayers, wouldn't have to pick up the slack.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: I've got to ask you, does Bill Maher have a point?</p><p>JOHNSON: No, when you raise the minimum wage, you remove those entry level positions, you create more unemployment. And that's not a good thing. What you need to do is you need to actually make the manufacturing base of this country more robust. How do you do that? You make America an attractive place for business investment, business expansion, job creation.</p><p>We have an onerous regulatory environment in this country. Obamacare is part of that. We have uncompetitive tax rates. I mean, if you're a German manufacturer who want to manufacture for the largest economy in the world, are you going to site your plant in Toronto at 15 percent, or Detroit at 35 percent?</p><p>So it's not rocket science in terms of what we have to do to make America an attractive place for job creation. We're just not doing it in this totally dysfunctional place called the federal government.</p><p>ROMANS: Well, at least we have the frameworks of a budget deal for the next couple of years. We'll take that as nice starting point.</p><p>Thank you, sir.</p><p>JOHNSON: That's a small little step. Have a merry Christmas.</p><p>ROMANS: You, too. Thank you so much.</p><p>All right. Coming up, who is your favorite CNN anchor? No, he doesn't work for CNN, but he's probably your favorite, maybe your second favorite anchor of all time. The business of being Will Ferrell, next.</p><p>Plus, winning the lottery without buying a ticket. An incredible moment. So how much money does it take to elicit this reaction?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YOUNG SOO LEE, STORE OWNER: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my -- I never that much money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: This might just be the most valuable mustache around. You might not be aware, but \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues\" is out this weekend. It hasn't been heavily marketed or advertised, so you're excused for not knowing.</p><p>Seriously, the man behind the mustache is everywhere. He's everywhere. Take a look at the business of being a comedy god.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over): Ron Burgundy is back.</p><p>WILL FERRELL, \"RON BURGUNDY\": We haven't seen you in a while, America.</p><p>ROMANS: From your TV cabinet to your liquor cabinet, the business of being Will Ferrell is --</p><p>DAVID KOECHNER, \"CHAMP KID\": It's just refreshing.</p><p>ROMANS: During seven seasons on \"Saturday Night Live,\" he earned laughs. Known for his impressions, from George W. Bush --</p><p>FERRELL: Strategery.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS: To Janet Reno, to Saddam Hussein.</p><p>FERRELL: Monica, you never call me anymore.</p><p>ROMANS: In his last season, he reportedly became the highest paid cast member. His salary: $350,000.</p><p>FERRELL: We're going streaking.</p><p>ROMANS: Before long, he went old school.</p><p>FERRELL: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: The movie was a hit, box office take $87 million worldwide.</p><p>FERRELL: It's so good.</p><p>ROMANS: This funny man became a leading man. There was \"Elf.\"</p><p>FERRELL: Santa. Oh, my gosh.</p><p>ROMANS: \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.\"</p><p>FERRELL: You stay classy, San Diego.</p><p>ROMANS: \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.\" \"Blades of Glory. \"Stepbrothers.\" The animated hit \"Mega Mind.\"</p><p>FERRELL: Incredibly handsome, mater of all villainy.</p><p>ROMANS: And the \"Campaign.\"</p><p>FERRELL: Let me hear a (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ROMANS: They haven't all been hits, and he was once named the most overpaid actor by \"Forbes.\" But tallied all up, movies Will Ferrell has starred in have grossed almost $2 billion.</p><p>FERRELL: Massive amounts of money.</p><p>ROMANS: And that's before \"Anchorman 2.\"</p><p>FERRELL: Why can't the news be fun?</p><p>ROMANS: Ron Burgundy does product placement very well. Dodge commercials featuring the anchorman helped push Durango sales up almost 60 percent in October.</p><p>FERRELL: It makes you feel pretty dumb, doesn't it?</p><p>ROMANS: The fictional character has inspired a line of underwear, scotch, and an ice cream flavor.</p><p>FERRELL: I love scotch. Scotchy, scotch, scotch. ROMANS: And Ferrell can also sell beer. Apparently based on this ad for old Milwaukee that went viral. Ferrell has also taken his talents to Broadway with a one-man show called \"You're Welcome, America: A final Night with George W. Bush.\" He also he co-founded the comedy video Web site, \"Funny or Die.\"</p><p>FERRELL: Don't make fun of me crying.</p><p>ROMANS: Don't worry. The business of being Will Ferrell leaves very little to cry about.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: Wow. And that \"Funny or Die\" Web site is no joke. It gets millions of unique visitors every month. It's got backers in Silicon Valley, lots of advertisers and partnerships with big media companies. Not bad for -- not bad an outlet for all of Will Ferrell's very funny videos. The only coming I know who's got D.C. backing.</p><p>All right. It's not a movie but it's a Hollywood ending. Young Soo Lee owns the Atlantic convenient Store that sold one of two winning Mega Millions tickets for Tuesday's monster jackpot. She figured she'd be paid $25,000 for selling that ticket, but CNN's Martin Savidge delivered her quite a shock.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YOUNG: Long time ago, I heard it's $25,000.</p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: 25,000. Let me just tell you, it's a lot more than $25,000.</p><p>YOUNG: Really?</p><p>SAVIDGE: It is about $1 million that you get.</p><p>YOUNG: I do? Oh, my gosh. Oh, my -- I never have that much money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Good for her. What a stroke of luck.</p><p>Thanks for starting Saturday smart with us.

It's also the NSA, Google, Facebook and credit card hackers.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Christine Romans.  This is YOUR MONEY.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When it comes to tests, your government is either too smart or back in the dark ages.  The rollout of healthcare.gov may have been a fiasco but America's fine capabilities are feared and envied by the rest of the world.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week a federal judge ruled the NSA's bulk collection of phone records is likely unconstitutional.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is the program essentially essential to security or an abuse of power? That's in the eye of the beholder.  Let's look at this from the perspective of the NSA director.  General Keith Alexander says the NSA's intelligence programs have helped prevent 54 terror attacks, 13 of those in the U.S. alone, including a threat to New York City subways.  </p><p>Now put on your Google glasses.  Google along with other major tech companies says the government has overstepped.  A report in the \"Washington Post\" alleged the NSA is tapping into links connected to the company's data centers giving the government access to users information.  The NSA denying those claims.  </p><p>Now tech companies are worried this could damage their businesses.  Of course their research says Cloud computing companies could lose a quarter of their businesses up to $180 billion by 2016 as companies and individuals put their data elsewhere.  </p><p>Tech company leaders have filed lawsuits against the NSA and written open letter calling for reform.  This week, they took their case to the White House.  </p><p>John Avlon is a CNN political analyst and executive director of \"The Daily Beast.\"  Shobhan MacDermott is chief policy officer at AVG Technologies and the author of Wide Open Privacy Strategies for the Digital Life.  </p><p>She says people should be afraid of Google spying on them and not the government, which brings me to the meeting this week from the tech executives and the White House.  You look at that sort of photo-op and I said, they know too much about you.  And who I'm talking about?  I'm talking about the tech companies and the government.  </p><p>Why should we even be so afraid of Google?  </p><p>SHOBHAN MACDERMOTT, CHIEF POLICY OFFICER, AVG TECHNOLOGIES:  Well, I think part of the reason we should be afraid of it is that they see everything, they see everything that you search for.  They see everything that you're looking at and people share a whole bunch of information online.  And they're not necessarily aware of the fact that that information isn't just disappearing after they look for something.  </p><p>ROMANS:  This is the way that Edward Snowden puts it.  Let's listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDWARD SNOWDEN, NSA LEAKER:  You're being watched and recorded.  And the storage capability of the systems increases every year consistently by orders of magnitude to where it is getting to the point you don't have to have done anything wrong.  You simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  Some privacy experts have sort of noted how rich it is really that you've got some of the big tech companies telling the White House they don't like their methods when it -- tech companies know an awful lot about you.  </p><p>MACDERMOTT:  Yes, I mean, that's true.  And if you look at social media networks, they probably know more about you because you're sharing information there that you're not necessarily conscious of all the time.  You're putting pictures of your kids up.  They know where they're going to school.  They know where you live.  They know when you're home, you're checking in on social media sites and saying, I'm either at home or I'm not at home.  You know all of these things open you up to all kinds of privacy issues.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Is this, John -- the revelations about the NSA and the problems with healthcare.gov, they creek this sort of this credibility gap for the president.  A recent ORC poll finds 53 percent of the Americans say the president is not honest or trustworthy.  Double what it was at the end of 2008.  </p><p>Can he regain the public's trust?  </p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  He can.  But you see that downward trend.  And it really is because of that core claim of his re-election campaign, if you like your health care, you can keep it.  And you take the screw-ups of healthcare.gov and then the revelation that that wasn't true.  And that hurts it.  But this president has always gotten high marks on that measure.  </p><p>The larger dynamic actually is a trap that the president is caught in. And it's a trap that Eisenhower began warning about 60 years ago with the military industrial complex.  We have seen the creation of a surveillance state, a national security state that has become unaccountable even to the commander in chief.  And that's one of the fascinating dynamics of our time and could be one of the major challenges of his second term.  </p><p>Can he dial that back?  Can he rein the surveillance state?  Or is the Genie out of the bottle because of both private and companies and their interaction with the government.  </p><p>ROMANS:  So let's go back to the big companies, the big tech companies, Shobhan.  Facebook, Google, they need users.  The public is essentially the product, not the consumer.  Really, right?  I mean, it's our information that they're dealing with.  </p><p>What kind of damage does it risk to these companies' reputation as a result of these I would say growing privacy concerns?  </p><p>MACDERMOTT:  Well, I think in my opinion one of the things that's always difficult to look at is the actual sheer amount of data that's been collected on people.  And the fact that all of this can be taken out of context.  There's no context put around it.  When you look at national surveillance, there's context around it in the fact that you're looking for, you know, a specific threat.  </p><p>ROMANS:  That's a really good point.  </p><p>MACDERMOTT:  As opposed to when somebody is collecting a bunch of data about an individual.  I may be searching, for instance, you know, presenting at a conference on child exploitation, now those are in my Google searches.  Well, somebody takes that out of context and looks at me and says, what kind of person are you?  And do I need to, you know, take a look at me in further detail.  </p><p>Again the issue of context, I think, is really important when it comes to the difference between the government watching what you're doing and the tech companies watching what you're doing.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Yes.  Everyone is watching.  There's so much information, it's insane.  </p><p>AVLON:  There is.  And you've got two motives.  You've got the profit motive, you've got the national security motive.  But I mean, the overall issue is technology outpacing our laws.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Yes.  </p><p>AVLON:  The growth of technology has so outpaced against our laws.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Absolutely.  </p><p>AVLON:  That until that accountability comes in, that gray area will be exploited by people pursuing their own self-interest.  </p><p>ROMANS:  And that's what the -- that's what the tech companies basically said to the president.  They want -- they want the rules of their own.  </p><p>AVLON:  Exactly.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Because we just have an archaic system.  </p><p>Shobhan MacDermott, John Avlon, nice to see both of you, guys.  Thank you.  </p><p>AVLON:  Merry Christmas.  </p><p>MACDERMOTT:  Thank you.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Coming up, even if you're not a Target shopper, even if you're not worried about the 40 million customers who fear their information was stolen, you should be.  Next, we'll show you how easy it is for hackers to get their hands on your credit card number.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PARK, TRUSTWAVE:  If I have access to the entire mag-stripe data that's on this device and I can -- I can get all of this and enough information to actually create a whole different card.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  It's not the news Target was hoping we'd be reporting this holiday season.  If you shopped at Target between November 27th and December 15th, your information may have been stolen.  </p><p>Right in the middle of Black Friday and the holiday shopping craziness, hackers hit those card readers that you use at checkout. So how could this have happened and what information can hackers steal from that little magnetic strip on your credit cards?  </p><p>CNNMoney tech correspondent Laurie Segall is here with some answers.  </p><p>Hi, Laurie.  </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY TECH CORRESPONDENT:  Hey.  Well, as you said, this hack is so widespread.  We wanted to take an inside look and see exactly the information these hackers could get if you were one of those unlucky folks that swiped your card at Target.  Check it out.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL (voice-over):  If you've done some holiday shopping at Target -- you might be wondering what a hacker could learn about you from your credit card.  </p><p>When you swipe, here's what a hacker could learn from the data in that magnetic strip.  Your name, your credit card number, the card's expiration date and the CVV code on the back.  </p><p>JOSE PAGLIERY, CNNMONEY:  All of these key data that can be used to falsify that card and go ahead and fraudulently use it online, they can access that just by taking what's on the strip.  </p><p>SEGALL:  In the case of the Target hack, that data may have been enough for hackers to make a counterfeit card.  One security researcher who showed us the different credit card hack explains.  To the employee, everything looks normal.  </p><p>MIKE PARK, TRUSTWAVE:  I just have to log in.  I could make a selection here.  And then I can do a credit card swipe.  It will ask me for the CVV.  I can put in a CVV.  Whatever numbers I want.  And then click pay.  Right?  Nothing seems untoward.  </p><p>SEGALL:  For the customer, pretty standard.  </p><p>PARK:  You're paid.  You get your receipt.  You move on.  </p><p>SEGALL:  But for the hacker.  </p><p>PARK:  I have access to the entire mag-stripe data that's on this device and I can -- I can get all of this and enough information to actually create a whole different card.  </p><p>SEGALL:  The Target hack has some saying that the U.S. is a little behind the times in terms of secure payments.  </p><p>PAGLIERY:  Well, one secure -- more secure solution that they have in Europe right now is this chip and PIN system in which the card doesn't actually have a strip.  It has a chip within it.  And every time you use it, you also have to use a pin.  </p><p>SEGALL:  According to the Federal Reserve, credit card fraud in England plummeted 34 percent in the six years after English banks and merchants implemented chip and PIN cards.  During a similar period in France, fraud from in-person card fell 35 percent.  But this holiday season, millions of American shoppers might have been the target.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL:  You know, the silver lining is we're having this discussion about what kind of technology can we invest in to ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen again.  But I'll tell you the -- the security researcher we spoke to, now he says, the major retailers are still at risk.  They have faulty software.  </p><p>ROMANS:  And not just when you're a consumer, you're just so bummed that you do everything that the retailer wants you to do.  You're going out there and spend.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Right.  </p><p>ROMANS:  I mean, that's what their advertising machine is trying to get you to do.  And then they can't keep a hold of your data.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Yes.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Frustrating.  </p><p>Laurie Segall, nice to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>For more stories that matter to YOUR MONEY, give me 60 seconds on the clock.  It's \"Money Time.\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS:  Drug giant GlaxoSmithKline will no longer pay drug reps based on their sales numbers.  It'll also stop paying doctors marking a big change in how the pharma company pushes its products.  </p><p>Vitamins are a waste of money.  Strong words from researchers studying long-term benefits in taking multivitamins.  The vitamin industry rakes in nearly $12 billion every year.  </p><p>Revenge of the nerds?  Or not so much.

I'm going to go one-on-one with the Republican senator who says if Democrats want to talk debt ceiling, they better be prepared to bargain over Obamacare.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  Fact.  The economy is getting better in this country.  Stock market records, a housing recovery for those with cash and credit. Soaring corporate earnings.  The U.S. economy grew more than 4 percent in the third quarter.  More than 4 percent.  This recovery is benefitting the top 1 percent of households.  In the past three years, they've taken home 95 percent of the income gains.  </p><p>What does that say about where the country is headed?  </p><p>Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, joins me now.  </p><p>Senator, welcome back to the show.  So nice to see you.  Let me start with this economy.  It's taking flight.  No one -- no one wants to see the government ground the plane, but here comes Groundhog Day. Republicans say they want concessions in exchange for raising the debt ceiling early next year.  </p><p>The White House says it won't negotiate and the Treasury secretary Jack Lew can't, quote, \"foresee any reasonable scenario\" in which the government can keep paying all the bills past March.  </p><p>Senator, how does this end?   SEN. RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN:  Well, hello, Christine.  First of all, let's talk about what we just did.  We have, I believe, avoided government shutdowns at least through fiscal year 2015.  And that's a good thing.  You know, try and bring some certainty to our economy. Try and give some of these agencies and departments and committees in Congress the opportunity to rationally prioritize spending.  </p><p>So we have to return some certainly to our economy so it can continue to grow and create jobs.  But when it comes to the debt ceiling or let's put it another way, when the president comes to Congress, asking for the authority to increase the debt burden on our kids and grand kids.  You know, I think the American people do expect some additional fiscal reforms to be at that point.  </p><p>From my standpoint, what I'd like to do is I'd like to do is I'd like start taking a look at this health care law, taking -- hopefully our Democratic colleagues are listening to the pleas of Americans that are begging for relief that are -- you know, just -- they're unbelieving in terms of how harmful that --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS:  Are you -- wait, are you going to tie the health --  </p><p>JOHNSON:  How harmful -- that's what I would like to do.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Are you going to tie reforms to the health care law to raising the debt ceiling?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, that's what I'd like to do.  I'm not sure exactly, you know, what type of fiscal reforms, what type of fiscal discipline, what kind of, you know, you have to do something.  The American people expect us to do something.  </p><p>If we're going to increase the debt burden on our kids and grandkids, we have to do some kind of reforms to make Social Security and Medicare solvent for future generations to stop the bankrupt in this nation.  </p><p>ROMANS:  So --  </p><p>JOHNSON:  We have to do something. </p><p>ROMANS:  You talk about people crying, you talk about crying for relief from the health care law, but at the same time you have people crying for relief for a little more time on unemployment benefits.  </p><p>We'll talk about what the bill -- the budget bill doesn't do.  It doesn't extend the federal unemployment benefits.  1.3 million Americans are going to lose those benefits at the end of this month. And when you look at the economic data, as I do, Senator, you can see, for people newly unemployed, things are getting better.  Things really are.  </p><p>For people who've been out of work six months or longer, it's the same old story.  And those jobless benefits go right into the economy. Would you support putting more money into jobless benefits here?  If you're talking about crying for relief from health care reform, what about crying for relief for the long-term unemployed?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Let's talk about the health care law's effect on unemployment.  You know the 29ers.  The people who are now being put into part-time status so that their employers don't have to pay that fine.  You know, this health care law is doing a great deal of harm to job creation, but anybody that wants to increase or renew unemployment benefits, you've got to first say, well, what is the lower priority spending item that you're going to, you know, take off the table?  </p><p>You know what areas of the budget are you going to cut to make room for what you consider higher priority item?  So that's the -- that's the first table stakes.  Don't come and request some more government spending without showing us how you're going to reduce the deficit in another area.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Clearly, a lot of prioritizing to go for the next couple of years.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Absolutely.  </p><p>ROMANS:  You know, on this show, sir, we talk about one America but two economies.  Anger over income inequality.  Anger over a lack of a living wage.  It's really on the rise.  </p><p>I want you to listen to liberal comedian Bill Maher and then I want to give you a chance to respond.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL MAHER, HOST, \"REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER\":  When even working people can't make enough to live, they take money from the government in the form of food stamps, school lunches, housing assistance, daycare.  This is the welfare that conservatives hate, but they never stop to think, if we raise the minimum wage and force McDonald's and Wal-Mart to pay their employees enough to eat, we, the taxpayers, wouldn't have to pick up the slack.  </p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  I've got to ask you, does Bill Maher have a point?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  No, when you raise the minimum wage, you remove those entry level positions, you create more unemployment.  And that's not a good thing.  What you need to do is you need to actually make the manufacturing base of this country more robust.  How do you do that? You make America an attractive place for business investment, business expansion, job creation.  </p><p>We have an onerous regulatory environment in this country.  Obamacare is part of that.  We have uncompetitive tax rates.  I mean, if you're a German manufacturer who want to manufacture for the largest economy in the world, are you going to site your plant in Toronto at 15 percent, or Detroit at 35 percent?  </p><p>So it's not rocket science in terms of what we have to do to make America an attractive place for job creation.  We're just not doing it in this totally dysfunctional place called the federal government.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Well, at least we have the frameworks of a budget deal for the next couple of years.  We'll take that as nice starting point.  </p><p>Thank you, sir.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  That's a small little step.  Have a merry Christmas.  </p><p>ROMANS:  You, too.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>All right.  Coming up, who is your favorite CNN anchor?  No, he doesn't work for CNN, but he's probably your favorite, maybe your second favorite anchor of all time.  The business of being Will Ferrell, next.  </p><p>Plus, winning the lottery without buying a ticket.  An incredible moment.  So how much money does it take to elicit this reaction?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YOUNG SOO LEE, STORE OWNER:  Oh, my gosh. Oh, my -- I never that much money.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  This might just be the most valuable mustache around.  You might not be aware, but \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues\" is out this weekend.  It hasn't been heavily marketed or advertised, so you're excused for not knowing.  </p><p>Seriously, the man behind the mustache is everywhere.  He's everywhere.  Take a look at the business of being a comedy god.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over):  Ron Burgundy is back.  </p><p>WILL FERRELL, \"RON BURGUNDY\":  We haven't seen you in a while, America.  </p><p>ROMANS:  From your TV cabinet to your liquor cabinet, the business of being Will Ferrell is --  </p><p>DAVID KOECHNER, \"CHAMP KID\":  It's just refreshing.  </p><p>ROMANS:  During seven seasons on \"Saturday Night Live,\" he earned laughs.  Known for his impressions, from George W.

His salary: $350,000.  </p><p>FERRELL:  We're going streaking.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Before long, he went old school.  </p><p>FERRELL:  Yes.  </p><p>ROMANS:  The movie was a hit, box office take $87 million worldwide.  </p><p>FERRELL:  It's so good.  </p><p>ROMANS:  This funny man became a leading man.  There was \"Elf.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  Santa.  Oh, my gosh.  </p><p>ROMANS:  \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  You stay classy, San Diego.  </p><p>ROMANS:  \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.\"  \"Blades of Glory.  \"Stepbrothers.\"  The animated hit \"Mega Mind.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  Incredibly handsome, mater of all villainy.  </p><p>ROMANS:  And the \"Campaign.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  Let me hear a (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>ROMANS:  They haven't all been hits, and he was once named the most overpaid actor by \"Forbes.\"  But tallied all up, movies Will Ferrell has starred in have grossed almost $2 billion.  </p><p>FERRELL:  Massive amounts of money.  </p><p>ROMANS:  And that's before \"Anchorman 2.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  Why can't the news be fun?  </p><p>ROMANS:  Ron Burgundy does product placement very well.  Dodge commercials featuring the anchorman helped push Durango sales up almost 60 percent in October.  </p><p>FERRELL:  It makes you feel pretty dumb, doesn't it?  </p><p>ROMANS:  The fictional character has inspired a line of underwear, scotch, and an ice cream flavor.  </p><p>FERRELL:  I love scotch.  Scotchy, scotch, scotch.   ROMANS:  And Ferrell can also sell beer.  Apparently based on this ad for old Milwaukee that went viral.  Ferrell has also taken his talents to Broadway with a one-man show called \"You're Welcome, America: A final Night with George W. Bush.\"  He also he co-founded the comedy video Web site, \"Funny or Die.\"  </p><p>FERRELL:  Don't make fun of me crying.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Don't worry.  The business of being Will Ferrell leaves very little to cry about.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS:  Wow.  And that \"Funny or Die\" Web site is no joke.  It gets millions of unique visitors every month.  It's got backers in Silicon Valley, lots of advertisers and partnerships with big media companies. Not bad for -- not bad an outlet for all of Will Ferrell's very funny videos.  The only coming I know who's got D.C. backing.  </p><p>All right.  It's not a movie but it's a Hollywood ending.  Young Soo Lee owns the Atlantic convenient Store that sold one of two winning Mega Millions tickets for Tuesday's monster jackpot.  She figured she'd be paid $25,000 for selling that ticket, but CNN's Martin Savidge delivered her quite a shock.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YOUNG:  Long time ago, I heard it's $25,000.  </p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  25,000.  Let me just tell you, it's a lot more than $25,000.  </p><p>YOUNG:  Really?  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  It is about $1 million that you get.  </p><p>YOUNG:  I do?  Oh, my gosh.

It's also the <person><nameText>NSA, </nameText></person>Google, Facebook and credit card hackers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Christine Romans. This is YOUR MONEY.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When it comes to tests, your government is either too smart or back in the dark ages. The rollout of healthcare.gov may have been a fiasco but America's fine capabilities are feared and envied by the rest of the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week a federal judge ruled the <person><nameText>NSA's </nameText></person>bulk collection of phone records is likely unconstitutional.</p><p/><p>Is the program essentially essential to security or an abuse of power? That's in the eye of the beholder. Let's look at this from the perspective of the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>director. General Keith Alexander says the <person><nameText>NSA's </nameText></person>intelligence programs have helped prevent 54 terror attacks, 13 of those in the U.S. alone, including a threat to New York City subways.</p><p/><p>Now put on your Google glasses. Google along with other major tech companies says the government has overstepped. A report in the \"Washington Post\" alleged the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>is tapping into links connected to the company's data centers giving the government access to users information. The <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>denying those claims.</p><p/><p>Now tech companies are worried this could damage their businesses. Of course their research says Cloud computing companies could lose a quarter of their businesses up to $180 billion by 2016 as companies and individuals put their data elsewhere.</p><p/><p>Tech company leaders have filed lawsuits against the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>and written open letter calling for reform. This week, they took their case to the White House.</p><p/><p>John Avlon is a CNN political analyst and executive director of \"The Daily Beast.\" Shobhan MacDermott is chief policy officer at AVG Technologies and the author of Wide Open Privacy Strategies for the Digital Life.</p><p/><p>She says people should be afraid of Google spying on them and not the government, which brings me to the meeting this week from the tech executives and the White House. You look at that sort of photo-op and I said, they know too much about you. And who I'm talking about? I'm talking about the tech companies and the government.</p><p/><p>Why should we even be so afraid of Google?</p><p/><p>SHOBHAN MACDERMOTT, CHIEF POLICY OFFICER, AVG TECHNOLOGIES: Well, I think part of the reason we should be afraid of it is that they see everything, they see everything that you search for. They see everything that you're looking at and people share a whole bunch of information online. And they're not necessarily aware of the fact that that information isn't just disappearing after they look for something.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: This is the way that <person><nameText>Edward Snowden </nameText></person>puts it. Let's listen to this.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>EDWARD SNOWDEN, </nameText></person><person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>LEAKER: You're being watched and recorded. And the storage capability of the systems increases every year consistently by orders of magnitude to where it is getting to the point you don't have to have done anything wrong. You simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Some privacy experts have sort of noted how rich it is really that you've got some of the big tech companies telling the White House they don't like their methods when it -- tech companies know an awful lot about you.</p><p/><p>MACDERMOTT: Yes, I mean, that's true. And if you look at social media networks, they probably know more about you because you're sharing information there that you're not necessarily conscious of all the time. You're putting pictures of your kids up. They know where they're going to school. They know where you live. They know when you're home, you're checking in on social media sites and saying, I'm either at home or I'm not at home. You know all of these things open you up to all kinds of privacy issues.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Is this, John -- the revelations about the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>and the problems with healthcare.gov, they creek this sort of this credibility gap for the president. A recent ORC poll finds 53 percent of the Americans say the president is not honest or trustworthy. Double what it was at the end of 2008.</p><p/><p>Can he regain the public's trust?</p><p/><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: He can. But you see that downward trend. And it really is because of that core claim of his re-election campaign, if you like your health care, you can keep it. And you take the screw-ups of healthcare.gov and then the revelation that that wasn't true. And that hurts it. But this president has always gotten high marks on that measure.</p><p/><p>The larger dynamic actually is a trap that the president is caught in. And it's a trap that Eisenhower began warning about 60 years ago with the military industrial complex. We have seen the creation of a surveillance state, a national security state that has become unaccountable even to the commander in chief. And that's one of the fascinating dynamics of our time and could be one of the major challenges of his second term.</p><p/><p>Can he dial that back? Can he rein the surveillance state? Or is the Genie out of the bottle because of both private and companies and their interaction with the government.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: So let's go back to the big companies, the big tech companies, Shobhan. Facebook, Google, they need users. The public is essentially the product, not the consumer. Really, right? I mean, it's our information that they're dealing with.</p><p/><p>What kind of damage does it risk to these companies' reputation as a result of these I would say growing privacy concerns?</p><p/><p>MACDERMOTT: Well, I think in my opinion one of the things that's always difficult to look at is the actual sheer amount of data that's been collected on people. And the fact that all of this can be taken out of context. There's no context put around it. When you look at national surveillance, there's context around it in the fact that you're looking for, you know, a specific threat.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: That's a really good point.</p><p/><p>MACDERMOTT: As opposed to when somebody is collecting a bunch of data about an individual. I may be searching, for instance, you know, presenting at a conference on child exploitation, now those are in my Google searches. Well, somebody takes that out of context and looks at me and says, what kind of person are you? And do I need to, you know, take a look at me in further detail.</p><p/><p>Again the issue of context, I think, is really important when it comes to the difference between the government watching what you're doing and the tech companies watching what you're doing.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Yes. Everyone is watching. There's so much information, it's insane.</p><p/><p>AVLON: There is. And you've got two motives. You've got the profit motive, you've got the national security motive. But I mean, the overall issue is technology outpacing our laws.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p/><p>AVLON: The growth of technology has so outpaced against our laws.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>AVLON: That until that accountability comes in, that gray area will be exploited by people pursuing their own self-interest.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: And that's what the -- that's what the tech companies basically said to the president. They want -- they want the rules of their own.</p><p/><p>AVLON: Exactly.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Because we just have an archaic system.</p><p/><p>Shobhan MacDermott, John Avlon, nice to see both of you, guys. Thank you.</p><p/><p>AVLON: Merry Christmas.</p><p/><p>MACDERMOTT: Thank you.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Coming up, even if you're not a Target shopper, even if you're not worried about the 40 million customers who fear their information was stolen, you should be. Next, we'll show you how easy it is for hackers to get their hands on your credit card number.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MIKE PARK, TRUSTWAVE: If I have access to the entire mag-stripe data that's on this device and I can -- I can get all of this and enough information to actually create a whole different card.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>ROMANS: It's not the news Target was hoping we'd be reporting this holiday season. If you shopped at Target between November 27th and December 15th, your information may have been stolen.</p><p/><p>Right in the middle of Black Friday and the holiday shopping craziness, hackers hit those card readers that you use at checkout. So how could this have happened and what information can hackers steal from that little magnetic strip on your credit cards?</p><p/><p>CNNMoney tech correspondent Laurie Segall is here with some answers.</p><p/><p>Hi, Laurie.</p><p/><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY TECH CORRESPONDENT: Hey. Well, as you said, this hack is so widespread. We wanted to take an inside look and see exactly the information these hackers could get if you were one of those unlucky folks that swiped your card at Target. Check it out.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SEGALL (voice-over): If you've done some holiday shopping at Target -- you might be wondering what a hacker could learn about you from your credit card.</p><p/><p>When you swipe, here's what a hacker could learn from the data in that magnetic strip. Your name, your credit card number, the card's expiration date and the CVV code on the back.</p><p/><p>JOSE PAGLIERY, CNNMONEY: All of these key data that can be used to falsify that card and go ahead and fraudulently use it online, they can access that just by taking what's on the strip.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: In the case of the Target hack, that data may have been enough for hackers to make a counterfeit card. One security researcher who showed us the different credit card hack explains. To the employee, everything looks normal.</p><p/><p>MIKE PARK, TRUSTWAVE: I just have to log in. I could make a selection here. And then I can do a credit card swipe. It will ask me for the CVV. I can put in a CVV. Whatever numbers I want. And then click pay. Right? Nothing seems untoward.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: For the customer, pretty standard.</p><p/><p>PARK: You're paid. You get your receipt. You move on.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: But for the hacker.</p><p/><p>PARK: I have access to the entire mag-stripe data that's on this device and I can -- I can get all of this and enough information to actually create a whole different card.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: The Target hack has some saying that the U.S. is a little behind the times in terms of secure payments.</p><p/><p>PAGLIERY: Well, one secure -- more secure solution that they have in Europe right now is this chip and PIN system in which the card doesn't actually have a strip. It has a chip within it. And every time you use it, you also have to use a pin.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: According to the Federal Reserve, credit card fraud in England plummeted 34 percent in the six years after English banks and merchants implemented chip and PIN cards. During a similar period in France, fraud from in-person card fell 35 percent. But this holiday season, millions of American shoppers might have been the target.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SEGALL: You know, the silver lining is we're having this discussion about what kind of technology can we invest in to ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen again. But I'll tell you the -- the security researcher we spoke to, now he says, the major retailers are still at risk. They have faulty software.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: And not just when you're a consumer, you're just so bummed that you do everything that the retailer wants you to do. You're going out there and spend.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: Right.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: I mean, that's what their advertising machine is trying to get you to do. And then they can't keep a hold of your data.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: Yes.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Frustrating.</p><p/><p>Laurie Segall, nice to see you. Thank you.</p><p/><p>For more stories that matter to YOUR MONEY, give me 60 seconds on the clock. It's \"Money Time.\"</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Drug giant GlaxoSmithKline will no longer pay drug reps based on their sales numbers. It'll also stop paying doctors marking a big change in how the pharma company pushes its products.</p><p/><p>Vitamins are a waste of money. Strong words from researchers studying long-term benefits in taking multivitamins. The vitamin industry rakes in nearly $12 billion every year.</p><p/><p>Revenge of the nerds? Or not so much. A new study finds people who were attractive in high school end up making more money later. An 8 percent bump for good-looking women and 4 percent more for men.</p><p/><p>Target is shunning Queen B. The retailer will not sell Beyonce's album. It was available digitally first. Target says that hurt sales.</p><p/><p>Can you smell what the Rock is cooking? \"Forbes\" named Dwayne Johnson this year's top grossing actor. His movies including \"Fast and Furious 6\" and \"G.I. Joe\" brought in $1.3 billion at the global box office.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Coming up, this economy is taking flight, but could Groundhog Day in Washington crush the recovery? I'm going to go one-on-one with the Republican senator who says if Democrats want to talk debt ceiling, they better be prepared to bargain over Obamacare.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Fact. The economy is getting better in this country. Stock market records, a housing recovery for those with cash and credit. Soaring corporate earnings. The U.S. economy grew more than 4 percent in the third quarter. More than 4 percent. This recovery is benefitting the top 1 percent of households. In the past three years, they've taken home 95 percent of the income gains.</p><p/><p>What does that say about where the country is headed?</p><p/><p>Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, joins me now.</p><p/><p>Senator, welcome back to the show. So nice to see you. Let me start with this economy. It's taking flight. No one -- no one wants to see the government ground the plane, but here comes Groundhog Day. Republicans say they want concessions in exchange for raising the debt ceiling early next year.</p><p/><p>The White House says it won't negotiate and the Treasury secretary Jack Lew can't, quote, \"foresee any reasonable scenario\" in which the government can keep paying all the bills past March.</p><p/><p>Senator, how does this end? SEN. RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN: Well, hello, Christine. First of all, let's talk about what we just did. We have, I believe, avoided government shutdowns at least through fiscal year 2015. And that's a good thing. You know, try and bring some certainty to our economy. Try and give some of these agencies and departments and committees in Congress the opportunity to rationally prioritize spending.</p><p/><p>So we have to return some certainly to our economy so it can continue to grow and create jobs. But when it comes to the debt ceiling or let's put it another way, when the president comes to Congress, asking for the authority to increase the debt burden on our kids and grand kids. You know, I think the American people do expect some additional fiscal reforms to be at that point.</p><p/><p>From my standpoint, what I'd like to do is I'd like to do is I'd like start taking a look at this health care law, taking -- hopefully our Democratic colleagues are listening to the pleas of Americans that are begging for relief that are -- you know, just -- they're unbelieving in terms of how harmful that --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Are you -- wait, are you going to tie the health --</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: How harmful -- that's what I would like to do.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Are you going to tie reforms to the health care law to raising the debt ceiling?</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Well, that's what I'd like to do. I'm not sure exactly, you know, what type of fiscal reforms, what type of fiscal discipline, what kind of, you know, you have to do something. The American people expect us to do something.</p><p/><p>If we're going to increase the debt burden on our kids and grandkids, we have to do some kind of reforms to make Social Security and Medicare solvent for future generations to stop the bankrupt in this nation.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: So --</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: We have to do something.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: You talk about people crying, you talk about crying for relief from the health care law, but at the same time you have people crying for relief for a little more time on unemployment benefits.</p><p/><p>We'll talk about what the bill -- the budget bill doesn't do. It doesn't extend the federal unemployment benefits. 1.3 million Americans are going to lose those benefits at the end of this month. And when you look at the economic data, as I do, Senator, you can see, for people newly unemployed, things are getting better. Things really are.</p><p/><p>For people who've been out of work six months or longer, it's the same old story. And those jobless benefits go right into the economy. Would you support putting more money into jobless benefits here? If you're talking about crying for relief from health care reform, what about crying for relief for the long-term unemployed?</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Let's talk about the health care law's effect on unemployment. You know the 29ers. The people who are now being put into part-time status so that their employers don't have to pay that fine. You know, this health care law is doing a great deal of harm to job creation, but anybody that wants to increase or renew unemployment benefits, you've got to first say, well, what is the lower priority spending item that you're going to, you know, take off the table?</p><p/><p>You know what areas of the budget are you going to cut to make room for what you consider higher priority item? So that's the -- that's the first table stakes. Don't come and request some more government spending without showing us how you're going to reduce the deficit in another area.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Clearly, a lot of prioritizing to go for the next couple of years.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: You know, on this show, sir, we talk about one America but two economies. Anger over income inequality. Anger over a lack of a living wage. It's really on the rise.</p><p/><p>I want you to listen to liberal comedian Bill Maher and then I want to give you a chance to respond.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BILL MAHER, HOST, \"REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER\": When even working people can't make enough to live, they take money from the government in the form of food stamps, school lunches, housing assistance, daycare. This is the welfare that conservatives hate, but they never stop to think, if we raise the minimum wage and force McDonald's and Wal-Mart to pay their employees enough to eat, we, the taxpayers, wouldn't have to pick up the slack.</p><p/><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>ROMANS: I've got to ask you, does Bill Maher have a point?</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: No, when you raise the minimum wage, you remove those entry level positions, you create more unemployment. And that's not a good thing. What you need to do is you need to actually make the manufacturing base of this country more robust. How do you do that? You make America an attractive place for business investment, business expansion, job creation.</p><p/><p>We have an onerous regulatory environment in this country. Obamacare is part of that. We have uncompetitive tax rates. I mean, if you're a German manufacturer who want to manufacture for the largest economy in the world, are you going to site your plant in Toronto at 15 percent, or Detroit at 35 percent?</p><p/><p>So it's not rocket science in terms of what we have to do to make America an attractive place for job creation. We're just not doing it in this totally dysfunctional place called the federal government.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Well, at least we have the frameworks of a budget deal for the next couple of years. We'll take that as nice starting point.</p><p/><p>Thank you, sir.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: That's a small little step. Have a merry Christmas.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: You, too. Thank you so much.</p><p/><p>All right. Coming up, who is your favorite CNN anchor? No, he doesn't work for CNN, but he's probably your favorite, maybe your second favorite anchor of all time. The business of being Will Ferrell, next.</p><p/><p>Plus, winning the lottery without buying a ticket. An incredible moment. So how much money does it take to elicit this reaction?</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>YOUNG SOO LEE, STORE OWNER: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my -- I never that much money.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>ROMANS: This might just be the most valuable mustache around. You might not be aware, but \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues\" is out this weekend. It hasn't been heavily marketed or advertised, so you're excused for not knowing.</p><p/><p>Seriously, the man behind the mustache is everywhere. He's everywhere.

Dodge commercials featuring the anchorman helped push Durango sales up almost 60 percent in October.</p><p/><p>FERRELL: It makes you feel pretty dumb, doesn't it?</p><p/><p>ROMANS: The fictional character has inspired a line of underwear, scotch, and an ice cream flavor.</p><p/><p>FERRELL: I love scotch. Scotchy, scotch, scotch. ROMANS: And Ferrell can also sell beer. Apparently based on this ad for old Milwaukee that went viral. Ferrell has also taken his talents to Broadway with a one-man show called \"You're Welcome, America: A final Night with George W.

It's also the <person><nameText>NSA, </nameText></person>Google, Facebook and credit card hackers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Christine Romans. This is YOUR MONEY.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When it comes to tests, your government is either too smart or back in the dark ages. The rollout of healthcare.gov may have been a fiasco but America's fine capabilities are feared and envied by the rest of the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week a federal judge ruled the <person><nameText>NSA's </nameText></person>bulk collection of phone records is likely unconstitutional.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is the program essentially essential to security or an abuse of power? That's in the eye of the beholder. Let's look at this from the perspective of the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>director. General Keith Alexander says the <person><nameText>NSA's </nameText></person>intelligence programs have helped prevent 54 terror attacks, 13 of those in the U.S. alone, including a threat to New York City subways.</p><p>Now put on your Googleglasses. Googlealong with other major tech companies says the government has overstepped. A report in the \"Washington Post\" alleged the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>is tapping into links connected to the company's data centers giving the government access to users information. The <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>denying those claims.</p><p>Now tech companies are worried this could damage their businesses. Of course their research says Cloud computing companies could lose a quarter of their businesses up to $180 billion by 2016 as companies and individuals put their data elsewhere.</p><p>Tech company leaders have filed lawsuits against the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>and written open letter calling for reform. This week, they took their case to the White House.</p><p>John Avlon is a CNN political analyst and executive director of \"The Daily Beast.\" Shobhan MacDermott is chief policy officer at AVG Technologies and the author of Wide Open Privacy Strategies for the Digital Life.</p><p>She says people should be afraid of Googlespying on them and not the government, which brings me to the meeting this week from the tech executives and the White House. You look at that sort of photo-op and I said, they know too much about you. And who I'm talking about? I'm talking about the tech companies and the government.</p><p>Why should we even be so afraid of Google?</p><p>SHOBHAN MACDERMOTT, CHIEF POLICY OFFICER, AVG TECHNOLOGIES: Well, I think part of the reason we should be afraid of it is that they see everything, they see everything that you search for. They see everything that you're looking at and people share a whole bunch of information online. And they're not necessarily aware of the fact that that information isn't just disappearing after they look for something.</p><p>ROMANS: This is the way that <person><nameText>Edward Snowden </nameText></person>puts it. Let's listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD SNOWDEN, </nameText></person><person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>LEAKER: You're being watched and recorded. And the storage capability of the systems increases every year consistently by orders of magnitude to where it is getting to the point you don't have to have done anything wrong. You simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Some privacy experts have sort of noted how rich it is really that you've got some of the big tech companies telling the White House they don't like their methods when it -- tech companies know an awful lot about you.</p><p>MACDERMOTT: Yes, I mean, that's true. And if you look at social media networks, they probably know more about you because you're sharing information there that you're not necessarily conscious of all the time. You're putting pictures of your kids up. They know where they're going to school. They know where you live. They know when you're home, you're checking in on social media sites and saying, I'm either at home or I'm not at home. You know all of these things open you up to all kinds of privacy issues.</p><p>ROMANS: Is this, John -- the revelations about the <person><nameText>NSA </nameText></person>and the problems with healthcare.gov, they creek this sort of this credibility gap for the president. A recent ORC poll finds 53 percent of the Americans say the president is not honest or trustworthy. Double what it was at the end of 2008.</p><p>Can he regain the public's trust?</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: He can. But you see that downward trend. And it really is because of that core claim of his re-election campaign, if you like your health care, you can keep it. And you take the screw-ups of healthcare.gov and then the revelation that that wasn't true. And that hurts it. But this president has always gotten high marks on that measure.</p><p>The larger dynamic actually is a trap that the president is caught in. And it's a trap that Eisenhower began warning about 60 years ago with the military industrial complex. We have seen the creation of a surveillance state, a national security state that has become unaccountable even to the commander in chief. And that's one of the fascinating dynamics of our time and could be one of the major challenges of his second term.</p><p>Can he dial that back? Can he rein the surveillance state? Or is the Genie out of the bottle because of both private and companies and their interaction with the government.</p><p>ROMANS: So let's go back to the big companies, the big tech companies, Shobhan. Facebook, Google, they need users. The public is essentially the product, not the consumer. Really, right? I mean, it's our information that they're dealing with.</p><p>What kind of damage does it risk to these companies' reputation as a result of these I would say growing privacy concerns?</p><p>MACDERMOTT: Well, I think in my opinion one of the things that's always difficult to look at is the actual sheer amount of data that's been collected on people. And the fact that all of this can be taken out of context. There's no context put around it. When you look at national surveillance, there's context around it in the fact that you're looking for, you know, a specific threat.</p><p>ROMANS: That's a really good point.</p><p>MACDERMOTT: As opposed to when somebody is collecting a bunch of data about an individual. I may be searching, for instance, you know, presenting at a conference on child exploitation, now those are in my Googlesearches. Well, somebody takes that out of context and looks at me and says, what kind of person are you? And do I need to, you know, take a look at me in further detail.</p><p>Again the issue of context, I think, is really important when it comes to the difference between the government watching what you're doing and the tech companies watching what you're doing.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes. Everyone is watching. There's so much information, it's insane.</p><p>AVLON: There is. And you've got two motives. You've got the profit motive, you've got the national security motive. But I mean, the overall issue is technology outpacing our laws.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>AVLON: The growth of technology has so outpaced against our laws.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely.</p><p>AVLON: That until that accountability comes in, that gray area will be exploited by people pursuing their own self-interest.</p><p>ROMANS: And that's what the -- that's what the tech companies basically said to the president. They want -- they want the rules of their own.</p><p>AVLON: Exactly.</p><p>ROMANS: Because we just have an archaic system.</p><p>Shobhan MacDermott, John Avlon, nice to see both of you, guys. Thank you.</p><p>AVLON: Merry Christmas.</p><p>MACDERMOTT: Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: Coming up, even if you're not a Target shopper, even if you're not worried about the 40 million customers who fear their information was stolen, you should be. Next, we'll show you how easy it is for hackers to get their hands on your credit card number.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PARK, TRUSTWAVE: If I have access to the entire mag-stripe data that's on this device and I can -- I can get all of this and enough information to actually create a whole different card.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: It's not the news Target was hoping we'd be reporting this holiday season. If you shopped at Target between November 27th and December 15th, your information may have been stolen.</p><p>Right in the middle of Black Friday and the holiday shopping craziness, hackers hit those card readers that you use at checkout. So how could this have happened and what information can hackers steal from that little magnetic strip on your credit cards?</p><p>CNNMoney tech correspondent Laurie Segall is here with some answers.</p><p>Hi, Laurie.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY TECH CORRESPONDENT: Hey. Well, as you said, this hack is so widespread. We wanted to take an inside look and see exactly the information these hackers could get if you were one of those unlucky folks that swiped your card at Target. Check it out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL (voice-over): If you've done some holiday shopping at Target -- you might be wondering what a hacker could learn about you from your credit card.</p><p>When you swipe, here's what a hacker could learn from the data in that magnetic strip. Your name, your credit card number, the card's expiration date and the CVV code on the back.</p><p>JOSE PAGLIERY, CNNMONEY: All of these key data that can be used to falsify that card and go ahead and fraudulently use it online, they can access that just by taking what's on the strip.</p><p>SEGALL: In the case of the Target hack, that data may have been enough for hackers to make a counterfeit card. One security researcher who showed us the different credit card hack explains. To the employee, everything looks normal.</p><p>MIKE PARK, TRUSTWAVE: I just have to log in. I could make a selection here. And then I can do a credit card swipe. It will ask me for the CVV. I can put in a CVV. Whatever numbers I want. And then click pay. Right? Nothing seems untoward.</p><p>SEGALL: For the customer, pretty standard.</p><p>PARK: You're paid. You get your receipt. You move on.</p><p>SEGALL: But for the hacker.</p><p>PARK: I have access to the entire mag-stripe data that's on this device and I can -- I can get all of this and enough information to actually create a whole different card.</p><p>SEGALL: The Target hack has some saying that the U.S. is a little behind the times in terms of secure payments.</p><p>PAGLIERY: Well, one secure -- more secure solution that they have in Europe right now is this chip and PIN system in which the card doesn't actually have a strip. It has a chip within it. And every time you use it, you also have to use a pin.</p><p>SEGALL: According to the Federal Reserve, credit card fraud in England plummeted 34 percent in the six years after English banks and merchants implemented chip and PIN cards. During a similar period in France, fraud from in-person card fell 35 percent. But this holiday season, millions of American shoppers might have been the target.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL: You know, the silver lining is we're having this discussion about what kind of technology can we invest in to ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen again. But I'll tell you the -- the security researcher we spoke to, now he says, the major retailers are still at risk. They have faulty software.</p><p>ROMANS: And not just when you're a consumer, you're just so bummed that you do everything that the retailer wants you to do. You're going out there and spend.</p><p>SEGALL: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: I mean, that's what their advertising machine is trying to get you to do. And then they can't keep a hold of your data.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Frustrating.</p><p>Laurie Segall, nice to see you. Thank you.</p><p>For more stories that matter to YOUR MONEY, give me 60 seconds on the clock.

I'm going to go one-on-one with the Republican senator who says if Democrats want to talk debt ceiling, they better be prepared to bargain over Obamacare.</p><p>ROMANS: Fact. The economy is getting better in this country. Stock market records, a housing recovery for those with cash and credit. Soaring corporate earnings. The U.S. economy grew more than 4 percent in the third quarter. More than 4 percent. This recovery is benefitting the top 1 percent of households. In the past three years, they've taken home 95 percent of the income gains.</p><p>What does that say about where the country is headed?</p><p><person><nameText>Senator Ron Johnson, </nameText></person>Republican of Wisconsin, joins me now.</p><p>Senator, welcome back to the show. So nice to see you. Let me start with this economy. It's taking flight. No one -- no one wants to see the government ground the plane, but here comes Groundhog Day. Republicans say they want concessions in exchange for raising the debt ceiling early next year.</p><p>The White House says it won't negotiate and the Treasury secretary Jack Lew can't, quote, \"foresee any reasonable scenario\" in which the government can keep paying all the bills past March.</p><p>Senator, how does this end? SEN. <person><nameText>RON JOHNSON </nameText></person>(R), WISCONSIN: Well, hello, Christine. First of all, let's talk about what we just did. We have, I believe, avoided government shutdowns at least through fiscal year 2015. And that's a good thing. You know, try and bring some certainty to our economy. Try and give some of these agencies and departments and committees in Congress the opportunity to rationally prioritize spending.</p><p>So we have to return some certainly to our economy so it can continue to grow and create jobs. But when it comes to the debt ceiling or let's put it another way, when the president comes to Congress, asking for the authority to increase the debt burden on our kids and grand kids. You know, I think the American people do expect some additional fiscal reforms to be at that point.</p><p>From my standpoint, what I'd like to do is I'd like to do is I'd like start taking a look at this health care law, taking -- hopefully our Democratic colleagues are listening to the pleas of Americans that are begging for relief that are -- you know, just -- they're unbelieving in terms of how harmful that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: Are you -- wait, are you going to tie the health --</p><p>JOHNSON: How harmful -- that's what I would like to do.</p><p>ROMANS: Are you going to tie reforms to the health care law to raising the debt ceiling?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, that's what I'd like to do. I'm not sure exactly, you know, what type of fiscal reforms, what type of fiscal discipline, what kind of, you know, you have to do something. The American people expect us to do something.</p><p>If we're going to increase the debt burden on our kids and grandkids, we have to do some kind of reforms to make Social Security and Medicare solvent for future generations to stop the bankrupt in this nation.</p><p>ROMANS: So --</p><p>JOHNSON: We have to do something.</p><p>ROMANS: You talk about people crying, you talk about crying for relief from the health care law, but at the same time you have people crying for relief for a little more time on unemployment benefits.</p><p>We'll talk about what the bill -- the budget bill doesn't do. It doesn't extend the federal unemployment benefits. 1.3 million Americans are going to lose those benefits at the end of this month. And when you look at the economic data, as I do, Senator, you can see, for people newly unemployed, things are getting better. Things really are.</p><p>For people who've been out of work six months or longer, it's the same old story. And those jobless benefits go right into the economy. Would you support putting more money into jobless benefits here? If you're talking about crying for relief from health care reform, what about crying for relief for the long-term unemployed?</p><p>JOHNSON: Let's talk about the health care law's effect on unemployment. You know the 29ers. The people who are now being put into part-time status so that their employers don't have to pay that fine. You know, this health care law is doing a great deal of harm to job creation, but anybody that wants to increase or renew unemployment benefits, you've got to first say, well, what is the lower priority spending item that you're going to, you know, take off the table?</p><p>You know what areas of the budget are you going to cut to make room for what you consider higher priority item? So that's the -- that's the first table stakes. Don't come and request some more government spending without showing us how you're going to reduce the deficit in another area.</p><p>ROMANS: Clearly, a lot of prioritizing to go for the next couple of years.</p><p>JOHNSON: Absolutely.</p><p>ROMANS: You know, on this show, sir, we talk about one America but two economies. Anger over income inequality. Anger over a lack of a living wage. It's really on the rise.</p><p>I want you to listen to liberal comedian Bill Maher and then I want to give you a chance to respond.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL MAHER, HOST, \"REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER\": When even working people can't make enough to live, they take money from the government in the form of food stamps, school lunches, housing assistance, daycare. This is the welfare that conservatives hate, but they never stop to think, if we raise the minimum wage and force McDonald's and Wal-Mart to pay their employees enough to eat, we, the taxpayers, wouldn't have to pick up the slack.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: I've got to ask you, does Bill Maher have a point?</p><p>JOHNSON: No, when you raise the minimum wage, you remove those entry level positions, you create more unemployment. And that's not a good thing. What you need to do is you need to actually make the manufacturing base of this country more robust. How do you do that? You make America an attractive place for business investment, business expansion, job creation.</p><p>We have an onerous regulatory environment in this country. Obamacare is part of that. We have uncompetitive tax rates. I mean, if you're a German manufacturer who want to manufacture for the largest economy in the world, are you going to site your plant in Toronto at 15 percent, or Detroit at 35 percent?</p><p>So it's not rocket science in terms of what we have to do to make America an attractive place for job creation. We're just not doing it in this totally dysfunctional place called the federal government.</p><p>ROMANS: Well, at least we have the frameworks of a budget deal for the next couple of years. We'll take that as nice starting point.</p><p>Thank you, sir.</p><p>JOHNSON: That's a small little step. Have a merry Christmas.</p><p>ROMANS: You, too. Thank you so much.</p><p>All right.

Cybersecurity remains top of mind for health systems, but more established technology challenges have bubbled back to the surface. Heading into 2019 survey respondents said telehealth and interoperability were top of mind, in addition to cybersecurity, replacing predictive analytics and consumer-facing technology in last year's survey.</p><p>Cybersecurity is the lone stalwart. Nearly 90% of respondents said they expect to increase their cyber budgets in 2019, and half of those said the increase would be greater than 5%. Just 20% said they were \u201cvery confident\u201d in their IT recovery and business continuity plans, and most executives still see staff as the biggest target, with spearphishing campaigns as the most pervasive challenge.</p><p>\u201cThe people that are up to no good have far better tools than we do on our platforms,\u201d one CEO said. \u201cIf they really target you, they will likely find a way in.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRHTIT-613351</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRHTIT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSR-P0C1-DXM4-G3XR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414543</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FierceHealthcare IT</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 21, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000A0R9</classCode><className>GE HEALTHCARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001NW4</classCode><className>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Maybe I'll have to try to find out who his travel agent is, and tie that into a trading package.  My only question is, when is he due back?  Great coverage today.  Thank you!\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">-- Scott Eadie (received 6/17/98) Buying and Holding\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Please don't give in to the buy and holders. I am a 25-year-old equities trader at a midsize limited partnership and the next best source of knowledge away from the desk is your writing. Your daily synopsis of what you see going on helps me more than any news channel or site.\u00a0</p><p>-- Ed McCabe (received 6/16/98) Too Much Support?\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: It seems to me that support levels and trend lines are meant to be broken.  Dell, Costco, Safeway, AOL, Lucent are all leaders and are all under attack daily, yet they haven't cracked their support levels. Until they do and the towel is thrown into the ring, will we really have the capitulation that is so often talked about?\u00a0</p><p>-- Frank Degley (received 6/16/98) Battling the Market\u00a0</p><p>Gary B. Smith, I can certainly appreciate the scientific approach to trading.  Cramer, however, seems to prefer military history.  His columns are replete with references to such well-known traders as Robert E. Lee and Erich Ludendorff.  I can imagine Cramer humming martial tunes as he orders his funds into battle. When he feels Napoleonic, there's always La Marseillaise. (When he wants to be Hannibal, he'd have to make up his songs from the Punic Wars.) Perhaps you should include history in the trading curriculum. The battlefields may differ, but the tactics may be the same.\u00a0</p><p>-- Eugene Finerman (received 6/15/98) Dismal Business\u00a0</p><p>Dunlap's departure brings to mind the Buffett observation that when a guy with a reputation for excellence goes into a dismal business, it's the reputation of the business that survives.\u00a0</p><p> -- George Acton (received 6/15/98) Speech Reviews\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Just wanted to say, thanks for sharing the history and future strategy.\u00a0</p><p>-- Matt Bayly (received 6/15/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Needless to say I'm glad, to say the least, that you let TSC live. I will only be able to retire at a reasonable age if I invest. To learn that I joined TSC. Thanks Jim, Dave Kansas, and the whole crew for the education.\u00a0</p><p>-- Thomas J. Reich (received 6/14/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I am so happy you decided to continue with TSC. If I had known you were thinking about quitting, I would have gotten on a plane, flown there and tried to talk you out of it.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeanne Merchant (received 6/14/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your one weakness is charging monthly subscription rates. Once you are comfortably above break even, the monthly rate should go to $0 or at least go down significantly. The number of subscribers will mushroom.\u00a0</p><p>-- George Seay (received 6/14/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: It was interesting and refreshing to read the \"story\" of TheStreet.com and understand your vision for the site. As a new \"Home Depot do-it-yourself\" investor I look to the site for daily information, direction, and insight to help me make informed financial decisions. While it is important for people to understand your vision, admiration, and zest to make TheStreet.com the absolute best source for market and financial information I think it is more important for those sentiments to be echoed by your readers and for that I say kudos!\u00a0</p><p>-- Matthew Shapiro (received 6/14/98) Axing the Chainsaw\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: You were smart to unload Sunbeam. I think Michael Price wishes he had unloaded Al Dunlap sooner. Dunlap represents the dark side of American business. It takes no particular talent to take over the management of a business, fire half the payroll to produce a couple of good quarters and leave the business smoldering in your wake while you take off to \"turn around\" another company.\u00a0</p><p>-- Mark W. Zabell (received 6/15/98) Spots Be Gone\u00a0</p><p>Jesse Eisinger: Interesting story on Dusa. I had the kerotosis on the backs of both hands. At the doctor's office, they zapped each spot with each with a spray of liquid nitrogen. Just an instant of pain, like a pin prick. No further pain, quick healing, no scarring. Good luck Dusa.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeffrey Warren (received 6/14/98) The Bottom\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: In your recent column, you mentioned you have a way of spotting the bottom in a stock.  Since many of us are trying to identify the bottom in many of our favorite stocks, how about a column detailing your methodology.  You could frame it around some past experiences.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jonathan Daws (received 6/12/98) Eyes Peeled\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Thanks for your honest appraisal of Rowan and the oil services in general.  I am currently long NE and have been keeping me eyes peeled for comments from you on the subject.  I certainly value your opinion and this oil correction has been a real learing experience for me.  I am not a trader (obviously), but I also hate loosing money.  Your insight in this area has been quite helpful and look forward to your ongoing commentary.  No flames from me.\u00a0</p><p> -- Brian Fryar (received 6/12/98) Nicely Adjusted\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I think your columns this week have been nicely adjusted to state not only that value matters, but also to give specific company examples.\u00a0</p><p>Almost everyone at my office uses the \"it has gone down, now it must go up\" method and then they give themselves a pat on the back for doing so much research.\u00a0</p><p>If we have a long bear, they will all leave, muttering that the market is not to be trusted.  Will the 1980 attitude then prevail all over again?\u00a0</p><p> -- Bob Morgen (received 6/12/98) Giving Up Hope\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your comparison of Techs to oil drillers was an eye opening slap in the face.  And in my case it was probably a much needed slap in the face. I'm a big tech fan (tech investing has been so good to me over the past two years), but as your column pointed out to me -- my trading lately has been based more on hope then on strategy and discipline.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for getting me pointed in the right direction again.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jason Winfrey (received 6/11/98) Good Advice\u00a0</p><p>Gary B. Smith: Your GBS Training System column was the best online trading advice I've read. Period.\u00a0</p><p>I'm a retired musician, and unfortunately, not a math whiz, so when I tackle projects like writing spreadsheets, writing/running backtests, keeping paper-trading portfolios for bottom-fishing/shorting data, keeping a trading diary, etc....it's out of the greatest reluctance that I begin these daunting chores, let alone maintain them\u2026\u00a0</p><p> But you're darn right......the \"zen\" is bunk, and I *intuitively* KNEW that....I just never wanted to admit it to myself, because......hey......If I could just guess \"up\" or \"down\" right, and get \"in sync\" with the psychology, and be a \"contrarian\" trader, and blah, blah, blah.....BALONEY!!!\u00a0</p><p>I've been at this for longer than I care to admit, and your article really has me soul searching...\u2026\u00a0</p><p>I really hope you'll concentrate on this theme Gary, and develop the idea with guys like me in mind........even if it's nothing more than a step by step glimpse of how you came by the conclusion to \"buy at market\" at the open, instead of gap-open techniques with limit orders\u2026 (Did you keep records of the actual fill, vs a paper trade fill and backtest it?) And do you trade on days that open down like today ? with trend or against ?\u00a0</p><p>You know, the works ! All the details.....not necessarily to copy, but to inspire innovation.\u00a0</p><p>I don't know *anyone* else that's doing this; to the contrary, most \"trading\" sights are strictly \"wing and a prayer\" outfits, where the \"main guy\" makes a trade recommendation, and all the unfortunates within his earshot, bid up his _already-filled_ order, getting at least ONE person out with a profit. (I wish I had a nickel for every one of these I've seen.....GAH!)\u00a0</p><p>Your column is terrific, and I hope you have the editorial freedom to go so far as to suggest that we collectively get off our bums, fire the newsletter/website/cnbc/aol gurus, start converting our mistakes to data that we can learn from, like you seem to have done.\u00a0</p><p>-- Dick London (received 6/11/98) The Intel Probe\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: First, let me say that I strongly agree with you regarding the undue influence of lawyers, and other non-productive varmints, especially as it relates to distractions for companies like Intel.  Second, I agree that Intel is a great company, and they have made me a lot of money through the years, and I love their products and the speed with which they evolve.\u00a0</p><p>However, I must respectfully disagree with you that there is absolutely no anti-trust issue with respect to Intel. Sadly, they have been guilty of some tactics similar to those of MSFT in recent times since they have controlled the PC hardware.  For example, they were requiring that if a PC vendor wanted to have early system design info for each new generation of microprocessor chip, they had to use Intel motherboards (not ONLY microprocessors) in their first generation machines.  Now, if there had been a reasonable alternative source of microprocessors, this might have been reasonable, but, of course, they had a functional monopoly.  In an industry that moves as fast as the PC business, this of course meant that ALL first versions of a particular generation were on Intel motherboards, thereby precluding innovation by the PC vendor themselves.  Or, if a vendor tried to go it alone, they would not be able to have a competitive product available during the critical first months of a new generation, which would have been tantamount to commercial suicide.\u00a0</p><p>There are other examples, as well--things such as Intel customers suddenly suffering parts shortages should they agree to use chips from an Intel competitor.\u00a0</p><p>Having said all this, I actually feel that this current investigation is probably good for INTC.  At the very least,it will cause them to reassess their business practices, and (if they are still doing this sort of stuff) change in ways that are better for us, their customers.  Given that Messrs. Barrett et al. are much less likely to take the arrogant approach of Mr. Softee, I would not be surprised to see a reasonable settlement that will be an obvious winner for everyone.\u00a0</p><p> -- Dave Kisker (received 6/11/98) Leave the Crash Helmet\u00a0</p><p>The waves of \"impending crash\" caveats that accompany just about every discussion of the U.S. stockmarket caused me to recall a sage's advice that, \"the market always does what the fewest people expect\".  Well, there are certainly many people who expect a crash, but there are also a lot of people who believe the market is headed much higher.  Is there another scenario that might be developing?  I believe so.\u00a0</p><p>First, lets think about the economic background that investors face.  The Asian economies have yet to find a bottom.  Several of our telecom equipment analysts have indicated that the companies they follow should report in line second quarter results, but that companies that distribute to Asia (the manufacturer's customers) are experiencing large increases in inventory. Result: channel stuffing will enable many companies to hit June quarter forecasts, but second half forecasts will come down.  If this is true, it explains why it seems that there have been a manageable number of pre-releases this quarter.  Nonetheless, the conference calls may be a different matter.  Conclusion: Domestic U.S. economic growth is unlikely to accelerate and should begin to slow as the year progresses.  If so, inflation will be very low and with it, bond yields will decline.\u00a0</p><p>If the market does what the fewest expect, what could this scenario mean for investors?\u00a0</p><p>1. Continued high valuations (P/E, Price/Book, etc.).  This will drive the valuation crowd crazy.  Investors will scramble for anything with growth among a diminishing list of growth companies.  This view helps explain the high valuations of internet stocks --- at least they have growth.\u00a0</p><p>2. Volatile individual stock prices.  These high valuations will cause companies that disappoint to be slaughtered because confidence in future growth will be shaken (and investors will move quickly to the next hot growth story).\u00a0</p><p>3.  Slowing growth, high valuations and periodic blowups will depress the typical investor's annual returns into the mid-single digits.  Few individuals or money managers will be able to sprint through an investment landscape increasingly littered with landmines.\u00a0</p><p>4. Low bond yields will cause total returns from fixed income instruments to be less than 6%.  Although the long bond might have a bit of price upside as yields drift toward 5%, total returns elsewhere along the yield curve won't provide double digit returns.\u00a0</p><p>Bottom line: Investors may get neither mid-teens returns nor a crash that enables them to buy on the dip.  Instead, we may be headed for a several quarter period of sluggish performance as valuations gradually come back to more normal levels.  As a old consumer goods analyst, this is exactly how large cap consumer stocks behave --- a few to several years of outstanding performance, followed not by a crash, but by flat line price performance as valuations catch up (take a look at KO in the late 1980's/early 1990's, or WMT more recently).\u00a0</p><p> -- Richard Davis Jr. (received 6/11/98) Hayden's an Asset\u00a0</p><p>An asset allocator is a welcome addition to TheStreet.com. I'd like to see a debate between Cramer and Vern Hayden on whether asset allocation maximizes returns or guarantees mediocrity.\u00a0</p><p>-- Roger Mann (received 6/10/98) Rewarded\u00a0</p><p>The only people who have been rewarded by the R.S. Contrarian Fund are those of us who were smart enough to get out last October when it was first nominated for the fund graveyard. Thanks TSC. Paul Stephens doesn't have a clue!!!\u00a0</p><p> -- Jim Puffer (received 6/9/98) Y2K, Revisited\u00a0</p><p>The article on E*Trade and Y2K is very interesting, but not necessarily accurate.  Many non-legacy systems, built in the past couple of years, are still non-Y2K compliant.  I know first hand of one bank in the Northeast, which shall remain nameless, that contract to have a new system built to keep track of its trading.  They engage a consulting firm, which built the system totally with 2-digit dates.\u00a0</p><p>Webtrends 3.5, a program that I use to analyze my web site, is not Y2K compliant.  This is not only not a legacy system, it is very recent and totally Internet oriented\u00a0</p><p>This is not to say that E*Trade is not Y2K compliant, I'm simply pointing out that just because it is \"Internet\" and \"recent\" doesn't make it Y2K compliant.  Given the legacy systems it must interface with, they could very easily have Y2K issues.  The article doesn't mention any statements from the company about Y2K.\u00a0</p><p>Overall, the securities industry is far ahead of just about any other industry in terms of awareness and progress.  The initial SIA testing is scheduled for this July, and their testing methodology is available on the Internet.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeff Jacobs (received 6/9/98) Perplexed\u00a0</p><p>I am still perplexed by Jim Cramer's characterization of his stock positions as \"inventory\". As near as I can ascertain, Cramer has long term opinions about the unfolding relative improvement of certain large companies. He believes that on a short term basis the markets in those stocks reach technically diifficult to sustain short term levels of excess enthusiasm or revulsion. His trading, therefore, is broadly \"fading\" the public order flow.\u00a0</p><p>This is not, however, what I think of as securities \"inventory\", which is the raw material of a truly market-making function, or the by-product of the distribution of new issues.\u00a0</p><p>In my experience, one of the most dangerous situations a trader can find himself in is confusing speculation with a market-making discipline. It often leads to a two sets of books mentality where the interim losses are consigned to a mental investment account and the mental market-making account feels great.\u00a0</p><p>Mr. Cramer's frenetic trading may be wonderfully cathartic for his hedge fund's senior partner; but one wonders at the end of the day, how much does it add to the performance of the firm's underlying, and presumably carefully formulated bets? Is it in large part grist for the insatiable moloch of Wall Street entertainment against a twice daily TheStreet deadline?\u00a0</p><p> -- Paul J. Isaac (received 6/8/98) The Ax\u00a0</p><p>Eric Moskowitz: Good series of articles on the various axes' on the Street. However, it is at times difficult to keep an eye out for comments from these analysts on a daily basis when the news agencies that report analysts upgrades/downgrades don't identify the analysts as \"axes\".  Therefore, how about you guys putting out a \"The Axe Has Spoken\" column as soon as one of these analysts makes a change in recommendation.\u00a0</p><p>-- Brett Rule (received 6/5/98) New Fan\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: Regarding the recent discussion in your column about comments directed at JJC, I offer my 2 cents. First, I began reading TSC because of JJC. I subscribed for a year (and will continue for long after that, I suppose) because of JJC. I try to read everything he writes, whether in TSC or other venues. I have learned more from him about trading than could be bought at any price at any of this country's best b-schools. I am obviously an ardent fan of his.\u00a0</p><p>That said, I am also becoming an ardent fan of yours since your arrival at TSC. Perhaps it is the lawyer in me, but I like seeing the issues from \"both sides of the street.\" It allows one to keep a clearer head, and that is what the entire exercise of TSC should be about. The \"sniping\" is taken for what it is: the good-natured ribbing of JJC from one who also admires his work and personna, while making valid points in disagreement. As I've said to you before, keep up the good work.\u00a0</p><p> -- Bill Luttrell (received 6/5/98) More Helpful\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: If you stop offering your perspective on the market, I'll cancel.  Although I respect JJC, and his views re trading etc. are interesting, your columns are much more helpful in my effort to understand this market as an investor.  So much noise and confusion out there!  What we need is wisdom and perspective on things. That's why I read your columns and that's why I'm still a subscriber to TSC.\u00a0</p><p>-- Tim Mikkel (received 6/5/98) Fore\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: When people hassle you about [a recent column on] Dell here is another analogy that my explain your bullishness.\u00a0</p><p>The four best golfers at a private club are Mr. Dell, Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP. They always shoot in the 70's with Mr. Dell usually shooting a couple of strokes better than the rest. There are lots of other members at the club but while being good players, they can't really compete with the big four. The club they belong to is know as an easy course(wide fairways, flat greens, few trees and sand traps). It is easy to score well. This course is the equivalent of the PC industry of the last couple of years, growth being so rapid everyone makes money.\u00a0</p><p>The big four decide to go on a golf vacation. By some miracle they are able to play Augusta National. Augusta National is the golf equivalent of today's PC environment \"HELL\". Needless to say Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP are completely overmatched by the course and shoot horrible scores. Mr. Dell sucks it up and scrambles his way to to another sub 80 round. Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP put on a brave face and say they are going to head to the driving range to make a few adjustments in their game. Things will be better tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>The fundamental difference between Mr. Dell and the others(Mr IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP) is that Mr. Dell can adjust to the rapidly changing environment as the environment changes. Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP get annihilated by a change in the environment, go back home reflect on what happened, develop a plan to adapt, put the plan into action and hope things will be better tomorrow. They will always be killed by a negative change in the environment(hard courses) and do well when the environment turns positive(easy courses).\u00a0</p><p>The morale of the story is that Mr Dell is a better golfer and if your going to bet on Golf then bet on Mr Dell. CREAMer always rises to the top.\u00a0</p><p> -- Mike Yaffe (received 6/5/98) Kudos\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: I don't understand people who don't \"get it\". I think the ongoing debate between the you [and James Cramer] is one of the things that make TSC an interesting forum. I, for one, am sick and tired of all the whiners who expect this to be a promtional site that has nothing but \"buys\" and positive spin. Tell them to put on their rose-coloured sunglasses and spend more time at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.justhypeme.com\">www.justhypeme.com</url> , otherwise known as Silicon Investor. As a paying customer, I would rather see fewer articles written for newbies - your sophistication and expertise is what adds value.\u00a0</p><p> -- A. John Carlesso (received 6/5/98) Remember the Akron\u00a0</p><p>Jim Cramer: Enjoy your writing, your comments have made money for me.  Thanks, and here is my favorite mental image of trading psychology.  Have you ever seen the newsreel clips of the 1920's US Airship Akron disaster? The scene is like traders' thinking about when to take the loss or hold on.  The airship was met by a party of about a hundred ground handlers grabbing the ropes when a sudden wind gust and loss of ballast control caused the ship to bob up and down twenty, thirty, forty feet three or four times before rapidly climbing to a thousand feet unable to descend and then crashing within the half hour. There was a rain of falling men from different heights.  When does the trader take his loss?  Like the ground handler he has to decide if he lets go for a 20 feet fall to suffer a broken leg or hold on for a litte longer until the ship gets back to only to only a 5 foot hop down. One could even hope to get back down uninjured.  But then what if the ship just continues up and up\u2026  This happened to the ones who didn't let go before it was too late. However, one man did survive by hanging even to a thousand feet holding on for dear life and walked away from the crash landing.\u00a0</p><p> -- Sanford Friedrich (received 6/5/98) Trust\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I welcomed the wisdom you shared yesterday, it helped put things in perspective and clearly you were right until the market got sand-bagged by the Intel whiff. You are on the money though, the trust level is down - I think that's what I was trying to articulate in my mail yesterday. Why should a trader trust a market that constantly deflates and then only partially re-inflates the next day? Clearly, for a newbie like me it's hard to see why one should - how many times do you need to get your hands burnt before you stop after all?\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps that's the most frightening thing about the market - the general feeling appears to be falling to short sentiment, which is something I haven't had much experience dealing with (I did send mail to Smith a few weeks ago to go over it since I suspected we would end up in this sort of market sometime - didn't think it would be this quick though). Here we now have people using the chats on the Net to try to move stocks down, not up - perhaps the strongest evidence I've felt that the nature of the game is changing. I sure hope I'm wrong, since this is a game that I really don't look forward to playing in.\u00a0</p><p> -- Bryan McCormick (received 6/5/98) What Intel Didn't Say\u00a0</p><p>With everything INTC has already said about business slacking off, coupled with another wave of price cuts, does Intel really need to issue another statement saying its profits/revenue/growth won't be what people thought?\u00a0</p><p> -- Erik Milstone (received 6/4/98) Turning the Tables\u00a0</p><p>Since Mr. Cramer has been on CNBC so much, I would like to see him turn the tables and invite Mark Haines to show up for Mr. Cramer's new show, Real Money.  Thanks for all the good work.\u00a0</p><p> -- Tom Delosso (received 6/4/98) Instructive\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I read everything you publish on TS.com and the articles that are most instructive (to me) are the \"I Can Screw Up Too\" ones where you describe and analyze your mistakes.  I too evaluate my mistakes from every angle with the intention of learning how to avoid making the same mistake twice.  Please keep it up.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jerry Daughan, Harpswell, Maine (received 6/4/98) Stretched\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your arguments seem more stretched by the day.  For some reason you don't want to acknowledge that there is a huge slowdown at the semiconductor and boxmaker level.  Dell, GTW, may be good trades, but it's ludicrous to suggest that the fundamentals are improving.\u00a0</p><p> -- Steve Vita (received 6/4/98) No Reply\u00a0</p><p>Dan Colarusso: I have filed several e-mail type complaints with the NASDR office and the SEC enforcement-tips office over the past few months when I have seen \"blatant\" volume-spike options trading in calls or puts where there was no news, AND then after hours that company will come out with dramatic 'material' information which causes massive trading in the underlying stock the following morning-open.  Some of these instances are so damm obvious that (you or I) figure that the regulators should have been able to see it, also.  Most of the time, I never hear back from them.\u00a0</p><p> -- Gerald E. Naugle, Boulder, Colo. (received 6/4/98) Hear! Hear!\u00a0</p><p>As regards JJC's motion to start a \"conference cancellation watch\" on TSC, here's a second.\u00a0</p><p> -- Tom Scott (received 6/3/98)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#31666#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3XRV-0CC0-00MP-T1H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4247\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 1998 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>June 17, 1998 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>THESTREET INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>TST (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>\u00a0SIC8999 SERVICES, NEC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>\u00a0SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>THESTREET INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>TST (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Online Transactions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkNFQUM0RTIzMDQzNEU3MEExOTdFRDEzRjBDOEI1OEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUVEMzEzOENBNTZGNDQ1RThEODQzODc2ODY3NDhDNDY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN5Y</classCode><className>FINANCIAL MARKET UPDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>ST0008X09</classCode><className>LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDFEQjUyNDAyMzQ0NDQyNUE5RjNGOEZEMzNBRDA1RUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjA4OEVGODBENzY4NDcxM0IyQzA1OTEwQzVDODRBOUE</classCode><className>Limited Partnerships</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN5Y</classCode><className>FINANCIAL MARKET UPDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE000A5B2</classCode><className>JIM CRAMER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Although some consumers are concerned about the impact of electronic waste on the environment - with the widespread use of non-degradable plastic a key focus - the sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions thanks to rapid growth in power consumption, an issue that does not greatly resonate with consumers. Drivers of change are corporations, which are brand-sensitive and increasingly being scrutinised on performance by investors, while their employees are becoming more empowered to ensure changes in sustainability and good governance are adhered to. Governments - through regulatory bodies - are becoming more involved but are more responsive than proactive. The Telecoms, media and technology (TMT) sector has, over the last decade, become acutely aware of its impact on the environment, on the global social fabric and in the way that industry stakeholders work together. </p><p>TMT companies and those they serve are among the biggest consumers of natural or scarce resources (power, land, human productivity/creativity) and they are very sensitive to any changes in how they are perceived and judged in this context.Many TMT industry players subscribe to some form of corporate and social responsibility (CSR) code of conduct, either collectively or through standalone self-developed internal mechanisms. These tend to be quite loose in terms of definitions of standards and grading of those standards but, where these mechanisms have been in place for several years, and where companies are willing to share data, clear improvements in resource consumption, environmental impact and relationships with shareholders, employees and suppliers are generally being recorded.Technological improvements have been a major facilitator for enhanced business sustainability, but the key drivers remain fundamentally driven by underlying business needs: to improve profitability; to protect or augment the value of the company's brand, and; to secure the loyalty of paying customers and investors. New technology - as has so often been the case throughout history - is rarely properly regulated and can be misused by end-users. This is often out of the control of many stakeholders and, in recent years, technology companies in particular have come in for strong criticism over the ways in which their creations - both in real and hypothetical terms - are being used for ill.Drivers For The TMT Sector <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Consumers </emphasis>  Devices The technology sector offers consumers a heady mix of tangible and intangible products, with the former being represented by disposable pieces of technology, such as personal computers, smartphones, TV sets, games consoles and similar types of gadgets. These tangible products have a significant environmental impact, both at the point of manufacture and at the end of life, owing to their high chemical and non-degradable content.A high proportion of the outer shells of these devices consists of non-recyclable plastic, which often goes to landfill at the end of its lifecycle. Meanwhile, the inner workings such as printed circuit boards, cables, microprocessors, touchscreens, etc vary considerably to the extent to which they can be reused.China has become a high-volume producer of generic or 'white label' consumer electronics, selling these at very low prices to low-budget consumers worldwide. Often, these products are designed with little or no consideration to recyclability and have very short lifespans owing to the limitations of cheaply made components.Broadly, there has been little impetus for change from consumers - often from pressure groups such as Greenpeace - as the desire for the newest gadget tends to override any concerns consumers might have about environmental impact. Furthermore, the junking of obsolete equipment typically occurs out of sight and some entrepreneurial businesses have emerged to act as middle-men in the process, incentivising the collection of materials for recycling by offering cash payments for old gadgets such as phones, TV sets and computers as well as media such as CDs and DVDs. Services Intangible products typically take the form of 'services', such as streamed video, instant messaging, remote computing, personal navigation, and so on. Consumers tend to see little connection between a digital service and the environment and so there is no real driver for change in this area.However, where such services have a pronounced social impact (typified by 'social media' platforms such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Instagram</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Snap</emphasis>), consumers have become very aware - and sensitive - to the way in which their personal data are shared by the platform to its partners as well as to the nature of the content being posted to and hosted on those networks.Revelations that digital services companies have had customers' personal details stolen or that social media platforms have been working with organisations whose ulterior motives include influencing political discourse and thinking have generated hyperbolic media headlines and caused consumer advocacy groups press for change to business models. However, there has been no fall-off in consumer usage of these platforms, diffusing the overall level of concerns by these stakeholders.As noted above, consumers generally do not see a connection between digital services and the environment and this is down to the diffuse and globalised nature of the services sector. Digital services are powered by vast numbers of large computers, all interlinked by a global network of cables, satellites and wireless connections and data are processed in huge computing warehouses, called datacentres. All of these need and consume enormous amounts of power, a very high proportion of which comes from fossil fuels or their derivatives.Popular media, e-commerce and information platforms (for example, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>) depend on high non-renewable power consumption and few consumers, if any, are cognizant of this fact. Fewer still are prepared to stop using these platforms unless a shift to renewable power is implemented. Yet tech companies - and the datacentre operators on which they rely - are making efforts to use power in a more sustainable fashion, and numerous power supply agreements have been struck with renewable energy companies by tech giants such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis> and Facebook. In May 2019, several of the largest US-based tech companies called upon their principal power supplier in Northern Virginia (the biggest datacentre hub in the world) to switch from gas-based power generation to solar and wind faster than it had outlined in its latest 10-year investment plan. Their influence is such that it may force a change in the power company's plans, a first for the power sector. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Governments/Policy-Makers </emphasis> The technology sector has flourished since the early 1990s, mainly because its development has largely been left to the private sector, where risk appetites are greater and where entrepreneurialism and innovation through failure has trumped investment pragmatism and conservatism.Governments have generally reduced their involvement in the sector (usually through privatisation or public-private investment partnerships) or have withdrawn direct involvement altogether. Yet, in order to capitalise on stakeholders' use of natural or scarce resources, to protect consumers from dominant or weak players, and to influence technological development to suit society's needs, governments have maintained a degree of control through regulation.Regulation is a form of control that can be sector- or product-specific (for example, setting price increase caps on particular services or mandating network build-out milestones), or it may be enforced more generally, for example though controls on mergers or financial accounting.As in most sectors, regulators' and governments' expertise lags far behind technological development and their response is often driven by consumers' and other stakeholders' concerns. Some of these concerns are wholly justified, others are less so and can take the form of ill-informed and judgemental reactions to experimental or immature applications and business models that tech companies - owing to the highly competitive nature of their businesses - might wish to keep opaque. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Investors And Employees </emphasis> The TMT sector hosts a broad spectrum of companies, ranging from small start-ups to sprawling multinationals, all with varying shareholder influences and agendas. The largest companies tend to be listed and therefore subjected to the greatest media, public, shareholder and government scrutiny. They must therefore be highly diligent in responding to concerns about their activities and the corresponding impact this may have on their reputations. However, as the Facebook- <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cambridge Analytica</emphasis> scandal and numerous other companies' data leaks attest, tech companies' brand reputations are not easily tarnished, let alone destroyed, such is the degree of their entrenchment.Technology, no matter how advanced or simple to use, is a high-risk investment opportunity, subject to retrospective regulation, rapid changes in consumption trends and fluid macroeconomic risk. Successful players are kept aloft by developing and continually refreshing or replacing differentiated or value-added products. In their bid to stay relevant or gain an edge over rivals, some companies may choose to use corporate practices that are unsustainable or improperly account for key transactions.The bursting of the dot-com bubble in 1999/2000 was driven, in part, by unsustainable investment in immature technologies, the acquisitions and mergers of non-viable businesses, and the use of questionable accounting practices that included - amongst many other now-notorious practices - the billing of the entire projected value of multi-year supply deals in the same quarter that deals were brokered.It is no coincidence that the technology sector began employing CSR initiatives as a guideline for responsible investment and profit growth soon after recovery began in earnest in the early 2000s. This increased transparency, bolstered by the accelerated maturity of technology within social, communication, governance and business infrastructures, saw the technology sector become one of the most attractive elements of investors' portfolios for a second time. The societal benefits of new technology are generally considered to outweigh its risks.<table><title>Microsoft Can Do Better: Energy Credits And Purchase Agreements Mask Slow Progress In Tech Companies' Moves To Sustainable Energy Use</title><tgroup cols=\"4\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"280\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"72\"/><thead valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>FY15</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>FY16</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>FY17</p></entry></row></thead><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p/></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Electricity Use (MWh)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>3,984,860</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>5,048,891</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>6,344,479</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Renewable Energy Usage (MWh)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>3,836,043</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>4,852,643</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>6,104,758</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o/w Renewable Energy Credits (MWh)</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">3,664,469</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">4,055,299</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">5,119,876</emphasis></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o/w Power Purchase Agreements (MWh)</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">170,887</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">796,802</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">984,464</emphasis></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o/w On-site Renewable Energy (MWh)</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">687</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">542</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">418</emphasis></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>% Renewable Energy</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>96</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>100</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>100</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>   Source: Microsoft, Fitch Solutions     <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Employees Are Main Drivers</emphasis>  Prominence Of Stakeholder Categories In Driving Sustainability For The Technology Industry <nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2061infographic---Drivers805\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scale chart out of 10.

Source: Fitch Solutions</emphasis>  Implications For The TMT Sector <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Consumers </emphasis>  Devices As noted earlier, consumers are not well engaged with the environmental cost of continued device replacement, but pressure groups have forced companies - often those under tightening environmental impact rules set by governments - to take steps to ensure that as much of the content of these old devices is recoverable and reusable as possible, including reducing the number of components, miniaturising core elements and designing products with reusability in mind.Retail and shipping packaging is also coming under scrutiny. In January 2019, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Samsung Electronics</emphasis> announced that it would start taking steps to replace plastic packaging materials with paper and other environmentally sustainable elements. From the first half of 2019, the packaging used for Samsung's products and accessories - ranging from mobile phones and tablets to home appliances - will be substituted with environmentally sustainable materials like recycled/bio-based plastics and paper. Other vendors have already embarked on this journey; undoubtedly, others will follow in their wake.With regards to end-of-life processes, the industry has seen the value chain expand to include dedicated device harvesters and recyclers; often, these are independent high-street or online-based organisations, but some manufacturers have set up their own end-of-life collection systems. Users are paid for unwanted items and the harvesters sell them back to the tech sector for a modest profit. Some devices are broken down and recycled; others are sold on at low prices to emerging markets, where the latest models are too expensive to buy.In the UK, for example, distributors (including retailers) must provide a system which allows all customers buying new electrical equipment the opportunity to recycle their old items free of charge. Those establishing their own take-back scheme must as a minimum offer all customers buying new electrical equipment free take back of their old electricals on a like-for-like basis. Incentivised by the prospect of cash for unwanted devices, consumers are engaged by this initiative, but they do not necessarily drive it. Services Although it is by no means the only platform to face increased scrutiny, Facebook has become the poster-child for the growing backlash against social media. Most damagingly, it appears to have engaged with a number of organisations that have since been found to have analysed user profiles and usage data to target users with news, advertisements and related content with the intent of swaying political views. While Facebook may not have been aware of its partners' intentions, its inability to carry out due diligence ahead of sharing data with those entities or to take remedial action or accountability after the fact has led to calls for it to either be more tightly regulated or broken up and 'neutered'.In the wake of further negative revelations - including the discovery that Facebook had actively been seeking to aggressively monetise young users - founder Mark Zuckerberg has conceded that the company (and, by extension, the social media sector as a whole) needs to be regulated by an independent authority.While consumers have become more aware and concerned about the social media sector's business practices, they have not stopped using the biggest platforms. Facebook has seen little fall-off in daily usage rates and other platforms are similarly continuing to do brisk business despite well reported instances of hacking and the hosting of unpalatable content. It is difficult to conceive the scale of a breach of trust that would cause users to drop away in significant numbers.<table><title>Estimated Value Of Raw Materials In E-Waste, 2016</title><tgroup cols=\"3\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"360\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"48\"/><thead valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Material</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Kilotons (kt)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>EURmn</p></entry></row></thead><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p/></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Iron</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>16,283</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>3,582</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Copper</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>2,164</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>9,524</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Aluminium</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>2,472</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>3,585</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Silver</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>1.6</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>884</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Gold</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>0.5</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>18,840</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Palladium</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>0.2</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>3,369</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Plastics</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>12,230</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>15,043</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>   Source: International Telecommunication Union<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Governments/Policy-Makers </emphasis> There is growing concern about the ease with which social media platforms can be subverted by agent provocateurs, criminal organisations, rogue nations' international intelligence agencies and by the subtle (or forthright) imposition of secular or populist views, even by some of the highest political offices on the planet. Calls for Facebook and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> YouTube </emphasis> to become more accountable for content hosted on their global networks are being listened to by liberal governments or being acted upon (ironically, pre- emptive bans or neutering is something that more authoritarian or socially controlled states have come to excel at).Several Middle East nations have long imposed blanket bans on social media platforms in order to protect both national security and citizens' morals, while countries such as China and Russia have sunk such deep content filters into local Internet infrastructures that they are effectively creating localised and isolated Internets.Liberal countries are also taking steps to protect citizens from harmful 'content'. In July 2019, as part of its Digital Economy Act, the UK will introduce age verification for 'adult content' sites hosted by UK Internet service providers ( ISPs) in an effort to prevent children accidentally accessing pornography. While well-intentioned, potential flaws in the initiative include legitimate users moving onto insecure platforms (raising cybersecurity risks), content moving onto more generic platforms such as social media, unintended blocking of non-pornographic sites, a heightened risk that a newly-created database for registered users could be hacked, and placing the burden of regulation onto an ill-equipped agency (the British Board of Film Classification).Furthermore, mindful that the emergence of a global Internet of Things ( IoT) will see billions of connected devices go live over the next decade, some regulators are looking to ensure that no single technology company can dominate the market from one end to another. In February 2018, French telecoms regulator Arcep said it was looking to create a new framework to ensure the Internet remains open end-to-end, adding the principles of device- or platform- neutrality to the already-regulated principle of net neutrality. Arcep believes the lack of openness of devices, through the use of applications, and its domination by a few major operating systems pose a threat to consumer choice, which must be addressed.Questions are also being asked of global technology players - such as Google - regarding their revenue accounting and tax payment methodologies. In October 2018, the UK government announced a new Digital Services Tax from 2020, targeting Internet companies. The tax will raise GBP275mn in the first year, increasing to GBP440mn in 2023-2024.<table><title>UK Vs Europe: Digital Services Taxes</title><tgroup cols=\"2\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"344\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"280\"/><thead valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>UK Tax</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>EU Proposals</p></entry></row></thead><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p/></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>2% of revenues</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>3% of revenues</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Minimum UK revenues of GBP25mn per annum</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Minimum European revenues of EUR50mn</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Minimum worldwide revenues of GBP500mn per annum</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Minimum worldwide revenues of EUR750mn per annum</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>   Source: UK Government, European Commission, Fitch Solutions   The initiative attempts to create a fairer system of taxation for digital players, which have been using legal ways to decrease the amount of taxes they pay in certain European markets. As the tax system still relies on physical presence, it means they were paying less than comparable or smaller companies. The UK is - along with Spain - the first market to implement such a tax, as moves are being made on both the European and international level. The UK wants to be seen as an innovator by moving quickly, but it is taking the risk of being alone in a completely globalised digital market, as well as negatively impacting one of its key sectors ahead of its withdrawal from the European Union.The key for the UK tax to work will be international cooperation. The EU is pushing ahead with its own tax, spearheaded by France, but this has faced opposition. The US Treasury has said the proposals were unfair, while many tech companies, including European ones like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Spotify </emphasis>, have also voiced concerns. Some member states which benefit from the current system are also against the plan, but the key country will be Germany, whose support has weakened in recent months. Without a wider agreement, the UK tax will have a limited impact. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Investors And Employees </emphasis> Driven by their highly visible CSR obligations and a need to maintain brand integrity in an age where even a minor breach of trust can cause considerable public relations damage and impact share prices, consumer electronics vendors are becoming more careful about component sourcing. Devices use considerable quantities of rare earth metals, much of which is sourced from economically, socially and politically challenging markets, and they will be wary of being accused of exploiting local populations or helping corrupt regimes oppress their citizens and workers.'Conflict minerals' refer to the metals - namely tantalum, tin, tungsten, gold and cobalt - that are used in devices such as smartphones, TV sets and PCs but which are harvested from central African nations, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda and the Central African Republic. These minerals are often the primary source of military funds of local armed rebels.High-profile vendors, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Intel</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Ericsson </emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Nokia </emphasis> and Samsung have established conflict-free minerals procurement policies that require suppliers to prioritise the use of conflict-free minerals in order to avoid indirect associated problems such as mistreatment of labourers, threatening workers with force, mass usage of child labour and destroyed ecology.Taiwan-based <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> ASUS </emphasis>' policy is typical of these high-profile brands, in that it requires its suppliers to reveal the status of procurement on conflict-free mineral every year. The rate of using conflict-free minerals by ASUS' supply chain had increased from 22% in 2013 to 97% by 2017 (latest published data). ASUS aims to source 100% of tantalum, tin, tungsten, gold and cobalt from qualified smelters by 2020.A relatively new aspect to this face of the puzzle is the growing influence of employees as a force of social conscience. Big tech companies have been supplying communications services to governments and their military forces for many years but, as technology has evolved to become more pervasive and sophisticated, so employees have become concerned that the companies they work for are putting profits ahead of ethics.Amazon, Google and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> have been developing facial recognition software for use by the military and law enforcement organisations. Their employees - along with a number of advocacy groups - have called on the companies not to sell these artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems to governments until they could ensure the technology could not be misused or employed for unethical reasons. Amazon has acknowledged that its Rekognition system could be used for unethical surveillance or population control, but is still pushing ahead with efforts to sell it to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI). Amazon is also seeking to provide cloud services to the Department of Defense's cloud computing project, JEDI, despite the concerns of its employees. It is a deal worth USD10bn and would put Amazon ahead of rivals Google and Microsoft in the hotly contested cloud services market.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Company Boards To Face Strongest Implications</emphasis>  Strength Of Technology Industry Sustainability Implications For Stakeholder Categories <nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2014infographic---Implications954\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scale chart out of 10.

That word is \u201csustainability\u201d.</p><p>Of course, we all have a general sense of what sustainability refers to. For most of the history of business, it was enough that a business made a profit. As the old phrase has it, the business of business is to stay in business. Sometime in the 20th century, however, the planet got a little more crowded and it became clear that the profit motive alone might not solve every resource allocation problem. It became evident that companies had better aim for something more than just returns on capital invested. A sustainable business is one delivering on that something.</p><p>What is it, then?</p><p>Part of the answer is about social responsibility: companies should be responsive to employees as well as shareholders, should not harm our common environment, should support civic life rather than enriching tyrants, and so on. But there is more to sustainability, I would argue, than collective responsibility. It is also about what kind of profit motive drives a business. Sustainable businesses are \u201clong-term greedy\u201d: they want to generate prosperity into the distant future, not make a quick buck. And they should create positive economic externalities, not extract economic rent.</p><p>Does this all sound a bit abstract? Perhaps, but happily the seven winners of this year\u2019s FT ArcelorMittal Boldness in Business Awards provide concrete examples of what it means for a business to be sustainable in the fullest possible sense. And they show how sustainability in business requires intelligence, invention, courage and verve.</p><p>What is required for real sustainability is, in a word, boldness.</p><p>Let us start with one of the most straightforward forms of sustainability \u2014 the environmental one. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/ff821eea-b6cc-4ba1-9a99-6e6e05e828ff\">Iceland Foods</url>\u2019 commitment to radically reduce \u2014 and eventually eliminate \u2014 both palm oil from its products and plastic from its packaging is admirable enough, considered in isolation. But it also dispels one of the most pernicious myths about environmental sustainability: that it is a luxury good to be indulged in only by well-to-do consumers and the top-shelf brands that cater to them. Iceland is a value brand, but it is also an excellent business that is in a good position to take responsibility for all the external costs its operations have the potential to create.</p><p>Others should follow its example. Bold leadership is not a luxury good, and this year\u2019s award for corporate responsibility and environment recognises that.</p><p>One of the most unfortunate facts of human nature (what we now call a \u201ccognitive bias\u201d) is the tendency to see all business situations as zero-sum. \u201cThink win-win,\u201d we are told again and again, but the point never seems to sink in. A good definition of a sustainable business is one that makes whole commercial networks work better \u2014 enriching all the participants, rather than separating the winners from the losers.</p><p>This magic is found particularly in information businesses, and this year\u2019s developing market award winner, Gro Intelligence, is an information business with immense potential. By gathering disparate sources of agricultural data, and doing the analytic work of turning the data into decision-making tools, it is set to make agriculture businesses more productive. A bold project the judges were pleased to endorse.</p><p>Next comes a gritty, literal sense of sustainability: the sheer ability to stick with it. Bold businesspeople cling to their long-term vision for their business, even when short-term conditions are unfriendly.</p><p>I was reminded of how hard it is for long-term-oriented businesses to stick to their guns by a comment that Warren Buffett made at a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. He was asked by an investor whether Berkshire\u2019s ability to buy high-quality private businesses outright would be maintained when he no longer ran the company. Business owners, the questioner suggested, are drawn to the Buffett mystique.</p><p>These opportunities had nothing to do with him, Buffett replied: owners who want to sell their businesses, but want to ensure they will be managed for the long run, have nowhere else to go. Public markets, private equity and everything in between \u2014 we live in a short-term world.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/79690dd4-4659-45be-91fb-3271c68229fd\"> Ocado</url>, the recipient of this year\u2019s technology award, has borne the full weight of the market\u2019s short-termism and come out the other side. The company and its founders endured years of pummelling from the markets as sceptics argued that a sufficient number of grocers would not adopt its technology for automating warehouses to facilitate grocery delivery, and the company would remain subscale for ever. (Full disclosure: even the FT\u2019s Lex column under my editorship sided with the sceptics. We were wrong.)</p><p>The company stuck to its vision and the customers did appear, in Europe and the US, sending the share price rocketing. At a moment when Britain needs a technology success story, Ocado is providing one.</p><p>Next, a somewhat paradoxical meaning of sustainability: the ability to change. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f8c9acd7-a803-437b-8c43-2a8d113e5363\"> Fast Retailing</url>, winner of this year\u2019s drivers of change award, has struck a remarkable balance between price and quality in its clothing. The products are inexpensive but not disposable, not meant to be worn for a season and thrown away, as many brands in the same price range are. Indeed, the quality matches that of many high-priced brands, and is forcing them to adapt.</p><p>Fast keeps the pressure on rivals by continuing to invest in technology and efficiency. Quality is maintained because underlying processes change.</p><p>One of the most reliable ways to win in business is to stay focused on serving a permanent and unchanging human need \u2014 especially when that requires doing things in a new way. There is no human desire more fundamental than that to eat ice cream. The entrepreneurship award this year was, for me, an easy choice. Halo Top, a business started in a lawyer\u2019s kitchen, made a place for itself in a market dominated by big, entrenched brands by delivering a low-calorie, high-protein product that was just better. Sustainable businesses, at a basic level, do not simply ensure customers pay up. They make sure those customers are happy.</p><p>Of course, there may be needs that have not yet been satisfied at all, except in dreams: in a nod to this, the judges\u2019 pick for small company was Lilium, which may deliver a low-noise, no-emission air taxi \u2014 or, as it is known to the child in all of us, a flying car. A business, or a world, that stops dreaming boldly becomes unsustainable fast, after all.</p><p>A final definition of sustainability is one that in my mind is the most important. Truly sustainable businesses \u2014 which, I have argued here, are all distinguished by their boldness of spirit \u2014 are operated with the recognition that some things are more important than business. There are values to which all commercial endeavours are subordinate.</p><p>Sir <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Tim_Berners-Lee\"> Tim Berners-Lee</url>, our person of the year, saw how the internet, which he did so much to bring to life, was put to use for the exploitation of individuals rather than their liberation. His latest endeavour, Inrupt, is trying to redesign the web to change this, putting individuals back in charge of their own information.</p><p>The judges hope to look back, years into the future, and see that the businesses we have recognised in 2019 are still growing, innovating and striking out for new territory. Bold business is sustainable business.</p><p>Winners</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Person of the Year: Sir Tim Berners-Lee</emphasis><br/>By designing the world wide web three decades ago, Sir Tim cemented himself as one of the most influential people of the modern era: his creation has had an incalculable impact on our everyday lives. But having grown increasingly concerned at how large interests were exploiting the web\u2019s openness \u2014 including for electoral manipulation and cyber crime \u2014 the British computer scientist designed a data platform called Solid aimed at returning ownership of data to the users who generate it. In 2018, Sir Tim launched Inrupt, a for-profit company intended to put Solid into operation, maximising the upsides of the web while minimising its downsides. The goal, in Sir Tim\u2019s words, is to \u201cgive people complete control of their data\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Drivers of Change: Fast Retailing</emphasis><br/>The Japanese group, whose clothing brands include Theory, J Brand and Uniqlo, has grown to become the world\u2019s third-largest casual clothing retailer. It is investing in technology to increase efficiencies: its automation of a Japanese distribution centre enabled 24-hour operations and increased productivity 80-fold. Fast Retailing is now investing nearly $1bn to automate its warehouse and distribution operations worldwide.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corporate Responsibility/Environment: Iceland Foods</emphasis><br/>The UK retailer has long been committed to environmental campaigning, removing artificial colourings from its food in the 1980s and banning genetically modified ingredients in the 1990s. More recently, the company started two key environmental initiatives: to reduce plastic use within five years and to stop using palm oil in its own-brand products. Despite a television ban for its political content, Iceland\u2019s Christmas ad about the impact of palm oil \u2014 featuring a homeless orangutan called Rang-Tan \u2014 received millions of views online.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Entrepreneurship: Halo Top</emphasis><br/>In 2011, Halo Top founder Justin Woolverton began experimenting in his kitchen to create an ice cream that satisfied his sweet tooth but contained substantially fewer calories than commercial brands. By the end of 2018, Halo Top had a hefty share of the North American market and was generating annual revenues of more than $300m. Halo Top has also started selling its low-calorie ice cream in the UK, Australia and Singapore, and continues to expand internationally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology: Ocado</emphasis><br/>The UK online supermarket has evolved into a technology group by selling its warehousing and ecommerce system, the Ocado Smart Platform, to other grocery retailers. In Ocado\u2019s warehouses, which are temperature-controlled to store fresh goods, robots collaborate to fetch goods and have the ability to complete a 50-item order in a few minutes. Since 2017, the company has signed deals with leading international retailers in Europe and North America.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Developing Markets: Gro Intelligence</emphasis><br/>Founded to provide agricultural data about Africa, Gro Intelligence has expanded to focus on global food markets. Its data help users better plan for droughts, invest in more resilient crops and make better-informed choices about loans and investments. Gro uses machine learning to model data such as future crop yields with high accuracy \u2014 recently the US Department of Agriculture revised down forecasts for US corn and soyabean production, bringing them closer to Gro\u2019s predictions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Smaller Company: Lilium</emphasis><br/>The German start-up is developing electric air taxis that will be low-noise, high-speed and emission-free. In 2017, the company completed a first test flight of its two-seater jet, which executed its signature transition from vertical to horizontal flight. The launch helped Lilium raise more than $100m in funding to develop the aircraft for commercial use. Lilium is aiming for its flying taxi service to be operational by 2025.</p><p>Other nominees</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Drivers of Change</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">GW Pharmaceuticals</emphasis><br/>The UK medical group was approached in 2012 by the parents of an epileptic boy to see if its cannabis-based medicine could be developed as a treatment for his seizures. In 2018, the resulting drug, Epidiolex, was the first cannabis-based medication to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Inrupt</emphasis><br/>In 2018, Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the world wide web, launched Inrupt, to enable users to take control of their personal data from big tech. Instead of allowing online services to use their Facebook or Gmail accounts to access their details, Inrupt\u2019s Solid helps users share that information themselves using a personal online data store.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Just</emphasis><br/>The US food technology company makes plant-based alternatives to animal products, including Just Mayo, an egg-free mayonnaise. The group has also launched Just Egg, a vegan product with the taste and texture of scrambled eggs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Monzo</emphasis><br/>The UK digital bank was founded in 2015, aimed at providing financial services to people \u201cwho live their lives on their iPhones\u201d. Monzo is constructing a marketplace where customers can access financial services provided by partner organisations. The company has raised \u00a320m from 36,000 investors via crowdfunding and has more than 1m customers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Revolution</emphasis><br/>AOL co-founder Steve Case started venture capital group Revolution, which since 2013 has invested in innovative US companies not based in New York or California. On his annual \u201cRise of the Rest\u201d tour, Case visits start-ups across the US, and has raised more than $1bn to invest in them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corporate Responsibility / Environment</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">BlackRock</emphasis><br/>In 2018, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced its commitment to \u201csustainable investing\u201d and launched exchange traded funds that prioritise social, environmental and governance factors.

It can produce up to 5,000 tonnes a year of the polymer, made with 20 per cent waste carbon dioxide.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Neighbourly</emphasis><br/>UK-based Neighbourly is an online platform that enables companies and individuals to donate food to local charities, helping UK retailers meet a commitment to reduce food waste by 20 per cent by 2025.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ReNew Power</emphasis><br/>A developer and operator of wind turbines and solar panels, ReNew is India\u2019s largest clean energy producer. Last year it acquired Ostro Energy, and founder Sumant Sinha is eyeing more deals to consolidate India\u2019s fragmented renewables industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Vindhya e-Infomedia</emphasis><br/>Two-thirds of the Indian outsourcer\u2019s staff are disabled \u2014 unusual for a country where disabled people face significant discrimination. The provider of claims processing, payroll and data management has attracted clients such as IBM, Accenture and SAP, while staff turnover is in single digits.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Astroscale</emphasis><br/>The Japanese company was founded in 2013 to tackle the problems posed by the estimated 750,000 pieces of debris circling the earth in space. The company\u2019s space mission ELSA-d, where a test launch will aim to capture a satellite, is scheduled for 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">BenevolentAI</emphasis><br/>The UK medical start-up uses artificial intelligence (AI) to mine and analyse biomedical data in an effort to discover compounds for development as new medical treatments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Celonis</emphasis><br/>The German technology group\u2019s AI-driven enterprise software analyses business processes. The software takes flows of information, such as those related to invoices or logistics, and visualises it in a way that makes inefficiencies easier to spot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Darktrace</emphasis><br/>The UK cyber security company\u2019s Enterprise Immune System uses unsupervised machine learning that can establish a baseline of normal activity for any computer network and identify threats, much like the human immune system. Darktrace was valued at $1.65bn in September 2018.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Oxitec</emphasis><br/>The UK biotechnology company has genetically modified mosquitoes to prevent their offspring reaching adulthood. In May 2018, Oxitec launched a pilot project in the Cayman Islands and has received funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Entrepreneurship</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bulb Energy</emphasis><br/>The company was founded in 2015 to offer renewable energy without the hefty premium charged by rivals. Having raised \u00a360m of funding, it aims to supply 5m UK households within five years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fever-Tree</emphasis><br/>The UK-based soft drinks company produces high-quality mixers. Since launching its first tonic water in 2005, it has developed a wide range and overtook Schweppes as the UK\u2019s leading mixer supplier in 2017.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mercari</emphasis><br/>The Japanese start-up is an app-based marketplace that enables consumers to sell second-hand goods to one another. It became Japan\u2019s first start-up to be valued at more than $1bn, with 30 per cent of Japan\u2019s population using the service.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Modanisa</emphasis><br/>Turkish entrepreneur Kerim Ture founded Modanisa in 2011 to fill a gap in the online market for Muslim women looking for modest but fashionable clothing. It sells more than 70,000 products from 500 brands.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Revolut</emphasis><br/>The financial services app offers its mostly European users international money transfers, cryptocurrency trading and fee-free currency exchange at the interbank exchange rate. The London-based company had a customer base of 2.8m by the end of 2018, and is expanding into the US and Asia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Developing Markets</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">BYJU\u2019s</emphasis><br/>India\u2019s largest educational tech company offers app-based learning programmes and test preparation to primary and secondary school pupils. In September 2018 it received a $100m investment for a 5 per cent stake, which it plans to use to expand internationally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CargoX</emphasis><br/>The Brazilian company\u2019s platform connects companies needing to ship goods with trucks with spare capacity. CargoX expects to reach $1bn in revenue by 2021 and plans to bring the technology to a wider global market.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tala</emphasis><br/>Launched in Kenya in 2014, Tala\u2019s app offers microfinance loans in emerging markets, using data points from a user\u2019s smartphone to assist lending decisions. By October 2018, the company had issued more than $500m in loans, and raised funding from PayPal to expand globally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Transsion</emphasis><br/>The Chinese electronics company makes smartphones aimed at sub-Saharan African consumers. It has adapted to that market by improving battery life, enabling phones to house multiple SIM cards, and recognise local languages.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ual\u00e1</emphasis><br/>The Argentine fintech company\u2019s personal finance app is linked to a Mastercard prepaid card. Its widespread adoption is encouraging cash-reliant Argentines to switch to digital banking. Goldman Sachs led a $34m funding round for the group in 2018.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Smaller Company</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">American Giant</emphasis><br/>Retailing entirely online, the clothing company was founded with hopes of regenerating the US garment-making industry. The company has gained popularity on the back of the \u201cMade in America\u201d movement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goonhilly Earth Station</emphasis><br/>Once the world\u2019s largest satellite station, the site in south-west England provides telecoms and satellite-tracking services. It is upgrading its antennas to meet deep-space communication requirements, which will enable Goonhilly to communicate with missions to Mars or the Moon by 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Icon</emphasis><br/>The Texan construction tech group was founded to develop tools capable of 3D-printing housing, to lower the time and cost of construction.

The first three chapters review global developments, prospects and risks, with particular emphasis on monetary policy and financial regulatory reforms, markets and intermediaries. We also devote two special chapters to topical issues, one on macroprudential frameworks and one on the economic analysis of cryptocurrencies. My remarks today will focus on the first three chapters. Acknowledging the gains from a decade of reforms and extraordinary macroeconomic policies after the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), I will stress the need for policies to sustain the growth momentum in the face of many uncertainties and risks. </p><p>After my presentation, Claudio Borio, Head of the Monetary and Economic Department, and Hyun Shin, Economic Adviser and Head of Research, will elaborate on the special chapters. A stronger global economy ... Over the year in review, the economic expansion strengthened and broadened. Global growth rates were around their pre-crisis long-term averages, and the expansion took hold simultaneously across countries. The private sector was the main engine of growth, but fiscal expansion also helped in some countries. Unemployment continued to decline, reaching multi-decade lows in a number of economies. Overall, headline inflation rates moved closer to central bank objectives, although core inflation typically remained more subdued. Generally benign financial conditions supported the expansion. The slowdown in the first quarter of this year is mostly considered temporary. The near-term outlook is largely favourable. Growth is projected to remain high, at least by post-crisis standards. Unemployment is expected to fall further, testing notions of full employment. And investment should pick up, promising to boost productivity over time. Financial conditions remain in general quite supportive, despite some recent tightening, notably in emerging market economies. Moreover, although some countries will be under pressure to consolidate, fiscal expansion will provide additional near-term stimulus in quite a few others. It is now 10 years since the Great Financial Crisis, and I think that the central banking community should feel satisfied with the state of the global economy today. Much of this is the reward for a decade of supportive macroeconomic policies, aided by unconventional monetary policies. Thanks to central banks' concerted efforts and their accommodative stance, a repeat of the Great Depression was avoided. The historically low, even negative, interest rates and exceptionally large central bank balance sheets during the last decade have provided important support for the global economy and have contributed to the gradual convergence of inflation towards objectives. And major financial reforms - including the recently completed Basel III, a prime example of global cooperation - have strengthened the financial system. Yet, as central bankers, we should never be complacent. Our job comes with the responsibility to be diligent in identifying vulnerabilities and to act in consequence. Central banks were largely left to bear the burden of the recovery, since other policies, especially supply side structural ones, failed to take the baton. But this has left a legacy of swollen private and public sector balance sheets and higher debts - a legacy that shapes the road ahead. As the global economy reaches or even exceeds potential, it is time to take advantage of the favourable conditions. It is now time to put in place a more balanced policy mix to promote a sustainable expansion. However, the path ahead is a narrow one. ... but with risks ahead While in the short run there are only limited weaknesses globally - with financial strains in some emerging market economies a key exception - there are material risks ahead. The analysis in the Report highlights uncertainties that could undermine the momentum. Let me expand on a few. Financial conditions have overall been quite easy in the last few years, especially given the monetary policy normalisation under way and solid global growth. Term premia remain unusually low and credit spreads are very compressed, often close to or even below pre-GFC levels. There are signs of financial cycle-related imbalances in countries little affected by the crisis, following years of private credit growth. Many asset prices are very elevated, notably equity prices in some advanced economies. This includes high house prices in many countries, and highly leveraged households as a result. These patterns partly reflect a decade of unconventional monetary policies. The depreciating dollar in 2017 meant easier financial conditions around the world, especially in emerging market economies. As the Report documents, the loose financial conditions contributed to increased vulnerabilities. In previous episodes, such vulnerabilities have heralded a range of problems, including recessions. Indeed, the recent tightening of financial conditions, including the still very gradual and largely expected dollar appreciation, has already sparked some stresses. This is particularly visible for the most vulnerable emerging market economies - Argentina and Turkey. Other countries have also been affected, but to a lesser extent. While it is too early to tell whether the strains will remain contained or put more countries under pressure, portfolio investment has been flowing out of emerging market economies. As the Report notes, most banks' balance sheets have greatly improved and the adjustment to the new, Basel III requirements is basically complete. But improvements are not uniform. In some crisis-affected advanced economies, banks have not fully healed, and business models have not yet fully adapted to the new environment. As a result, some banks' market valuations remain below book value, and some banks' ratings are lower when assessed on a standalone basis, suggesting that relatively small shocks could easily erode confidence. In addition, in some advanced economies, concerns about fiscal sustainability have led to spikes in sovereign spreads, with widespread effects on bank valuations and financial markets more generally. With these and other vulnerabilities looming, a number of developments could threaten the economic expansion under way. One could be a further escalation of protectionist measures, undermining the open multilateral trading system which has laid the foundation for much of the global progress in improving living standards. Indeed, there are signs that the ratcheting-up of protectionist pressures has already weighed on investment. Another threatening development could be a sudden decompression of historically low bond yields, a \"snapback\", in core sovereign markets. A greater share of credit is now intermediated by non-banks, especially asset managers. This means interactions among agents become more complex, with consequences for asset prices and financial stability that can be harder to anticipate. As shown earlier this year, small events, including mild inflation surprises, can easily scare overstretched financial markets. Moreover, as asset management has become more global, international repercussions can quickly multiply. Another risk is a reversal in global risk appetite, possibly triggered by concerns about some sovereigns' debt sustainability, as happened recently in the euro area periphery. In contrast to the snapback scenario, this could usher in a further compression of term premia in those sovereign markets benefiting from the flight to safety, rather than a widening. Many of these risks have to be considered in the light of turning financial cycles in some economies and aggregate debt burdens, both public and private, that have continued to increase post-crisis. Turning financial cycles can carry the seeds of risk, including recessions. High public debt is obviously constraining fiscal policy. The economic upswing also still relies on extraordinary support from central banks. However, central banks may find it increasingly difficult to manage both financial stability and price stability objectives. Their room for manoeuvre is clearly more limited than before the Great Financial Crisis. Interest rates are significantly lower and central bank balance sheets much larger, making easing policies harder. This applies in different ways and degrees to both advanced and emerging market economies. Many of the latter have precious little room for policy mistakes. Policy challenges Policy actions today should encourage the establishment of frameworks that avoid the further build-up of risks, promote sustainable growth, and prepare economies to adapt to technological and other structural changes. This calls for policies that have long horizons and that take account of the various interlinkages. Fiscal policy must ensure that public finances are on a sustainable footing. Compared with pre-crisis, public sector debt in relation to GDP has increased further, leaving very limited space. In this context, the Report notes the dangers of higher debt service burdens as interest rates rise. With due regard for country-specific circumstances, fiscal consolidation over the medium term is a priority in most economies. Besides implementing agreed financial regulatory measures, maintaining and deepening financial reforms is still necessary. This means further strengthening the resilience of banking systems in both balance sheet and business model dimensions. It's also key to assess and tackle risks in non-banking sectors, including those related to liquidity mismatches and interactions that can lead to adverse effects. Structural policies have often been lacking during the last decade. Reforms should reinforce the ability of economies to absorb shocks and avoid a further build-up of imbalances. Moreover, they need to encourage workers, employers and consumers to adapt to ongoing structural changes, many triggered by technological advances. In the current political environment, maintaining an open trading system is one of the toughest tasks. But there is no greater need today than to defend the system that has fostered such enormous global gains. Monetary policy is also crucial when looking over a longer horizon. Monetary policy normalisation among advanced economies is essential in rebuilding policy space, with a focus on enhancing resilience to slow-building threats. This means responding to signs of inflation resurfacing, while not overreacting to moderate inflation shortfalls or transient bouts of volatility. This would create room for countercyclical policy, dilute the risk of financial vulnerabilities, and slow down debt accumulation. For some emerging market economies the adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance might be necessary sooner rather than later, given the likelihood of investors' portfolio adjustments in anticipation of tighter global financial conditions. For these countries, the presence of a congruent macro-financial framework will be of the essence in the period ahead. As highlighted in one special chapter of the Annual Economic Report, and as Claudio Borio will detail, the role of macroprudential frameworks in ensuring more resilience is now more widely recognised. Reaping the full benefits of this intellectual shift requires embedding an explicit macroprudential orientation to regulation and supervision into broader and more holistic macro-financial stability frameworks. Those must include monetary, fiscal and structural policies. Only such well constructed frameworks can help ensure financial and macroeconomic stability while boosting overall growth on a sustainable basis. In all of this, it is essential to consider the rapid changes that technological advances have brought about in financial services. As noted in the Report, these include not just fintech but, potentially more importantly, big tech - the foray of the big technology firms into financial services. The latter could erode valuations of incumbents and pose existential threats. We are just seeing the early signs, but we may well be at the cusp of a new paradigm. While there are many benefits from technological advances, including more efficient financial services, they also signify potential threats to the current monetary and financial system. Some of these new risks stem from the emergence of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies promise to replace trust in long-standing institutions, such as commercial and central banks, with trust in a new, fully decentralised system. Looking beyond the hype, the analysis in our second special chapter makes it clear that today's cryptocurrencies cannot deliver on these promises. They are impractical as a means of payment, offer a lot of scope for fraud, and entail enormous environmental costs. As the chapter highlights and Hyun Shin will explain, they also have many further economic shortcomings. They have a limited ability to satisfy the signature property of money as a coordination device and to ensure the finality of payments. The emergence of cryptocurrencies calls for global coordination to prevent abuses and to strictly limit interconnections with regulated financial institutions. The goal should be to ensure that cryptocurrencies cannot undermine the role of central banks as trusted stewards of monetary and financial stability. The decentralised technology of cryptocurrencies, however sophisticated and useful for many other purposes, is a poor substitute for the solid institutional backing of money through independent and accountable central banks. A four-part agenda Let me conclude with four goals for policy. First, secure the progress made over the last decade. Second, continue on the path of normalising monetary policy, and normalise gradually, with careful communication, while considering global spillovers and spillbacks. Third, maintain a long-term perspective and limit the build-up of imbalances as part of the design and implementation of holistic macro-financial stability frameworks. Finally, redouble efforts to implement structural reforms to strengthen the global economy's resilience and growth potential. In sum, we must seize the day. Addressing vulnerabilities is key to keeping the growth momentum on track. The stronger performance gives us a window to pursue necessary reforms and recalibrate policies. Let's not miss this opportunity. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN635110520180628</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SNK-V041-J9XT-P0F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 28, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Walter Hewlett, son of HP co-founder Bill Hewlett, misses the first day of the meeting to play cello with an orchestra at Bohemian Grove. On the second day, Hewlett reportedly says he opposes the deal because he doesn't like the prospects for the PC business.</p><p>Aug. 31: HP's board discusses the tentative merger agreement. Hewlett has reservations, but says HP attorney Larry Sonsini tells him that if board approval isn't unanimous, HP might have to pay more for Houston-based Compaq. Hewlett says Sonsini also advises him that he could still vote against the deal as a stockholder. (Sonsini disputes Hewlett's account.)</p><p>Sept. 3: Both companies' boards unanimously approve HP's proposed purchase of Compaq for HP stock initially valued at $25 billion. The combined technology company would have annual revenue of about $87.4 billion and 145,000 employees, trailing only IBM in size. The company says it will cut 15,000 jobs after the merger.</p><p>Sept. 4: Wall Street sends HP shares plunging 19 percent in a single day. Shortly thereafter, Hewlett hires lawyer Stephen Neal and others to advise him how to vote the approximately 100 million shares he controls through the Hewlett Trust. The Hewlett Foundation, which Hewlett co-chairs, also hires a financial adviser.</p><p>Nov. 6: Hewlett announces the Hewlett family and the foundation, which together control 5.2 percent of HP's stock, will vote against the deal. David Woodley Packard, the only son of HP co-founder Dave Packard, says he, too, will vote no with the 1.3 percent stake held by the Packard Humanities Institute. HP's shares soar 17 percent, their biggest one-day surge since the deal was announced.</p><p>Nov. 15: HP and Compaq file a proxy statement detailing their arguments for the deal.</p><p>Nov. 16: Hewlett tells regulators he intends to solicit shareholder votes against the deal. He also files a detailed financial analysis arguing that big tech mergers usually fail and predicting that revenue will drop sharply at the combined company.</p><p>Dec. 7: The board of the Packard Foundation, HP's largest shareholder with 10.4 percent of the vote, votes unanimously to oppose the deal. Among those voting \"no\" are three daughters of HP co-founder Dave Packard: Susan Packard Orr, Julie Packard and Nancy Packard Burnett.</p><p>Dec. 12: Richard Hackborn, an HP board member and supporter of the acquisition, resigns from the board of the Hewlett Foundation so that he no longer has a foot in both camps.</p><p>Dec. 19: HP launches a newspaper ad war that ultimately costs both sides millions of dollars. The first ad shows HP's original product, a 1938 oscillator, and asks, \"What if we had stopped here?\"</p><p>Dec. 27: Hewlett files a formal proxy statement and outlines a detailed financial case against the deal.</p><p>Jan. 3: The Hewlett Foundation admits that it sold 5.5 million shares of HP stock in late 2001, effectively giving away votes that its chairman, Walter Hewlett, was trying to solicit.</p><p>Jan. 7: The fight gets nasty. In an open letter, HP's other directors question Hewlett's integrity, motives and actions as a board member.</p><p>Jan. 14: HP and Compaq disclose that they will pay $579 million in retention bonuses to 6,000 mid-level employees over the next two years if they stay through the merger. Top executives will get an additional $55.5 million.</p><p>Jan. 16: Compaq beats analysts' expectations for fourth-quarter sales and profit, suggesting it is emerging from an industry slump.</p><p>Jan. 18: In a letter to shareholders, HP board members slam Hewlett as \"a musician and academic\" with little business experience. \"The problem isn't just that he is saying 'no' to the merger -- he's giving us nothing to say 'yes' to,\" they say.</p><p>Jan. 22: Alliance Capital Management says it will vote its 1.1 percent stake in favor of the deal, the first large shareholder to publicly endorse management.</p><p>Jan. 23: David Woodley Packard says Fiorina has misappropriated his father's image and words to promote the deal, and he lashes back at the \"professional marketer\" with his own $150,000 ad in the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Jan. 31: European Commission antitrust officials approve the deal.</p><p>Feb. 5: HP sets March 19 for the shareholder vote on the deal, with Compaq's vote the next day. Both sides begin to aggressively court shareholders.</p><p>Feb. 13: HP dazzles Wall Street with stellar first-quarter earnings. In response to an analyst question, Fiorina denies she \"goosed the numbers\" to impress investors before the vote.</p><p>Feb. 19: Criticized for offering no alternative to the deal, Hewlett offers a strategy he calls \"Focus and Execute.\" He argues that HP should play to its existing strengths, such as printers, rather than strive to become a market leader in all fields. He says he expects Fiorina to leave HP if the deal is defeated.</p><p>Feb. 20: Packard releases a Field poll he commissioned showing that HP employees in Corvallis, Ore., oppose the deal by a 2-1 ratio. Polls of employees in Boise, Idaho, and Fort Collins, Colo., produce similar results. HP says its own polls show employees favor the deal by a 2-1 ratio.</p><p>Feb. 26: Hewlett chides HP's board for failing to tell shareholders about draft contracts for Fiorina and Compaq Computer CEO Michael Capellas that call for paying them $115 million over two years. HP says the packages were never formally adopted.</p><p>Feb. 27: HP executives tout the deal to analysts and investors in New York. Meanwhile, Hewlett says that if the acquisition is defeated, HP should appoint an interim CEO and add new board members. Fiorina's predecessor, Lew Platt, is the leading candidate for interim CEO. Platt declines to comment, but sources say Platt has been approached about the job.</p><p>March 5: Institutional Shareholder Services, a key adviser to many large stockholders, endorses the merger, saying management has laid out realistic, achievable goals. But ISS also praises Hewlett's role as a \"meaningful outside voice\" and recommends that a family member stay on the board as a watchdog.</p><p>March 6: Antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission sign off on the deal.</p><p>March 8: The California Public Employees' Retirement System, an influential pension fund, says it</p><p>will vote its 0.39 percent stake</p><p>against the deal.</p><p>March 11: Both sides claim they have support from a majority of shareholders, but analysts say the outcome is too close to call.</p><p>Tuesday: HP shareholders vote on the deal at Flint Center in Cupertino.</p><p>Wednesday: Compaq shareholders vote on the deal in Houston.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-0F251ADE3A20C35F</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">San Jose Mercur KRDi</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:45CC-D690-018X-W1X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1107\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>San Jose Mercury News (California)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 San Jose Mercury News\u00a0 All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>March 17, 2002 Sunday MO1 EDITION</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>HEWLETT FOUNDATION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>HPQ (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

But Trump also adds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some increases in regulation remain inevitable, and the spending state propels that as well. A president is limited in any ability to unilaterally roll back much of the administrative state. For example, the Trump administration's making peace with the Affordable Care Act now seems near-inevitable given the grinding machinery of the administrative state, driven by massive, sweeping legislation that delegates enormous power to agencies.147 This ratcheting upward of federal administration, with rare retrenchment, is endemic of institutionalized social-policy fiscal spending and regulation, the cost of which is rarely measured beyond the purely budgetary element.</p><p>On the flipside of Trump's regulatory savings, Trump sports regulatory impulses of his own that could derail or even eclipse the rollback agenda not just in 2020 but for years beyond.148 Not every Trump executive order has reduced regulatory intervention; some open the door to it. Trump's proclivity for trade restrictions and his ad hoc zeal for antitrust and media regulation (such as swipes at Amazon and the ATandTTime Warner merger) are well known.149 There are additional less well-known warning signs of regulatory initiatives that have emerged or heightened during the Trump tenure, such as the president's approval of a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund,150 and his boasting of \"the largest public lands package in a decade, designating 1.3 million acres ... of new wilderness\" for a federal government that already owns a large portion of the continent.151</p><p>In the worst caseone-in, two-out and net-zero \"regulatory budget\" notwithstandingTrump could be adding more than he is subtracting in terms of the broader federal administrative state interventionist dynamic. And just as some of the relaxation of regulatory action does not show up in the Federal Register, many of the interventions now in play may not show up immediately or lend themselves to measurability.</p><p>Notably, on October 17, 2018, the day the 2018 fiscal year two-for-one update was released, Trump held an Oval Office meeting on regulations and the economy with several industry-specific workers and cabinet officials during which he said: \"We've removed more regulations, and we will continue to get rid of regulations.\" But then, in a littlenoted remark at the time, Trump said, \"I think within a period of about another year, we will have just about everything that we've wanted.\"152 Yet, there remains plenty to be done regarding comprehensive regulatory reform, especially given the administrative state's propensity to grow and its built-in defenses against retrenchment.</p><p>Among the bigger complications for the Trump streamlining agenda is the fact that one cannot get rid of regulations; one can generally at best replace a rule with another rule.153 As former OIRA Administrator Susan Dudley pointed out:</p><p>For significant regulations, agencies must develop a legal and factual record to support the action, engage in interagency review led by OMB, seek public comment on the revisions, and justify the final action with information in the record.154</p><p>This does not give any president much time in the face of a patient careerist-dominated administrative state, yet there is much on the books that may only be addressed in this fashion when Congress sits idly by. But more important, Trump's own regulatory impulses have become the most pertinent concern, particularly where he exhibits substantial agreement with regulatory advocates on issues such as antitrust policy, regulatory action against tech firms and traditional media companies, and industrial and social policy.155 What follows are areas where the administration has added regulation or aggressively signaled support for intervention. This section will conclude with observations about rules with ambiguous effect and the complexities those present in streamlining bureaucracy.</p><p>Antitrust. On the one hand, the Trump administration has taken steps to cut merger review times overall and to speed up bank merger approvals via internal streamlining at the Federal Reserve and Comptroller of the Currency.156 But on the other hand, President Trump has casually invoked antitrust action against some tech and telecom firms, striking a discordant note with his deregulatory agenda. A hint occurred when candidate Trump proclaimed, \"ATandT is buying Time Warner, a deal that we will not approve in my administration ... because it is too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. ... We will look at breaking that deal up and other deals like it.\"157 The Justice Department's attempt to block the merger ultimately failed.158 Similarly, Trump tweeted in 2018 that Comcast may be violating antitrust laws.159 However, after mulling it over (such delay of transactions is itself a regulatory cost), the Justice Department did not investigate the Comcast-NBCUniversal alliance.160 Further, the president has said that Google, Facebook, and Amazon may be in a \"very antitrust situation,\"161 and said he was \"in charge\" and \"looking at it,\"162 in an environment in which politicians and pundits across the political spectrum have called for the breakup of those companies.163</p><p>In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a \"technology task force\" to assess tech sector \"antitrust\" violations and increase scrutiny of acquisitions beyond current practice.164 In the wake of that, and in contrast to the administration's recognition of the misuse of guidance elsewhere, the FTC is now in the process of drafting guidance on how the antitrust laws apply to the technology sector and defending its own role in policing it.165</p><p>In other antitrust developments, the FTC is pondering an injunction against Facebook's procedures for interoperability across platforms.166 The FTC is also in the early stages of investigating Amazon, having started interviews in 2019 with businesses that sell on the site.167 Other signals point to a potentially expanding Trump administration antitrust agenda by the Department of Justice and FTC beyond big Internet firms.168 The FTC, for example, is challenging an acquisition transaction in DNA sequencing.169</p><p>Hospital and pharmaceutical price transparency mandates and price controls. Reform legislation affecting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), known as \"right to try,\" has expanded the public's access to certain needed medications.170 On the other hand, the administration has energized pursuit of antitrust-related campaigns related to long-dormant issues like price fixing. The Trump administration in 2018 rattled the pharmaceutical industry with charges that companies were \"getting away with murder\" and voicing support of government drugprice negotiation.171 The administration that year introduced a regulatory proposal to require pharmaceutical price-listing mandates in television advertisements.172 A federal judge blocked the subsequent rule from the Department of Health and Human Services.173 Demonstrating Trump's own contention that regulation drags down markets, the drugmakers' shares rose upon the blocking of the rule.174</p><p>We have not likely seen the end of such campaigns. Some Republicans in the U.S. Senate proposed not just transparency but controls on prices (tying them to lower prices charged in some other nations), in an attack on \"big pharma companies,\"175 which would affect availability and medication research and innovation.176 The president is reported to support the idea as well, in the wake of the judicial rejection of compelled TV ad listings.177</p><p>The president also issued an executive order in mid-2019 on hospital price transparency that, while it expanded Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts, included negotiated rates for services and shoppable items.178 This presaged finalization of a rule in November 2019 about which the president boasted, \"Under the new price transparency rule ... hospitals will soon be required to publish the price of everything from individual medical supplies to the total cost of common procedures.\"179 Today, little of the nation's medical sector remains unsupervised by the federal government.</p><p>Speech, social media, and tech regulation. Trump and many on the left agree on regulation of social media search and speech, although each camp has its own reasons.180 When Trump's economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow was asked in the summer of 2018 about the administration's openness to regulating Google search results, he responded, \"We'll let you know. ... We're taking a look at it.\"181 Google is a private entity, and the search results it offers up represent free speech of Google's own. Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other private platforms cannot censor; only governments can do that.182</p><p>Yet Trump has tweeted extensively about media censorship,183 and not just social media censorship. At one point candidate Trump even threatened NBC's broadcast license,184 and in June 2018 called for a boycott of ATandT over CNN's coverage of himself.185 Candidate Trump in 2016 proclaimed at a rally, \"I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.\"186 Trump reaffirmed that sentiment at a January 2018 cabinet meeting, telling reporters, \"We are going to take a strong look at our country's libel laws.\"187</p><p>Asked at a November 7, 2018, press conference if he would regulate social media companies, Trump acknowledged that \"when you start regulating, a lot of bad things can happen.\" Nonetheless he said, \"I would do that. Yeah. I would look at that very seriously.</p><p>I think it's a serious problem. At the same time, you start getting into speech; that's a very dangerous problem. That could be the beginning. So it's very dangerous. ... But I would certainly talk to the Democrats if they want to do that. And I think they do want to do that.\"188 In the wake of a June 2019 Fox Business interview Trump attacked tech giants like Google and Facebook for \"bias ... toward Democrats\" and \"hatred\" for Republicans and said legislation may be warranted, and that they \"should be sued.\"189 And in June 2019 Trump said he was \"all in\" for a \"no brainer\" constitutional amendment proposed by Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) to ban burning of the American flag.190</p><p>In May 2019 the administration set up a tattletale Tech Bias Story Sharing Tool (since discontinued) for members of the public to report to the White House allegations of online bias and censorship, such as account suspension or termination.191 That was followed by a July 11, 2019, White House Social Media Summit featuring a number of right-of-center personalities.192 In a Tweet showcasing the event, the president asserted, \"Today, I am directing my Administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect the free speech rights of ALL AMERICANS. We hope to see more transparency, more accountability, and more FREEDOM!\"193</p><p>The White House also appears to be considering an executive order to combat alleged anti-conservative social media bias.194 This move would complement other moves by conservatives, potentially working with progressives, to change the regulatory environment of social media and big tech and its accountability for user-generated content.</p><p>The result of that would likely backfire on conservatives by making bias real rather than imaginary or exaggerated.195</p><p>Tech regulation. The regulatory apparatus aimed at social media goes beyond marketpower and speech concerns. In July 2019, the Federal Trade Commission approved</p><p>a record-level fine against Facebook for alleged privacy violations involving consulting firm Cambridge Analytica gaining improper access to user data.196 The agreement could result in very close regulatory supervision of the company's moves henceforth.197</p><p>Another major but much smaller privacy settlement is that of the FTC with YouTube over the service's collecting children's information without parents' consent. Illegal behavior and violation of contract need to be addressed, but overzealous responses can backfire as well as affect firms that have not misbehaved. As former FTC chief technologist Neil Chilson noted on Twitter, \"The FTC has shifted in a way that will require platforms to police user-generated content more heavily. This is an incremental change for big platforms who already have large staffs to review content; it is a much bigger deal for small players.\"198</p><p>Alongside antitrust, social media \"censorship,\" and privacy-related incursions, other escapades illustrate the many ways policy makers, even in a deregulatory Trump administration, will seek openings to creatively expand power.</p><p>In a rerun of a contentious move that happens periodically, some high-level security officials in the Trump administration are seeking to bar encryption that law enforcement cannot circumvent.199</p><p>The FTC has discussed in hearings concerns with algorithms that share user data in behind-the-scenes \"auctions\" that influence the advertisements viewers see.200</p><p>The FTC hosted a workshop to \"examine consumer protection issues related to video game 'loot boxes,' in-game rewards players can buy while playing a video game.\" Sharing sentiments with and mirroring pursuits of some legislators who wish to treat video gaming as an \"addiction\" and elevate governmentas-parent in response, one panel examined \"potential social, psychological, and economic motivations associated with loot box spending,\" while another focused \"on current initiatives for disclosing in\"game micro-transactions and explore ideas for other mechanisms that may enhance consumer protection.\"201</p><p>Online taxes. Taxes influence behavior and are regulatory, and the tech sector is naturally a target in that regard. When the Internet sales tax was upheld in the 2018 Supreme Court case South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,202 the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Jessica Melugin observed that \"the U.S. Supreme Court reversed 50 years of precedent by allowing states to collect sales taxes from businesses located completely outside that states' borders.\"203 While the ruling was by no means any of Trump's doing, the president had seemed to favor an Internet tax, perversely seeing it as a shot at Amazon, despite that company's being one of the online sales tax's most high-profile proponents.204 On the international stage, French President Emmanuel Macron proclaimed on Twitter, \"Some digital players pay very little tax. This is an injustice that destroys jobs. @realDonaldTrump and I have just agreed to work together on an agreement at the @OECD level to modernize international tax rules.\"205</p><p>Bipartisan large-scale infrastructure spending with regulatory effects. Too often, the only bipartisanship found in Washington is in passing big spending bills, as both parties show an inclination toward spending stimulus in the form of infrastructure.206 Proposed spending levels have called for $1 trillion in direct federal spending, with plenty of regulatory set-asides and stipulations.207 Heavy government spending in economic quarters will always have regulatory effects and alter the trajectory of industries engaged in large-scale transactions. At this writing, it is too early to tell the regulatory effects of the $2 trillion-plus COVID-19 relief legislation, though those should be apparent by the time of the 2021 edition of this report.</p><p>Trump has engaged in a number of significant executive actions to liberalize infrastructure permitting and expansion.208 Ominous, though now perhaps off the table following the impeachment episode, was talk of a potential arrangement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) of some form of major federal infrastructure spending package.209</p><p>At the FCC, the infrastructure subsidy/ welfare Rural Digital Opportunity Fund intends to spend tens of billions of dollars to bring old-school telephony subsidies to the modern age, with new mapping approaches to expand it in the future.210 At one point, Trump championed the enlistment of eminent domain to contribute to building a wall on the southern border with Mexico, invoking the potential use of a \"military version\" of an already awesome power.211</p><p>Trade restrictions. President Trump once referred to himself as \"Tariff Man.\"212 Trade wars do not work because tariffs hurt Americans.213 Barriers create direct costs, regulatory uncertainty, and market losseslikely greater than Trump's regulatory savings. In a study of the Trump administration's trade policy on prices and welfare, the Londonbased Centre for Economic Policy Research found that the \"full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"214</p><p>If one were to assume this trade barrier cost burden commenced in December 2018 and stayed constant, Trump's claimed regulatory savings of $51 billion to date would be eclipsed in about three years. One interpretation maintains that the trade war tariffs wipe out the typical household's savings from the tax reform package enacted under Trump.215 Resolution with China can resolve the pain of the trade war hammer.216</p><p>In a notable fusion of trade restrictions and infrastructure spending, Trump also issued a January 2019 executive order on \"Strengthening Buy-American Preferences for Infrastructure Projects.\"217 That was followed in summer 2019 by an order on \"Maximizing Use of American-Made Goods, Products, and Materials\" in federal contracting.218 A fixation on reciprocity in trade deals can increase costs of household-level imports like e-commerce purchases by ejecting de minimis exemptions.219</p><p>Anecdotes of trade harm also abound. The tariffs that were to boost the steel industry are claimed to have not had their desired effect.220 Other unanticipated effects include craft distillers canceling plans to export to Europe,221 calls for helping Maine's lobster industry suffering from the trade war,222 and the oddity of reparative payments to farmers damaged by the trade war.223 Harm to farmers increased in 2019,224 compounded by the bulk of restorative aid said to unfairly benefit the largest farmers.225 Yet Trump sees nothing amiss in the latter, no problem that reparations cannot handle, upping the ante in January 2020, proclaiming of a spending package, \"We're signing a monster. A big, beautiful monster. Forty to fifty billion dollars to our farmers. ... I keep saying go buy larger tractors.\"226 Even the resulting dispute resolutions can result in overly managed, backward-looking trade.227</p><p>Frontier sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI) innovation, are vulnerable to trade restrictions as well. For example, Adam Thierer and Jennifer Huddleston of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia noted, with respect to the Trump administration's pondering of a \"potentially massive expansion of export restrictions on a wide variety of technologies,\" that more \"than a dozen different AI or autonomous system technologies appear on the list for consideration.\"228</p><p>Added features of the trade war with China included Trump's call for companies to leave China altogether and for importers to police drug trafficking.229 Shares of UPS, Amazon, and FedEx fell after Trump tweeted, \"I am ordering all carriers, including Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS and the Post Office, to SEARCH FOR and REFUSE ... all deliveries of Fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!).\"230</p><p>Farm bill and agriculture. Many interventionist policies move along with a life of their own, but some deserve to be called out as overly regulatory when accentuated.</p><p>The $860 billion farm bill, signed December 2018, was a prominent example. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a former Republican now independent, characterized it appropriately in May 2018, tweeting, \"This farm bill is loaded with corporate welfare and subsidies. It's a big-government, anti-market swamp creature that puts special interests ahead of the American people. Every conservative should oppose it.\"231 Trump, however, saw things differently: \"[T]he House will vote on a strong Farm Bill ... We must support our Nation's great farmers!\"232</p><p>Stealth regulatory measures or requirements can also accompany ostensibly deregulatory ones. University of Pennsylvania Law Professor Cary Coglianese noted that when the \"USDA [United States Department of Agriculture] lifted its import ban on pitahaya fruit,\" it also \"imposed a regulatory regimen on production sites, calling for work plans, inspections, and various pest management techniques.\"233 That USDA move highlighted the reality that rules operate beyond presidential control as elements of regimes moving on autopilot. One example was a proposed bioengineered food disclosure requirement,234 which, according to Henry I. Miller of the Hoover Institution and University of Oklahoma Law Professor Drew L. Kershen, \"may be the worst regulation,\" costing hundreds of millions annually with no benefits.235</p><p>Subsidies with regulatory effect. Government spending has often disregarded regulatory effects, such as the displacement of private action by steering toward government-chosen ends, and by creating marketplace distortions. This can come from unexpected quarters; the EPA, for its part, considered subsidies for \"talking car\" technologies to communicate hazard and other information.236 As a general matter, subsidies or corporate welfare aggravate problems of a president being able to, as Rep. Amash put it, \"act as a central planner in chief to bribe and coerce companies.\"237 The president has expressed support of the Export-Import Bank,238 long deemed a showcase for cronyism and corporate welfare.239</p><p>Trump also supports ethanol subsidies, even warning (while in campaign mode in October 2018) that Democrats would be anti-ethanol.240 And the EPA issued a rule in 2019 boosting the amount of ethanol allowed in gasoline blends during summer months.241 If that were not enough, Trump set about reassuring farmers in mid-2019 nervous about his commitment to ethanol: \"Farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for Ethanol. ... It will be a giant package, get ready! At the same time I was able to save the small refineries from certain closing. Great for all!\"242</p><p>Telecommunications. The FCC's approach has been deregulatory, as noted, but a long legacy of the top-down control of the \"expert\" administrative state leaves only new regulation and law to cope with mundane matterslike caller ID spoofing or robocallingwith inordinate fines that competitive markets might have put to rest ages ago.243 That makes it hard to keep regulators away from more momentous concerns in any sector. But other aberrations have come from above. Early in the Trump administration, there were growing calls to build a nationalized 5G network.244 That elicited a response letter to the administration from U.S. Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV)245 and introduction of anti-nationalization legislation in the 116th Congress.246 Proposals such as these would have substantial unmeasured longterm effects, such as the compounded costs of delays of cellular technology and induced airwave scarcity.247</p><p>A June 2019 executive order, \"Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain,\" aims at preventing foreign adversaries' use or acquisition of \"any information and communications technology or service.\"248 This has now been elevated to a proposed rule from the Commerce Department249 that appears to arrogate an alarming degree of unilateral power to interfere with or block foreign transactions with entities controlled or influenced by whomever the administration declares to be an \"adversary.\"250 While Commerce \"invites comments,\" it informs us in no uncertain terms that \"the determination of a 'foreign adversary' for purposes of implementing the Executive order is a matter of executive branch discretion and will be made by the Secretary.\"251</p><p>Personal liberties: health-tracking, vaping, supplements, anti-privacy, and firearms. While on the one hand, the FDA is said to be approving drugs at greater speed (which is a cause of concern for some), it is currently engaged in numerous regulatory or potentially regulatory pursuits beyond the Department of Health and Human Services' hospital and drug disclosure/pricing regulations.252 FDA guidance aims to clarify when the agency would regulate health-tracking apps and software as medical devices.253 It is already regulating (\"approving\") robotic exosuits for rehabilitation.254</p><p>The agency also spent energy on regulations on vaping and smokeless tobacco products, which, as an alternative to cigarettes, save lives.255 The president stopped the push for a ban of all flavored e-cigarettes, but tight deadlines for e-cigarette makers are in place for filing pre-market tobacco applications.256 And in December 2019, as part of the larger defense spending bill, Trump signed into law a ban on the sale of vaping products to those under age 21.257 In another tobacco-related move challenged on free speech grounds, the FDA sought in 2019 to mandate graphic, photorealistic images on cigarette packages, in addition to the traditional Surgeon General warning.258</p><p>The FDA has also been considering costly and unhelpful labeling regulation for nondairy products that use the term \"milk.\"259 The administration continued to implement Obama-era menu-labeling rules.260 The FDA is also continuing strengthening enforcement of regulation of dietary supplements.261 In one campaign, the FDA is warning companies, while not banning the herb, to stop selling kratom as treatment for opioid addition or cancer.262</p><p>New postal regulations aimed at addressing the opioid abuse issue require providing identifying information and contents on international shipments.263 On the surveillance or threat-to-privacy front, the White House, in a response to gun violence, has begun to explore tracking the mentally ill or those suspected of being so via their wearable devices (like the health monitoring ones the FDA would enjoy regulating) and smartphones.264 The Department of Homeland Security, already now one of the more costly agencies, is preparing regulation requiring biometric face scans of all travelers, including U.S. citizens, entering or leaving the country.265 Finally, in a move controversial to his base, Trump moved to ban bump stocks used on semiautomatic weapons by designating them as machine guns.266</p><p>Finance. Along with favorable executive actions, the Trump administration signed legislation such as rolling back financial regulatory excesses of the Dodd-Frank law said to overburden smaller institutions,267 and, as part of a spending package for the 2020 fiscal year, the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act, which changes rules of inherited retirement plans and allows small businesses to band together to offer retirement plans, and allows part-timer participation in employer retirement plans.268 Other steps toward liberalization included, for example, policies from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (alas, now a fixture) allowing for easing test experimentation for certain financial products and the streamlining of consumer disclosures.269</p><p>But as in other sectors, the administration has exhibited regulatory impulses of its own in the financial arena, particularly with respect to newfangled offerings enabled by technology and the Internet that threaten incumbents and the vast financial regulatory superstructure. Prominent are efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies, and for the establishment of government-run real-time payment systems.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission deems digital currency products, such as Facebook's Libra, to be \"securities\" in a bid to claim jurisdiction over them, which would saddle cryptocurrency developers with new layers of red tape.270 Companies failing to register their \"tokens\" are being targeted with restraining orders by the SEC.271 Yet, the SEC has no legal jurisdiction over most crypto and tokens; its assertions and actions to the contrary constitute a power grab.272 While Democratic members of Congress have proposed barring big tech's digital currencies, Trump administration officials seek a clampdown.273 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin calls crypto a \"national security\" issue and said digital currency providers must</p><p>be regulated and not be operated in the shadows.274 Likewise, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified in the Senate that Facebook's Libra \"raises serious concerns\" and \"cannot go forward\" without satisfying government regarding money laundering and other concerns, and told senators that Fed oversight was \"an interesting idea.\"275 In a three-part Twitter thread, the president himself express his great distaste for crypto, that he is \"not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money,\" that they are \"highly volatile\" and will have \"little standing or dependability.\" He continued that if tech firms want to \"become a bank,\" they must seek charters and become subject to all \"Banking Regulations.\"276 And naturally, if you have income from cryptocurrencies, the IRS expects to hear from you.277</p><p>The same Federal Reserve that wants to regulate crypto also proposes to directly compete with private banks' processes of confirming and completing financial transactions.278 In its enthusiasm to implement its \"FedNow\" scheme, the Fed is skirting laws like the Congressional Review Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act.279 As Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute put it, this is an agency that already has too much to do and should leave the payments system to the private sector.280</p><p>There is more. The Treasury Department has contemplated regulations on foreign equity stakes in U.S. biotech firms to subject those firms to greater review.281 Troubling also, especially in light of the new talk of digital taxes, is the reported potential support in the administration for a \"global minimum tax\" in the name of tax harmonization.282</p><p>Industrial policy or market socialist mechanisms. Overabundant taxpayer funding of scientific and technology research is incompatible with a future of lightly regulated science and technology specifically, and with limited government generally.283 Neither major political party takes that view, in today's rule-of-experts, send-tax-dollars-home America. Addressing infrastructure and other broad initiatives in his February 5, 2019, State of the Union address, for example, the president called for legislation \"including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future\" and proclaimed, \"This is not an option, this is a necessity.\"284 Along with the regulatory effects of strings attached of such spending, it is not proper for the sciences and their practical applications to proceed walled off from one another in an arbitrary legislative appropriations environment.</p><p>Artificial intelligence serves as a warning. A February 11, 2019, executive order, \"Maintaining American Leadership on Artificial Intelligence,\" established the \"AI Initiative,\" which was followed by the March 19, 2019, launch of the federal hub AI.gov (now whitehouse.gov/ai). Executive orders are not law, but they can influence policy, and this one promotes \"sustained investment in AI RandD [research and development] in collaboration with industry, academia,\" and others. It also calls for federal collection of data, among other centrally coordinated moves. The orders states: \"Actions shall be implemented by agencies that conduct foundational AI RandD, develop and deploy applications of AI technologies, provide educational grants, and regulate and provide guidance for applications of AI technologies.\"285</p><p>This \"federalization\" is concerning on its own, but it occurs in an environment in which much federal AI research happens at the Department of Defense. The Pentagon, on the day after Trump's AI executive order, released its own AI strategy, describing use, plans, and ethical standards in deployment.286 Where is a definition of AI codified in federal statute? In the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.287 Alas, when it comes to robotics and military, Isaac Asimov's famous Laws of Robotics (devised to protect humans) are programmed out, not in. This makes fusion of government and private AI deployment troubling. Where one tech titan's motto had been \"Don't Be Evil,\" a fitting admonition now for the AI sector is \"Don't Be Government.\"</p><p>The most recent development is OMB's Guidance for Regulation of Artificial Intelligence Applications.288 The January 2020 document strikes the right tone. It aims at engaging the public and forbearance, limiting regulatory overreach, eliminating duplication and redundancy across agencies, improving access to government data and models, recognizing that one size regulatory shoe does not fit all, using performancebased objectives rather than rigid rules, while avoiding over-precaution.289 Michael Kratsios, chief technology officer of the tory principles to govern AI development in the private sector\" to \"address the challenging technical and ethical questions that AI can create.\"290</p><p>The guidance states: \"When considering regulations or policies related to AI applications, agencies should continue to promote advancements in technology and innovation, while protecting American technology, economic and national security, privacy, civil liberties, and other American values, including the principles of freedom, human rights, the rule of law.\"291 The guidance mentions \"American values\" five times, without recognizing the degree of incompatibility of the administrative state with those values, and the extent the bureaucracy has an opposite vision of \"rule of law.\"</p><p>As such, the guidance contains numerous exploitable elements. The guidance correctly states: \"The deployment of AI holds the promise to improve safety, fairness, welfare, transparency, and other social goals, and America's maintenance of its status as a global leader in AI development is vital to preserving our economic and national security.\" On the other hand, it says \"AI applications could pose risks to privacy, individual rights, autonomy, and civil liberties that must be carefully assessed and appropriately addressed.\"292 But governments, not competitive free enterprise, are the primary threat to these values.</p><p>Agencies not only want to get in on the game, they have been invited. In evaluating \"benefits and costs\" of regulatory alternatives, agencies are to evaluate \"impacts to equity, human dignity, fairness, potential distributive impacts, privacy and civil liberties, and personal freedom.\"293 These favor agency governmental proclivities, not the competitive process and nongovernmental resolutions of the difficult issues that will naturally arise. Agencies always answer the question, \"is there call for regulation,\" in the affirmative. The guidance invites agencies to \"consider whether a change in regulatory policy is needed due to the adoption of AI applications in an already regulated industry, or due to the development of substantially new industries facilitated by AI.\"294 Regulating the latter, as a blank canvas, will prove irresistible.</p><p>The notion that industry likes regulation that disadvantages rivals is generally true of AI regulation specifically: \"Companies cannot just build new technology and let market forces decide how it will be used,\" says one leading tech CEO.295 While companies may not like the kind or regulation that makes them ask Mother-may-I, established players, especially given the government contracting and military head-start presence in AI, will appreciate federal approaches that forestall those with a different idea. Here are a few additional concerns with the guidance at this stage.</p><p>The first item in the \"Template for cumbents at the expense of new market entrants, competitors, or up-stream or down-stream business partners.\"298</p><p>The guidance invites social policy regulation: \"AI applications have the potential of reducing present-day discrimination caused by human subjectivity.\"299 On the other hand, it invites political predation in the form of social policy regulation: \"When considering regulations or non-regulatory approaches related to AI applications, agencies should consider ... issues of fairness and non-discrimination with respect to outcomes and decisions produced by the AI application at issue.\"300 Further, \"there is a risk that AI's pursuit of its defined goals may diverge from the underlying or original human intent and cause unintended consequencesincluding those that negatively impact privacy, civil rights, Agency Plans\" invites agencies to establish \"Statutory Authorities Directing or Authorizing Agency Regulation of AI Applications\" and instructs them to \"List and describe any statutes that direct or authorize your agency to issue regulations specifically on the development and use of AI applications.\"296 No definition of AI existed at the time such \"predicates\" came to be, and this request for statutory rationales for future intervention will be stretched to justify regulation. The guidance fails to engage Congress or recognize its primacy, and does not call on agencies to consult with Congress for clarity.297</p><p>The guidance invokes executive orders, OMB guidance, pursuits like maximizing net benefits, and \"regulatory impact analyses\" as restraints on excessive AI regulation, but these tools have not been able to either restrain or facilitate regulatory streamlining, much less a hands-off approach. On the contrary, they are apt to be used to reinforce rather than resist calls for regulation.</p><p>The guidance invites expansion of antitrust regulation: \"Agencies should also consider that an AI application could be deployed in a manner that yields anticompetitive effects that favor incivil liberties, confidentiality, security, and safety.\"301</p><p>The OMB directive may create vulnerability to the very guidance documents that the administration is seeking to restrain elsewhere. In the noted call for a premature inventory of sector-specific statutory authority, agencies are invited to use their conclusions regarding their authority \"to issue non-regulatory policy statements, guidance, or testing and deployment frameworks.\"</p><p>Relatedly, there may be opportunities for gaming of the system and rent-seeking in well-meaning attempts to \"allow pilot programs that provide safe harbors\" and the systematization of \"collaboration with industry, such as development of playbooks and voluntary incentive frameworks.\"302 The White House has invited \"Federal engagement in the development of technical standards and related tools in support of reliable, robust, and trustworthy systems that use AI technologies.\" Furthermore, it states: \"Federal engagement with the private sector on the development of voluntary consensus standards will help agencies develop expertise in AI and identify practical standards for use in regulation.\"303 Such \"voluntary consensus standards\" will only be favored by some, not all, firms and entrepreneurs.</p><p>Sometimes there is misdiagnosis of the source of problems. The OMB guidance calls on agencies to \"encourage the consideration of safety and security issues throughout the AI design, development, deployment, and operation process.\"304 But the government is more prone to undermine encryption used in private sector applications, and, especially given government's heavy \"collaborative\" role, indemnify winner companies when things go wrong. The guidance also stretches the bounds of the possible. It acknowledges that \"current technical challenges in creating interpretable AI can make it difficult for agencies to ensure a level of transparency necessary for humans to understand the decision-making of AI applications.\"305 Agencies cannot do this; no one can. It is the nature of black box machine learning.</p><p>The administration's AI proclamations belong in the regulatory rather than the deregulatory camp, so it is good that \"strong\" AI (the potentially sentient, self-improving version) is ostensibly not addressed. Republicans and Democrats alike seek major government funding of science generally, including a proposal to appoint a \"manufacturing czar.\"306 Internationally, governments are moving toward regulation, along with the U.S.307</p><p>This state of affairs is not particularly the fault of policy makers within the White House, but is more likely due to the lack of a constituency for a hands-off approach. Unfortunately, in part due to Trump's order and subsequent guidance, we can confidently predict that future presidents will expand cozy government alliances with a subset of private sector winners, perhaps even promote a sort of cartelization. The legitimization of this concept at the top by an ostensibly deregulation-oriented president will make it harder to achieve regulatory liberalization and any \"separation of technology\" and state in the future.</p><p>The establishment of a \"Space Force,\" enacted in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020,308 presents the same lock-in, given that commercial space activities have barely taken root beyond NASA contractors and partners.309 Making the AI-driven force a sixth branch of the armed forces is bound to alter freedoms and commercial space activities, heavily influencing technology investment in a sector that barely exists yet.310 The space force move had already been preceded by a presidential directive on space traffic management complete with tracking, cataloging, and data sharing with government.311 It is worth remembering that most debris in space used to justify calls for regulation is there thanks to NASA, not private entrepreneurs.312 \"Normalizing\" commercial space activities for a \"diverse portfolio of actors and approaches\" is not compatible with heavy regulation.313</p><p>In a similar vein, an October 2019 executive order established a new President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology that declares:</p><p>Through collaborative partnerships across the American science and technology enterprise, which includes an unmatched constellation of public and private educational institutions, research laboratories, corporations, and foundations, the United States can usher extraordinary new technologies into homes, hospitals, and highways across the world. These technologies would have American values at their core. By strengthening the ties that connect government, industry, and academia, my Administration will champion a new era of American research and innovation, which will give rise to new discoveries that create the industries of the future.\"314</p><p>This appeared in the wake of Executive Order 13885, \"Establishing the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee,\"315 aimed at implementing the 2018 National Quantum Initiative Act in its purpose of \"supporting research, development, demonstration, and application of quantum information science and technology.\"316</p><p>Welfare and labor regulations. We noted earlier the propensity for federal government involvement in job training. In the Trump administration, a \"national strategy for training and retraining workers for high-demand industries\" is in play, spearheaded by Ivanka Trump.317 In other labor regulation, the president also signed into law as part of the same defense compilation the Fair Chance Act, which bars government and contractors from inquiring into job applicants' criminal history prior to making an offer. Some companies follow such guidelines already, but this move is meant to \"ban the box,\" the familiar job application query into whether or not one has been convicted of a crime.318 It is a form of regulation that can be expected to backfire and aggravate the discrimination problem it is purported to solve, but only the public will be punished, not those who knowingly imposed a faulty rule.319</p><p>In addition, a \"nationwide paid family leave\" plan was touted by Trump in his second State of the Union Address,320 an issue that has been taken up by legislators on both sides of the aisle.321 This development represents another example of the extent to which the regulatory state is statutory and fiscally driven. Senators released a \"bipartisan framework\" for mandated family leave in summer 2019.322 The plan ultimately came to fruition in the same December 2019 compromise defense spending package that included the Space Force.323 A mandate on the private sector is baked in, since, as Ivanka Trump put it (speaking in her role representing the federal government), \"It's very hard for people to say, well, employers should provide this benefitif we are unwilling to provide it ourselves. So you have to lead by example.\"324</p><p>As opponent Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) put it, \"[I]n the end, President Trump should get full credit for this because he's the one who made it happen. I know the Democrats won in the House, but this would not have happened had not President Trump strongly supported it.\"325 Then, in summer 2019, Trump signed legislation that requires all federal buildings to provide a room for nursing mothers to breastfeed, including members of the public, not just federal employees. The mandate is so specific that it requires that \"rooms provide privacy and contain a chair, working surface and an electric outlet for breast pumps,\" as NPR described it. 326</p><p>The foregoing comprises an incomplete catalog of active policy implementations and proposals with substantial regulatory heft that run counter to the administration's deregulatory campaign as summarized by OMB in each year's \"Regulatory Reform Report: Completed Items for Fiscal Year.\" That official roundup catalogs what are in most cases less dramatic examples of the kinds of regulatory actions cataloged here. Individual rules and regulations matter, but the overall structure of the market, business environment, and prospects for economic growth are also heavily influenced by overarching government policy. Large-scale federal initiatives morph over time into interventions unintended and unforeseenor perhaps not so unintended. The conventional administrative state and big-spending appropriations framework exert a considerable influence. Trump cannot and has not stopped it all, which is to be expected, but he has also counterproductively added his own pro-regulatory predispositions to the landscape, which are enough to outweigh his claimed billions in streamlining.</p><p>There are ambiguities as well, given administrative law's entrenchment. Changes with ambiguous effect may be rooted in factors that cannot be laid at Trump's feet. Some items get deemed deregulatory, such as streamlining subsidized small business loans, yet are inherently distortionary. This self-reinforcing growth is abetted by the fusion of the budgetary and regulatory, and the complexities over who is the beneficiary in the cost/benefit calculuswhether taxpayers or some targeted public.</p><p>Trump issued an executive order commanding \"free speech\" at colleges that receive federal research or education grants.327 Free speech is nonnegotiable in society, but a directive like this one would not be an issue if government were not funding education and inflating its cost in the process. Also illustrative of ambiguities is revocation of an Obama \"gainful employment\" rule cutting off funding to poorly performing for-profit colleges while leaving nonprofit ones alone. Neither should be receiving federal funding.328 A similar situation exists with respect to a Trump rule invoking \"Federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws\" that take into account religious objections to providing certain services or that prevent certain abortion referrals by health clinics that receive federal dollars. Had there been no federal funding, there would be no or less \"regulation\" over which to argue divergent, incompatible views of benefits and costs.</p><p>Prominent programs in this category include joint State Department and Department of Homeland Security issuances on \"Inadmissibility on Public Charge\" grounds,329 in response to Trump's intent to suspend immigration that would \"Financially Burden the United States Healthcare System, in Order to Protect the Availability of Healthcare Benefits for Americans,\"330 the Department of Agriculture's changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program's eligibility and asset rules,331 work requirements for the able bodied with no dependents,332 and a Department of Housing and Urban Developmentproposed rule on public housing eligibility and asset limitations.333 All these are deemed and characterized regulatory and appear as part of the one-in, two-out \"Regulatory Reform Report: Actions for Fiscal Year 2019.\"334</p><p>It is notable that efforts to make government spending more difficult or to tighten benefits eligibility or qualifications for government programs are characterized as costs. These raise distributional issues, but can involve direct outlays. Even components of the deregulatory repeal of the Clean Power Plan are deemed regulatory in the new Unified Agenda disclosures and the 2019 Regulatory Reform Report.335 Such is also the case with the Trump SEC's ostensibly deregulatory rewrite of the Obama Department of Labor's \"fiduciary rules\" targeted at investment advisors. While better, these remain costly, and with the SEC being an independent agency, the rule did not appear in the one-in, twoout roundup.336</p><p>These peculiarities further show the difficulty of disclosure and basic tractability. In perpetuating the administrative state approach, streamlining may do only short-term good. Congress has not passed comprehensive regulatory liberalization in nearly a quarter century, and deregulation under Executive Order 13771 has inevitably become a more difficult task as quick-to-rid regulations are exhausted. As the University of Pennsylvania's Coglianese observed at the outset, \"In a single year the regulatory rule book simply cannot be changed dramatically enough to make a palpable dent in the obligations imposed on industry.\"337 Therefore, the pertinent question is whether any executive branch regulatory liberalization can be maintained over time given the administrative state's barriers and intractable resistance to any reform at all.</p><p>When all is said and done, the administrative state cannot be said to have fundamentally changed under Trump. While agencies like FCC, EPA, and CFBP are led by pro-liberalization appointeesand at one point operated under an instruction from then-OMB Director Mick Mulvaney that deregulation should be their \"highest priority\"the permanent bureaucracies are likely biding their time.338 Without congressional action on general reforms (there have been targeted ones such as the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act aimed at reducing burdens on small banks), much of the Trump streamlining phenomenon will be transitory, especially if he backs off from that streamlining or sends mixed signals. A pruned weed is a healthy weed when it comes to the administrative state's half-hearted rollbacks, so expectations for executive-branchonly reforms must be tempered.339</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123718474</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600N-S4N1-DYTH-G4PC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8565\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 26, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Disruptive fintech startups not long ago were thought to threaten important revenue streams of even the biggest financial institutions. But they are now pursuing business models based on collaboration with banks or even being acquired by them. And banks increasingly see ways they could improve customer service by working cooperatively with the nimble entrants, which are unconstrained by layers of bureaucracy, regulation and conservative corporate cultures unused to rapid change.</p><p><br/><br/>SWIFT Institute<br/><br/>But don't expect total harmony, say experts. Some fintechs will aggressively go it alone and challenge the legacy banks in their most lucrative markets. And recent rule changes in Europe, which force banks to transfer closely guarded customer information to fintechs upon customer request, will add new momentum to the upstarts.<br/><br/>Still, the drive towards collaboration is well underway, as the following on-the-ground examples suggest.<br/><br/>ICICI Bank, India's largest private bank, and Paytm, the country's largest digital payments platform, have jointly launched a digital credit account on the Paytm app. Paytm-ICICI Bank Postpaid gives customers access to instant micro-credit for everyday expenses - from bill payments to movie tickets. Its algorithm - from ICICI - is based on a customer's financial and digital behavior and evaluates credit-worthiness in seconds.<br/><br/>Bocom International, the investment banking arm of China's Bank of Communications, has partnered with Hong Kong fintech firm FDT-AI to develop intelligent, personalized investment research based on bank clients' past transactions. The hope is to offer more tailor-made investment advice.<br/><br/>ING Group has partnered with Scalable Capital, a leading online wealth manager and robo-advice firm in Europe, to offer a fully digital investment solution to ING's retail customers starting in Germany. Customers do a paperless registration in under 15 minutes. With a minimum investment of 10,000 euros they can monitor their portfolios on both Scalable Capital and ING mobile apps and online portals.<br/><br/>Kabbage, a U.S.-based leading online lender, has partnered with large players such as Scotiabank, for streamlining online lending; MasterCard, for business loans through MasterCard's network of acquirers; ING, to provide capital to small businesses; and Santander Bank, for loans to small and medium enterprises.<br/><br/>These moves by financial institutions and fintechs in India, China, Netherlands and the U.S. show just how globally the imagined natural differences between traditional financial institutions and creative, disruptive fintechs continue to shift from competition to collaboration.<br/><br/>Incumbents that don't seek to partner will die.<br/><br/>Mike Sigal<br/><br/>The financial services sector is going through the same kind of digital transformation that media and commerce went through in the 1990s and telecom went through in the 2000s, says Mike Sigal, Partner, 500 Fintech  Co-founder, Upside Partners and founding executive producer of Innotribe, an initiative of the SWIFT bank messaging cooperative. History suggests that when the industry shakes out the leaders left standing will be a mix of incumbents that move aggressively to adopt new technologies, and some new entrants. Incumbents that don't partner 'will die,' he says. 'Smart incumbents realize that they can benefit from the insights and agility of startups, while startups have understood that the scale, reach, stability and regulatory management of incumbents can be helpful.'<br/><br/>Indeed, fintechs can pose an existential threat to banks. Kartik Hosanager, Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions, sees fintechs as 'definitely a big threat to banks,' especially in service areas that are capital-light and where 'fintech products offer new capabilities that are hard to offer in non-tech products.' A classic example is marketplace lending. Here, fintechs take advantage of the capital-light aspect of a marketplace to offer lending services at lower costs.<br/><br/>Further, they can leverage new data from social platforms and elsewhere to improve their analytics. 'In areas like student lending, fintechs have already made sufficient inroads. Companies like Square (credit card processing) and others who use mobile devices as cheaper point-of-sale systems are another example.' But Hosanagar thinks fintechs will likely find it hard to penetrate capital-heavy services such as wholesale banking and mortgages.<br/><br/>Hosanagar expects 'a lot of co-opetition.' Take mobile wallets. Most big banks like Chase and others have mobile wallet solutions that compete with Apple Pay and Android Pay. These companies also work together to offer a seamless service to any user independent of which device and card she uses at a retail store. Robo-advisors is another case. Incumbents like Schwab and Vanguard have robo-advisors that compete with fintechs like Betterment. At the same time, banks like Citizens Bank have partnered with fintechs to offer robo-advisor capabilities to clients.<br/><br/>According to the World FinTech Report 2018 produced by Capgemini and Linkedin, in collaboration with the European Financial Management Association, 75.5% of fintechs surveyed want to collaborate with traditional financial services firms. Only 18.1% want to compete on their own. The rest want to be acquired by other fintechs or traditional firms.<br/><br/>More than 55% of fintech executives said 'gaining visibility, achieving economies of scale, earning customer trust and establishing a better distribution infrastructure' are crucial reasons for partnering with incumbents. 'Such a mindset and logical fit of complementary strengths make a strong case for collaboration for today and the future,' says Sankar Krishnan, executive vice president for banking and capital markets at Capgemini.<br/><br/>The Trust Factor<br/><br/>For the upstarts, tapping into the goodwill and trust that incumbents have created is a strong draw. Hosanagar says: 'Trust is extremely important for financial services and is not easy to build overnight. Institutions that have been around for decades, if not centuries, have an edge with trust.' Rob Morgan, vice president of emerging technologies at the American Bankers Association, adds: 'I may be willing to get into someone's car for a few minutes without a lot of trust. But when I give you my money, I really need to trust you. When banks and fintechs pair together, you get the best of both worlds and customers can get the new innovative services they crave from a trusted partner.'<br/><br/>Morgan also points out that fintechs typically focus on narrow areas and develop competitive solutions. But unlike, say Uber, which provides a full replacement for the service it has disrupted, fintechs do not replicate the entire suite of banking services. This limits their ability to disrupt the industry as a whole.<br/><br/>Trust is extremely important for financial services and is not easy to build overnight.<br/><br/>Kartik Hosanagar<br/><br/>Another huge impetus for fintech-bank collaboration is the growing threat from large technology players such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba - popularly grouped as GAFAA. Vivek Belgavi, partner and India fintech leader at PwC India, points out that they can 'develop unique solutions because of their huge base of frequent customers, large data sets and technology pool.' Jean-Philippe Vergne, strategy professor at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, notes that in China big tech is 'already reaching more fintech customers than big banks.' Suggesting that the banks must 'leverage the technology developed by fintech startups to compete against big tech by using licensing agreements, acquisitions, partnerships or direct investment,' Vergne considers fintechs at present to be 'more of an opportunity for big banks than a threat.'<br/><br/>Yet, it's not as if the marriage between the large, veteran firms and the upstarts do not carry risks. Ravi Bapna, professor in business analytics and information systems at the University of Minnesota, 'doesn't see a natural cultural fit.' Since legacy financial institutions 'haven't really focused on reducing frictions faced by consumers and organizations,' the threat to banks 'is real.' Fees charged by credit cards to merchants, he thinks, will be disrupted in the same way that brokerage fees are going to shrink in the era of exchange traded funds and innovators such as Robinhood (a zero-cost trading platform), and how the investment banking business is threatened by the direct listing of Spotify's IPO. The newer models are made possible by automation, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI).<br/><br/>Bapna also points to disruptive models in places such as China and India. Ant Financial in China, as an example, has regular interactions with 450 million consumers for payments. That is the 'stepping stone for every imaginable financial product' like credit, working capital loans, insurance, pensions, etc. 'at a fraction of the cost of legacy institutions, which are encumbered by the pre-Internet, pre-AI- based operating models.'<br/><br/>The India Stack ecosystem, he notes, is another interesting model. 'By designing an open, application programming interface (API) platform that others can innovate on, it has the potential to even disrupt the disruptors like Paytm,' says Bapna. He adds: For now, 'the Indian government has completely waived transaction fees for person-to-person transactions. This should send shockwaves to credit card companies that charge 3% to 4% of transaction value.'<br/><br/>Stay tuned for part two of Banks and fintechs: Adversaries or partners?<br/><br/>This article was produced in collaboration with Knowledge@Wharton (<url normalizedValue=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu\">http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu</url>/ ).<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S83-X941-F0K1-N0W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 4, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The $1 trillion club currently includes Apple Inc, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet.</p><p>Amazon.com stood at $927 billion, though the e-commerce leader's shares jumped on the heels of its earnings report on Thursday after the bell, putting it in position to crack $1 trillion, as it did briefly in September 2018.</p><p>Revenue for both Visa and Mastercard nearly doubled over their past five fiscal years, to nearly $23 billion for Visa, and about $17 billion for Mastercard, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled for both companies over that period.</p><p>Visa reported quarterly revenue late on Thursday that slightly missed analyst estimates, a day after Mastercard beat quarterly profit estimates.</p><p>About 43% of consumer purchases around the world excluding China are made using a digital form of payment, up from 28% in 2010, according to Lisa Ellis, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson.</p><p>\"Globally, we still have five to 10 years, at least, to go of penetration,\" Ellis said.</p><p>Visa holds a 60% share of the credit and debit card market, followed by Mastercard with 30%, according to Ellis, with American Express far behind at 8.5%.</p><p>Despite their importance in finance, Visa and Mastercard are categorized as part of the S&amp;P 500's information technology sector. While Apple, Microsoft and chip companies such as Intel Corp often garner the lion's share of attention, Visa and Mastercard have been key contributors to the rally in technology shares.</p><p>Their valuations have expanded to their most expensive in at least a decade. Visa trades at about 31 times forward 12 months' earnings estimates, while Mastercard trades at 35 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. Both stocks are trading at a higher premium to the market than they have on average over the past five years.</p><p>The big run for Visa and Mastercard shares has also come during an more than 10-year U.S. bull market, and gains could be more muted in any downturn. Stocks started 2020 strong but have pulled back amid concerns over the spread of a virus from China.</p><p>Risks to the companies, Ellis said, include greater competition in the payment sector from big tech companies, as well as tougher regulations from governments around the world that might hinder access.</p><p>The companies are not sitting still. Earlier this month, Visa agreed to buy privately held Plaid Inc in a $5.3 billion deal to boost access to financial technology, and in August Mastercard agreed to buy a majority of the corporate services businesses of Scandinavian payments group Nets for about $3.19 billion.</p><p>Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Dan Grebler</p><p>Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</p><p>Reuters</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/85/158046976804.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/85/158046976804.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-165996888</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3P-GC11-F11P-X0JM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Yerepouni Daily News.

Soaring stock prices are propelling credit and debit card companies Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc up the market value charts, where they currently rank 7th and 11th among companies in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. The stock prices of both Visa and Mastercard have gained roughly 50 per cent in the past year. While the stocks may not keep up that torrid pace, Visa and Mastercard would each be worth over US$1 trillion by 2023 if their average annual gains of the past three years were to continue, surging past the likes of Facebook and Berkshire Hathaway, if they also maintain their recent pace. </p><p>Fueling their rise is a shift toward cashless financial transactions spurred by a rise in online shopping. \"Everything travels on their rails,\" said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund, which holds Visa shares. \"They literally sit in the middle of the banks, consumers and merchants and that has been a really enviable place to be.\" Visa had a market value of US$449 billion and Mastercard's stood at about US$324 billion as of Thursday's close. The US$1 trillion club currently includes Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet. Amazon.com stood at US$927 billion, though the e-commerce leader's shares jumped on the heels of its earnings report on Thursday after the bell, putting it in position to crack US$1 trillion, as it did briefly in September 2018. Revenue for both Visa and Mastercard nearly doubled over their past five fiscal years, to nearly US$23 billion for Visa, and about US$17 billion for Mastercard, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled for both companies over that period. Visa reported quarterly revenue late on Thursday that slightly missed analyst estimates, a day after Mastercard beat quarterly profit estimates. About 43 per cent of consumer purchases around the world excluding China are made using a digital form of payment, up from 28 per cent in 2010, according to Lisa Ellis, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. \"Globally, we still have five to 10 years, at least, to go of penetration,\" Ellis said. Visa holds a 60 per cent share of the credit and debit card market, followed by Mastercard with 30 per cent, according to Ellis, with American Express far behind at 8.5 per cent. Despite their importance in finance, Visa and Mastercard are categorized as part of the S&amp;P 500's information technology sector. While Apple, Microsoft and chip companies such as Intel Corp often garner the lion's share of attention, Visa and Mastercard have been key contributors to the rally in technology shares. Their valuations have expanded to their most expensive in at least a decade. Visa trades at about 31 times forward 12 months' earnings estimates, while Mastercard trades at 35 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. Both stocks are trading at a higher premium to the market than they have on average over the past five years. The big run for Visa and Mastercard shares has also come during a more than 10-year U.S. bull market, and gains could be more muted in any downturn. Stocks started 2020 strong but have pulled back amid concerns over the spread of a virus from China. Risks to the companies, Ellis said, include greater competition in the payment sector from big tech companies, as well as tougher regulations from governments around the world that might hinder access. The companies are not sitting still. Earlier this month, Visa agreed to buy privately held Plaid Inc in a US$5.3 billion deal to boost access to financial technology, and in August Mastercard agreed to buy a majority of the corporate services businesses of Scandinavian payments group Nets for about US$3.19 billion. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12373360</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3N-M2J1-JCDN-14FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"645\"/><timeReceived>6:17 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The competition authority said it was investigating whether the banks, including state-owned PostFinance, colluded with local payments providers not to use the mobile payment systems of the big tech companies. \"There is the suspicion that the companies agreed not to make their credit cards available for use with Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, in order to favor the Swiss solution TWINT,\" Competition Commission WEKO said in a statement on Thursday. Some of the companies targeted in the probe said the regulator's accusations were without merit. \"We are surprised about this investigation and are convinced that the allegations will prove to be unfounded,\" Credit Suissesaid in a statement. </p><p>Credit Suissesaid it offers Swiss consumers access to Apple Pay and Samsung Pay through its 50 percent subsidiary Swisscard and has also been in talks with Apple, Samsung and Google over how their solutions can be used. UBS acknowledged the investigation and said it had tried to reach an agreement with Apple Pay over use of the Swiss bank's credit cards as early as 2016, but had not managed to come to an understanding with the company. \"Although we offered a number of alternative solutions, unfortunately we weren't able to reach an agreement with Apple Pay to cooperate,\" a UBS spokeswoman said. Postfinance, part of Switzerland's postal service and one of the country's largest banks, also said it did not breach Swiss cartel law and said it was cooperating with the WEKO probe. TWINT AG, a joint venture between Switzerland's biggest banks to create a digital payments system, said it was \"astonished\" by the competition commission's approach. TWINT said its offices were raided by the watchdog even though it is not under investigation. TWINT also said it had previously submitted a complaint against Apple over unfair competitive practices. \"TWINT itself asked the (Competition Commission) some time ago to investigate discriminatory behavior by Apple toward TWINT, because Apple prevents the trouble-free use of the TWINT app on IOS devices,\" it said. \"A decision of the WEKO in this matter is expected shortly.\" An Apple spokesman in Switzerland could not immediately be reached for comment on the TWINT allegations. Disputes between mobile payment systems and banks have cropped up elsewhere too. Last year, a decision by Australia's competition watchdog stopped the country's banks from collectively trying to introduce their own mobile applications for contactless payments on Apple's phones and watches. Apple Pay entered Switzerland in 2016 as the first major rival to TWINT, which was launched in the same year but has not yet made big inroads into Switzerland's payments market. TWINT in April said mobile payments in Switzerland had yet to gain traction the way they had in other countries, with just an estimated 0.2 percent of all payments occurring over smartphone in the country. It said it had reached 750,000 users as of April 2018, a step down from the one million it had been targeting by end-2017. The competition watchdog said its investigation included Aduno Holding, PostFinance, Swisscard AECS GmbH and Swiss units of Credit Suisseand UBS. Aduno confirmed that its offices in Zurich were searched by Swiss authorities and said it was cooperating with the investigation. It declined further comment.

TWINT also said it had previously submitted a complaint against Apple over unfair competitive practices.</p><p>\"TWINT itself asked the (Competition Commission) some time ago to investigate discriminatory behavior by Apple toward TWINT, because Apple prevents the trouble-free use of the TWINT app on IOS devices,\" it said. \"A decision of the WEKO in this matter is expected shortly.\"</p><p>An Apple spokesman in Switzerland could not immediately be reached for comment on the TWINT allegations.</p><p>Disputes between mobile payment systems and banks have cropped up elsewhere too.</p><p>Last year, a decision by Australia's competition watchdog stopped the country's banks from collectively trying to introduce their own mobile applications for contactless payments on Apple's phones and watches.</p><p>Apple Pay entered Switzerland in 2016 as the first major rival to TWINT, which was launched in the same year but has not yet made big inroads into Switzerland's payments market.</p><p>TWINT in April said mobile payments in Switzerland had yet to gain traction the way they had in other countries, with just an estimated 0.2 percent of all payments occurring over smartphone in the country.</p><p>It said it had reached 750,000 users as of April 2018, a step down from the one million it had been targeting by end-2017.</p><p>The competition watchdog said its investigation included Aduno Holding, PostFinance, Swisscard AECS GmbH and Swiss units of Credit Suisse and UBS.</p><p>Aduno confirmed that its offices in Zurich were searched by Swiss authorities and said it was cooperating with the investigation.

The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) report, conducted on behalf of Temenos, is titled A Whole New World: How technology is driving the evolution of intelligent banking in Asia-Pacific. It found that competition is intensifying between established retail banks and the technology and e-commerce disruptors that threaten to carve up the payment solutions market.</p><p>Big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Apple and major payment players such as WeChat Pay, Alipay and PayPal are viewed as the biggest threat to APAC bankers (60%), followed by neo-banks, like Volt Bank, Varo Money, Monzo (25%). With these threats top of mind, 37% of Asia-Pacific bankers see mastering digital marketing and engagement as their top strategic priority by 2020.</p><p>The report also found that as digital technology regulation in Asia-Pacific catches up to the rest of the world, 37% of bankers believe that this emerging regulation in areas such as data protection and digital taxation will have a significant impact on the banking sector.</p><p>Regulation across the region has developed disparately. In Australia, open banking is being driven by the government to increase competition within established regulatory frameworks. In other parts of Asia-Pacific, such as Singapore, open banking is primarily being driven by the players themselves propelled by their desire to remain competitive and resulting in a need for retrospective regulation.</p><p>The report also points to China, where tighter licensing and data protection rules are set to diminish Alipay and WeChat Pays duopoly across the broader region.</p><p>Key report highlights:</p><p>New technologies like AI, machine learning, and blockchain are viewed as the dominant trend that will have the biggest impact on retail banks by 2025</p><p>For 37% of respondents, emerging data regulation will have a major impact on the banking sector</p><p>Technology and e-commerce disruptors such as Google, Alibaba and Apple are considered the biggest threat to banks (32%), followed by payment players such as PayPal, Ripple and Alipay (28%) and Neo-banks such as Volt Bank, Varo Money and Monzo (25%)</p><p>Mastering digital marketing and engagement is the top strategic priority for banks by 2020 (37%), while migrating client usage to digital from physical channels is the top priority by 2025 (29%)</p><p>The main concerns about open banking are the ability to capture customer data (34%) followed closely by a third-party relationship vulnerability being exploited (31%) and an inability to protect against cyber-attacks (31%)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-150009110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN5-6GD1-JDJN-6345-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"444\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

And it costs consumers dearly, UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said.</p><p>Digital markets, where Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have replaced oil and gas and telecom firms among the top 10 global companies based on market capitalization in 2018, also demonstrate the trend.</p><p>Digitalization, in particular, has led to winner-take-all dynamics in digital markets, Dr. Kituyi said.</p><p>Economies of scale and network effects have led to single dominant firms in e-commerce, online search, online advertising and social networking.</p><p>This has also given these firms significant control over consumer data, which confers them further market power, raising not only competition-related concerns, but also consumer protection concerns.</p><p>These concerns are compelling competition law and policy makers to find new ways of approaching, policing and addressing the challenges.</p><p>Some believe a long history of competition law has equipped legislators with what they need to tackle competition issues in the digital economy.</p><p>At a global level competition policy goals dont need to change  they are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes in the digital economy, the University of Melbournes Prof. Caron Beaton-Wells said in her keynote address to the meeting.</p><p>But the toolkit needs to be tweaked and enforcement needs to be bolder and quicker.</p><p>Digital fallout</p><p>The activities of big technology companies are cause for concern for competition law and policy makers, not only because of competition and concentration issues within the technology space, but also their cannibalization of the offline market too.</p><p>The United States and Chinas technology giants generate 90% of digital revenues. The same companies are penetrating sectors in the non-digital economy, disrupting traditional business models, in areas such as retail trade and financial services, Prof. Beaton-Wells said.</p><p>She added that the digital economy was taking over the offline market as the new engine for the economy.</p><p>But there are economic distress signals: increasing market concentration, declining business dynamism, slowing productivity growth, increasing mark-ups and stagnating wages.</p><p>There is also little real competition within the industry, dominated by a handful of big companies which buy competing start-ups before they become a real threat, experts said.</p><p>The matter of regulation and enforcement is thus central, the meeting heard.</p><p>Philip Marsden, the deputy chair of the Bank of Englands enforcement decision making committee said while big tech are like babies, they live in our house and need to live by our rules.</p><p>They're wonderful and life changing, but at the same time exhausting and very demanding. We have to remember that they have a mommy and a daddy. Who's that? That's us, the regulators, he said.</p><p>\"We know what the tech giants want. They want our data and they want to make money off it. Enforcers have to run faster to face digital era challenges. We officials cannot wait for the glacial evolution of the judicial precedent, we have to lead it. It is up to us to ensure Big Tech run competitively in the market race, Mr. Marsden said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-149601222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM2-NYR1-JDJN-62M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"718\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

Lack of up-to-date data is recognized as one of the impacts of lower intra-African trade. When there is data, it can differ from agency to agency and sometimes even within agencies.</p><p>The AU is working to address the data issue, she said, saying it would establish a trade observatory located within the AU Commission with funding from the International Trade Centre and the European Union.</p><p>The observatory would deal with the issue of not having a central trade data repository at a continental level and quantitative information to make decisions.</p><p>The term data though, said Deborah Elms, founder and executive director of the Asian Trade Centre, has been used too loosely, which makes it confusing and complicated.</p><p>Data is used to describe everything, so it ends up describing nothing, she said. We have to be more precise.</p><p>The more complicated you make it, the more difficult you make it for small businesses operating in the digital world.</p><p>With data and trade at the core of the wide-ranging discussion, the definitional issue was central.</p><p>Governments are grappling with this, said Lantosoa Rakotomalala, Madagascars industry, trade and crafts minister.</p><p>We have all the challenges relating to (digital) connection, data storage and ensuring this data is secure.</p><p>But on the other hand, we also have research and development policies which today are not yet allowing us to fully appreciate the usage of data in terms of economic development, she said, but added there were costs especially in machine learning, new equipment and the rights to a private life.</p><p>She said an additional challenge is identifying how to process and analyze data in Africa.</p><p>The case of Paraguay is heartening for other developing nations, but also demonstrates that connectivity alone is not enough.</p><p>Pedro Mancuello, Paraguays vice minister of trade, said while more that 86% of people in Paraguay have internet, only 14.3% buy online. This connectivity is a  testament to its investment in digital infrastructure, but also a portend of whats required to get entrepreneurs selling, and consumers buying, online.</p><p>But getting online is a challenge for many says, said Joozinho Mendes of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA).</p><p>Because of the digital divide an awful lot of our producers are simply not able to have such a high online profile for economic, infrastructure or indeed educational reasons.</p><p>He said he doesnt believe data collection is a bad thing and contributes to development.</p><p>Digital technologies do generate a great deal of information, but we need to be in a position to process, collect, analyses, and store it to implement development strategies. Hence the need to develop competencies that allow us to manage data, Mr. Mendes said.</p><p>The data divide</p><p>On the industry and civil society side, there was emphasis on the difference between consumer and business data and its use.</p><p>Consumers Internationals director general Helena Leurent said data benefits consumers daily, citing the example of TripAdvisor.</p><p>But she said there is a dark side that needs to be considered.</p><p>The value that companies and nations gain from data originates from individuals. Our ability to create a rich personal profile which helps aid decision-making and recommendations is the same thing that then creates the challenges.</p><p>For consumers there is a fear that (their data) is being used against them, which stops them wanting to engage in a digital world, she said.</p><p>Meanwhile Ms. Elms view is that while big data may be the preserve of big tech companies, the 2,500 companies in her network simply dont see business information as data that needs major protections.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-141773037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTF-SYX1-F11P-X3GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"970\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

Finally bringing our culture\u2019s obsession with both mental and physical health and wellness closer to the forefront of understanding ourselves and others helps to bring some coherence to our description of the roots and remedies proposed to the polarizing political issues that divide us as a society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Or at least the view from SXSW makes that case.</p><p>There was a surprising amount of agreement\u2014from the technology entrepreneurs to political aspirants to new-age celebrity advisors\u2014on how we need to take responsibility for ourselves, others, our country and the very powerful technologies that have become truly integrated into our lives. And so, after a decade of technology hero worship in business and culture, it is perhaps no surprise that we\u2019re ready for some mature and far-reaching reflection on where we\u2019re headed in the future and what role technology can and should play in defining that future. It\u2019s one reason I love SXSW as much as I do; digging deep on issues like this doesn\u2019t really happen at the other major marketing and media tentpoles.</p><p>For those of us in marketing and technology, SXSW had always been where world-changing platforms emerged from garages to add their contributions to building out the internet around the planet. So it struck me as particularly poignant, even ironic, that the most provocative story out of SXSW this year was Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s call to break up the tech titans. (And Warren was by far not the only political figure to appear at what felt like a preview of the Iowa caucuses: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made two appearances, and ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz also tried out some of his stump material.)</p><p>Warren\u2019s battle cry became the touchstone issue of the conference, and almost every speaker and moderator considered the implications of such a prospect. Then, right after the conference, news hit that Facebook suffered an hours-long blackout and stood to face a criminal investigation. It\u2019s interesting for a few reasons that the proposal was often considered an alternative to the movement for more regulation of the platforms.</p><p>First, because of the overt political manipulation of communities but also because of decidedly harmful expression and consequent bullying. An entire panel devoted to \u201cAdvertisers\u2019 Responsibility in the Digital Age,\u201d which advertiser watchdog Sleeping Giants spoke, took marketers to task for only temporarily pulling advertising from platforms for bad behavior rather than withholding budgets until the platforms truly course corrected.</p><p>Marketers, for their part, mainly want to regain some measure of control over a valuable ecosystem where their brands will not be associated with the aforementioned negative content. While many consider regulation to be either impossible or undesirable on free-speech grounds, anti-trust action could usher in a world of many more digital platform alternatives for individuals and brands.</p><p>Here, political, technical and health-related issues converge. Much has been made of the potential for social platforms to be harmful to individuals\u2019 health as well as to social discourse. And the issues are not always separated. There\u2019s currently a lot of discussion over how the contempt people feel toward their political enemies can lead to violent actions or mental health issues.</p><p>Whether Senator Warren\u2019s proposal remains politically salient as we march toward the 2020 elections or whether the definition of the platforms as monopolies will stand legal challenges, the reigning sentiment at SXSW this year was focused on reclaiming our health and agency against monumental division brought on by digital giants whose brilliance has been eclipsed by the negative ways they can be used. And that optimistic turn of events can only bode well for marketers in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1031754</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP1-GVK1-JC8H-T3N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

South by Southwest, or SXSW, often represents a touchstone for startups and burgeoning innovation in tech and media.</p><p>The problems with growth and consolidation in tech cover a wide range of issues, whether it's Amazon.com Inc. white labeling products to compete with vendors on its marketplace, the social media dominance of Facebook Inc. through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp Inc., or Apple Inc. allowing one app store for its device downloads, the pair said. The problem is further complicated because every company today is a tech company, convoluting the concept of tech regulation, they said.</p><p>Social media appsSource: Pexels \"Whether property prices or Russian meddling in elections   there's a long list of reasons people are angry at tech right now, some of them I believe are well-founded,\" Systrom said. \"That doesn't mean the answer is breaking all the big companies up.\"</p><p>The executives' comments come after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is running for president in 2020, released a March 8 blog post detailing how she would like to break up big tech companies   specifically Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC   if she is elected to the White House. She said regulators would use existing tools to undo mergers deemed as anti-competitive, such as Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as large deals involving Google and Amazon.</p><p>Systrom said he is concerned that policies like Warren's are not specific enough, and they attempt to solve nuanced problems with an overly broad antitrust solution. Krieger pointed to the outcome of the sweeping online privacy policy in Europe   known as General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR   which has led to more of the digital advertising market being held by fewer large companies rather than leading to diversification and innovation in the industry.</p><p>Warren said her administration would pass legislation that requires tech platforms that offer an online marketplace or exchange and collect global revenue greater than $25 billion to be designated as \"platform utilities,\" and they will be broken up from any participants on that platform. Those companies, Warren wrote in a recent blog post, would be barred from owning both the platform utility and any participants on the platform. They also would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties. This would potentially break up Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p>When asked if keeping Instagram and Facebook separate would enable more competition in the social media space and make a more diverse experience for consumers, Systrom said he does not believe the growth of Instagram and its combination with Facebook was bad for consumers.</p><p>\"For Instagram to get to the stage it did, I think   it's incredible for consumers,\" he said.</p><p>Additional SXSW coverage:</p><p>SXSW: Media, entertainment, enterprise, health, policy, and AI to bind them all</p><p>SXSW: 'Enormous' opportunity for bankers willing to embrace fintech</p><p>SXSW: Instagram founders recap on ads, authenticity with Facebook integration</p><p>SXSW: Venture capital looking for targeted enterprise AI opportunities</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-50494051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMS-VK61-JDVW-N2VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"560\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

And brands of all types are falling all over themselves to adopt them.</p><p>Executives descended on SXSW en masse to wax poetic about their efforts to meet the future head-on, from Walmart's work with virtual reality, machine-learning and robotic tech to amplify its grocery business, to Kohl's Corp.'s interests in VR and Passage AI's chatbots, to Amazon's considerable work in artificial intelligence to crack personalized shopping for fashion consumers.</p><p>Technology's rich potential in retail is starting to bear fruit, from digital efforts to hardware pursuits. Walmart, for example, found that shelf-scanning robotics slashed the inefficiencies of workers racing around stores to check inventory levels.</p><p>At Accenture's installation, the consulting firm showcased how retailers are using tools like augmented reality for Kendra Scott earrings or sunglass try-ons to Salesforce's artificial intelligence tool, Einstein, to draw insights from data to get a more holistic view of the customer. In another area, the firm demoed VR goggles that can track the user's gaze in a virtual store and inform brick-and-mortar merchandising strategy.</p><p>\"It's how people can visualize product on themselves and how it's connected now to the journey much more seamlessly,\" said Accenture Interactive's Rori DuBoff.</p><p>The takeaway: Innovation in retail is progressing nicely. More tools are allowing online and off-line stores to give customers useful experiences, while giving companies more information to help them strategize.</p><p>But there was another emerging theme: Being innovative alone just doesn't cut it anymore. And it leads to a critical question that kept begging to be articulated this week: When everyone is innovative...is anyone, really?</p><p>In the meantime, the dangers and pitfalls of tech's biggest platforms are honing a sharp edge that cuts across cultural and political lines. Politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar ignited a firestorm of media attention when they blasted big tech - in no small part because they chose a technology festival as the place to criticize the tech industrial complex.</p><p>Warren wants to break up the \"tech monopolies,\" and when it came to the possibility of hurting the bottom-lines of big-time tech executives like <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/technology/how-amazons-tackling-fashion-retail-with-machine-learning-1203081722/\">Amazon</url>'s Jeff Bezos, she summed up her point of view in two words: \"Boo hoo!\"</p><p>On Thursday, as SXSW continue on with its blockchain portion of the programming, the tech world was buzzing with the news that Facebook's chief product officer, Chris Cox, and WhatsApp boss Chris Daniels were leaving their roles. Cox largely had been considered a contender as chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg's successor. This follows the announcement of retail chief Angela Ahrendts leaving Apple Inc., among others, in what looks like an exodus of high-profile tech executives.</p><p>The changes were not only stunning, but might be indicative of potential changes facing the big tech platforms that retailers are increasingly relying on.</p><p>Amazon, a fairly self-reliant operation, is working on bolstering its self-sufficiency even further with its own development in advertising and influencer networks. Barring antimonopolistic overtures from D.C. or other regulatory intervention, the company will continue stoking admiration and fear from retailers large and small.</p><p>No matter the SXSW brand or retail session, the company is almost always the wooly mammoth in the room. Tips on how to work with the Amazon marketplace or how to fend off the threat from the e-commerce giant made for major talking points.</p><p>If few can compete with Amazon's reach and its deep expertise in technology, logistics and fulfillment, then it behooves brands and retailers to compete on other fronts -\u00a0like authenticity.</p><p>As Will.i.am brand director Lindsay Cornell put it: \"It's not what you say, it's not what you do. It's who you are. I think that's going to be the future of successful businesses and successful brands - not looking at the platform, not looking at the client offering, but really looking at what you're standing for and what value you have.\"</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/technology/how-amazons-tackling-fashion-retail-with-machine-learning-1203081722/\">How Amazon's Tackling Fashion Retail With Machine-Learning</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/media/french-filmmakers-celebrate-international-womens-day-with-academy-of-motion-picture-arts-and-sciences-oscars-1203081469/\">French Filmmakers Celebrate Women's Day With Academy</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/human-resources/on-staff-walmart-cto-talks-behavioral-scientists-robots-and-poaching-silicon-valleys-finest-1203038861/\">On Staff: Walmart's CTO Talks Behavioral Scientists, Robots and Poaching Silicon Valley's Finest</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WOWEDA-1203084964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WOWEDA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN1-C8M1-DYJW-X1FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434863</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"801\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>WWD</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 15, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0001Y2Q</classCode><className>KOHL'S CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001ZX8</classCode><className>ACCENTURE PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS452210 DEPARTMENT STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS448140 FAMILY CLOTHING STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC5311 DEPARTMENT STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS452311 WAREHOUSE CLUBS &amp;

Amazon; Google; Austin's HomeAway vacation rentals firm; and Maven, General Motors' ride-sharing service, have been privately pitching to them. They've held a little startup shark tank. They're touring new designs for space-efficient housing and hearing about surveillance technology. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Government has been a hot topic throughout the annual technology conference in Austin. It's the first time a sitting president has visited, and the event comes at a time when the FBI-Apple debate is stirring tension between civic offices and tech companies. Tech companies seeking to get around regulation are also noticing just how much trouble a mayor can cause. </p><p>Over a cocktail reception at city hall, the mayors talked about how to attract engineers to their cities, how to negotiate with union-resistant startups, and what they can do to get GoogleFiber to pick them.</p><p>\"First of all, we've all been wanting to come to South By for a while, and this is a great excuse,\" said Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson. \"And then there's just the reality: the biggest problems just can't be solved without tech right now.\"</p><p>Jorge Elorza, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, said entrepreneurs and big tech companies underestimate the importance of the mayor: \"When you look at civic innovation, mayors are at the center of decisions. People don't know how important this role is for tech.\"</p><p>\"I'll be honest, though: South By is overwhelming,\" Elorza said. \"And I'll be really honest - I didn't know what South By was before this.\"</p><p>He's focused on technology because of the city's new development project, \"the 195 relocation\", a 25-acre downtown development project he's hoping to infuse with startups. </p><p>As for the companies coming to pitch, Amazon has tried to sell mayors on its cloud-based web services and Googletalked about self driving cars and Fiber. \"We want Fiber,\" Elorza said. \"Free internet! Who wouldn't?\"</p><p>Every mayor wants to win over the industry, but the key may be setting different cities up with the right developing tech market, said Sly Majid, who works for the Austin mayor's office and is organizing the mayoral summit. </p><p>\"You don't want to try to beat San Francisco at being San Francisco,\" Majid said. \"The economic development can happen most with sectors that aren't fully developed. So maybe your city can be the center for augmented reality.\"</p><p>Over the past few years, Austin has emerged as a major tech hub and center for the American startup scene. It's both an outpost for large tech companies looking for a place to hire slightly cheaper labor and an innovation center of its own, with a startup and co-working ecosystem. These startups bring higher salaried workers to town, and trendy restaurants and hip shopping districts emerge. </p><p>While the tech boom is causing some Austinites to worry their city is losing its cool, it's also causing mayors across the country to think something entirely different: they want some of that. </p><p>\"Austin's achieved something here that Phoenix wants - to be a leader in tech, to have this amazing creative class,\" said Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton. \"As Silicon Valley companies grow, Phoenix is one of their biggest expansion locations, but our challenge is to not just get the back office of eBay. We want the engineers, too.\"</p><p>A lot of this, Stanton said, comes down to \"coolness\". \"The game is talent - a place like Austin built a brand that's cool.

Amazon; Google; Austin's HomeAway vacation rentals firm; and Maven, General Motors' ride-sharing service, have been privately pitching to them. They've held a little startup shark tank. They're touring new designs for space-efficient housing and hearing about surveillance technology. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Government has been a hot topic throughout the annual technology conference in Austin. It's the first time a sitting president has visited, and the event comes at a time when the FBI-Apple debate is stirring tension between civic offices and tech companies. Tech companies seeking to get around regulation are also noticing just how much trouble a mayor can cause. </p><p>Over a cocktail reception at city hall, the mayors talked about how to attract engineers to their cities, how to negotiate with union-resistant startups, and what they can do to get Google Fiber to pick them.</p><p>\"First of all, we've all been wanting to come to South By for a while, and this is a great excuse,\" said Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson. \"And then there's just the reality: the biggest problems just can't be solved without tech right now.\"</p><p>Jorge Elorza, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, said entrepreneurs and big tech companies underestimate the importance of the mayor: \"When you look at civic innovation, mayors are at the center of decisions. People don't know how important this role is for tech.\"</p><p>\"I'll be honest, though: South By is overwhelming,\" Elorza said. \"And I'll be really honest - I didn't know what South By was before this.\"</p><p>He's focused on technology because of the city's new development project, \"the 195 relocation\", a 25-acre downtown development project he's hoping to infuse with startups. </p><p>As for the companies coming to pitch, Amazon has tried to sell mayors on its cloud-based web services and Google talked about self driving cars and Fiber. \"We want Fiber,\" Elorza said. \"Free internet! Who wouldn't?\"</p><p>Every mayor wants to win over the industry, but the key may be setting different cities up with the right developing tech market, said Sly Majid, who works for the Austin mayor's office and is organizing the mayoral summit. </p><p>\"You don't want to try to beat San Francisco at being San Francisco,\" Majid said. \"The economic development can happen most with sectors that aren't fully developed. So maybe your city can be the center for augmented reality.\"</p><p>Over the past few years, Austin has emerged as a major tech hub and center for the American startup scene. It's both an outpost for large tech companies looking for a place to hire slightly cheaper labor and an innovation center of its own, with a startup and co-working ecosystem. These startups bring higher salaried workers to town, and trendy restaurants and hip shopping districts emerge. </p><p>While the tech boom is causing some Austinites to worry their city is losing its cool, it's also causing mayors across the country to think something entirely different: they want some of that. </p><p>\"Austin's achieved something here that Phoenix wants - to be a leader in tech, to have this amazing creative class,\" said Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton. \"As Silicon Valley companies grow, Phoenix is one of their biggest expansion locations, but our challenge is to not just get the back office of eBay. We want the engineers, too.\"</p><p>A lot of this, Stanton said, comes down to \"coolness\". \"The game is talent - a place like Austin built a brand that's cool. Phoenix is cool, too.\"</p><p>At the private mayoral shark tank, Stanton sat with his 20 fellow mayors over breakfast burritos and coffee and listened as startups gave their all, hoping to score lucrative city contracts. </p><p>\"Are you gonna say South By's jumped the shark because the mayors are here now?\" said Stanton. \"Most importantly, last night, to get to the hotel, I used Lyft for the first time,\" he said. \"Lost my virginity.\"</p><p>Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake looked confused by the question of why her city would want to attract tech. \"It's like that old question: why do you keep robbing the bank? Because that's where the money is,\" Rawlings-Blake said. \"Why do we want tech?

GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA): Congress has immense powers. And if you want to go to war with Congress, you do so at your own peril.</p><p>TRUMP: INSIDE POLITICS, the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters now.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KING: Welcome to INSIDE POLITICS, I'm John King. To our viewers in the United States and around the world, thank you for sharing your Sunday.</p><p>We'll get to a big week in American politics in a moment. But, first, the latest on a horrific Chabad shooting at a California synagogue. One woman is dead, several others wounded after 19-year-old gunman bursts into services at a synagogue about 25 miles north of San Diego.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Our entire nation mourns the loss of life, prays for the wounded and stands in solidarity with the Jewish community. We forcefully condemn the evil of anti-Semitism and hate which must be defeated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: The California attack six months to the day after 11 people were murdered at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</p><p>CNN's Nick Watt is live for us this morning with the latest -- Nick.</p><p>NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: John, that gunman is now behind bars on one charge of first degree murder and three charges of attempted murder.</p><p>Now, yesterday, during a service here at the Chabad synagogue in Poway, he burst in and was shouting things that led the mayor to pretty quickly brand this a hate crime. Now, the rabbi was hit in the hand at which point Lori Kaye, a 60-year-old man, jumped in between the shooter and the rabbi. She was hit, she was down. Her husband who was also in the synagogue ran over to help the person who was shot, he didn't realize it was his wife. When he did, he fainted.</p><p>Now, The gunman then pointed his weapon which we're told was an AR-15- style assault weapon, he pointed it towards some children. At which moment a member of the congregation threw the doors open, some kids managed to escape. One child was injured, as well as that man who threw the doors open.</p><p>And an off duty CBP officer who was in the synagogue then managed to get a weapon and fire at the gunman as he was leaving. He was detained later without incident and is now behind bars.</p><p>Authorities are now, they say that they don't have any connection between him and any white supremacist group, but there is an open letter posted on the internet they believe was posted by him. They are looking into the validity of that and looking into a suggestion in that letter where he also claims responsibility for an arson attack at a mosque just a month ago. This right now is a community in shock and in mourning.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>KING: Nick watt, appreciate the live reporting. We'll continue to track that investigation. Appreciate it.</p><p>Now to the most significant political news of this past week, Joe Biden's entry into the 2020 presidential race. The former vice president went big in his official announcement, leaving jobs and health care and his resume for later. Character, the former vice president says, should be paramount in 2020.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an abhorrent moment in time. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House he will ever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are. I cannot stand by and watch that happen.</p><p>We can't forget what happened in Charlottesville. Even more important, we have to remember who we are. This is America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Sniping from activist liberals was immediate and constant. A group of Justice Democrats called Biden old guard and, quote, in near complete opposition to where the center of energy is in the Democratic Party today.</p><p>That tells you, yes, Biden faces a huge challenge selling some of his record to a more liberal Democratic base. The volume also tells you, those in the party who don't like Biden, mostly because they support somebody else, view him as a force. Also telling us how much attention Biden announced he received form the president and his party.</p><p>We know in private conversations the president views Biden as the most formidable of the Democratic candidates.</p><p>[08:05:00] But Sleepy Joe is the nickname the president was quick to tweet and also quick to question Biden's stamina.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think we beat him easily. I feel like a young man. I'm so young. I can't believe it. I'm the youngest person -- I am a young vibrant man. I look at Joe, I don't know about him. I don't know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: With us this Sunday to share their reporting and their insights, Lisa Lerer of \"The New York Times,\" CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Perry Bacon of \"Five Thirty Eight\", and Karoun Demirjian of \"The Washington Post\".</p><p>So, a different conversation about 2020 this Sunday, because now the Democrats have their second big name, if you will, Bernie Sanders from last time and now Joe Biden.</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: No question. I mean, I think we're going to look at this race BB, before Biden, and AB, after Biden. This definitely changed everything.</p><p>And it is sort of interesting that President Trump and former Vice President Biden are going back and forth over age. They're both in their 70s. The president is 72, Joe Biden is 76.</p><p>But what I'm told by people who are close to the president is that the president has been fixated, of course, on Pennsylvania. That is his -- the feather in his cap, if you will, of 2016. They believe Joe Biden can win Pennsylvania.</p><p>A top Republican told me this this week. If he would make it to the general election, yes, he's a big problem. How does he survive a Democratic primary?</p><p>So, that is Joe Biden's task as he heads out on this. But he benefits from a crowded field. Yes, there are a lot of candidates here, but there also a lot of Democrats who want to win and Joe Biden, that's his central message.</p><p>LISA LERER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: I think you can't -- I agree, of course, with everything Jeff said, but I don't think you can fight the last war. Every race was different. It was interesting to me how he made no concessions really to the current Democratic Party warriors.</p><p>You have all these candidates that are not talking about Trump because their sense is Democrats want to hear what they're doing for the country. You have all these candidates, a number of them sworn off big donor fund-raisers, Biden embraced it, went all in. He's not talking about policy.</p><p>He's refused to really -- he's been apology adjacent as one of my colleagues called it on issues like Anita Hill, whatever your views on those issues and how important they are, that's kind of an older style. You see all these new candidates. They apologize for basically everything, the Democratic field.</p><p>So he really -- he made no concessions in this announcement. He's doing it how he's done it for all those decades in Washington. I think it is an open question whether that is what Democrats in this primary race want.</p><p>KING: I think it's the open question. I like that term, policy adjacent.</p><p>So, let's listen to some of that. You know certain things. Whoever you are, you're getting into the race, you know your strengths, you know your weaknesses, Biden has some.</p><p>And you know the big questions, and one is his treatment of Anita Hill, especially now in context of today's Democratic Party, in the #MeToo Movement. So, his first international interview is on \"The View.\" He knew it was going to come up. The question, was this good enough?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: I think what she wants you to say is I'm sorry for the way I treated you, not for the way you were treated. I think that would be closer.</p><p>BIDEN: Well, but I'm sorry for the way she got treated. I never heard to say -- if you go back and look at what I said and didn't say, I don't think I treated her badly. There are a lot of mistakes made across the board, and for those I apologize.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Why not a \"of course I'm sorry?\"</p><p>PERRY BACON, POLITICAL WRITER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT.COM: You heard him, I don't think I did anything wrong. I don't think this issue is the killer for him. You look at the polls. His support is with more moderate Democrats and with Democrats over 50. Those are people, if you look at the polls, who are not -- maybe not as passionate about #MeToo as the younger people.</p><p>I do think the base he's targeting maybe doesn't care about these things in he did in the past and not looking for him to apologize. They like the fact that maybe he's not so woke, not so left, not talking about issues -- he's talking about Trump and not the other stuff.</p><p>I think right now, this is a feature of his campaign. That interview was not great itself. But his base I don't think cares about these things the way other parts of the party does.</p><p>KING: One of the things he does want to do is make more of a personal connection. And in part of that, again, he has some obstacles, weaknesses at his record, however you want to characterize. He also has considerable strengths. Party activists love him. His former association with President Obama helps him a lot with the entire Democratic Party. He also has a story of personal tragedy that allows him to empathize with voters in a way that's hard for candidates. He lost his first wife, and he lost his son Beau last time. In that \"View\" interview, it was interesting, when he talks about personal loss, it's quite emotional.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: When I get up in the morning, I think about -- I hope he's proud of me. I hope he's proud.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>[08:10:01] A lot of people, all you folks have lost somebody, they're still with you. They're in you. They're there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: It is part of the -- there's Anita Hill, there's his role in the crime bill. You think of him as a relic of the past, not in touch with today's Democratic Party.</p><p>There's a personal side of politics where I'm on your side, I'll fight for you, I get it. That is potentially a great asset.</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: This is a thing about, are you voting for somebody based on the policies they're pitching, the specifics of the policies frankly, because the Democrats are not all that dissimilar or are you voting based on a person that you kind of fall for in some way.</p><p>We've been talking this for a while. We talked about it with Beto O'Rourke, we're talking about with Buttigieg. And, of course, Biden has always had that certain something, that's intangible that makes somebody a good politician. Whether that gets him all the way to the finish line, it hasn't in the past. But he does have -- he occupies a warm spot in many people's hearts. I don't know that necessarily translates into votes. That's always the question.</p><p>KING: And we'll spend more time on this just ahead as we get to the road for Joe Biden, where he'll be this week, some of the historical trends he hopes to defy, and this week's \"politicians say the darndest thing,\" presidential long shot, math edition.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, I look at this optimistically. I used to be at 1 percent, now I'm at 2 percent. I've doubled my support in such a short time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: A big week ahead for Joe Biden as he hits the campaign trail trying to prove he can keep his place at the top of the Democratic pack.</p><p>[08:15:06] Let's just look at the week ahead, a big rally tomorrow in Pittsburgh. By the end of the week, Biden will visit the first caucus state, go out to Nevada, he'll touch California, South Carolina and New Hampshire as well, all the big early prizes in the Democratic race.</p><p>As he does so, his age is a factor and so is history. Biden would be 78, if he won the 2020 election on inauguration day. Democrats have a history of electing younger candidates, of nominating younger candidates, from John Kennedy at 43, Bill Clinton at 46, Jimmy Carter at 52. Doesn't count Harry Truman and LBJ because they were vice president who came became president.</p><p>But Democrats have a history of going younger. Another challenge for Biden is the vice presidential curse you might call it. Al Gore, Don Quayle, Walter Mondale, Herbert Humphrey tried to run for president and failed. George H.W. Bush and Richard Nixon have been successful, although Nixon lost the first time out of the box but later came back and redeemed himself.</p><p>One question for Joe Biden because of his past campaigns, can he raise money. He posted $6.3 million in the first 24 hours, that put him atop the Democratic pack. He's doing some things differently. But he did prove he can do something he was not good at in his prior campaign. We'll see if he can sustain that.</p><p>Now that he's in the race, the other candidates figuring out how polite or impolite I should be. Elizabeth Warren pointing out in a big debate consumer rights, she thinks he was on the wrong side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER: Do you think he's been too cozy to Wall Street to be an effective regulator of the industry if he becomes president?</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, our disagreement is a matter of public record. At a time when the biggest financial institutions in this country were trying to put the squeeze on millions of hard working families, there was nobody to stand up for them. I got in that fight because they just didn't have anyone. And Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: So now comes the test. He did answer, one of the big doubts -- I remember the '88 campaign, couldn't raise money, couldn't hang in there. At least out of the box he did that.</p><p>How much will that become an issue in the campaign in the sense that he is doing more big dollar fund-raisers, most of the other candidates have sworn that off? They're going to try to make him corporate Joe? They're going to try to make him, what?</p><p>ZELENY: I think they are, but as Perry was saying earlier, I'm not sure the moderate Democrats, the Democrats who really want to win are going to be bothered by that.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with having fund-raisers. It is a time suck for candidates. That's the biggest challenge for him. He's going to have to show up for these fund-raising events.</p><p>The $6.3 million is impressive. We thought he would raise a little bit more -- this whole new phenomenon of how much you raised in the first 24 hours is a little bit hocus pocus potentially here because he has three months to raise money. We're not going to see actually how much he raised in this quarter until the middle of July. But it showed that people are interested in him running. He has a lot of fund-raisers out in California as well.</p><p>I was talking to a Democrat working for Buttigieg. He said, boy, Biden in the race hurt Buttigieg's ability to raise money because some Obama supporters are now going with Biden. So, I think money will not be his biggest challenge. It's something that he can compete with. His rolodex is still pretty good.</p><p>KING: He's going to get labeled as the elite establishment guy, if you will, by the -- Bernie Sanders says it's a revolution.</p><p>This is a reaction from some of the candidates. You heard Elizabeth Warren, saying in a fight over credit cards, consumer rights, they thought he was on the wrong side.</p><p>Here's Senator Warren: How did Joe Biden raise so much money in one day? Well, it helps that he hosted a swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors at the home of a guy who runs Comcast's lobbying shop.</p><p>Bernie Sanders: Earlier today, Joe Biden released his first day fundraising numbers. When their campaign got done counting the checks from a $700,000 fundraiser, hosted at the home of a telecommunications lobbyist, he outraised us by just a little bit. Does that work?</p><p>BACON: Well, I'm not sure it will work -- it captures something real. If you ask Warren or Sanders what is the problem in America, they would say big company, the wealthy, they would say a lot of things plus Donald Trump. Biden would say basically Donald Trump is a big problem.</p><p>I think this is what you're capturing, is the divide between the sort of left and the less left about policy and about what the real problems. And I think you're going to see that early on. That's what I'm going to see a sense of. The other candidates, figuring sort of in between where they are. But I think Warren/Sanders versus Biden is the real fight of the party. I think now, Biden will bring it to fore.</p><p>KING: It's going to be interesting to watch. I just want to quickly bring up this \"Washington Post\" poll today. This is the challenge for Democrats, before you pick who you want, what do you want?</p><p>Candidate I most agree with, 47 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaders say that's what they want, the candidate they most agree with, 39 percent of the most candidate most likely to beat Trump. The challenge for a candidate is to get a pretty good share of both camps, since you have these two camps there.</p><p>All right. Next, the president rallies the faithful in Wisconsin. A look at his 2020 map and the theme he hopes to ride to re-election.</p><p>[08:23:24] KING: President Trump's rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last night, capped a week of clear and combative markers about his re- election playbook. One of which is to convince base voters the Mueller report is good for him, which, of course, it's not.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The radical, liberal Democrats put all their hopes behind their collusion delusion which has now been totally exposed to the world as a complete and total fraud, the greatest political hoax in American history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Another is to convince his voters he's delivering on tough immigration policies, though again, the facts, at least as of today, not on the president's side on this point.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Now, we're sending many of them to sanctuary cities. Thank you very much. They're not too happy about it. I'm proud to tell you that was actually my sick idea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) KING: His bet is his core voters won't believe it when the media says the president is again twisting the facts. His bet is his free- wheeling style will make the same magic as it did in 2016 when he lost the popular vote big time but won the Electoral College by flipping Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: By the way, Saturday night, is there anyplace that's more fun than a Trump rally? Can you imagine Sleepy Joe, Crazy Bernie?</p><p>[08:25:00] You look at the candidates, right? Can you imagine any of these people up here doing what I'm doing? There'd be 200 people show up if they were president. If they weren't president, nobody would show up. Is that right?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: It's entertaining. He's good at that, but it does not make it so just because when he's the president of the United States when he says we're sending people to sanctuary cities, they're not. This is an idea they put out there. The White House tried to knock it down.</p><p>But he just says things that are not true chronically.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Because this is his thing. He likes to massage the facts and present them as it behooves his argument at the moment in time and also as it pleases his audience at the moment. When he's at a rally with his base, he doesn't get challenged, so they keep blowing forth.</p><p>KING: Another interesting thing is Joe Biden in his announcement decided to go big with the Charlottesville comparison saying essentially America is at risk with this president, he doesn't share your values, he doesn't understand adversity, he says things that sides with the dark forces. So, the president had a chance to respond to that this week and he decided to double down on his both sides analogy.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Many of those people were from University of Virginia, from all around the neighborhood, the area, they just wanted to protest the fact that they want to take down the statue of Robert E. Lee. Now, there were a lot of good people in that group and you had some very bad people in each group, too.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>KING: We talked about Joe Biden's reluctance to apologize, the president will not budge off this and say, look, horrible people on one side.</p><p>ZELENY: Without question. I was struck by how Joe Biden was able to draw the president back to this. You know, in a sense usually the president is leading the debate and Democrats responding to him. In this case, it was the reverse. So, the fact that the president is still explaining and refusing to budge on this which makes even his most loyal supporters cringe. That was one of the lowest moments of his presidency so far. He took the bait.</p><p>7KING: Another point that was interesting is, you heard the president all week long, Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, Mueller. A lot of his aides want him to move on, just talk about the economy. Just let it go, just let it go.</p><p>But Jared Kushner, his son in law, talking about Russia meddling in one context, the FBI director a very, very different take.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISER: I think the investigations and all of the speculation that's happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on democracy than a couple Facebook ads.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: I do think Russia poses a very significant counterintelligence fact. The use of social media, fake news propaganda, false personas, et cetera, to spin us up, pit us against each other, sow divisiveness and discord --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Not a couple of Facebook ads. A big deal.</p><p>LERER: I mean, we know from the Mueller report that Florida was, in fact, hacked, or a county in Florida was hacked during the last presidential. This is a serious problem. You can see an alternative universe, another administration would be a task force or a coalition because these elections are run by a million different local counties and states and there's a lot of coordination that needs to happen to really ensure the security of our election results.</p><p>But you have this willful blindness that is hard to see as anything but political coming from the White House that really impedes any kind of effort in that direction. It is for all Americans -- you see Republicans saying this, too -- concerning as we head into 2020.</p><p>KING: All right. Next for us, just say no is the White House answer to House Democratic oversight. Big court fights are looming. As the law is tested, it's clear the president loves this political fight.</p><p>[08:31:52] JOHN KING, CNN HOST: Speaker Nancy Pelosi is scheduled to meet with the President on Tuesday. The subject: infrastructure. The big question, whether the conversation shifts from that potential area of cooperation to a source of unprecedented confrontation.</p><p>The White House has issued a blanket no to oversight requests from House Democrats, even ignoring subpoenas. And Team Trump loves this fight -- all but daring Speaker Pelosi to challenge the President in person. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, SENIOR COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: If she wants to talk about impeachment and not infrastructure; if she wants to talk about dragging down a president instead of drug pricing; if she wants to talk about haranguing the President instead of health care -- that's up to her. I would imagine it would cost her party precious political currency but I'm not in charge of that.</p><p>If she's coming here under the ruse of infrastructure and wants to talk about subpoenas, I'll let you know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: The Mueller Report is central to this divide but hardly the only fight. You can see the White House sued to block Congress from getting Trump financial records. It blocked a senior official from testifying about security clearances. It ignored a subpoena related to adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Vowed to fight efforts to question the former White House counsel. And has ignored two deadlines to surrender the President's taxes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D), RHODE ISLANDS: It's not up to the President. No matter how much the President tries to stop it, we will prevail and we will get the information we need to find the truth.</p><p>REP. GERRY CONNOLLY (D), VIRGINIA: It's an assault on the constitutional framework of our government. And If it's allowed to stand, frankly the legislative branch will be a pale shadow of what it was intended to be by the constitution of the United States. There's no \"we're going to resist\".</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: It is a giant test of constitutional powers. And you even saw Jim Jordan, the leading Republican member of the House Oversight Committee trying now to broker a compromise on one of these issues -- whether the security official, Mr. Kline, will testify on Capitol Hill. That's going to fight out in the courts.</p><p>But the glee with which the President, Kellyanne Conway -- they're talking about they like this political fight even though many people question whether they can hold it up in court.</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR Washington CORRESPONDENT: They definitely like the fight. In one respect, it draws things out. I mean who knows what's going to happen at the ends of the day here, if Don McGahn is going to have to testify. Probably so.</p><p>But you know, there's 18 months to go essentially before the election. So the legal battle could be long and protracted.</p><p>So Speaker Pelosi here also has the challenge of keeping her chairmen and others sort of on track and in control. And so far that definitely has been the situation. But an explosive week potentially with the attorney general on Capitol Hill if he shows.</p><p>KING: The Democrats don't consider Congressman Jordan a voice of reason. But is he trying to -- is this a legitimate effort to try to broker compromise here? Is he thinking ahead and maybe Republicans retake control someday?</p><p>I might be the chairman of this committee, if this president is allowed to set this precedent of always saying no, then I'm going to get it from a Democratic president some day.</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Yes. I mean look there are the longer-term consequences that last beyond the scope of the administration. This has been a constant fight between Democrats and Republicans the whole way that the precedent that you set between whatever party is in charge and whatever White House is there is going to last for a long time.</p><p>And everybody in Congress should be pro transparency, pro responding to request, pro having our subpoenas mean something. Otherwise how are we (INAUDIBLE) of government.</p><p>[08:35:01] It's always difficult to have anybody though broker anything in the middle because Jordan is a close ally of the President and many in the GOP that are at the tops of these committees have shown themselves to be more sympathetic to Trump than they are to the Democrats' greater cause calling.</p><p>But by the same token, Democrats too are not exactly, you know -- nobody's angels here. Everybody is completely sullied by their political bent. It's very difficult to take anybody at their words when it comes to these fundamental issues of are you challenging Trump right now, today or not?</p><p>PERRY BACON, POLITICAL WRITER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: These issues -- I mean the (INAUDIBLE) Congress thing is universal here but the issues (ph) are somewhat distinct and Trump is never going to turn over his tax returns. So that's one issue that's very distinct.</p><p>McGahn testifying is we're rehearing the Mueller investigation. Trump is going to be very opposed to that I think throughout. I think the census and other questions like that, I think these issues are going to be part of negotiations.</p><p>Will the administration block all congressional hearings for the next two years? I doubt it. But on these things that are Mueller or tax related, I do think the White House wants those fights particularly about taxes. I don't think the Democrats are being mean, demanding his taxes. They want that, fine.</p><p>Ultimately they -- Pelosi has said we're not going to impeach. She knows parts of the party want to impeach. So I think drawing that debate out and generating lots of Democrats' divided stories is probably what the White House wants as well.</p><p>KING: All right. The President is trying to poke them to want to stir up the impeachment because he thinks -- again, that's the fight. To your point, we should not be surprised, I guess, because politics is politics. But if you go back in time, the Republicans at the time said Bill Clinton lied and Bill Clinton tried to obstruct an investigation, he should be impeached. You read the Mueller report. President Trump lied. There's plenty of evidence to at least make the case, if you want to.</p><p>You can dispute it if you want but there's plenty of evidence, ten, 12 examples of the President potentially obstructing justice. Republicans say time to move on and I'll thank (ph) you across the seat.</p><p>On the issue of congressional power and the value of congressional oversight, here is Lindsey Graham back in anther day saying a president must not defy Congress when he gets a subpoena.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Article three of impeachment against Richard Nixon, the article was based on the idea that Richard Nixon as president failed to comply with subpoenas of Congress. And the Congress back in t that time said you're taking impeachment away from us, you're becoming the judge and jury.</p><p>It is not your job to tell us what we need. It is your job to comply with the things we need to provide oversight over you. The day Richard Nixon failed to answer that subpoena is the day that he was subject to impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LISA LERER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": I mean look, I think this shows you what power President Trump has in the Republican Party. You're in election season. You have a lot of -- we're in a primary season. You have a lot of these Republicans watching behind them on their right flank especially.</p><p>And President Trump holds great sway in this party. It's part of the reason why when we talk about a primary challenge to President Trump, everyone rolls their eyes a little bit. It's not something that feels particularly realistic. And you see it in Congress, too</p><p>ZELENY: Lindsey Graham there, of course, back when he was in the House. Now he's the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But much more important than that he's President Trump's best friend or golfing buddy.</p><p>KING: His new best friend.</p><p>ZELENEY: His very new best friend. In an election year himself. So does not want to have anyone in his committee talk about it. But the House where he used to serve is controlled by Speaker Pelosi now. So he doesn't have much of a say in it.</p><p>KING: (INAUDIBLE). When we come back, the Democratic race not only crowded with candidates, there's a giant list of new policy ideas, including one that caught the President's eye.</p><p>[08:38:22] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KING: There's a vibrant policy debate among the Democrats in the 2020 nomination chase. And it expanded into controversial new territory this past week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You have said that you believe that people with felony records should be allowed to vote while in prison. Does this mean that you would support enfranchising people like the Boston Marathon bomber?</p><p>SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy, yes, even for terrible people.</p><p>SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think we should have that conversation.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: While incarcerated?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: No, I don't think so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: You can count President Trump among those watching that debate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I mean you see what's going on. Let the Boston bomber vote. He should be voting, right? I don't think so.</p><p>Let terrorists that are in prison vote. I don't think so.</p><p>Can you believe it? But this is where some of these people are coming from. And they're the most popular ones.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: It's fascinating on a number of fronts. Number one, will Bernie Sanders pull the party even further, again to the left on that issue. Number two, how closely the President -- he looks for ways to get involved and get engaged, even in the Democratic debate.</p><p>ZELENY: Sure he definitely does. I mean he's long been following all this very carefully.</p><p>The next day Senator Harris came out and, you know, she didn't wait for the conversation. She said I'm a former prosecutor. Essentially, no, that's not a good idea. So she cleaned up her answer there fairly quickly.</p><p>Look, I mean Bernie Sanders has been very successful in pulling the party to the left on a variety of issues. Most of the issues being debated right now were his issues, you know, (INAUDIBLE) the mainstream to that's the central challenge for the party.</p><p>LERER: Yes. I mean It is striking to see President Trump get involved in this primary, usually sitting presidents are not deeply involved in the other opposing party's primary process and how he throws it off in real time. How he changes how these candidates behave on the Democratic side.</p><p>I think it will be really fascinating to see that story evolve. I don't think we know the answer to that because like so many things in our politics, it's just something we haven't seen in previous races.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: The challenge is going to be also for Democrats. I mean knowing this about Trump and that he's watching, can any of them actually pull him into anything that is now advantageous for him. Because when Trump takes pot shots, he redefines the narrative, he redefines the conversation.</p><p>[08:45:00] If Democrats can manage to do to him and that could be -- bring people to rise up --</p><p>BACON: Like Biden did on Charlottesville.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Right. Like Biden did on Charlottesville.</p><p>BACON: Pushed (ph) him aside. Donald Trump barely won the election in 2018 (INAUDIBLE). We should not pretend that he's some political genius here. This isn't like -- this is all really nothing is more unpopular than separating children from families. So you'll hear about that.</p><p>Or actually Trump brought up repealing Obamacare again this week. Not a smart idea. I don't think that his decisions have been particularly smart so far even if the Bernie Sanders idea was also unpopular.</p><p>The question right now, we're hearing lots of unpopular ideas from Trump and from the Democrats. And Joe Biden has a chance to run a campaign of things people are actually for and he should do that.</p><p>KING: It's an interesting point. Another Democratic trying to do that is Elizabeth Warren who has not gained any traction, much traction, in the Democratic polls just yet.</p><p>But what she's hoping is when you get to the debate phase of the campaign, when they're all in the stage together. And then as voters get more and more involved in this, it's still very early. We're into this every day. Most voters have real lives, if you will.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren has put out some detailed plans. You can disagree with them if you want but to her credit, she's put detailed proposals out. She says how she's going to pay them for them -- whether it's universal free college and student aid, childcare, breaking up big tech, corporate tax plans, protect public lands, abolishing the electoral college, a wealth tax, breaking up big tech. You see the big list here.</p><p>She's trying to be -- and actually you know, Dave Weigel of the Washington Post tweeted this out from Warren merchandise. \"Warren has a plan\" t-shirt there. She's trying to be the eye of a planned candidate. She's struggled a little bit so far. What do Democratic voters want? Do they want, you know, semi-colons and a book on the plans. Or they want to fall in love with somebody.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: It's kind of both. Right.</p><p>Look, Warren has struggled so far but she has not struggled in terms of setting what the tone is for the rest of the Democratic field. She says impeachment, everybody follows. She says, you know, gives out details of tax plans, health care plans, she brings up new issues, and people tend to follow that, move into that space.</p><p>It's the question of is she the messenger the people want for these types of messages? And right now the answer is apparently not, but she's hoping that she gets a chance to change people's minds.</p><p>LERER: And I think it's worth remembering that this is a wide open race. \"The Post\" has a poll out this morning. A majority of Democrats -- I think around 54 percent say they're not decided. Biden is the clear front-runner at 13 or 19 percent.</p><p>BACON: It was 17 -</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>LERER: 17 -- is under 20. So, you know, This is wide open and I think if you talk to the Warren folks, what they say it's slow and steady. Just stay in the game. Those first 24 hour fund-raising numbers are kind of not a great metric for the long haul. Just stay in there. She has a comprehensive world view and see what happens.</p><p>The debates very well could -- we're going to start monthly debates in June. That can scramble up a lot of things.</p><p>KING: Monthly debates in June. That looks (INAUDIBLE) a lot of things.</p><p>And that's -- again, that's the chance you get if. If you view Biden as a the big voice in the race, it's a challenge for him. How much does he say I'm with Obama? Ho much does he embrace some of this new stuff. how does He strike that balance?</p><p>ZELENY: And we're about to find out. He's never been in this position before. He's about to prove if he is a front-runner or not. But he is beginning this as a front-runner. That is some good and bad but he'd rather have it if you're him.</p><p>KING: I remember the '88 race, I think seven or eight Democrats, they thought that was a crowded feel.</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>Our reporters share from their notebooks next including the reception the attorney general can expect when he heads up to Capitol Hill this week, assuming he shows up.</p><p>[08:48:18] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KING: Let's head one last time around the INSIDE POLITICS table, ask our reporters to share a little something from their notebooks to help get you out ahead of the big political news just around the corner.</p><p>Lisa.</p><p>LERER: Well so his week when I was looking at the 2020 race I was reminded of that old \"Real World\" slogan, you're going to find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real. And what we saw a lot of this week in the race was for months this had been a crowded primary, but a very polite primary. They were at least saying my friend this and, my friend that.</p><p>And we're starting to see that shift a little bit. We saw Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, take a shot at Biden. We saw Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the pages of the New York. And this just made some liberal activist in the party nervous.</p><p>They've been circulating this unified urging with candidates to commit -- basically commuting their tax a little bit. That feels unlikely to happen. This is a crowded race. This is going to be a competitive race. We're going to see a lot of what our friends in the political professionals like to call drawing contrasts.</p><p>But we haven't seen a race this crowded in a very long time. The question is going to be whether the tone of this race does weaken these candidates and prevent them from achieving what Democrats really hold oz their most passionate, sacred goal in this thing which is defeating Donald Trump.</p><p>So I think that's what a lot of people, including the people at this table, but also a lot of activists are going to be watching as we move forward, particularly as we head towards that first debate.</p><p>KING: 20 people in the race. There's going to be some sharp elbows.</p><p>Jeff.</p><p>ZELENY: Well, Joe Biden, as we've been talking about all morning has long-held presidential ambitions but they have seldom, in fact, never gotten him beyond Iowa. 1988 he stopped actually well short of that in 1987. In 2008, he stopped the day after the Iowa caucuses.</p><p>So he heads to Iowa this week on Tuesday and Wednesday for stopping at least four different cities, talking to a lot of activists, Iowa holds considerable importance for Joe Biden. But I am told he's going to be announcing some endorsements when he's out there. There are a lot of people who liked Joe Biden in 2008 and who liked him earlier in the year but then they went with that Obama guy. Of course, he comes back now with that Obama guy with him. So the idea at least in spirit.</p><p>So keep an open mind about Joe Biden in Iowa. It's a critical state for him. But hat visit this week will show if he can win the big one, it starts in Iowa.</p><p>KING: Stir up some old ghosts but also new opportunities.</p><p>Perry.</p><p>BACON: 17 Republicans were in the debate in 2016 at the beginning. As you know, lots of Democrats running this year. So now with Tim Ryan in the race, he's polling well. We have 16 Democrats who qualify at the debate so far.</p><p>So the thing to watch, if you want to see more candidates debate which may not be everyone's dream -- the thing to watch next is Eric Swalwell and Seth Moulton. So we might get those two are the next two I think who might qualify and then we'll beat the record the Republicans set in 2016.</p><p>KING: We have two split debates. Will we need three split debates?</p><p>PERRY: The limit is 20 though so we're only going to have two. Journalists thank the DNC for that.</p><p>KING: We think.</p><p>Karoun.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Well, as we're focusing on the continued standoff between the White House and the House over these subpoenas and everything else, we have Bill Barr, the attorney general coming to Capitol Hill. He's supposed to show two times this week although it's unclear whether he's actually going to be present for the hearing that's scheduled with the House Judiciary panel.</p><p>But what's going to be really interesting is how Democrats try to hold into account for the public statements he made about the Mueller report, whether he was spinning. Some people think he was lying on behalf of the President.</p><p>[08:50:02] And definitely many of the Democrats think he was shilling (ph) for the President and are going to challenge him basically on did you tell us lies intentionally to obfuscate what was in that report.</p><p>The tone that is set clearly has implications for the subpoena battle for the redactions. But it also has to implications for everything else that goes through DOJ which is a massive which is a massive portfolio of issues.</p><p>If there's no trust between the attorney general and the Hill this early on, that's a problem for a while to come. KING: It's a major confrontation in the week ahead.</p><p>I'm going to close with a little follow-up on what Jeff was just talking about here and how the Biden campaign is betting that some old school rules are still worth following. He cannot keep up with some of his rivals when it comes to the big new test in politics -- online, small dollar contributions. But the former vice president is hoping to pressure his rivals with an old school tool, a steady stream of big name endorsements.</p><p>There are a handful of prominent New Hampshire Democrats waiting after Biden leaves Iowa to come on board. And New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's support is considered a two-fer by team Biden -- a gateway to a proven fund-raising network and a blow of sorts to New York Senator and fellow 2020 candidate, Kirsten Gillibrand.</p><p>If there's a downside, we've seen it before. It is that candidates like Bernie Sanders are very adept at stoking the idea, the establishment elites are trying to put their thumbs on the scale.</p><p>But team Biden sees the upside as far greater especially as it tries to quiet that early skepticism, the third campaign will be superior to the first two. Keep an eye on that this week.</p><p>That's it for INSIDE POLITICS. Hope you can catch us week days as well. We're here at noon eastern.</p><p>Up next, don't go anywhere. Big \"STATE OF THE UNION WITH JAKE TAPPER\". His guests include White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and the other Democrats to jump into the 2020 race last week, Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton.</p><p>Again thanks for sharing your Sunday. Have a great day.</p><p>[08:56:40] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019042801CNV15</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0S-WHB1-DXH2-62HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7409\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 28, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Chabad Synagogue</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>San Diego</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Murders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Police</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elizabeth Warren</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democratic Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Race Relations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

The idea is to deliver more processing power at the edge of the network so we can have smarter and smarter devices in the internet of things. Synaptics said the Smart Edge AudioSmart family is a set of system-on-chip (SoCs) offerings that include neural network acceleration, proprietary wake word engine, and advanced far-field voice processing. </p><p>These technologies can be used in smart home hubs, Wi-Fi repeaters, speakers, and other appliances. The company made the announcement at CES 2019, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas this week. The first chip, AudioSmart AS371, is available in samples now and incorporates a powerful machine-learning engine with SyNAP (Synaptics Neural Network Acceleration and Processing) technology. 'Intelligence at the edge begins in the Smart Home, where privacy is paramount, and with voice as thefastest-growing and most natural human interface,' said Huibert Verhoeven, senior vice president andgeneral manager of the IoT division at Synaptics, in a statement. 'Our cutting-edge voice processing technology and SyNAPintegration not only provides unmatched performance and security, it opens numerous newopportunities across consumer IoT products, spanning speakers, displays, set-top-boxes, thermostats,lighting, Wi-Fi repeaters, home appliances and much more.' Intelligence at the edge results in an enhanced user experience through better response times androbustness. For example, performing Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural LanguageUnderstanding (NLU) locally on-device ensures core Smart Home voice control works when there is pooror intermittent internet connectivity. SyNAP enables advanced features such as user identification andbehavioral prediction, which allows voice assistants to perform ambient computing and enables a more intuitiveinteraction with users. In this era of 'always on' and connected, amplified by an ever-growing set of devices within the SmartHome, your device and data security is only as strong as your weakest link. Ensuring a high level ofdevice and system security is a fundamental tenet of Synaptics' AudioSmartAS3xx family of SoCs, whose precautions range from a dedicated security processor to architecting every element of theSoC and system implementation, Synaptics said. The AS371 solution with SyNAP on-device intelligence enhancesconsumer privacy by greatly reducing the need to continuously send personal data to the cloud. SyNAPalso complies with Europe's tough privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The far-field voice processing and wake word technology improves voice pick-up in noisy, real-world conditionsand barge-in capabilities during very loud playback. Through in-house design of the SoC, wake wordengine, voice pre-processing and playback enhancement, Synaptics has optimized the complete systemto achieve the highest possible far-field voice performance at affordable consumer electronics pricepoints. While the AS371 is sampling now, the AS390 (for voice-enabled devices with displays), the AS350 (for voice-enabled low-power devices), and the AS320 (for voice-enabled microcontroller-based devices) will all be available in sample quantities in the first quarter of 2019.

So we'll kick off this first panel session with our speakers, as Tom mentioned, Brian Doubles, who is the President of Synchrony and Brian Wenzel, who's the CFO. We've been very fortunate to have Brian here many times before. And this is your first time, I think, Brian Wenzel. So thank you for attending. There's obviously a lot going on at Synchrony, and we'd love to get your thoughts on how the year is set up. So maybe, Brian Doubles, you could start. It's been a year since you transitioned to your role as President. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about your new role and sort of where you're spending your time.</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES, PRESIDENT, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL: Yes. It doesn't even seem like a year. It's been -- there's a lot going on. So it's been pretty fast. But if you think about why we put all these different groups together under one org, it was really to find ways to deliver solutions, capabilities, new products and bring them to market for our partners faster. I think we've had a lot of success innovating, building new capabilities, but we took a step back and said, okay, can we be solving problems for our partners faster, can we get to market quicker? And so we took marketing, we took new products, the digital teams, strategy, M&amp;A, our ventures group, data analytics, customer experience, we brought all those things together. And if you think about -- probably, a good example is, what we've done on Digital Apply. So if you think about Digital Apply, we've made tremendous progress over the last 4 years. We took a look at that and we said, okay, that involved so many different functions across the business. If we had them under one umbrella, could we have brought that to market quicker? So now you can apply for credit, really by putting in 1 or 2 fields, everything pre-populates. And that took teams, that took our digital teams, that took our data analytics teams, customer experience teams. It also relies on a strategic venture that we made -- strategic investment we made with Payfone. And so we brought all those things together to create what is, we think, a leading digital apply process. We said, we probably could have done that a little bit faster for our partners. And so that was really the goal of bringing all these things together. And I think so far, it's been successful. I'm spending a lot more time with our partners now, just getting out in the field, visiting them, trying to understand, both for our large partners in Retail Card, but also in Payment Solutions and CareCredit. What are the pain points? What are the things that we can be doing to help you succeed? We've got really good traction on digital, which I talked about. We're seeing really good traction, too, on data analytics. I would say, all of our large partners are sharing data with us now. That's very powerful when it comes to both marketing and growth, but also credit and underwriting. And now we're starting to take a lot of those data share technologies and practices, and we're starting to roll those out in Payment Solutions to some of our small and medium-sized partners.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: Okay, great. And I guess, when we think about strategic priorities, maybe you could rank order, top 3?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes. It's hard to rank, where I would say, look, first and foremost, we are very focused on helping our large partners succeed. So that is still the core of the business. I think we've got terrific engagement across all of the large partners. When you're in uncertain times, like we're in right now, retail is a bit challenged, we tend to see really good engagement from our partners. They're bringing a lot of great ideas to the table. We're bringing a lot of great ideas to the table. That collaboration, I think, has never been stronger. I think we're also delivering a lot of new capabilities for them. I talked about data analytics, I talked about everything we're doing on the technology side. And look, if you think about our 2 most recent announcements with the Verizon relationship and Venmo, I think that's real evidence that the places we've been investing over the last 5 or 6 years are absolutely the right places to invest. They're helping us win and compete for new programs. And if you think about like Venmo and Verizon, those are going to be 2 very unique, very large programs for us. And we're pretty excited about that. So I'd say that's first, large partners continues to be the core. But then I think you're also going to see a heavier focus on diversification. And diversification, primarily through CareCredit, Payment Solutions and even some of our direct-to-consumer products like the general-purpose card.</p><p>So if you look at CareCredit, we couldn't be more excited about the opportunities in front of us at CareCredit. One, if you look back over the last 20 years, how we've grown CareCredit, we've got tremendous scale in the business. So we're in over 80% of dentists, we're in over 90% of vets. It's a large and growing market. There's $350 billion of out-of-pocket health care spend. There's $70 billion that people spend on their pets. And we're positioned really well in that space to win. As we think about growth over the next 10 years, though, it's not going to come from being present in more dentist office and vets. We're already very saturated, and we've got a market-leading position. As I think about where the next wave of growth is going to come from, it's really going to be more -- getting more deeply penetrated inside of the provider offices. So we still have a lot of provider offices today where we get 1 app a month or less than 1 app a month. And part of the challenge that we've always had historically is in smaller offices. You've got an office manager or practice manager who he or she is stretched, just trying to make the place run every day, get people their appointments, et cetera. But this is where I think technology can play a large role. They may not have time to walk a customer through a CareCredit application process, but there's no reason why the customer sitting in the waiting room can't scan a QR code or do text to apply and do the whole thing on their mobile phones, so that when they get -- it comes time for their appointment, they're ready to pay using CareCredit. So we started to roll out technologies that will help us really get more deeply penetrated inside of those 200,000 providers that we've gotten CareCredit.</p><p>And then Payment Solutions, similarly, we're really excited about the launch of both the home and the auto network. I think these are really great strategies to drive growth into the future. Our Synchrony Car Care card is now accepted at over 0.5 million locations. The HOME card is accepted at over 1 million locations. So really, the strategy there is driving awareness across that cardholder base. They know what -- where they can use the card, the value proposition, et cetera. So there's a big awareness campaign that we're running there.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: Cool. So you mentioned in the outset of your response to the previous question, sort of the uncertain times. Obviously, top of mind subject for a lot of our investors. Maybe Brian Wenzel, you could talk about sort of any early indications of anything in terms of credit quality. And then maybe, Brian Doubles, you could talk broadly about any of the threats you're thinking about to the business model in general outside of just specific macro impact.</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Sure.</p><p>BRIAN J. WENZEL, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL: Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. So from a credit perspective, just go back to '19 for a second, we saw improvement throughout the year, stabilization really in the fourth quarter. As we move into 2020, we don't see anything today as we look at it that gives us any different concern or raise awareness. We look, obviously, at all our credit grades by product, by channel, by partner, so we haven't seen things there. But we also looked at consumer behavior pattern, payment behavior pattern, which, to be honest with you, at the end part of 2019, we actually saw payments increase, which is very unique, probably given the credit quality of our portfolio. So we looked at payments, we looked at consumer spending behavior patterns, are they changing the way in which they consume groceries, gasoline, discount because we haven't seen anything from a credit perspective that gives us pause today. We continue to watch it every day. We continue to make refinements. But so far, it's a very stable environment and favorable for '20.</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes. And then in terms of threats, I think sitting here today, I see a lot more opportunity than I see threats. I think a couple of years ago, we were -- and we continue to watch fintech and new competitive entrants into our space very closely. I think we respect all of our competitors, but I feel even better today than I did 2 or 3 years ago in terms of how we're positioned, both in terms of the product set that we have, our -- the technology and the architecture that we've developed and our ability to integrate into the partners' experience and provide a really good experience for the customer. 2, 3 years ago, I probably would have said we got a little bit of work to do there. Now I feel like we are absolutely best in class. And as we go out and compete for new business, Venmo is a great example. I mean you can imagine the very high bar that they set on customer experience and the ability to integrate into their app, into their digital experience and bring the credit capabilities in. So I feel like we are absolutely positioned to win right now. So I see a lot more opportunity sitting here today than I do threats.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: I guess, we hear a lot about the fintechs and installment-based lending. Could you just talk about sort of how your capabilities and your product set compares to them because some of those guys seem to be at least winning in some places?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes, it's an interesting trend. I mean we have an installment product today called SetPay. We can -- we finance small dollar purchases through an installment product. So we have the products. And look, our goal is really just to provide our partners and our partners' customers with choice. And interestingly enough, if you go out and pull our partner base, they're not unanimously supportive of an installment product. From their perspective, they say, hey, well, over the last 5 or 10 years, we've been working really hard to get that second purchase, right? We've driven really good reuse rates on our products. An installment product is kind of a one and done, right? It makes that next purchase a little bit more challenging. So we do have partners that are a little more cautious around an installment product. They like the revolving product. They like the repeat. They like the loyalty that, that builds. With that said, we also have partners that are like, hey, look, I just want to give the customers, my customers the choice, and we're able to flex to that as well.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: And I guess, when we think about the economic model around each of those different products, does it differ in any way? Or is it comparable?</p><p>BRIAN J. WENZEL: Yes, it's fairly comparable. There's a different competitive set. But when you look at it, the discount that you're charging between those, we price relatively the same return, so it is comparable. It's really how do you -- Brian hit on this, how do you meet the needs of the merchant or the retail partner and what they're trying to accomplish with the program, whether it's repeat sales or really trying to pull through a sale.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: Got it. I want to talk about Verizon and Venmo. But maybe before we get into that, as we think about some of these investments you're making for these new clients, I mean is it adding to capabilities that you didn't have? Or is it tailoring those product sets for your partner? I mean could you just talk about contextually sort of what you're doing?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes, sure. I mean it's a little bit of both. So part of this is, again, I think part of how we're winning in the marketplace today is our ability to flex to the partner, right? A lot of our -- many of our partners, almost all of our partners want to control that customer experience, right? So we have to find ways to integrate into their -- whether it's their digital environment or mobile app, et cetera, which we've done over the years with SyPI. And so this is now kind of think about it as kind of a next level of SyPI where we're building an API architecture that will plug into our partners' mobile experience, their app and it will be absolutely seamless. So you'll move from their in-app experience to credit functionality, and you'll never know. You'll never know. Think about the alternative, if you were to -- you're inside of one of our partners' apps and you're doing some things, and all of a sudden, you want to do something related to credit and it pops you out to a website. That's a terrible experience. And then you got to go back into the app to kind of figure out whatever you're going to do, and this will be completely contained in their experience. So that requires some technology build. Now we're building it in a way that it will be scalable across the enterprise. So once we build it -- and you're never done building it, right? You're always adding new features and functionality, but we're building it in a way that it can be scalable across the enterprise, so our partners can benefit from it.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: And when we think about like -- and we'll start with Venmo and go into Verizon. But when we think about Venmo, I mean we've heard PayPal talk about it being sort of a unique offering. Could you maybe just elaborate on sort of that product and what to expect?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes. There's not much we can share at this point. Obviously, we're still in discussions, and you'll see more around the launch in the second half. But it will be very innovative. It will -- we are laser-like focused on delivering an experience on the credit program that aligns very closely with the current Venmo experience. And again, you can imagine, as we went through that process with PayPal and Venmo, and I participated in a number of meetings with our technology team, it was all about the experience. I mean that was -- we would spend a couple of hours together, and it was all about the experience. It wasn't a traditional RFP process, where you go in, you spend time on the experience, you spend time on the economics, you spend -- this was like, okay, how are we going to make sure that at the end of the day, this feels very much like Venmo.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: Got it. And I mean, I guess, their target customers, like do you feel they have a propensity to want to take on credit cards? Because we hear a lot about millennials and sort of their unwillingness to take on debt. Like, do you guys feel like that's an...</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: No, absolutely. Absolutely, we do. And I think -- but part of this is going to come down to the experience and the value proposition on the card. But we've done research on this cohort of consumers, and they are open to credit. There's an aversion to what they would view as banks, I think, stodgier banks. And I think this won't feel like that. We need to make sure it doesn't feel like that. It needs to feel different, but we think there's -- there'll definitely be a really strong reception to it.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: So could you talk about the Verizon product because that one is a little bit more sort of foreign to me in terms of just understanding what they might do with the lending products? So could you just talk about that a little bit?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes. Well, I think this is also -- this will be very unique for us as well. And I think there's a tremendous amount of growth opportunity in this space. It's pretty exciting to enter a new vertical. So I also think, at the same time, it gives us some nice diversification inside of large partner programs, but also for the company. And if you think about it, when you go in and buy a phone, a lot of people put that on a payment plan, right? This gives them another alternative to open a Verizon co-brand card. You put the phone on it, there will be, we think, a very strong value prop and other incentives attached to it. But at the end of the day, it's a way for Verizon to drive even more customer loyalty with a great brand. We're pretty excited about the prospects there.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: And then when we think about the future and your pipeline or -- is that pipeline more like the Venmo and Verizon type stuff? Or is it -- are there more traditional RFPs and stuff out there?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: I'd say, right now in the pipeline, it's probably more start-up opportunities that veer a little bit more towards like Verizon, Venmo type opportunities. There's not a lot of large programs that are currently sitting in the pipeline, a lot of those have been renewed. So that's what I would say in terms of Retail Card. In Payment Solutions, you got a pretty broad cross-section of new opportunities, but also a very strong pipeline there. And then CareCredit, we just recently announced a great new program with Kaiser Permanente in the health system space. So [they on the team] have a really good pipeline in that business as well and new opportunities that they're working.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: One more question I get a lot from investors with these investments you're making. As we think about the returns on these new wins, are they comparable to the stuff you've had before? Or is it lower?</p><p>BRIAN J. WENZEL: It's comparable. I think the difference, and Brian referred to it, de novo programs, especially where you have to make this type of investment in the technology, creates a little bit more of the upfront drag. So this year is a year of investment for us. We talked about in our earnings call in January, about a $0.20 headwind. If you think about that, it's the people to go behind these programs, it's the technology build that we have, it's launch funds, et cetera. So there's initial drag, but we believe a couple of years out, obviously, this will -- as we get through the first early vintages, they would be very comparable and hopefully, the mainstay is for us 10 years from now. If you look at some of our largest programs, they were start-ups a number of years ago. Amazon, the Gap, Sam's Club. So they're stalwarts, but again, de novos have a little bit different profile in the front end, but the overall return, we believe, they're good risk adjusted returns for us.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: Great.</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: It's a good problem to have, but it's very rare, Brian and I were talking the other day. It's very rare to have 2 big start-up opportunities like this in the same calendar year. So I do think about it as a year of investment because we're very fortunate to have 2 big launches coming this year. I can tell you our teams are working around the clock to make sure that both of these are successful. Usually, you get one of these every maybe 3 to 5 years. We have 2 in a 12-month period. So our teams are hard at work trying to make these things happen.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: And just to clarify, like these investments don't reoccur. They should scale after this year?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes.</p><p>BRIAN J. WENZEL: Yes.</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: You have a big upfront, all the things Brian talked about, but then we look at these programs over a 7-, 10-year period and say, okay, do we like the return profile, do we like it under different economic circumstances. And in both cases, these are very attractive opportunities for us with a lot of room for growth.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: So Brian Doubles, you touched on a little bit, CareCredit and Payment Solutions. Obviously, they're really exciting opportunities for you guys. We tend to sort of overlook those a little bit as an investor.</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: So I have to talk about them as much as I can.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: No, and I appreciate that. So maybe you could just elaborate a little bit about those opportunities more -- in more detail and talk to sort of the profile of the consumer there and whether or not it's comparable to private label?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes. The profile of the consumer is very consistent across the 3 platforms. If I start with CareCredit, I mean this is a business with, again, just tremendous scale in the industries that we participate in, but we're also doing a number of different things to continue to grow the business. I talked about getting more deeply penetrated already. But the other thing we're doing is we're entering new specialties. So we're now in 25 different specialties, right? Whereas, if you go back in history, it was primarily dental that we did some audiologies and cosmetic. Now we're in 25 different specialties. So that's one big avenue for growth. And the other thing that we're doing, we talked about health systems. So the trend in the market over the past few years has been one of consolidation. So as we continue to see practices consolidating and moving into larger health systems, we want to be there, right? And I'll be honest, those are not -- that's not an easy sales cycle, right? These are big practice groups, where it takes some time to work your way in, but they've been very receptive to the CareCredit product and what it can do for their customers to help them pay the out-of-pocket expense. So we feel really good about that strategy. And then the other thing that is probably underappreciated is just how important technology is going to be for CareCredit. I go back to that small practice, for example, where it's just too hard to offer CareCredit. And now somebody sitting in the waiting room can just do text to apply and pre-populate it using Payfone, enter a couple of fields, get approved. And by the time their son or daughter goes in to get their braces, they know exactly how they're going to pay for that treatment. That's a really big deal.</p><p>And then the other thing that probably gets overlooked a little bit in CareCredit, is just how we drive awareness in CareCredit in terms of where you can use the card because acceptance is a big deal. And we have a provider locator that gets over a 1 million hits a month, where people who have the CareCredit card go in, and they look at, okay, where can I use my CareCredit card, right? That's great for 2 reasons. One, it's very easy for the customer to know where they can use the card, but it also brings business to our providers, right? So if they accept CareCredit, they're in our provider locator, and they know that they're going to have access to the CareCredit customer base to come in and spend. So that's kind of CareCredit in a nutshell.</p><p>I think Payment Solutions has a ton of momentum as well. We talked a little bit about the auto and home networks. I think they are obviously not as mature as CareCredit. And so the one thing that we're working on there is, again, around awareness. Where can you use the card? What are the benefits attached to the card? That's really more of an awareness campaign that we're running right now. But I'd say, just in the core of Payment Solutions, we're seeing a lot of really good momentum and a ton of engagement on things like technology and data share. So most of our large Retail Card partners are leveraging data share to some extent. Now we're taking that -- the Payment Solutions clients, and we're seeing really good engagement. We're hosting them at our innovation stations. We're taking them through the technologies and things that we have that can help them. And you can imagine, our big partners have big digital teams working on this stuff. But if you've got 2 or 3 electronic stores in Middle America, you don't have a digital COE, right? So these technologies and the things that we've built can be even more impactful for our small- to medium-sized partners. And we're seeing a lot of really good traction there.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: I guess you mentioned data before and that you're getting data for all your partners now. How much are you using that data to sort of inform the merchant on getting repeat business and such? And getting better conversion even?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes, it's really both. So one -- so they're sharing things with us like how much the customer spends, how long have they been a customer, how long have they been registered on the website, average basket size, we've always had the SKU level data, which, as you know, is really powerful. But now we're able to calculate what we call a customer engagement score for that customer, which helps us, at the end of the day, really make better underwriting decisions, better line assignments. So in cases where we have a good customer engagement score, we can give lines that are 20% to 30% higher. And at the same time, have better credit risk for us, right, a lower propensity to default because we know so much about the customer at the time they apply. And that can be really powerful. So if they have a 20% to 30% higher line, you're going to get 15% to 20% higher sales on that customer, more repeat, more loyalty. And we can actually target offers to them as well. So it really is a combination of different things, which is why our partners are so excited about it. It was -- if you go back a couple of years, we started doing this with 1 or 2 partners and you have to have a good -- you got to have a good test case. But now that we have some actual results, we take that -- we don't share any names or anything, we take that kind of results to other partners, and they see it. And they see the power of it, and they say, yes, I'm bored, okay, I can improve my approval rate, bigger lines for my customers, more sales for me. There's no reason not to do it. And so it's really now just proliferating, which is pretty exciting.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: And how far along are you in terms of penetrating your customer base with this? With all of these types of...</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: All of our large partners share data in some form with us. I'd say, we have -- as you can imagine...</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: Utilizing the data, I mean.</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Utilizing data, yes. All of our large partners. And now we're starting to roll it to the smaller ones. What I would tell you is that it's not one size fits all, right? So we have -- and again, this is where you have to be flexible in your architecture, your technology because we have some partners that want to -- they want to share data lake, right, on one technology platform, and we need to be able to work inside of that framework. It's not one size fits all. I think as we start to roll it out to small- to medium-sized enterprises, we're going to have to find a way to make this scalable. So it's not as customized as it is today, but I would say all of our partners are very engaged on this topic. And while each approach may be a little bit different in terms of what they're actually sharing, the level of sharing, what we're doing with it, the engagement is exponentially greater today than it was 2, 3 years ago.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: Great. So I'm going to ask another question on loan growth, but then maybe we'll open it up to the audience. So audience, please think up some questions. I guess you guys are targeting 5% to 7% loan growth this year. When we look at some of the early indications, it's been a little weaker than that, but that's probably because you have these relationships pulling up. But maybe you could just talk about how you guys got to 5% to 7%, sort of contextualize it with what we've seen thus far? And then also maybe factor in some of the weakness that we might see in retail sales and how we should consider what that impact might be?</p><p>BRIAN J. WENZEL: Yes. So if you look at the 5% to 7%, we think we should be growing 2 to 3x the GDP of our retail partners. And a big driver to that is our Dual Card in capturing world spend from our customers. So -- and if you look historically, our growth rate has been in the 4% to 7% the last 3 years. So we see pretty consistent growth. I mean Brian has talked about the tremendous opportunities that we have in CareCredit, which has grown high single digits in that 8%, 9% range. Payment Solutions, again, right in that 8% range, from growth when you factor out the loss of Yamaha and oil and gas coming out, but a very consistent growth pattern. And then we had a lot of noise in Retail Card with Walmart coming out. But again, they're growing in that kind of mid-single digits. So as we look at that, we come back to that 5% to 7% is a very achievable and manageable number now. Again, there's going to be a little bit of benefit, smaller this year with the launch of Verizon and Venmo. Verizon in the first half, Venmo in the second half. So that growth rate as we go through the year, we expect to accelerate towards the back half of the year with our plan kind of coming in. We do get a lot of questions on the coronavirus. What are you thinking about that? It is way too early for us to really have any impact from that. We do talk to our retail partners. But as we see it, the sales growth projections and how we're coming into the year is very achievable and manageable. So we think it's a good plan.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: And when we think about like retail sales, obviously, we hear a lot about offline retail suffering in terms of growth. How do you see that growth profile changing over time? Do you feel like, for your own partnerships, more of that is going to come from online? And that's why you guys are making the investments you are?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes, absolutely. I mean we have -- one, we're partnered with really strong online players, obviously. But we're also helping our partners who have been traditionally more brick-and-mortar, transform to be more online, more digital. That's a big part of the value proposition, I think, that we bring to our partners. We're helping them transform. And one of the things that we've talked about the card program is so instrumental to that transformation because if you think about it, the traditional brick-and-mortar retailer, they want to be able to get that 360-degree view of how the customer is shopping. How much is in store? How much is online? How much is through the mobile phone? And they want to be able to see what they're buying through the different channels. Well, the only way you can put that picture together is through the card, right? If you come in and use a general-purpose card, the retailer doesn't know, unless they have a really strong loyalty program, which many don't. The only way they know is they can look through the card and the SKU level data that we get and say, okay, this customer, they might buy jeans in store, but they buy T-shirts on their mobile phone. Well, that's pretty powerful for the retailer to know. They also know number of visits, the average basket size, et cetera, and they can get all that from the card program. So as our more traditional retailers are kind of undergoing this transformation, they're leaning very heavily on the card program to help them do that.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: That's fair. All right. Let me open up to the audience. Audience, any questions? One right up there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just high level, do you expect Venmo or Verizon to be a bigger contributor when it's at maturity?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Come on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I mean is one -- the question is, if one is really much bigger, I guess, just order of magnitude is...</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Well, I think, look, they're both going to be great programs. And I would say both programs have the potential to be top 10 partners for us, relatively quickly. So that's how I would answer. I think it's too early to say it's one or the other, and I wouldn't want either partner to come back to me and say, well, why didn't you pick me? Thanks for your question.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: Any other questions in the audience? There's one right there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: From a data capture perspective, can you give us a sense of what additional information you're getting from your partners that helps you make decisions on the credit side? We understand data from a behavioral perspective, purchase perspective. But when you're underwriting credit, how does that help you? And what specific data elements do you get from your partners?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes. So it's actually a lot of the same data, but knowing that -- how loyal a customer is with the partner is incredibly powerful from a credit standpoint. They're more likely to make good on their payments. They're more likely to be an engaged customer. So it's the same stuff. It's how long they've been a customer, how long they've been registered on the website. Even simple things to reduce fraud like if we know the ship-to address that they've registered on our partners' website ties to the address they put on the credit application, you know the fraud's going to be dramatically less on that type of account. So again, it's engagement, not just from a sales perspective, but engagement from a credit and underwriting perspective. We've now demonstrated over the past couple of years and when we look at the probability of default for a highly engaged customer versus a relatively mixed level of engagement, it's dramatically better. So it's the same type of things, but it comes back to this customer engagement score.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: Any other questions in the audience? I guess, when we think about partnerships in the future, are there other sort of -- I mean I'm not saying Venmo is nontraditional, but big tech technology, are there any other types of deals like that, that might be in the pipeline that are interesting and unique in that regard?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: Yes. What's great about our position, I mean, anybody who is thinking about doing a card program, whether it's a fintech, who wants to round out their product suite or a telecom like Verizon, they come and talk to us. We are in the mix on every competitive process that's out there, just given our size and scale in the space. So I think that's great. That doesn't mean you're going to go pursue every opportunity that's out there. I think one of the things that has been and will continue to be very important for us is the level of engagement from the partner on the card program and is it one of their top 3, top 5 priorities. And in both cases, if you're just talking about whether it's Venmo, Verizon, Fanatics, the big launches that we've had recently, the level of engagement at senior levels inside of that company has been exactly what we look for. So if you can get the card program to be a top 3 priority for the CEO and leadership team, you're almost guaranteed success. You're almost guaranteed success. If you've got the [value prop] structured the right way and you got engagement of senior management, then there's nothing more important to guarantee the success of the program. So as we evaluate opportunities, whether it's -- they can be fintechs, they can be new industries, things like that, that's a key criteria for us to evaluate.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: That one right there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Brian, just curious obviously, working closely with your partners isn't new, but the flip side is a number of the technologies, I presume that you're going to be using in your new relationships involve things like machine learning and AI and learning to mass customize and make the experiences more seamless for consumers, as you've said. Can you talk about the degree to which adopting these technologies and making these investments is being priced into the relationship with clients, in general? Or how you would see it evolving, in general, whether that essentially is the evolution of the already existing expectation that you're working closely with your partners? Or does this actually create a new potentially type of consulting relationship that gets priced differently in the future?</p><p>BRIAN D. DOUBLES: It's a great question. I'd say, right now, it's part of the package that we offer our partners, okay? And we never lead with price. So we never lead with price. We lead with our capabilities. Our goal is to demonstrate that our tools, our technologies, our product suite, our capabilities are worth a premium to the market. And we believe that, and that's how we compete. Look, I think we've certainly entertained the idea for some partners that, whether it's data analytics or some things that we do for our partners that aren't necessarily related to the credit program, could that be a service? Could that be something we charge for down the road? Sure, we've thought about that. We've talked about it. We don't have an immediate plan for that, but it's something we'll continue to evaluate. Right now, our goal is to provide these services and these capabilities to our partners to help them win. And it's part of a package deal that we offer. And we think -- we do think we get paid for that in the overall program economics. So we haven't considered breaking it out separately at this point, but who knows down the road.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: Any other questions in the room? So no discussion is complete without talking about capital and capital management and liquidity and CECL, and everything combined.</p><p>So maybe, Brian Wenzel, you could just talk about sort of the outlook for capital and how you're going to use it? Obviously, you guys bought a lot of stock back on the heels of the Walmart loss? Any constraints related to CECL that we should be mindful of going forward?</p><p>BRIAN J. WENZEL: Yes. So as you think about capital, we've been on a journey right from our separation from our parent, GE, a number of years ago, where we came out with a very high CET1, really to facilitate and make sure that we could get the regulators confident and get that exit point and stand up the company. We've been on a journey to deploy capital into growth of the company over the last number of years. So that's obviously one of our first priorities, and then we've begun a capital plan that includes a -- we view as a strong dividend as well as we're beginning to reduce the CET1 level and return that back through share repurchase program. We currently have a $4 billion program that runs through June of this year. We had $2.7 billion done at the end of December. So we have $1.3 billion still to go on that. So we'll continue to manage that. As we look forward, and you bring up CECL, obviously the phase-in for CECL happens over 4 years. It's roughly 60 basis points of CET1. But there, we've been really engaged with our regulatory partners. We engage with Treasury, who's doing a study on CECL and the implications of CECL. So at the highest levels inside the Board of Governor and at the Treasury, highest levels as well as the National Economic Council. We've been trying to educate people with regard to the impact of that. So it was factored into our 2019 plan. Again, we will be factoring it to our 2020 plan. And listen, the regulators get it. They may not react in the same time frame that we want to react, but we think we're going to get or we expect to get some relief. And at the end of the day, as you think about our capital return program, we expect to execute that in a manner whereby we get closer to our real peers on a journey. Obviously, you have to be mindful of the fact that you can't reduce the capital so quickly as the regulators would get uncomfortable with that. So if you do it in a measured pace, which I think we have done, obviously this year is a little bit higher relative to Walmart really think about an extra $2 billion, but we're going to continue that capital plan and reduction of our capital level strictly with CET1.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: All right. Well, we're out of time. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.</p><p>BRIAN D.

The Pentagon and the State Department consider the U.S. presence a critical counterweight to Iran and Russia. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">Here\u2019s how Mr. Trump\u2019s shift could affect the region.</url></p><p>Johnson calls for return of American diplomat\u2019s wife</p><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for the wife of an American diplomat involved in a crash that killed a teenager to return to Britain, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">said he would ask President Trump to intervene</url> if necessary. </p><p>\u201cI do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in an interview with the BBC, \u201cand I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of laws that carried out in this country.\u201d</p><p>Britain has been pressing the U.S. since Ms. Sacoolas left the country after telling the police that she had no plans to do so. But the U.S. says that questions of immunity, which is rarely waived, were discussed at senior levels and that it is in close contact with the British authorities.</p><p>Details of the crash: Harry Dunn, 19, was killed after his motorcycle collided with a car traveling in the opposite direction in Brackley, a town about 60 miles northwest of London. The police have said that Ms. Sacoolas was driving on the wrong side of the road. </p><p>The U.S. is shielding Big Tech from foreign regulators</p><p>For years, lawmakers in Europe have moved swiftly to regulate Big Tech and protect privacy. But <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">the expansion of a 1990s U.S. law is threatening that global push</url>.</p><p>Before Facebook even existed, the law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, helped countless internet companies flourish \u2014 and it now shields them from liability for content created by their users.</p><p>And lately, the U.S. has been inserting various legal protections for companies like Facebook and Twitter into trade agreements, like one with Japan signed by President Trump on Monday. </p><p>Big picture: The protections are part of a global fight over who gets to set the rules for the modern internet. American negotiators have already proposed including the language in prospective trade agreements, including with the European Union and Britain, if it leaves the bloc.</p><p>Go deeper: Section 230 is largely credited with fueling Silicon Valley\u2019s rapid growth.

But Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers quickly appealed and won a temporary block. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">Read our takeaways</url> in a case that could wind up at the Supreme Court.</p><p>Bolivia: Recent heavy rains in the Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">have helped put out forest fires that have raged for two months</url> across the landlocked South American nation, charring more than four million hectares of land, the local authorities said.</p><p>Snapshot: Above, members of the climate change protest group Extinction Rebellion holding a demonstration on Wall Street in New York with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">a pool of fake blood representing people killed by climate-related disease and disaster</url>.

Her candidacy is a challenge to the economic system, known as neoliberalism, that bred many of the ills that beset us today. Neoliberalism is an economic model that lowers trade barriers, deregulates capital markets and allows money to flow wherever it will - usually to where labor is cheapest. Over the past generation, both parties have given neoliberalism their support.</p><p> In fact, the system has underpinned the past 40 years or so of globalization. To be fair, it has lifted billions of people out of poverty, particularly overseas, mainly by opening global trade. As emerging markets have joined in the free-market system, a new global middle class has been born, and at a global level, inequality has decreased.</p><p> But it's also allowed for huge in-equalities within individual countries and created bigger and more damaging financial crises around the world. What happens in one economy affects what happens in another thousands of miles away. When capital can flow in and out of countries at will, financial speculation can imperil economies half a world away.</p><p> The two biggest beneficiaries of globalization since 2000 have been, research shows, China and big companies. China benefited from the inflow of global capital looking for cheap labor. This contributed to growth and rising wages there, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which suffered by comparison in many other countries. (As a state-run system, China could manage some of the downsides of globalization more easily, ring-fencing strategic sectors or limiting capital inflows when necessary.)</p><p> The other winners are big companies that, thanks to their global footprints, are able to fly miles over the problems - and the laws - of any particular nation. They can move jobs, capital and profits wherever they like, which allows them to leverage all the benefits of the current system, without dealing with the downsides - in the form of growing inequality, skill shortages or rising populism - with which nations themselves have to wrestle.</p><p> Tech companies have enjoyed this neoliberal benefit - only on steroids. If capital can flow more easily across borders than either labor or goods, data - which is Big Tech's real currency - is like quicksilver: It moves even more freely. According to McKinsey Global Institute figures, about 80 percent of all corporate wealth is now living in 10 percent of companies, which are richest in data and intellectual property. Those assets can be located anywhere - which is why tech firms typically pay even less in taxes as a percentage of revenue than other types of multinational companies.</p><p> It's no surprise that public trust in the elites who run such firms is at record lows. The anti-elite sentiment was a powerful driver in producing the phenomenon of Trump and remains potent, in the United States and overseas. And yet the tech giants seem oblivious to this fact. That's partly because they came of age when the private sector was ascendant, when greed was good and when government showed little interest in regulation. Which might help explain why so many tech companies' PR is tin-eared: They simply don't remember a time when things were any different or have any idea of why they should be.</p><p> Warren is a logical tribune for this moment. She may have worked as a bankruptcy lawyer, but at heart, she's an economic nationalist. Her policies would empower the public sector to redistribute some of the wealth hoarded by multinational companies in recent years to a broader group of stakeholders - labor, yes, but also small and midsize businesses and local communities. A Warren administration would likely push to in-source some supply chains and connect the dots between educators and job creators with new vocational programs. Her health-care plan, which might be a step too far for many Americans, at least has the intellectual coherency of her convictions - it's a top-down, nationalized approach designed to give the entire population basic coverage.</p><p> Warren is not the only politician espousing a more-regulated capitalist system, one that would owe a lot, ironically, to what unfolded in the United States in the 1960s: a consciously regulated economy at the federal level.

If you're in the aerospace industry, why would you build a different type of airplane when the current ones have worked so well? If you're a woman, could someone persuade you to shop for undergarments in a way significantly different from the way mother or grandmother did? At home, why wouldn't you simply grab a phone directory for help with a blown fuse or leaking pipe?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today's business headlines are filled with descriptions of how companies, industries and cultures are being disrupted in many ways. At the same time, innovation has become the guiding star for industry leaders as they face challenges from new marketplaces, rapidly changing customer demands and existential threats to longtime business models. Those changing trends were discussed by a Table of Experts in Denver recently.</p><p>The forum, \"How Leading Companies are Navigating Innovation and Disruption,\" was presented by Greenberg Traurig, LLP and the Denver Business Journal. The panel moderator was Pete Casillas, President and Publisher of the Denver Business Journal and panelists included George Bye, Founder and CEO of Bye Aerospace; Meghan Marsden, Co-founder of Veil Intimates; Thomas Romer, Shareholder in Greenburg Traurig's Denver office; and Chris Terrill, CEO of ANGI Home Services. The panel described how their companies have changed to accommodate current market and industry needs while continuing to shift direction in order to meet anticipated future challenges.</p><p>How do you think of your company as a disruptor?</p><p>TERRILL: I think we're disruptors at two levels. Number one, we're disrupting the traditional marketplace. If you needed a plumber or electrician in the past, you would turn to friends and family for recommendations. We're disrupting 85% of the business that previously occurred offline. We're a disruptor of an old-school industry by using every kind of technology than can connect people with service providers on demand. We're also disrupting within our organization: we are constantly embracing new ways of doing things, rethinking our strategy and pushing ourselves to stay fresh.</p><p>MARSDEN: We are in the business of bras and they have been made the same way for many years. We're disrupting both in the manufacturing process and by using a different business model. On the manufacturing side, we're literally trying to change how bras are made. Our business strategy is to add technology, so we build applications and offer license agreements to companies with existing brands of intimates and activewear. We focus on clients who have a specific need or use for that technology.\u00a0</p><p>BYE: The core of what we're doing at Bye Aerospace is electric propulsion as applied to aerospace. The aerospace industry has a legacy of propulsion systems - for a smaller airplane, it's a propeller; for a jet, it's a turbofan engine. Of course, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are relatively new but they use traditional propulsion systems. We are about as disruptive as you can possibly imagine by developing electric aircraft and solar-electric aircraft. So, if you think about a Tesla perhaps replacing a Cadillac, we're building electric and sun-powered planes to replace legacy aircraft, such as a Cessna or a Piper. But unlike electric automobiles, an electric or solar-powered aircraft is only about one-sixth the cost to operate. That is more cost disruptive than many people can imagine. Every aspect of existing aviation is off-tilt when our Sun Flyer comes to market. It's an innovation with a purpose.</p><p>ROMER: Lawyers and law firms have been slow to adopt change. But the conventional wisdom is that the practice of law will change more in the next 2 to 5 years than it has in over 200 years. What's going to happen in the legal industry will be a wave of white-collar disruption. If you hadn't noticed, there has been a lot of disruption for physicians in recent years. What you thought you would do as a doctor years ago is a heck of a lot different than what you do today. Lawyers may be disrupted in different ways, but they will certainly be disrupted.\u00a0For example, last year, we saw a software program introduced that they estimate can eliminate 360,000 hours of loan officer and lawyer review. 360,000 hours is the equivalent of an entire law firm of 200 people working for one year. The software program can do the work in seconds. Lenders would be saving about $162 million in legal fees based on an average rate of $400 per hour.</p><p>Law firms are going to have to be more proactive when faced with those types of changes. To survive, law firms will need to constantly change and reinvent. Author Thomas Friedman said that the current pace of change is so rapid that it has already surpassed our ability to adapt to those changes.\u00a0That's what Greenberg Traurig is working at: figuring out how lawyers can continually adapt to a market that is constantly changing.</p><p>Can you think of what successes have come to your businesses by virtue of being a disruptor? What has made you more successful than just being the next generation of the Yellow Pages?</p><p>TERRILL: The best evidence, I think, of our disruption is our financial results. Since we rebranded ServiceMagic to HomeAdvisor and acquired Angie's List, the best outcome for us has been our financial success. We've been highly profitable in this space and our success will depend on our ability to continue to see where this space is going.\u00a0</p><p>Can you think of a way that your approach has been particularly successful in your industry?</p><p>MARSDEN: Our founders do not have backgrounds in apparel or engineering, so our learning curve was steep. We learned to understand our industry. The successes we've had are because we've created partnerships with higher-education institutions, leveraging and adding manufacturing, and using metric integration into apparel. What that means for the future is using our technology and biometrics to create custom apparel. We can use information to help physicians with their patients and advocate for their health.\u00a0</p><p>What are some of the unique challenges you've faced going at an established industry?</p><p>BYE: People are continually asking, \"How big are your batteries [to power an airplane]? Aren't they heavy?\"\u00a0However, as technology has advanced, we've all seen smaller and more powerful batteries with our electric devices. For instance, electric cars now have longer range batteries and the number of available charging stations is beginning to catch up. As a disruptor, we're forecasting technology trends and bringing those advances to market to solve a problem. The challenge in my industry, aerospace, is that we have deep legacy roots. It's hard to make transitions as significant as what we are introducing. With our tenacity and our innovation, we're overcoming the objections step by step. Ultimately, it will result in our success.</p><p>You have conversations all the time with clients who are wondering what their business will look like. Would you say that - more often than not - innovators have very well-defined business plans or are they figuring out things as they go along? Or is it a little bit of both?</p><p>ROMER: A lot of people start with plans but they're not always the plans that work. You can make plans but you need to be ready to change them and adapt to the market. Law firms need to be more adaptable, too.\u00a0Many firms have begun to adopt project management tools and practices to help their clients and themselves adapt to change.\u00a0At GT, we have begun to focus on how agile project management can help us to deliver better services to our clients.\u00a0Deals and cases change constantly and you need to be ready to adapt to those changes - you need to be agile.\u00a0We need to be focused and smart but we have to be agile, too. The lawyer of the future must be prepared to pivot, to change how they practice because everything's changing.</p><p>How did your business plan look compared to where you are now?</p><p>MARSDEN: We were originally very interested in the medical space, making customized apparel for women who have undergone mastectomies or lumpectomies. Through this process, we found we could help the everyday consumer and create something that works for them. We leveraged our network and reached out to experts in higher-end fashion to discuss customized bras because we saw where consumers wanted products to be. Eight months ago, I would not have told you we would be working to create a product for an activewear client. In a consumer marketplace, you have to be ready to pivot. As an entrepreneur, you have to see where the opportunities will grow.</p><p>Have you installed in your management or operation the ability to look for continued innovation?</p><p>TERRILL: We've completely changed our organizational structure. We've taken it from a top-down entrepreneurial structure and have flattened out our management with the goal of becoming a true meritocracy. The concept is that my ideas should be challenged more than anyone else's. What I want to see is more ideas coming up from down below the management level. It doesn't matter where the idea comes from - it matters whether it's the best idea for the organization. The culture of our company is radically different from when I first arrived and that is a good thing for innovation.</p><p>BYE: Being agile in aerospace means suddenly adapting to something new and applying technology. A new model of a traditionally configured airplane takes three years to develop and three years to become certified. If you're talking about a new approach or a new technology propulsion system, we're talking long, long wait times for FAA approvals. One aspect of aerospace innovation is the absolute tenacity to a vision of bringing about some type of change.</p><p>ROMER: Culture is really important. At Greenberg Traurig, we call our culture \"freedom within a framework.\" We empower our lawyers to go do their own work in their own way. Someone out there in your business might have the next great idea, but if your culture squashes a person's desire to raise their hand, you're killing your ability to generate new ideas. At GT, we are really focused on empowering our attorneys to find new and better ways to serve our clients.\u00a0We built our culture to generate and foster new ideas.\u00a0That is where our success will be found.</p><p>How has innovation affected current business social and legal paradigms?</p><p>ROMER: The paradigm shift that is happening in law is really interesting. The legal industry is basically a guild.\u00a0We try to prevent competition and of course, protect legal service users, by prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law.\u00a0Which means that no one can offer legal services without a law license.\u00a0However, companies are disrupting that model and appear not to follow those rules. It's similar to how ride share companies appeared to ignore public transportation regulations and created a business model that regulators said wasn't compliant. But suddenly, everyone was using ride share companies and regulators had to figure out a way to approve it. If lawyers are so na\u00efve as to think our little guild is going to protect us for the next 10 or 15 years, we're going to wake up and see something new in the marketplace that is so popular our regulators will have to accept it even if it could be technically unauthorized practice of law.</p><p>BYE: With the electric airplane, there were no existing regulations for them. FAA regulators had to start from scratch and be creative.</p><p>There probably is some social paradigm shifting in getting fitted for a bra. Talk about some of the situations you're encountering. Are people embracing this concept?</p><p>MARSDEN: No woman is claiming to enjoy the process of a bra-fitting today. I think that area is ripe for disruption and people want it. The technology side is being able to scan or use your phone as opposed to walking into a store for a fitting. From a social perspective, we're going to see something that's really individualized for that person. That's why we're seeing some big-box retailers starting to fail, because people like to shop online and find products specifically for them. We fully expect for that to be a continuing trend. I think the most successful companies are embracing that concept. There is a Chinese company in Arkansas that is using robotics to create apparel. Adidas just opened a facility in Atlanta for customizing shoes, so we're starting to see a more customized approach in manufacturing.</p><p>The market you operate in has been very traditional and word-of-mouth. If I'm a consumer looking to hire a trusted plumber, where do you think is the biggest value-added point in this paradigm shift?</p><p>TERRILL: What people don't understand is that home services is an incredibly complicated marketplace. We are constantly balancing supply and demand. If you think about 500 services we offer and the number of zip codes. In the case of a roofer, you have to have the capacity available to provide the service and the exact right match for what the customer wants. We have to put those things together seamlessly so the result is the best outcome. The paradigm shift is to have someone readily available to service the customer. You have to be able to have someone who can be there almost immediately or within a couple of hours. That's a big change from the old ways of doing things when you had to look through the Yellow Pages or an online directory. Back then, you might call someone who couldn't help you for two weeks. We're experiencing a fundamental shift in how people get home services. Now, with a smartphone, an individual business person or small firm can be available to deal with a customer or book an appointment quickly.</p><p>When you think of other innovators or disruptors who've had an influence on you or what you're trying to accomplish, what are some of those benchmarks from which you've taken inspiration?</p><p>BYE: About 10 years ago, I had the opportunity to tour Elon Musk's Tesla facility and got to see what would become the Tesla Roadster. The electric motor was the size of a watermelon. The vision there was to create electric vehicles. I got to take a ride in this prototype Roadster. When it came to acceleration, it was like a rocket. I thought that if this concept could be applied to cars, what would that look like for aerospace?</p><p>HomeAdvisor has been a tremendous success. What advice do you give other companies who are trying to foster an innovative culture?\u00a0</p><p>TERRILL: I tell people to think about the culture you want to create and the people you want to have around. I want to find toxicity in the organization and root it out. Toxicity can eat an organization from the inside out. I don't care what your company size is: if you have good people who are intellectually honest and put the business first, you are not toxic. I've known some Ivy Leaguers who were really toxic and too disruptive to the organization. I've seen many companies get sidetracked because there was so much chaos, so much infighting and too many egos that they couldn't take that good idea and get to the next level.</p><p>ROMER: Culture matters. At Greenberg Traurig, we encourage a habit of innovation. We also foster trust. A good leader makes sure that everyone trusts the system but fostering that trust is hard when there is a lot of change. The successful firms are going to be the ones whose lawyers trust that the change is going to benefit them.</p><p>MARSDEN: I agree with what the others said. We are where we are because we've built a truly phenomenal team. It really helps to be a good listener and to embrace the team in a cooperative environment. You need to have a culture of trust and sharing ideas.</p><p>BYE: You have to have tenacity and a fire in your belly. You have to have a vision for creating what the future might be. Secondly, there is failure. You have to deal with a failure and learn how to manage to work past it. I call it \"fail forward.\" When you fail, you fail forward into a solution. Expect failure but have the maturity and processes to deal with it.</p><p>Give us an inkling into where the future innovation lies for your company or industry?</p><p>TERRILL: Voice technologies. If you thought the web browser wars were big, just wait for the voice wars. The big tech companies are playing for a huge prize, which will be to own the platform for voice - the voice that will follow you in your car, at home and at work. The company that owns that portal will have access to everything. I think it will transform many industries in a way that many people haven't begun to think about.</p><p>MARSDEN: Once a customer completes the scanning process, a company can manufacture something custom and deliver it to your door. It might be a bra or apparel.</p><p>David Palmer, Managing Shareholder of Greenberg Traurig's Denver office, introduced the program for a crowd of over one hundred at the firm's future office space at 1144 15th Street.

First, the \u201cmore harm than good\u201d question has hardly been answered. Second, the accusations and concerns about the four companies whose leaders will testify are not the same. The problem Google represents with its power over search is far different from the problem Amazon represents as the nation\u2019s most powerful retailer.</p><p>Our concerns are twofold. One is that Congress will do nothing. Washington is now awash in tech\u2019s lobbying money and its anesthetizing hold over the average representative.</p><p>The second worry is that Congress will do the wrong thing, using antitrust power as the primary reform tool.</p><p>Breaking up major tech companies before enacting more basic regulatory reforms won\u2019t resolve the problems that underlie Big Tech\u2019s power. And it would do nothing to address the most serious complaints Americans have about the way technology impacts our lives: by driving social division and spreading misinformation.</p><p>Wednesday\u2019s hearing might be a good photo op for Congress. But it would have been more effective if, instead of one grand show, there had been four individual hearings in which each company\u2019s problems could be examined in turn.</p><p>Amazon and Apple enjoy enormous market share for the goods they provide. Investigating whether there are anti-competitive practices baked into operations is important. But it\u2019s hardly time to say either company controls its areas of commerce.</p><p>Meanwhile, much of the power that Google and Facebook enjoy issues from their ability to capture massive amounts of user data. It\u2019s well past time for the U.S. to get serious about data privacy.</p><p>Beyond that, the Facebook problem is really a social media problem, and Facebook, once again, is standing in at Wednesday\u2019s hearing for every social media company, including Twitter and Reddit, whose practices are just as troubling. All of these social media firms play a role in dividing the nation even as they\u2019ve been used by foreign powers to undermine democracy.</p><p>The way to address this problem is to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and pull back on the libel protections these companies enjoy.</p><p>If Congress is wise, it will look at the problems Big Tech represents not as uniform but as multifarious and in need of different solutions.</p><p>We can only hope that Congress gets there before we learn Big Tech has harmed our society in ways we cannot repair.</p><p>Correction: An editorial Tuesday about the killing of Garrett Foster during a protest in Austin incorrectly referred to Foster and Whitney Mitchell as husband and wife. They were engaged to be married.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DALNWS-75597447</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DALNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G4-HVY1-DY2D-K0M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11802</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS</copyright><publicationName>THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15041\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>1 EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Today, the series ends with market power: ad technology dominance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As German publisher Axel Springer's senior vice-president Dr. Dietrich von Kl&amp;#228;den told the INMA, all news media companies today \"are facing the challenges of a dysfunctional online advertising market in which two-thirds of the advertising revenues are going to two global digital platforms.</p><p>\"High-quality journalism is expensive to produce,\" he said. \"At the moment, the platforms take all journalistic content and use it without adequate financial compensation.\"</p><p>Publishers and advertisers often have no choice but to use - and sometimes pay for - a tech giant's related tools and products when wanting to advertise or publish content on their platforms. These tools offer little transparency around policies and processes including ad exchanges, which are digital marketplaces that allow companies and publishers to buy and sell advertising space, often through real-time auctions.</p><p>Google's market share of ad exchange services is 66 per cent. Its closest competitor holds 11 per cent of the market. Google used that dominance in April to launch \"unified pricing rules,\" which stopped publishers from setting granular pricing, limiting how they compete. A month later it dealt publishers another blow when it introduced a \"fair access agreement\" requiring competitors to provide Google with visibility on all their bids and transactions.</p><p>Possible solutions:</p><p>Revamp fees, commissions and revenue sharing.</p><p>Platforms should lower fees they impose on publishers for everything from web hosting to licences for technologies - because publishers are engaged in working for the public good and producing quality journalism, INMA says. It believes such a solution is possible because it has already seen platforms strive to be flexible in signing different revenue fee deals based on the size and prominence of news publishers. Facebook, INMA points out, has led the way by introducing a news subscription tool at no cost or hidden fees for publishers. \"This improved on Google's attempt to undercut Apple by introducing a 5 per cent fee for a subscription transaction, which Google has said repeatedly is only to cover its cost,\" INMA says.</p><p>Allow publishers to collectively bargain with the platforms for better terms.</p><p>INMA says Facebook and Google account for about 90 per cent of all digital advertising revenue growth, so \"they exert enormous power over publishers in all negotiations.\" Lawmakers and advocates behind the U.S. Journalism Competition and Preservation Act are attempting to change that by pushing for publications to land the ability to collectively negotiate fairer advertising revenue pricing terms without the threat of legal recourse from platforms and regulating agencies. They are hoping the act will trigger algorithm stability, increase publisher access to data, end the suppression of media brands and deliver funds to publishers. They believe the act will give them leverage to argue that because Facebook and Google license and pay for other kinds of content, including music, they should be willing to pay for news.</p><p>Remove ad sales conflicts.</p><p>INMA is calling for the regulation of ad pricing, independent auditing of the practice and the restriction of forced bundling of tools, services and products. Given that regulators have been unable to stop Google from repeatedly swallowing up ad tech businesses, INMA would also like to see Google separate its ad technologies from its advertising business and hold them in a separate, possibly independent trust. INMA believes this could lower costs and drive competition in the ad market.</p><p>Ad tech regime.</p><p>INMA has suggested tech companies could create an independent, non-profit ad tech regime that links clients directly with all entertainment, music, news and web publishing companies. INMA believes this would reduce fees and repatriate most or all of the 70 per cent of ad money that currently disappears to intermediaries standing between advertisers and publishers.</p><p>National ID sign-ons.</p><p>A global initiative that would create national identification sign-ons across banking, telecommunications companies, retail and news media using hyper-secure technology could quash the destructive allure of using platforms for sign-ins, INMA argues. Such a sign-in would be as simple to use as those currently operated by tech platforms, but would bypass the platforms altogether, allow data to be collected and ensure power is not consolidated by the digital giants. It would also disrupt Apple's current model, which requires apps in its App Store with social login opportunities to offer sign-ins with Apple ID. Apple does not share that data with publishers unless a consumer opts in and beginning later this year INMA says a new feature will allow consumers to sign up by default through an anonymized email address Apple provides to a publisher.</p><p>News in the era of big tech</p><p>A Star series is examining the effect of powerful global digital platforms on the news industry.

Today, the series ends with market power: ad technology dominance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As German publisher Axel Springer's senior vice-president Dr. Dietrich von Kl&amp;#228;den told the INMA, all news media companies today \"are facing the challenges of a dysfunctional online advertising market in which two-thirds of the advertising revenues are going to two global digital platforms.</p><p>\"High-quality journalism is expensive to produce,\" he said. \"At the moment, the platforms take all journalistic content and use it without adequate financial compensation.\"</p><p>Publishers and advertisers often have no choice but to use - and sometimes pay for - a tech giant's related tools and products when wanting to advertise or publish content on their platforms. These tools offer little transparency around policies and processes including ad exchanges, which are digital marketplaces that allow companies and publishers to buy and sell advertising space, often through real-time auctions.</p><p>Google's market share of ad exchange services is 66 per cent. Its closest competitor holds 11 per cent of the market. Google used that dominance in April to launch \"unified pricing rules,\" which stopped publishers from setting granular pricing, limiting how they compete. A month later it dealt publishers another blow when it introduced a \"fair access agreement\" requiring competitors to provide Google with visibility on all their bids and transactions.</p><p>Possible solutions:</p><p>Revamp fees, commissions and revenue sharing.</p><p>Platforms should lower fees they impose on publishers for everything from web hosting to licences for technologies - because publishers are engaged in working for the public good and producing quality journalism, INMA says. It believes such a solution is possible because it has already seen platforms strive to be flexible in signing different revenue fee deals based on the size and prominence of news publishers. Facebook, INMA points out, has led the way by introducing a news subscription tool at no cost or hidden fees for publishers. \"This improved on Google's attempt to undercut Apple by introducing a 5 per cent fee for a subscription transaction, which Google has said repeatedly is only to cover its cost,\" INMA says.</p><p>Allow publishers to collectively bargain with the platforms for better terms.</p><p>INMA says Facebook and Google account for about 90 per cent of all digital advertising revenue growth, so \"they exert enormous power over publishers in all negotiations.\" Lawmakers and advocates behind the U.S. Journalism Competition and Preservation Act are attempting to change that by pushing for publications to land the ability to collectively negotiate fairer advertising revenue pricing terms without the threat of legal recourse from platforms and regulating agencies. They are hoping the act will trigger algorithm stability, increase publisher access to data, end the suppression of media brands and deliver funds to publishers. They believe the act will give them leverage to argue that because Facebook and Google licenses and pays for other kinds of content, including music, they should be willing to pay for news.</p><p>Remove ad sales conflicts.</p><p>INMA is calling for the regulation of ad pricing, independent auditing of the practice and the restriction of forced bundling of tools, services and products. Given that regulators have been unable to stop Google from repeatedly swallowing up ad tech businesses, INMA would also like to see Google separate its ad technologies from its advertising business and hold them in a separate, possibly independent trust. INMA believes this could lower costs and drive competition in the ad market.</p><p>Ad tech regime.</p><p>INMA has suggested tech companies could create an independent, non-profit ad tech regime that links clients directly with all entertainment, music, news and web publishing companies. INMA believes this would reduce fees and repatriate most or all of the 70 per cent of ad money that currently disappears to intermediaries standing between advertisers and publishers.</p><p>National ID sign-ons.</p><p>A global initiative that would create national identification sign-ons across banking, telecommunications companies, retail and news media using hyper-secure technology could quash the destructive allure of using platforms for sign-ins, INMA argues. Such a sign-in would be as simple to use as those currently operated by tech platforms, but would bypass the platforms altogether, allow data to be collected and ensure power is not consolidated by the digital giants. It would also disrupt Apple's current model, which requires apps in its App Store with social login opportunities to offer sign-ins with Apple ID. Apple does not share that data with publishers unless a consumer opts in and beginning later this year INMA says a new feature will allow consumers to sign up by default through an anonymized email address Apple provides to a publisher.</p><p>Last in a Star series examining the effect of powerful global digital platforms on the news industry.

Facebook, INMA points out, has led the way by introducing a news subscription tool at no cost or hidden fees for publishers. \"This improved on Google's attempt to undercut Apple by introducing a 5 per cent fee for a subscription transaction, which Google has said repeatedly is only to cover its cost,\" INMA says.</p><p>Allow publishers to collectively bargain with the platforms for better terms.</p><p>INMA says Facebook and Google account for about 90 per cent of all digital advertising revenue growth, so \"they exert enormous power over publishers in all negotiations.\" Lawmakers and advocates behind the U.S. Journalism Competition and Preservation Act are attempting to change that by pushing for publications to land the ability to collectively negotiate fairer advertising revenue pricing terms without the threat of legal recourse from platforms and regulating agencies. They are hoping the act will trigger algorithm stability, increase publisher access to data, end the suppression of media brands and deliver funds to publishers. They believe the act will give them leverage to argue that because Facebook and Google license and pay for other kinds of content, including music, they should be willing to pay for news.</p><p>Remove ad sales conflicts.</p><p>INMA is calling for the regulation of ad pricing, independent auditing of the practice and the restriction of forced bundling of tools, services and products. Given that regulators have been unable to stop Google from repeatedly swallowing up ad tech businesses, INMA would also like to see Google separate its ad technologies from its advertising business and hold them in a separate, possibly independent trust. INMA believes this could lower costs and drive competition in the ad market.</p><p>Ad tech regime.</p><p>INMA has suggested tech companies could create an independent, non-profit ad tech regime that links clients directly with all entertainment, music, news and web publishing companies. INMA believes this would reduce fees and repatriate most or all of the 70 per cent of ad money that currently disappears to intermediaries standing between advertisers and publishers.</p><p>National ID sign-ons.</p><p>A global initiative that would create national identification sign-ons across banking, telecommunications companies, retail and news media using hyper-secure technology could quash the destructive allure of using platforms for sign-ins, INMA argues. Such a sign-in would be as simple to use as those currently operated by tech platforms, but would bypass the platforms altogether, allow data to be collected and ensure power is not consolidated by the digital giants. It would also disrupt Apple's current model, which requires apps in its App Store with social login opportunities to offer sign-ins with Apple ID. Apple does not share that data with publishers unless a consumer opts in and beginning later this year INMA says a new feature will allow consumers to sign up by default through an anonymized email address Apple provides to a publisher.</p><p>Last in a Star series examining the effect of powerful global digital platforms on the news industry.
