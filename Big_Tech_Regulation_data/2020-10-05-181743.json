I'm Jesse Watters along with Dagen McDowell, Juan Williams, Lisa Boothe, and Greg.  It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a Fox News alert, President Trump refusing to back down on his border battle to build the wall, Trump issuing the first veto of his presidency to overrule a resolution that blocks his national emergency declaration at the border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  The protection of the nation is my highest duty.  Yesterday, Congress passed a dangerous resolution that if sign into law would put countless Americans in danger, very grave danger.  It is definitely a national emergency.  Rarely have we had such a national emergency.</p><p>Therefore, to defend the safety and security of all Americans, I will be signing and issuing a formal veto of this reckless resolution at -- Congress has vote to deny the crisis on the southern border is a vote against reality, it's against reality.  It is a tremendous national emergency.</p><p>It is a tremendous crisis.  People hate the word invasion, but that's what it is.  It's an invasion of drugs and criminals and people.  Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution, and I have the duty to veto it, and I'm very proud to veto it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS:  So, Mr. Gutfeld, I watched this press conference in full and I think he stole one of your lines.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  What did he say?</p><p>WATTERS:  He said they were border deniers, and then even reality deniers, I think.  What do you think?  Do you think he's watching THE FIVE?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Maybe, perhaps.  I don't think he watches much Fox though.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know -- you look back at an era growing up, the 90's would be grunge, you know, the 80's acid wash, the 70's Jimmy Carter.  This year is going to be the wall.  Because I feel like -- that's every day we're always talking about the wall.  It's part of his kind of -- like the bigger picture which is safe at home, an appreciation of law enforcement, so you have a lot of the police there.  You have -- trying to eradicate the terror threat and you have military -- the military buildup, so all these things are part of one vision.</p><p>So he tends to see it as that.  And other people see it as fear mongering because that kind of belief can be seen as fear mongering.  You want a strong military.  You want a wall.  You want law enforcement -- oh, my God, you're scaring people.  So, unfortunately something that he believes in can be recast as something wrong.  They brought up a fact in there that I -- you know, made me think about the other half of this story, the number one leading cause of death for people under 50 -- what he said drug overdose.  One of the officers said that there.</p><p>So I say, what about that?  You know, the fault isn't in the dealers alone.  You know, the drugs keep coming because we keep using.  And I think there is -- there's a refusal to admit that often the drug war doesn't make things any better.  We're seeing this with the opioid mess where we're trying to reduce -- we're reducing the legal ways to get opioids and that ends up in overdoses on fentanyl, which is one of the gentlemen spoke about his son dying on fentanyl.  So we still haven't addressed maybe the underpinnings of this story which is our desire for oblivion.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's right.  People like to get zonked out of their minds and, you know --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Great summary.</p><p>WATTERS:  You've done it.  You've done it.  I'm sure Juan has done it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Agree on my point.</p><p>WATTERS:  Juan, now, speaking of zonked out of their minds, Nancy Pelosi says she's going to hold a vote to overturn this veto, but she needs, I guess, two thirds of the Senate to uphold the override and that's just not possible mathematically.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Not at the moment.  But what we saw was the tremendous number -- I think it was 13 Republicans who voted with the 40 -- with the Democrats in the Senate.  And so what you're getting there is not veto-proof majority, but you're getting in that direction.</p><p>WATTERS:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And what you've got to understand here is that you have essentially a manufactured crisis --</p><p>WATTERS:  Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- you have 50 --</p><p>WATTERS:  Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Remember, I'm zonked out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Because in Trump world I'm zonked out.  So allow me to speak.</p><p>WATTERS:  OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But you get 58 national security officials saying this is not right.  Don't do it.  You have in terms of the polling in the country, 64 percent oppose the emergency declaration, 58 percent oppose the wall.  This isn't close, folks.  But for Trump it's all about Trump and Trump's political promises --</p><p>WATTERS:  I'll hit you back with that line.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm shocked.  I'm amazed that we're here on day 30 of the national emergency.  Cover your head.</p><p>WATTERS:  Those 50 people were mostly Obama people.  And if you listen to the actual sheriffs --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, yeah.</p><p>WATTERS: -- if you watch the press conference, they don't say it's manufactured.  They say it's a huge crisis, Lisa.</p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS HOST:  Yeah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And they invited a lot of these congressmen and women and senators to come down and see it for themselves before they cast their next vote.</p><p>BOOTHE:  Juan, you're zonked out, my friend, because even President Obama in 2014 was talking about the crisis we had along the border.  He did so in the Rose Garden.  He talked about traffickers bringing unaccompanied minors across the border, calling on Congress to do something because we had a humanitarian crisis.  That humanitarian crisis remains today.</p><p>There's been 260,000 illegal immigrants apprehended at the border.  Ninety percent -- since October, 90 percent increase from last year.  ICE is giving pregnancy tests to young girls over the age of 10 because of the amount of rapes and sexual assaults that are experienced along the journey.  So, of course, we have a humanitarian crisis.  The question is if a national emergency the way to solve it?  I don't know.</p><p>But the point being is that what we're seeing right now is everyone exercising their authority under the national emergencies act.  President Trump has broad authority to declare a national emergency under the act.  Congress also gave themselves the authority to try to rescind that national emergency.  President Trump has the authority to then veto, and then Congress can try to find the votes, two thirds in the House and Senate to override it.</p><p>So, essentially, everyone is exercising the authorities that they have under the act.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What you just said, though, if this is not the caravan.  This is not like someone invading our country, Lisa.  We have a humanitarian --</p><p>GUTFELD:  But you saw the caravan (INAUDIBLE) crisis first off, Juan.  You were the first person.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I say -- look --</p><p>BOOTHE:  How is it not a crisis?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's so different than talking about --</p><p>GUTFELD:  How is it?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- an invasion where you send troops and you declare a national --</p><p>GUTFELD:  People die no matter what you call it.  People die.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  By the way, never, never has any national emergency been declared to get around the fact that Congress won't fund.  This is an exceptional --</p><p>WATTERS:  Why did they write the act that way, Juan?  I mean, did Congress write an unconstitutional act?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, no.  They say it's never been done is all I'm saying.  They wrote it.</p><p>WATTERS:  Dagen, I don't see how this plays out in any other way that it gets just tied up in the courts.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST:  Yeah, it will get tied up in the courts.  I think that there were four additional states that signed on to this lawsuit challenging the emergency order bringing it to 20.  You could get an emergency injunction that stops this in its tracks for the time being.  But, listen, Juan doesn't recognize what's going on here with the Republicans because they're not being hypocritical unlike the Democrats.</p><p>Unlike Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi who basically just sat back and let President Obama violate the separation of powers.  Let's go through the list.  As the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote, a blank check on recess appointments, environmental and financial regulations, Obamacare spending without appropriations, work permits for illegal immigrants and more all rebuked by the court system.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  So that's why you have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why -- at least the Republicans who voted against the president are voting based on their concern that the Democrats will then turn around and abuse the emergency power.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's my point to you.  So what you're saying is he shouldn't be doing it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where were you guys when Obama was doing this over and over and over again.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Nobody has ever, including Obama, ever said I'm going around the constitution --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, Juan --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p><p>BOOTHE:  What do you think happened with DACA, Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That was not about funding.</p><p>BOOTHE:  It was a massive overreach with DACA --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOOTHE: -- and DACA got stuck by the courts because --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm just saying it wasn't about the constitution --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what -- why President Trump at least so far doesn't seem to be annoyed with these Republicans because he ain't calling them name on twitter yet.  Maybe Mitt Romney deserves that stupid op-ed in blowing out the birthday candles individually.</p><p>WATTERS:  You know he mentioned that, actually.  He goes, if I wanted to pressure him I would have brought the pressure.  He goes, I didn't need it because we had the votes.  But if they want to see pressure, they'll know what pressure is.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The only reason why we're here is that the Democrats can't admit that they want what Trump wants because they can't admit that they agree with him.  We're all talking about the same thing.  We want an enforced border but they can't admit it because that means Trump's right.  That's all this is about.  It's petty political team sport.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm glad you said that because I think Democrats do want it, but I think for the longest time what you hear from Republicans, oh, Democrats don't.  But you're right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  We have a history here -- a history of Democrats funding this kind of stuff --</p><p>WATTERS:  I'm not so sure the Democrats really want --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Trump has made it about him and his political promise --</p><p>GUTFELD:  But Democrats made it about him as well.</p><p>WATTERS:  All right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Let's face it, they've made it about him.  He is a large character, Juan.  So it's hard not to --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait, it was his campaign promise.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.  And so they've made it about him.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, no.  He says --</p><p>GUTFELD:  They can't give it to him.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- because, guess what, Republicans in the first two years didn't do this, did they?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yeah, because they needed more votes in the Senate.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh.</p><p>WATTERS:  Disturbing new details in the New Zealand terror attack that killed 49 people, plus President Trump's reaction to that up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Earlier today, I spoke with Prime Minister Arden of New Zealand to express the sorrow of our entire nation following the monstrous terror attacks at two mosques.  These sacred places of worship were turned into scenes of evil killing.  You've all been seeing what went on.  It's a horrible, horrible thing.  I told the prime minister that the United States is with them all the way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump reacting to the horrific New Zealand terror attacks.  The prime minister there calling it one of her country's darkest days after a gunman opened fire in two mosques killing 49 people.  A suspect has been arrested and charged with murder, as reports indicate he live streamed the murders on social media, on Facebook.  Jonathan Hunt has more of the details.  Jonathan, what can you tell us?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, the live streamed video of this attack is horrific to watch.  We will not show it but we have watched it for the sake of accurately reporting what happened.  You see on the video the gunman drive calmly toward the mosque, playing music and talking to himself.  He approaches the entrance and fires his first shots at two men.  They drop to the ground.  One tries to crawl away desperately.</p><p>The gunman walks up behind him and fires several more shots.  The man stops moving.  Then the gunman moves into the main prayer room where two large groups of worshipers are already cowering in two separate corners.  The shooter fires dozens of rounds into each group.  One man appears to run at the gunman but is shot at point blank range.  The shooter then turns his attention to the groups again firing even more shots.</p><p>He reloads several times, walks back into the hallway and then back into the main room.  Many of the men there are already dead.  Some appear to be wounded.  The gunman walks slowly toward them taking kill shots finishing off his victims with bullets to the head or body.  By our count, the gunman fires around 187 rounds within just the first two and a half minutes of the attack.</p><p>Once he leaves the mosque, he shoots several people on the street.  Including a woman wearing traditional Muslim dress.  She's wounded.  She lies on the street crying out for help.  The gunman walks up to her and once again delivers the final shots directly to the woman's head.  He then gets back in his car.  He drives over that woman's body and continues to shoot other people from his vehicle.</p><p>There is no sign at that point of any police officers.  The video stops after about 16 gut-wrenching minutes and by our count, 236 shots fired.  Now the gunman also left online a manifesto of sorts.  It's long, it's rambling in places, precise in others.  The gunman makes his motivation very clear, intimidating, repelling, and killing what he repeatedly calls Muslim invaders.</p><p>He says mass immigration is a threat to civilization.  And at one point he poses a question to himself are you a supporter of President Trump?  His answer, quote, as a symbol of renewed white entity and common purpose, sure, as a policy maker and leader, dear God, no.  The gunman who was taken into custody alive also said in his manifesto that he hopes to go to trial where he will plead not guilty because in his view he was taking action against what he calls an occupying force.</p><p>Leaders around the world, including President Trump have refuted that idea saying it was an act of pure hate, pure evil.  I used to live in Christchurch for a time after 9/11, Dagen.  I can tell you it is a beautiful and peaceful place.  It is like a snapshot from the 1950's, immune, somehow, to the problems of the modern world.  Well, it is around 10 AM Saturday in Christchurch right now and everybody there and across New Zealand is literally and figuratively waking up to a whole new reality.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jonathan, thank you so much.  Greg, I want to focus on the social media aspect of this that this was live streamed on Facebook and only removed by Facebook after it was flagged to them by the New Zealand police.  It showed up on other social media sites on YouTube and on Twitter.  They're not doing anything to stop this.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, I don't -- two things.  I don't know what you can do right now -- a few weeks ago on Twitter they were suspending people for tweeting the phrase learn to code.  So if you're spreading yourself that thin chasing that stuff, it's like having the FBI go after gum chewing on the subway.  You're not going to get the real crime.  They're trying to figure this out.  I've said this a couple of days ago, technology is ahead of humanity.  We aren't catching up to it so we have this vulnerability.</p><p>The biggest issue -- we talk about this after every shooting is the copycat effect.  That's why we never mention the guy's name.  That's why we try not to cover it, blanket coverage, because blanket coverage enlarges the spotlight which is what they want.  Each shooter cites previous shooters.  That is a fact.  Each one inspires the next.</p><p>My worry is that because he filmed it he gave it a wider -- wider reach for more people to see, expanding his footprint and it is our -- I wound not just go after social media, it is our responsibility in the media to shrink that footprint to as small as possible.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jesse, and I should correct myself, I said they're not doing anything.  Facebook says that it has 15,000 contractors and employees reviewing content as part of a 30,000 person team working on it.  But I can say this, since they launched livestreaming there have been murders.  There have been suicides.  In fact, there was a man in Thailand who killed his 11-month-old daughter in a live video and that was two years ago, and we still have this going on.</p><p>WATTERS:  Well, I don't know what anybody can do about that because we live in a free society.  So people can use technology however they want, and you have to catch up with the fact afterwards.  And that's the unfortunate situation.  Now, I don't understand how the media can lie about this guy's manifesto.  I read it.  The manifesto, if you read it, does not attribute this guy's philosophy to Donald Trump.  This is a direct quote, the nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People's Republic of China.</p><p>This guy was an eco-nationalist.  Meaning, he was a racist and thought that the immigrant population of the earth was too fertile and they were overpopulating everything and were causing climate change and they needed to be eradicated.  He said he's not a conservative.  He's not a Nazi.  And like Greg said, he was celebrating these wacko European mass shooters more than anything.</p><p>So for the media to link Donald Trump and frame Donald Trump for some lunatic's actions halfway around the world is so irresponsible and it's exactly what the guy wanted.  If you read the manifesto the guy wanted division in his country.  He wanted the left to overreact and take away guns from Republicans, and wanted to balkanize North America because that would create more racial purity in his opinion.</p><p>So, we were very responsible when the Bernie bro shot up Steve Scalise's baseball game.  We didn't attribute that to Bernie.  We didn't attribute that to the left-wing media.  We've said everyone is individually responsible for themselves.  But the media doesn't do that when it's on the other side.  They only frame Republicans.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because it's easy to tweet that this -- Trump was somehow responsible.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yeah, I could say the Israeli-Palestinian violence that's happening today, I could point to Omar and say she instigated the anti-Semitism hate against Israel and that's why.  But I wouldn't do that because that's not true.</p><p>BOOTHE:  I would say, one, I think it just takes a special kind of evil to target people in a house of worship that's supposed to be a place of refuge.  They were praying.  It's absolutely despicable and disgusting.  We obviously pray for the victims and their families as well.  I'm with Greg.  I really struggle in the fact that -- I think there's a responsibility to deny these killers what they want.  And this guy wants to live in infamy.</p><p>Clearly, he wrote a manifesto because he wanted it out.  And I'm all about denying that by not giving the manifesto any time and not giving him what he wants.  And to Greg's point about the copy cats, I spent all day today looking at statistics and studies about it and it's real and it's scary.  Dr. Steven Pitt who's a psychiatric -- did psychiatric autopsy of the Columbine shooting, he said that the shooters predicted with chilling and stunning accuracy how their actions would encourage other similarly disaffected individuals for doing the same thing.</p><p>You'll get things like the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting.  During the trial there were two similar shootings in movie theaters in two weeks after that.  ABC in 2014 did an investigation found that 17 school shooters and 36 others that tried were all partially inspired by Columbine.  The Newtown shooter had clippings, as you've said, of previous mass murders that took place.</p><p>So, clearly, these guys want infamy and we should deny it to them.  And sometimes we give it to them.  The Rolling Stone did that cover of the Boston bomber, put them on the cover.  Remember after the Virginia Tech shooting, images of the guys with the gun.  Let's deny them what they want.  Don't give them the infamy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Juan, what about shutting down people's ability to use social media?  Is that something the Democrats would be on board with?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  We're going to talk about that -- we're going to talk about later in this show because what we're seeing is an increased emphasis on either regulating or moderating, or even in Elizabeth Warren's terms breaking up some of the power because these folks are interested in money.  It's unbelievable that this 17-minute video, the police want it stopped.  It just keeps running and, of course, it spreads and it spreads to a specific niche population that's interested, you know, kind of the gamers and a little bit of a hate people all combined here for young men.  I think it's very troubling.</p><p>I just want to say, I think, imagine if a Muslim had committed such an act, I can imagine that there are a lot of people who would have gone bananas on the Muslim community here in the United States and around the world.  But what I think is the reality is, we have white nationalists anger spreading globally, his manifesto was called the great replacement and they're talking about, you know, just like we saw in Charlottesville, you will not replace us.</p><p>And we see this kind of anger being spread in such a way that I think we have to address the idea that this white nationalist fervor is now without borders because of the internet, and because -- we can't ignore it or play it down because it doesn't fit one ideology or the other --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We need to go.  But the problem is after the rage that you saw here in the United States was directed at President Trump for something -- a massacre that happened in New Zealand.  Some in the media can't get enough of Beto O'Rourke or how the heck you say his first name.  He's all the buzz over the 2020 candidates.  Is it overblown?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOOTHE:  Some in the media are overcome with Beto mania after the guy who lost to Ted Cruz officially announced he's running for president.  Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Look, I'm a little light hearted today because I like this feeling.  It got a new levity to it.  But it's not like we in the press created it.  There's something out there that is magical.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, he has a vibrancy, a youthfulness to him.  He has a message which is largely cheerful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Seeing him is like -- it's like a Jesus Christ Superstar seeing this guy in front of people.  He's got that celebrity aura about him.  And in that moment he was owning that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOTHE:  Safe to say they like him.  But the question a lot of us are asking is what has he actually accomplished.  Here's Nancy Pelosi responding, attempting to answer the question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: -- brought vitality to Congress. When he came, he came as a real champion for the environment. He got a great deal of support from the environmental community in his district. Preserving our planet and protecting our people, there are at least two areas in addition to his vitality in so many other ways.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOTHE: So, Juan, to me it looks like she's struggling to answer the question. So why Beto what has he done?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think -- around town the big cliche was Abe Lincoln he only had one term as the Congressman before he became President. But, I think clearly, the voters in El Paso liked him. And I think if you wanted to look at the actual record he was pretty good, not only on environment, but on military spending.</p><p>Today, though, I must say the guns out for Robert Francis or that's what White House likes to call him or Beto, The Washington Post had a front page story about how Republican donors had been key to the start of his camp -- of his career as a politician. And he had backed spending for some malls that pushed people out of low-income neighborhoods.</p><p>And then you also have to keep in mind that he, and I think this is really important, Lisa, sometimes I think the Right can't hear this, but he did lose to Ted Cruz. But for the people for people on the Left the idea that in Texas he challenged Ted Cruz and raised a record amount of money like $80 million, I think, really makes him a superstar.</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, you're right, he did raise a record amount of money, Jesse, but part of that was because he was running against Ted Cruz, someone that the media hates, that the left hates, so they really protected him, and his record really wasn't examined.</p><p>Now that's going to be a little bit different, Jesse. I was talking yesterday about the fact that he supports the Green New Deal allegedly, but took more money from the fossil fuel industry than anyone else besides Ted Cruz. So this stuff is going to surface and do you think it's going to end up having an impact on him?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it will. He will not release his new fundraising numbers, which is interesting. I'm not so sure they're going to beat Sanders'. They might not even beat Kamala's. Like you said, if he doesn't have a demon as the Left sees Ted Cruz as, maybe they're not going to put money in his pockets, but we'll see.</p><p>I think Chris Matthews has another throw up of his leg. It's clear he's the media darling right now and there's already Beto backlash. POLITICO says no woman got that kind of coverage and they don't like how this white male who has this privilege is being romanticized in the media. He's got the Vanity Fair cover.</p><p>They had all the reporters down there in El Paso for the counter Trump rally, and he's only been to Iowa once. And when he got up on that table in the coffee shop there were more media reporters than there were voters. So we'll see about him. The weirder he gets, I kind of like him, to be honest with you.</p><p>He was in a hacking group. He wrote some crazy stuff about murder. I don't know, he's kind of unpredictable, and that's kind of interesting and he's more fun to cover than some of the other candidates.</p><p>BOOTHE: Interesting. So the hacking group is what that just does it for you.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it -- that does it for me.</p><p>BOOTHE: All right. Greg, there's a Morning Consult poll that found that 49 percent of those polled either hadn't heard of him or have no opinion on him. Do you think he's going to be able to differentiate himself?</p><p>GUTFELD: Those people are idiots, because Beto is awesome. You guys are so mean to the guy. Look, you know what? Why does the media love him? Because he is them.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you look at him, he's just lily-white, non-threatening, liberal who likes their kind of music, right. He's kind of edgy in an inoffensive way. He looks like he probably does Pilates, I don't know. Or maybe has one of those new bikes that everybody's talking about.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, the Peloton.</p><p>GUTFELD: Peloton, thank you.</p><p>WATTERS: Why are you looking at me? I don't know that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- like he runs the Peloton --</p><p>WATTERS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: But he is the Republican with his minuses, would get nowhere. Obviously, the drunk driving arrests and they're running away from the scene, and the fact that he married an heiress. I mean, that's stuff. But if you're a Republican, would be endless --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a second, wait a second -- I know what you're going to say to me. But I believe we have a President who has no political experience.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And who has a lot of problem --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, but he hasn't been arrested.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p>GUTFELD: But you want to talk, yes, yes.</p><p>WATTERS: The Mueller report is not out.</p><p>GUTFELD: The Mueller report -- you want to talk collusion. Now you want to talk collusion, look at the -- like how -- what a coincidence that he declared when the cover came out. I mean, that's -- so that's with Vanity Fair.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, media loves him.</p><p>GUTFELD: So they like -- the thing that gets me mad -- not mad, but I find it humorous actually. How does the media not notice when they're fanboying. Like -- how can they -- when they are talking about somebody they love, do they go death, and they can't hear how hilarious they sound when they're talking about.</p><p>They're basically vomiting Valentine's -- projectile Valentine's and it's like --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have more man talk about how he's kind of a himbo and women don't see that. Quite frankly --</p><p>GUTFELD: The men, you're right the men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What like --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Himbo, it's like a male bimbo.</p><p>GUTFELD: The men are more into him than the women.</p><p>WATTERS: That's a fancy thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way is just want to say couple of things. Well, Jesse, if I squint move my chair way, you kind of look like --</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, don't you dare.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, my god.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I looked at their website, there's nothing about policy. There's just some merch for sale and a couple of photos of Beto, one where he has sweat dripping down his face.</p><p>GUTFELD: We're going to get that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. So here are -- I wrote some suggestions of things he could sell on his website to raise more money. How about a beard kit that you staple on, so you at least, look like you can split wood? I think that's his voting bus --</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. Well, maybe he'll show up in Iowa like that, maybe we'll see. All right. Well, America's top general is ripping Google, find out why next. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: America's top general warning about the potential dangers of Google's relationship China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GENERAL JOSEPH DUNFORD, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, CHAIRMAN: The work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military. We watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing that there is that indirect benefit.</p><p>In fact, frankly, indirect maybe not a full characterization of the way it really is, it's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: The company recently dropped its bid for a $10 billion Pentagon contract saying that would conflict with its corporate values, apparently not so with the Chinese. In fact, this is so interesting to me, Dagen, what General Dunford said was, you have a $5 trillion share of the Chinese economy that is state-run.</p><p>So when Google does business with the Chinese military, it essentially then is funneling that information, that strategy and technology into the Chinese economy as well. This is all thievery.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And then the company because of outrage within the liberal walls of Google decided to not do business with the U.S. Defense Department. So let's be clear, Google is not in favor of protecting the land and the nation and the people that allowed Google to be formed in the first place.</p><p>It is this kind of delusional moralizing from the people at Google. There motto used to be \"Don't be Evil\", well they got rid of that clearly if they're doing business with the Chinese, and the delusional moralizing that really hurts America.</p><p>And I just want to point -- I just quickly do the imitation of Ruth Porat, the CFO, after Hillary Clinton lost and they had this big company meeting. She was talking about Hillary losing and what a massive that it was and it was really painful, that's Google.</p><p>BOOTHE: Sounds upset.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I think that's Google. That's who works at Google.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Jesse, so what they refused to do for the Pentagon was work on cloud storage type technology and they said it was in violation of the company's principles, a lot of the workers said this. How do you interpret this?</p><p>WATTERS: Well, do the company's principles adhere to the Communist Chinese principles?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I hope not.</p><p>WATTERS: They had some pretty crazy principles over in China -- one-child policy, no freedom of speech. The Chinese have a \"Project Dragonfly\" that Google was working on with them, where they can censor all sorts of Internet content, and it looks like Google's OK with that.</p><p>What they're doing, Juan, is they're putting profits above patriotism. And you have to ask yourself, is Google an American company anymore? Or do they -- are they just this amorphous multinational conglomerate that just does whatever they want to whoever they want in search for the highest bidder?</p><p>$21 billion in revenue over there in Asia, that's a pretty penny. And like you said in the beginning, if you invest Google in China, in a commercial enterprise, they just transfer that right to the state-owned corporations. So there's a direct pipeline from commercial interests to the military-industrial complex which is run by the Communist Chinese, and they steal it on top of that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Lisa, Elizabeth Warren has been trying to say we should break up some of the Facebook, Google, Amazon, that they're just too big and too powerful. Jesse, you suggested maybe they don't have any sense of loyalty to the United States?</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, and a lot of this comes from the criticism over data, which I think is one of the biggest fake news stories of all time. The Obama team did the exact same thing at Cambridge Analytica did. The only reason anyone cared about it was because they got caught in President Trump's orbit campaigns.</p><p>Both the RNC and the DNC have massive databases of consumer information for voters across the country. Every politician that was sitting on those Committees pointing the fingers, has Mark Zuckerberg has used consumer data in way to target voters, it's all such a sham.</p><p>Not only that, there's literally no privacy anymore. You look at location services, it's a $21 billion industry in 2018, people following, you what you're doing via apps to reach you via advertising and things of that nature. Vizio was caught two years ago of like collecting data on people via smart TV.</p><p>So point is, there's no privacy, the whole thing's a sham. And the only reason anyone cared about it was because of President Trump.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think Greg disagrees. Because Greg thinks that, in fact, we should -- a lot of times people don't realize they're giving up their privacy.</p><p>GUTFELD: You have read my mind, just like Facebook. It's true. I hate Google for two reasons. The one reason that Juan is talking about is because they got me, right? I got suckered into the free Google which is -- look at this marvelous search engine. It's all your, search away, search away, and then you are the product. Because once every -- once you're using, they're just mining you, so you become the product.</p><p>#2, their employees were -- a few of their employees were upset, because they were helping with the drone -- making the drone program in the Pentagon more precise. Precise drones will help eliminate mass warfare, that's what it's about. You don't have to carpet-bomb anymore if you have precise drones.</p><p>So what they were arguing about was -- I mean, what they were defined was actually, progress that would help save millions of lives.</p><p>WATTERS: Instead of Google, Ask Jeeves --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Let's go back.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. They're rushing us, because there's so much fun about to happen, an explosion of \"Fan Mail Friday\", with maestro Gutfeld next on THE FIVE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes, Fan Mail Friday, let's get started. We don't have enough time here. Instagram question. If you were a college professor, Juan, what would you teach?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I was a philosophy major in college and I -- but I don't know much about philosophy these days. I discovered my thesis the other day in the basement. I couldn't even understand what's this guy is writing about.</p><p>GUTFELD: We feel that same way.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But now it's like I'm all steeped in politics and history, I should have majored in something that would have been useful. My mom would have appreciated it.</p><p>GUTFELD: How about you Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: I would do like history of rock and roll or bowling or something like that.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bowling, interesting.</p><p>BOOTHE: -- you still get paid and it's not really -- its I mean --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute, were you in that College scam?</p><p>GUTFELD: Dagen?</p><p>BOOTHE: I deny it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would teach --</p><p>BOOTHE: Not that you know of.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would teach speech to everybody.</p><p>GUTFELD: Speech.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- in an Ivy League school.</p><p>GUTFELD: Very good, very good. Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: I wouldn't teach. I would coach.</p><p>BOOTHE: Which sport?</p><p>GUTFELD: Why don't you teach coaching? How about that?</p><p>WATTERS: Not qualified.</p><p>GUTFELD: See, I would do a class called errands.</p><p>WATTERS: Errands?</p><p>GUTFELD: Errands. And then I would show up and just give each student an errand to run, and then I would just kick back.</p><p>WATTERS: OK.</p><p>GUTFELD: And they've learned, yes, right. There you go. Quick one. All right Sherry U. writes, \"What is the nicest thing you have done for someone else this week?</p><p>WATTERS: Why are you looking at me like that?</p><p>GUTFELD: Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: You know, I can't come up with anything. Jesus -- god, did I give a homeless guy anything? I might have -- I tipped. OK. When I get change at the Starbucks, I put the rest of the change in the tip jar.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's very good.</p><p>WATTERS: Because you probably pocket it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, when they're not looking, I take the whole tip jar.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, I don't think you're giving yourself enough credit. I bet people in your life appreciate.</p><p>WATTERS: I must have done something.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what the thing -- the problem with Jesse is he's done so much, he can't remember. He can't remember.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Have you Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I always do this. I stopped a lady in the street who looked really nice -- perfect stranger and told her that she looked really pretty.</p><p>GUTFELD: See, we can't do that. If I do that, I'm like -- I'm gone. Did you just told that woman she looked good?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's how you get arrested.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, yes. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: So I going to get two things, one, I mentored a young man. I took him to dinner and hung out with him. But secondly, I agreed to give us free speech at event.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's really good. Wow. Lisa.</p><p>WATTERS: He's like the Dana of the table now.</p><p>GUTFELD: Lisa.</p><p>BOOTHE: I don't know this week, but next month I'm watching my special-needs aunt for my parents, so they can go on vacation.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's real good.</p><p>BOOTHE: And it's a vacation I bought for them.</p><p>GUTFELD: The question has said what \"Have you done this week\", so you cheated --</p><p>BOOTHE: I know.</p><p>GUTFELD: -- by looking ahead. I could do that too. Like, next week I'm planning on schooling these orphans on errands.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think there was a pregnant lady on the subway who got on and you didn't get your -- out of the seat and give her the seat, I'm just --</p><p>GUTFELD: I give money to the guys that play music on the subway, because I like the music.</p><p>WATTERS: I thought you will do fine with the guy that plays music on the subway.</p><p>GUTFELD: Damn it Jesse, \"One More Thing\" is next.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And usurped his money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Time now for \"One More Thing\". Bernie Sanders has a big bandage on his head. Check out the Senator from Vermont there, gashed his head on the corner of the glass shower door. He's got seven stitches. Went to a walk-in clinic, keeps campaigning in South Carolina.</p><p>GUTFELD: Tough guy.</p><p>WATTERS: He's a very tough guy. Now I actually understand what happened. I myself too gashed my head --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: -- in the bathroom on Black Friday about two years ago. They did a great job with the makeup there. But there is a Band-Aid on my head, so Bernie and I have a lot in common.</p><p>GUTFELD: Run with him.</p><p>BOOTHE: Jesse that could be your nice thing this week that you just did for Bernie.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right.</p><p>BOOTHE: You may feel better.</p><p>WATTERS: I made feel better Bernie, wow, that's a low bar. All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, take a look at this scene from a month ago. Yes, that's Duke basketball star Zion Williamson falling to the floor as his Nikes tore apart. Will now take a look at this video as the star returns to the court last night</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: 29 points with a perfect night of shooting. 13 for 13, he also had 14 rebounds 5 steals. That kind of performance is going to put him at the center of March Madness. And guess what he was wearing Nikes. Yes, he's stuck with the brand. The shoemaker made a special size 15 with extra padding for the 6'7'', 285 pound college freshman. By the way NCAA tournament teams will be selected this weekend good luck to your team guys.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: And they have Tar Heels this weekend too, I think.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Big game. All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. Tomorrow night, Saturday, March 16th, 10:00 p.m. another Greg Gutfeld Show with Johnny Joey Jones, Jimmy Failla, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. And I think Jesse has a show too, but he forgot to--</p><p>WATTERS: I did.</p><p>GUTFELD: He forgot to promote it. So Jesse Show as well which is on at 8:00. Anyway animals are great, right?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Animals are Great!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Every now and then you find an animal that's not just strange, but strangely sexy. Check out the dance of the Bateleur eagle -- Bateleur is French for tightrope walker. And I got to tell you something, there's something really interesting. I want one of these.</p><p>WATTERS: Is that a real thing?</p><p>GUTFELD: That is a real thing. That is not a man in a furry suit, although, I have been known to dress up like that on the weekends, downtown just to make some extra money.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. That's -- it's called the</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Animals are Great!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: That was real. I think might be high.</p><p>WATTERS: Before we get to dig and I'm going to plug my show. 8:00 p.m. we have Dana Loesch and we have Kellyanne Conway in. I interview a birth striker, she won't have kids, because she's afraid the climate is going to kill the earth. All right, there it is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Dagen McDowell.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So man's flying into the Berlin Airport from Cairo with, what he says, were some cakes, little chocolate cakes. Officers stopped him and said -- he said, \"I have nothing to declare\". And they said, \"Let's look in this box\". They're not cakes, they were tortoises -- living Moroccan tortoises.</p><p>WATTERS: That's trouble.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That the border veterinarian, who knew there were veterinarians at the border, that's good to hear, confiscated the animals. Hopefully, they're safe. The guy faces up to $56,000 fine, could end up in prison. If you love tortoises and turtles, go to the turtle conservancy to figure out how to save them all.</p><p>BOOTHE: So real quick, so I wouldn't go out of time. But tune in next Thursday to Fox &amp; Friends our March 21st -- Thursday, March 21st, I'm doing the interview with John's Crazy Socks with Co-Founder John Lee Cronin and a young man an entrepreneur with Down Syndrome. I hung out with him, his dad and the rest of the team. Please tune in, it's really special.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, that is nice.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I met him in the green room.</p><p>BOOTHE: He's lovely. It was a beautiful day. It was really cool.</p><p>WATTERS: Can you score me some free socks --</p><p>GUTFELD: Of course, Jesse. You always want the free stuff, don't you?</p><p>WATTERS: Don't you?</p><p>BOOTHE: You wear socks? What kind -- what kind, I can put a word in.</p><p>WATTERS: Anything that matches like a nice navy suit.</p><p>BOOTHE: OK.</p><p>WATTERS: That's it for us. We'll see you back here on Monday. Have a nice weekend everybody.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2193264787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWW-J2P1-DY0W-42X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7287\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Many of you are friends, and many of you are friends that I don't know what you look like, but I know what you sound like -- (laughter) -- which, I guess, is probably more important. Right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I want to thank you. And it's a terrific -- it's a terrific day to be together. And, if you look, you're in a very famous place. We all work very hard. And I don't know if you call it \"influence,\" I don't know if you call it \"power,\" but whatever it is, we're in the White House. And we're going to stay in the White, and we're going to get our agenda done and completed beautifully. (Applause.)</p><p>So I'm thrilled to welcome you here. And we're all working very hard. And I don't know if you know, but we just did 27,000 on the Dow. That's the highest in history. We're up a couple of hundred points today. (Applause.) The highest in history -- for those of you that like the stock market.</p><p>But the stock market means jobs. I view it as jobs, and I view it as 401(k)s. A lot of people say, \"Oh, the rich people are getting rich.\" But if you look at the numbers, the greatest impact, proportionately, is blue-collar workers in what's happened, in this miracle that's happening. (Applause.)</p><p>And people with 401(k)s, they're up 72 percent and 67 percent. And the wife or the husband -- whoever is responsible -- the other one says, \"You're a genius. You're a great financial investor.\" (Laughter.) \"Darling, you're up 77 percent this year.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>So a lot of good things happened. A lot of people are happy. And I think, really, everybody is happy; some people just aren't willing to admit it. Does that make sense? (Laughter.)</p><p>So this is a historic day. Never before have so many online journalists and influencers -- and that's exactly what you are; you're journalists and you're influencers -- come together in this building to discuss the future of social media.</p><p>Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation. You're challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the American people. And that's what you're doing -- you're going right to the people.</p><p>Possibly, we wouldn't be here right now. I asked somebody, \"What do you think I'd do without social media? Would I be here?\" Because I said, \"I think so.\" (Laughter.) But they weren't so sure. (Laughter.) I have to say that; you know that. I'm not sure I believe that, but I have to say it.</p><p>But you communicate directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake-news filter. It's very simple. Together, you reach more people than any television broadcast network by far -- not even close.</p><p>We're delighted to be joined at this summit by someone you know very well: our Senior Advisor for Digital Strategy and somebody that's been working for me for a long time, for many years, Dan Scavino. Where is Dan? (Applause.) Stand up. Come here. Great job.</p><p>So, long before we were even doing this, he was at a club -- running a club and other businesses. And he was okay at doing it. (Laughter.) Not the greatest. I wouldn't say the greatest. (Laughter.) But you know what he was great at? He was always looking at his computer screen. I said, \"That guy is incredible.\"</p><p>So, right at the beginning, I said, \"That's the man.\" And there was nobody better at that. And I think Hillary had 28 people and I had Dan. (Laughter.) Right? (Applause.) I had my Dan. And he works about 28 hours a day, and he works very hard. But he doesn't work -- I mean, he loves it. He loves it.</p><p>And his imagination and, really, working with all of you and many of you -- he'll come up with ideas and you'll come up with ideas. And he'll run into my office. He said, \"You got to see this.\"</p><p>And a lot of times, I'll go out and I'll spend a lot of money on a concept. I'll say, \"Here's a concept. Come up with this.\" And we'll hire these companies, and they want a lot of money. And they come back -- it just happened the other day, right? I said, \"That's terrible. These guys have no talent.\" (Laughter.) The people that have the talent are the people that we deal with. And it's true.</p><p>And some of you are extraordinary. I can't say everybody, but -- (laughter). No, but some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable. (Laughter and applause.) True. Unbelievable.</p><p>So I'm going to go back to the basics of Washington. I'm going to introduce some of my Secretaries. Steve Mnuchin. Steve? Where's Steve? Steve has done a fantastic job. (Applause.)</p><p>Wilbur Ross. Wilbur? We have a meeting -- (applause) -- in a little while, on the census and citizenship. Can you believe: \"Are you a citizen of the United States of America?\" \"Sir, you can't ask that question.\" (Laughter.) \"Why?\" \"Because the court said you can't.\"</p><p>We have three very unfriendly courts. They fight us all the way. The judges don't like us too much, I guess. But think of that, Herman. Think of that question: \"Are you a citizen?\"</p><p>We spend -- this is another thing that's so crazy: $20 billion on a census -- $20 billion. They spend $20 billion. I said, \"20 billion what?\" (Laughter.) Twenty billion dollars on a census.</p><p>They go through houses -- they go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. \"How many toilets do they have?\" \"How many desks do they have?\" \"How many beds?\" \"What's their roof made of?\" (Laughter.) The only thing we can't ask is, \"Are you a citizen of the United States?\" (Laughter and applause.) No, isn't it the craziest thing? Twenty billion. (Applause.) Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing, Charlie.</p><p>Also, David Bernhardt, great job you're doing -- Interiors. (Applause.) He's the largest landlord in the United States. When my friends tell me how big they are, they -- \"I just bought another building.\" Big deal, Kevin, right? They bought another building. Then I look at David Bernhardt; he controls half of the United States. (Laughter.) Department of Interior. There's a lot of land -- a lot of beautiful land -- that we're taking good care of, David. Right?</p><p>Acting Director Russ Vought. Russ, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) We're working on our budget. (Applause.)</p><p>Along with some of the great members of Congress and a wonderful friend of mine who's my Leader, right? He's my Leader. I tell him that to his face because it makes him feel good. I don't know if I believe that, Marsha. (Laughter.) But, Kevin -- stand up, Kevin. Kevin McCarthy, everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>Senator Marsha Blackburn of the great state of Tennessee. We campaigned together. (Applause.) And she did -- we can say it now: She ran against the most popular Democrat in the last 50 years. He really was great. A good man, right? THE PRESIDENT: And governor for quite a long time -- eight years. And she just didn't stop.</p><p>SENATOR BLACKBURN: I beat him by 12 points.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Twelve points. (Applause.) She was down by 10, and she won by 12. That's right. She was down by 10, and she won by 12. And she wouldn't stop. They just -- every day, \"Where is she?\" \"She's here. She's there.\" Fantastic job you did. We're proud of you.</p><p>SENATOR BLACKBURN: Thank you (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, honey. That's great. It was just -- honestly, working with people that know what they're doing, it's fun. That was fun. And you know what you're doing.</p><p>Representative Dan Crenshaw, who is very good at this, by the way, Dan. (Applause.) Very good at this. Really good. Thank you. It's great to have you in the party. And you have more courage than I do, Dan. Okay? That courage of yours is incredible. Thank you very much. Great job.</p><p>A friend of mine, and a wonderful person, and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future, I'd say -- I hear a lot of very positive things -- Liz Cheney. Liz, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.</p><p>And, you know, I pardoned somebody named Scooter Libby. A lot of you don't know who Scooter Libby is. Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly. And Liz was right on the forefront of that one. And I said, \"What do you think, Liz?\" And you said, \"Absolutely. He deserves it.\" And it's been a very popular pardon. He was treated very, very brutally and unfairly. So, thank you for that -- for that help.</p><p>Matt Gaetz. Where's Matt? Where's Matt? Stand up, Matt. (Applause.) Boy, a great defender. He gets on television, and he's like -- it doesn't stop. And he's smart, and he's good, and he loves Florida, and he loves his people, and he's a hard worker. And, Matt, thank you very much. I really appreciate it very much.</p><p>And Mike Johnson. Mike, thank you. (Applause.) Great job, Mike.</p><p>And I want to thank a man who I said, a long time ago, when we said, \"Let's do it\" -- because Josh Hawley is special. He is somebody that -- I said, \"Josh, you got to run.\" \"Well, I don't know.\" You know, he had a good set-up -- pretty well, right? You weren't going anywhere. He could do whatever he wanted in his great state.</p><p>And I said, \"I'm telling you, you can do it.\" And she turned out -- she's a tough candidate. Whether you like her or you don't like her, she's tough. Right? And by the end of that, that was incredible. That was a hell of a race and he won. And he's young and he's brilliant. And I'm going to ask him to come up and say a few words, if you don't mind, about what we're doing. And come on up right now. I think it would be a good time, right? (Applause.)</p><p>SENATOR HAWLEY: Thank you. Well, first of all, can we just give another round of applause to the President of the United States for his leadership on this issue? (Applause.)</p><p>You know, the media -- the media says -- the establishment media, the fake media -- they say, \"Oh, there's no censorship in social media. That's all made up. That's all fake.\" You and I know that that's not true. You and I know the truth is that the social media giants would love to shut us down. They would love to shut us up. They would love to shut him up more than anything else. And we can't let them. And that's why we need to step up now.</p><p>And I think we need to say to them, \"Here's the deal.\" Google, Facebook, Twitter -- they've gotten these special deals from government. They've gotten a special giveaway from government. They're treated unlike anybody else. If they want to keep their special deal, here's the bargain: They have to quit discriminating against conservatives. Do you agree with that? No more! (Applause.) No more discrimination. It's that simple. (Applause.) That's all we're asking for.</p><p>They ought to abide by the same principles of free speech and the First Amendment that this country embraces, that we love and call our own. And I don't think it's too much to ask for these huge tech platforms -- who've gotten rich off our information, right? Off of our data, off of everything we've given them -- they've gotten rich off of it. They've gotten rich off their special privileges from government. If they want to keep those, they shouldn't discriminate. They shouldn't censor. They shouldn't shut us down.</p><p>I want to thank the President again for his incredible leadership. Thank you for allowing me to be here. Thank you, Mr. President, for all that you do. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, you know, Josh is doing -- right now, he's doing some very important legislation because we have to do something about what's happening. I never hear about the other side. I can tell you -- I think I'm pretty good at getting out a message, but, technologically, I would think I'm okay. Just okay. But I'll tell you, a lot of bad things are happening.</p><p>I have people come up to me, \"Sir, we want to follow you. They don't let us on.\" And it was so different than it was even six, seven months ago. I was picking up unbelievable amounts of people. And I'm hotter now than I was then, okay? Because, you know, you also cool off, right? But much hotter. (Laughter.) Especially with a nice, new stock market like it is, right?</p><p>But, no, I'm hotter now. And I go to Dan, and I say, \"Hey, what's going on here? It used to take me a short number of days to pick up 100,000 people.\" I'm not complaining; we're like 60-some-odd million. But then we have five different sites. We have another site with 25 million. We have another site with 10 or 12. Then we have Facebook. Then we have Instagram. We have a lot -- you know, a lot of people -- way, way over 100 million.</p><p>But I used to pick them up, and I -- when I say \"used to,\" I'm talking about a few months ago. I was picking them up 100,000 people every -- very short period of time. Now it's, I would say, 10 times as long.</p><p>And I noticed things happening when I put out something -- a good one -- that people like. (Laughter.) Right? A good tweet. It goes up. It used to go up -- it would say \"7,000, 7,008, 7,017, 7,024, 7,032, 7,044.\" (Laughter.) Right? Now it goes \"7,000, 7,008, 6,998.\"</p><p>Then they go, \"7,009, 6,074.\" I say, \"What's going on?\" It never did that before. It goes up, and then they take it down, and then it goes up. I never had that. Does anyone know what I'm talking about with this?</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I never had that before. I used to watch it. It would be like a rocket ship when I put out a beauty. (Laughter and applause.) Like when I said -- remember I said somebody was \"spying on me\"? That thing was like a rocket. I got a call two minutes later. \"Did you say that?\" I said, \"Yeah, I said that.\" \"Well, it's exploding.\" (Laughter.) \"It's exploding.\" I turned out to be right. I turned out to be right. And we turn out to be right about lot of things. (Applause.)</p><p>But I never had it. I'm just saying from -- you know, from the standpoint of a -- of somebody that maybe has used social media better than anybody, Josh, because I became President. I'm sure I could have done it, as we said, much -- I would have -- there's no question I would have done it either way.</p><p>I said to Mark Burnett the other day -- I said, \"So, The Apprentice...\" Had I never done \"The Apprentice\" -- because it was a tremendous hit for 12 seasons. I said, \"Had I never done The Apprentice, would I be President?\" He said, \"Maybe not.\" And I said, \"I think I would have.\" But I'm always going to say that. (Laughter.) I'm always going to say it. But it was a great show.</p><p>But with social media -- so I've never seen it before where I go up and then come down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Now, ultimately, you get -- but it goes very slowly. But I've never seen where it's subtracted. And I really believe people are -- they're taking it up as it goes up. And it -- sometimes it comes down substantially.</p><p>A number of months ago, I was at a certain number -- you know, many millions -- and then all of a sudden, I was down over a million. And then I came down -- I said, \"What's going on?\" And you checked, Dan, and you said, \"They say they're doing adjustments. They say they don't like some of the people.\"</p><p>And I don't have the fake people. You know, a lot of people buy people. I don't want to do that because, first of all, if I did it, it's a front page story all over the place. (Laughter.) but I know a lot of people -- there's no question about it, because I see some numbers that are phony numbers where they have these, you know, many, many millions of followers. And I say, \"There's no way because nobody has any interest in these people.\" (Laughter.) There's -- they have no --</p><p>Now, Herman Cain, they have interest in, okay? (Applause.) But they have no interest in these people. They're playing games. They're playing games.</p><p>James Woods. I don't know James, but he's an interesting guy and he's a conservative guy. And he is a straight shooter. He's tough. But when they want to take him off -- and other people like him; many in this room, some in this room -- it's a very, very bad -- it's a very bad thing.</p><p>So I have many millions of followers across various accounts. And together, everyone in this room, we reach over a half a billion followers. And I think that's probably a low number. Because one of the things I get that's a little benefit -- I'll go, \"Watch.\" Like, I did Golan Heights. I gave Israel the -- the real credit over -- and, you know, Golan Heights in Israel. Very important.</p><p>But I gave representation, in the strongest form, of the Golan Heights -- Israel. And I talked about it in a little quick tweet. They've been looking at it -- for 52 years, they've been trying to get it. They couldn't get it. They'd have many summits where people would fly in, talk about the Golan Heights, and then fly out. This went on many, many summits. It's about a 52-year period. I said, \"What happened?\" They said, \"Nothing.\" They'd fly in. They'd fly out. Some had beautiful planes. Some didn't. Some probably didn't get there by plane. But they'd have many summits.</p><p>said, \"Watch, I'm going to do this.\" And I said, \"We recognize the Golan Heights as being part of Israel.\" It was a big thing. I go, \"Watch this.\" Boom. I press it and, within two seconds, \"We have breaking news.\" John Roberts of Fox was over, and he said, \"We have breaking news. Please, break it up.\" Doesn't matter what they're talking about, John, does it? He breaks it up.</p><p>Now, that's Twitter. That's social media. I call Twitter a \"typewriter.\" That's what I really call Twitter, because it goes onto Facebook automatically and it goes onto Instagram. And it goes onto television -- more so Fox than it does CNN. If it's something bad, they'll put it on. (Laughter.)</p><p>If I have a spelling deal, they will put it on. (Laughter.) It's -- \"Donald Trump spelled the word 'the' wrong.\" You know? (Laughter.) \"He doesn't know how to spell, 'the.' He spelled it 'T-H-I.'\" (Laughter.) You know, I couldn't care -- any kind of a punctuation mistake, they put it on. So I'm very, very careful. I really -- I'm actually a good speller. But everyone said, \"The fingers aren't as good as the brain.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But -- but it is true. And it's -- it's incredible what it does. I put out a social media statement. And I was telling Kellyanne the other day, I said, you know, I used to put out like a press release, right? And people would pick it up, sort of, you know, in the next day, two days. They'd find it sitting on a desk. If I put out -- we hardly do press releases anymore because if I put out, on social media, a statement -- like I'm going to in a little while on something totally unrelated, but a very important statement. Now they're going crazy. \"What it is? Tell me what it is.\" Watch. (Laughter.) But it's very important.</p><p>But if I put that out in a press release, I'm telling you, Kevin, people don't pick it up. It's me -- same. If I put it out on social media, it's like an explosion. Fox, CNN, crazy MSNBC -- they're stone-cold crazy. (Laughter.) I made them a lot of money with \"The Apprentice.\" And I gave them a top show when they were dying on NBC. But they don't like me too much. They wanted a big extension. They used Arnold Schwarzenegger instead -- a big movie star. You know what? He died. He died. (Laughter.) I was there 12 -- 12 years, 14 seasons. And then they pick a movie actor and he dies on us. (Laughter.)</p><p>You know, I own that with Mark Burnett and some people. And I said -- they said, \"Would you rather have him had been like this tremendous massive success?\" You own it, so you benefit, financially. \"Or would you rather have him die?\" So they just say, \"You did it for 14 seasons, 12 years.\" I said, \"I think I'd rather him die at it.\" (Laughter.) That means you don't need the money. I'd rather have him die at it. Anyway.</p><p>But with amazing creativity and determination, you're bypassing the corrupt establishment -- and it is corrupt -- and you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media -- which not all of it, but much of it is far greater percentages than anyone would understand. As the cameras start to go off. There go the red lights. Look, boom. I can always tell. (Laughter.)</p><p>I can always tell. Like, when I talk about -- and I'll be in the stadium. The red lights are all on. Everyone has got -- and then we start talking about, like, the media -- how dishonest it is, how corrupt it is, how fake it is. And you see lights going off. (Laughter.) Lights immediately go off. And, usually, they don't come back. They say, \"This guy is impossible.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But I want to just say it because you people have a lot of courage. To each and every one of you, I say: Thank you very much, on behalf of a nation. Thank you very much. It's very important what you're doing. You're getting the -- you're getting, in many cases, the honest word out -- not in all cases, but in many cases.</p><p>When historians look back at this time, they will see that many of the biggest news stories of our era were totally ignored. I -- I can tell you that I deal with the media, and the spin they put on it -- or sometimes they'll leave it out, and then if there's something slightly negative, they'll make it, you know, headline news. They'll put it down as headline news. Or even covered up by the media -- they were broken up by citizens.</p><p>And you'll take a look at what's happening, and you see stories that should be phenomenal, big, beautiful stories and it turns out that they don't get covered. We did something yesterday on kidney and kidney dialysis, and there's a tremendous number of people with problems with kidneys. And it was Secretary Azar -- it was a big, big important thing. It got very little coverage. You know, very positive -- what we did is such -- such a great thing.</p><p>I don't care. We don't have to get the -- hey, it's good for our nation. It's good for people to read about it and see the strides that we've made and what we're doing. But that doesn't get covered and it should get covered. And it doesn't get covered for a reason because they don't want to give that to a conservative. They don't want to let that happen.</p><p>Now, if somebody else were in this position -- such as the previous administration -- they'd make that headline news all over the place, what we did yesterday. But when we're doing it, they give very little credit to that.</p><p>But anything bad that happens -- I always say, \"They can take bad and make it horrible. They can take a good story and make it sort of bad. And they can take a great, great story and make it anywhere from good to slightly bad.\" (Laughter.) It's incredible what they can do.</p><p>I say I haven't had a good story in two and a half years. I used to get great press. Steve Mnuchin knows. He said, \"Man, you get the greatest press.\" Until I got elected. (Laughter.) Then it stopped. But I used to get the greatest press -- possibly one of the reasons I'm here.</p><p>But we're getting the word out, and we get it out in a different way. I didn't think we'd have to -- Charlie, I didn't think it would be this tough and --</p><p>By the way, two very special people -- I have to say hello to them. Because my wife said, \"I see these two beautiful women -- African American, incredible women -- that are on television. They are unbelievable.\" This is two years ago. She was before her time. They have no idea who I'm talking about. (Laughter.) She was -- our First Lady said, \"You have to see these women. They're incredible. They're genius. And they like you.\" I said, \"I want to see them.\" (Laughter.) And I liked them. I loved them, actually. I loved them. Come. Come. (Applause.)</p><p>I don't want them to fall, because it'll be a major story. (Laughter.)</p><p>So, when the historians look back, they're going to see something very important took place right here. Before today, it took place. It started taking place a number of years ago, and it's something that nobody ever thought would happen.</p><p>Free speech is a bedrock of American life. Our constitutional rights must be fiercely protected. And I want you to know that we will always have your back. We're fighting for you very hard. We're going to be calling a big meeting of the companies for -- in a week or two. They have to be here.</p><p>And Josh is really leading a very strong group of people. This isn't just Josh. This is you leading a tremendous group, and they feel equally as strongly as you because they see the unfairness of what's happening.</p><p>And remember: We won. We have a bigger voice than anybody. But we don't get covered fairly. Can you imagine if we were covered fairly? We had our best polls, like, yesterday, they were telling me. I said, \"Could you imagine if I actually got good press instead of -- even fair press. I don't want good; I want fair.\" Can you imagine what those numbers would be? They make up stories -- you know, the Russian hoax. I call it the \"Russian hoax\" -- the witch hunt. All bad publicity, and yet we're doing great in the polls.</p><p>So people understand it. The public is very smart. But we're getting the word out about so many things -- not just that -- about so many things.</p><p>And maybe the most important thing about how great our country is doing. Jobs -- now more people working today than ever in the history of our country. Ever in the history of our country -- think of that. Unemployment are the best numbers in 51 years. For African American, the best numbers in our history -- in our history, Herman, right? (Applause.) Including you. And you're making a lot, I hope.</p><p>But Hispanic American -- best numbers in history. (Applause.) Right? Stand up. And I like your dresses, by the way, very much. No, not you, sir. You. (Laughter.) Thank you. I saw you the other day. Fantastic job.</p><p>But Hispanic American -- the best in history. Asian American -- the best in history. Women -- I think, Kellyanne -- the best in 75 years. The best in -- best unemployment numbers in 75 years. What we're doing -- it's nothing like this has been done.</p><p>Our military is now strong. When I took it over, it was depleted. We had planes that were so old they didn't fly. They'd have to go to the desert to get parts. When we took it over, it was not a good situation. We got $700 billion, and then $716 billion. And we're going to be asking for another one this year. And it's all manufactured in the United States. We make it ourselves. And that's always good, because that's jobs. Now, in this case, jobs aren't important compared military defense, but we make the best planes and rockets and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nothing like it. And we're doing something that's incredible.</p><p>So, our military is strong. Our -- our country is really powerful and really strong. Never been like this.</p><p>Whoops. How did a fly get into the White House? (Laughter.) I don't like that. I don't like flies. I don't like flies. (Laughter.)</p><p>So I just want to tell you, just in finishing up, we had a terrible bias. We have censorship like nobody has any understanding or nobody can believe. When you see the Google executives together, and one of their executives decides to put it on the phone -- right? That's right. Thank you. Oh, there he is. Stand up, please. Stand up. (Applause.) How good -- what a great job. Somebody said he's controversial. I said, \"He's not controversial. He's truthful.\" He's truthful. (Applause.) That was a great job. That was one of many. Thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic.</p><p>So, you know, they're playing with -- with a lot of minds and they're playing unfairly. And the funny thing is that, in theory, they shouldn't be liking the other side. They shouldn't be liking the other side. They should be, really, liking our side, because we're the ones that want freedom far more.</p><p>You see what's happening up in the debate stand. You see what they're doing to each other. You're seeing the hatred that they have up there. And it's a very different philosophy. It's a very different thought.</p><p>And I'll say this: The election that's coming up is, I think -- and, you know, we talk 2016, and I would say maybe that's the most important, and certainly I said it. But what we're really fighting for -- there has never been a difference of this candidate, our candidate, your candidate against whoever it may be. There will never be anything like that hopefully again, because what they're looking at is pure socialism or worse than socialism. You know, there's a word called \"communism,\" too. There's a word called -- they don't like to use it. Very rarely do you hear that. But there's a word called \"communism,\" and they're trying to get socialism over the line.</p><p>But these people are -- this is beyond socialism, to a large extent. And I think that we're going to have a tremendous success. We had a -- sort of, an opening rally in Orlando, Florida. We had 109,000 -- maybe more; I think it was nine -- wanting to come. We were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming. We have a 21,000-seat stadium, and then, with the basketball court, it held many more than that. It was packed. And we had a similar number outside, and we had thousands and thousands of people that wanted to be there. And this was an opening.</p><p>And you look at Biden; they say he had 600 people. That wasn't 600; that was 150 people. (Laughter and applause.) That was 150. That was a very small crowd. (Laughter.) And even their big crowds -- I mean, if they have 1,000 people, it's like a big crowd. We have enthusiasm that's far greater than the left. It's not even a contest. They don't want to say that. They never will say that.</p><p>We had, on the Mall, just the other day -- 4th of July -- a tremendous success. It was pouring. The weather was just -- it was beautiful, in one way. They learned it was my real hair that day -- (laughter) -- because I was drenched. Well, that is the one good thing. I ran, and they learned it's my hair, because I've been through every windstorm, sandstorm. Let's go over here. Let's go this one, that one -- this desert. Let's go to this ocean and get out of the plane. \"Sir, the wind is blowing at about 70 miles an hour.\" I said, \"Boy, it's got to be -- it's got to be mine.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But we've seen it all. We've seen it all. And I tell you what: More than anything else, I've met great people. I've met great people. Dedicated people. And I think that the election coming up, Kevin, this is the most important election of our times.</p><p>This is an election where our country is going to go one way or it's going to head in the direction of Venezuela. And that's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen.</p><p>This Green New Deal -- and I -- you know, I hate to speak badly of it right now because it's a little early. I spoke too early on Elizabeth \"Pocahontas\" Warren. (Laughter.) I spoke -- I should've saved it.</p><p>But, you know -- so I don't like to go too early because I don't want them to change. I like the Green New Deal. I want them to keep going. I don't want them to make -- you know, the problem with this business: They can make a change, and immediately upon making the -- it lasts for about a week. You look at, for instance, on the wall, Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall. Right, Liz? Totally in favor. Everybody. Hillary. Everybody. They were all in favor of a wall, just a few years ago.</p><p>Now a wall is a -- well, that's okay. They want open borders. They want people to pour in, including criminals -- the worst criminals. They want people to pour into our country. Nobody can tell me that's good, politically. Nobody can tell me.</p><p>So all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations, they've got a right to speak their mind. That includes them. That includes them. But they don't have the same difficulty. They don't get shut out. I wrote a few terms. I said to my son, Don, who's here some- -- where are you, Don? Where are you, Don? (Applause.) He's very good. Kimberly. Don. People like Don, I tell you. (Applause.) Good. Thank you, Don.</p><p>But we wrote out a few -- shadow ban, 100 percent. You look at what's going on. You know, I could go -- the blocking -- just the basic blocking of what we want to get out. The fact that they don't let them join. They don't. There was -- there's no doubt in my mind that I should have millions and millions -- I have millions of people -- so many people, I wouldn't believe it. But I know that we've been blocked.</p><p>People come up to me and they say, \"Sir, I can't get you. I can't follow you. They make it impossible.\" These are people that are really good at what they do. They say, \"They make it absolutely impossible.\" And, you know, we can't have it. We're not going to let it happen. Josh, we're not going to let it happen.</p><p>And, you know, if they did it on both sides, if it were done to the other side, to the other group -- and I'm representing everybody. I do. I represent everybody. I fully understand liberal. I fully understand Democrat. We want to get along. We want to make sure that everybody loves each other, if that's possible. And, maybe, I really believe it is. Someday it will be.</p><p>I, for a while, have said that the thing that's going to bring us together is great success. Now we have tremendous success -- greater than we've ever had before. I mean, our country picked up trillions of dollars in value and worth. China has gone down trillions of dollars. The tariffs have hurt them. I don't want to hurt them, but I want to give us a fair playing field. But China has gone down trillions. We've gone up tril- -- not billions, trillions. We've gone up in value and worth.</p><p>I want everybody to do well, but they've got to treat us fairly. They've got to treat -- everybody has to be treated fairly. Their side, our side -- we all have to be treated fairly.</p><p>And, you know, the farmers say, \"We just want a level playing field, sir.\" I love the farmers. They're patriots. And China, as you know, targeted the farmers because they think they could get to me by hurting the people that I love and that we take care of. And it had no impact.</p><p>I would watch, even on networks that don't exactly like me, and I'd watch as they interview farmers. And they'd have 10 or 12 people sitting around. They're saying, \"We don't care. The President is right. We've been ripped off for many years. Somebody has to do -- somebody had to do this.\"</p><p>China made, over the last 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars. You could say four to five hundred billion dollars a year. That's not sustainable. That's not -- we built China. And you know what? They've done a great job. I don't blame them; I blame our former Presidents and the leaders of our country for allowing this to go on ever since the World Trade Organization opened up. They allowed this to go on. They allowed hundreds of billions of dollars a year to be taken out of our country and to be used to rebuild China. So those days are over.</p><p>So, right now, they're paying 25 percent on $250 billion. A lot of money coming in. You know, we had a 3.2 GDP for the first quarter. Everyone said, \"I wonder how that happened.\" Because first quarter is the weakest quarter always -- almost -- almost always. And we had like this great quarter.</p><p>But I don't consider 3.2 great. I consider much higher. And, frankly, if we had lower interest rates -- you know, we're forced to pay more money than other countries because we have a rate that's high. We have somebody that likes raising rates. Now, I think he's maybe going to change, but we'll find out. But if we had lower, we'd have another 10,000 points. We're doing -- we just set a record. You know, I'm a very greedy person. We just set a record: 27,000. I said, \"We could be 10,000 points higher.\" We could be 10,000 because there's no inflation. A big thing is inflation. There's no inflation. But we're doing so well. We're going to keep it that way.</p><p>So, I just want to introduce -- because a person that I've admired for a long time who is a great lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, and she's one of the leading First Amendment lawyers in our country. And, Harmeet, could you come up -- just say a few words, please? Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS. DHILLON: Thank you, Mr. President. (Applause.) Thank you, Mr. President. It's a tremendous honor to be here with a lot of people who I really respect and admire.</p><p>The corrupt establishment that you talked about and the mainstream media have told a lot of people in this room that the social media censorship and the banning that we're experiencing is all in our heads. They're gaslighting us with this lie.</p><p>Let me tell you about a couple of people I represent in my law practice and the civil rights work that we do. David Horowitz is a great American, who is a supporter of yours -- has been in the movement for many decades. Well, Twitter abruptly de-platformed him one day -- took him off, said he was banned. And then, he complained and then they let him back on. And then, the next day, they did the exact same thing to him. That's not an accident.</p><p>James Damore is another great American who I represent. Mr. Damore complained internally about Google's discriminatory practices against conservatives and pushed for more balance. Not only was he fired for daring to do that, but then these social media platforms used their platforms to humiliate him publicly, weaponize their platforms, and make sure that he could not get a job in Silicon Valley. That's a disgrace.</p><p>But it goes beyond that. These social media CEOs have come to Congress in front of the -- many of these members of Congress here, and they've lied about what they do. They've lied about the data theft. They've lied about the media manipulation. And they can't get away with that.</p><p>Now, Senator Blackburn knows, from what happened to her on Twitter, that these companies are trying to stop the ordinary men and women who you represent from hearing their voices. I'm very concerned that they affected the outcome of the 2018 election. And if we let them do what they're going to -- what they've been doing, it's going to affect the outcome of the 2020 election as well.</p><p>So, Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting everybody here to talk about these issues. And we're all behind you joining the fight to make sure that every American's voice is heard. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And what Harmeet said is so, so true. I mean it's -- it's really incredible. You know, I've watched and I've watched some of these scenes that have been taped and gotten through -- talented people, by the way -- but gotten through and gotten to the public where you see the hatred of -- of our party, of our people, of our voice. And you say, \"That's the collusion.\" It's a collusion between the Democrats and the media and -- and social media and these platforms. It's a disgraceful thing. (Applause.)</p><p>And another thing, I believe you're representing a young man who just got slugged, viciously slugged. I think it's a disgrace. Do you ever notice they pick on certain people? I mean, he would tell you he's not the toughest person in the world physically, right? They don't go after Bikers for Trump. (Laughter.)</p><p>Do you ever notice that? They don't go after our construction workers, who love us. They don't go after the police. They don't go after -- we have incredible people. You know, we're the elite. They say they're elite. You know. Do you ever hear this? Hey, I live better than all of them. (Laughter.) Great education. The greatest houses. The great- -- but I guess I'm not elite. They live like in the basement of their mom's home. (Laughter.) Their arms are this big. Look, like this.</p><p>But they have the black -- they have the black masks on, and they have sticks. And they hit people. They hit people in the face, in the head -- this Antifa.</p><p>But do you ever notice the Antifa is never there when we have a bikers rally? (Laughter.) They're never there when the construction workers and the unions are honoring the President. They're never around. They're always there when you have a single guy protesting in front of a school.</p><p>And as you probably know -- I think all of you know -- we did something very serious. I signed an executive order recently. We're taking money away from those schools. (Applause.) We're going to -- you know, we give them billions and billions of dollars, and they don't allow free speech. (Applause.) And we don't want anything special, but we want free speech.</p><p>We're also joined by someone affected by this troubling bias very, very much -- and President of Live Action and somebody I've watched, really, with great admiration. Lila, please come up. Lila Rose. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS. ROSE: Thank you so much, Mr. President. It's really an honor to be here. Thank you for doing this important summit.</p><p>I represent Live Action. I'm the founder and president, and we are a pro-life organization which reaches millions of people every week with the truth about abortion and human dignity.</p><p>We have been, for four years, banned from doing any advertising on Twitter. And they told us that, in order to reinstate our accounts, we'd have to stop calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood and stop sharing our pro-life content. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other abortion groups continue to advertise.</p><p>Last month, we were permanently suspended from Pinterest, and they accused us of spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation with our pro-life content, with no evidence. And then, news media groups picked up the narrative and spread it around. Meanwhile, abortion groups, including abortion clinics, post freely on Pinterest.</p><p>And then, recently, our videos have been viewed more highly than almost any other abortion-related content on YouTube. But YouTube -- we made it to the first page of search results, but YouTube buried our pro-life videos and boosted pro-abortion videos. So this double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech, even though they say that they are politically neutral and they don't discriminate. They even testified before Congress and said that.</p><p>So thank you so much to the administration and to you, Mr. President, for holding this very important summit. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Thank you very much.</p><p>So, one of the advantages of being President is when you ask for a meeting, you get it, generally. I don't know -- I can't think of too many I haven't gotten. And you say, \"I'd like to see you in Oval Office.\" Or you have somebody call -- Oval Office.</p><p>I have been with all of these people at the highest level -- one-on-one, just recently, with Google. Just recently, with Twitter. The top. All right? And you talk to them and you swear they're like your best friend. \"Oh, sir. No, we're -- we're -- we believe -- we -- freedom of speech. Oh, yes. Absol-...\"</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And we go out --</p><p>He says, \"Liar.\" Who said that? (Laughter.) Must come from Queens. (Laughter.)</p><p>So -- so it's very interesting to see that. And -- and the level of -- you know, you look at them -- the sincerity. And I say, \"That's fantastic.\" And they'll leave. And then, I'll realize, three or four weeks later, it's worse. It actually got worse.</p><p>Because I say -- look, I believe in technology. I believe in free markets. I believe in freedom of speech. I believe in all of the things, and they are super genius.</p><p>I'll tell you, I'm dealing with China. And they admitted there's nobody like Silicon Valley. There's nobody smart, in that sense -- maybe not smart in other senses. I've watched some of them speak before Congress; it's not pretty. (Laughter.) I say, \"I could do much better than that.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But I tell you what: Technologically, it's unbelievable what they think of. Even Dan and I, when we sat with you-know-who at Twitter -- number one. We talked about certain things. He says, \"You know, we could do this, this, this.\" I said, \"That's really great.\" You know, this is incredible stuff.</p><p>China will admit there's nobody like these brains. But they're not using that brilliance and they're not using what we gave them fairly. And they have to do that.</p><p>And we don't want to stifle anything. We certainly don't want to stifle free speech, but that's no longer free speech. See, I don't think that the mainstream media is free speech either because it's so crooked. It's so dishonest.</p><p>So, to me, free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write bad. To me, that's very dangerous speech and you become angry at it. But that's not free speech. Somebody came to my office -- and I won't say who, but a very big person. And I said, \"Okay, you don't like the term 'fake news'\" -- which I think I get credit for, but I'm sure that, if I said I get credit, they'll say, \"Thirteen years ago, somebody came up with the terms 'fake.'\" (Laughter.) I think I'd get credit. I'd be very proud to take it. But I think I'd get credit.</p><p>Now, by the way, the worst fakers of all are using \"fake news.\" I saw the other day on CNN -- total fakes -- I see on CNN -- they go, \"Fake-news media has reported...\" No, no -- they're fake-news media. (Laughter.) They've turned it around. (Applause.) They've turned it around.</p><p>So I'm not going to allow -- and Josh and all of us, we're not just going to allow it to happen like this. We're not going to be silenced.</p><p>Two months ago, we created a new White House tool to report social media bias, censorship, and discrimination. We saw you folks being taken off, and we fought on all of you. And many of you are back now. But many of the names -- I won't mention your names -- but some of you were taken off for absolutely no reason.</p><p>I mean, in all fairness, some of you I could almost understand. (Laughter.) I mean, some of you guys are out there. (Laughter.) But even you should have a voice. (Laughter.) But some of you -- no, some of you deserve -- (applause) -- some of you. I mean, it's genius, but it's bad. (Laughter.)</p><p>But they take off people that are -- you know, that you wouldn't believe. And we received over 16,000 responses just in a tiny little period of time talking about this subject.</p><p>Based on the feedback that we're hearing from you, I'm announcing that we will ask representatives of the major social media platforms to join me at the White House over the next month, have a big meeting and a real conversation. We want -- might want to invite some of you. I know, Josh, we're going to have you and some of the senators.</p><p>And it's amazing how the senators -- including Democrats, in all fairness -- which is probably because they know it can turn on them also. It can turn very quickly. But they want to come. So we'll let you know the date, okay?</p><p>And today, I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans. That's you people in this room and a lot of people out there. There are a lot of people.</p><p>We hope to see transparency, more accountability, and more freedom. That's on both sides. This is not -- I am not speaking for our side, assuming we're all -- I don't even know if you're on our side. You could be some of the most liberal people in the world in this audience, and that's okay. I don't care. But we're talking about for everybody. Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people.</p><p>To all of the social media influencers here today -- a lot of -- you have a lot of power and you have a lot of strength. And, you know, you have to use it wisely. Many of you do, but you have to.</p><p>I want to thank you once again for being here. You're very special people. You're very brilliant people, in so many cases. I look around the room -- I mean, I see people that really have almost found a new life over the last short period of time with this new technology. But this new technology is so powerful and so important, and it has to be used fairly. It has to be used fairly.</p><p>So thank you all for being here. It's a great honor. Tremendous honor.</p><p>We're going to take a few questions, I think. And then I'll head out. And you're going to actually come -- if you want, you can come to the great Rose Garden. You can stand in the rain with me. We're going to talk a little bit about the fact that we're not allowed to ask for whether or not somebody is a citizen on the census form. And I think we have a solution that will be very good for a lot of people -- really good.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6788370 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6788370</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJM-29G1-JC11-133F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7998\"/><timeReceived>7:31 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001213</classCode><className>NEWS REPORTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX001307</classCode><className>PENSION &amp; RETIREMENT PLANS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CP7A</classCode><className>INTERNET JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000001</classCode><className>US 401K PLANS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001213</classCode><className>NEWS REPORTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX001307</classCode><className>PENSION &amp; RETIREMENT PLANS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CP7A</classCode><className>INTERNET JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000001</classCode><className>US 401K PLANS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

You know, just a few weeks ago, it was 13 percent, now it's 6.9 percent over that average, I can obviously not see the ground, it's on the screen --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BERMAN: You're talking -- but we're talking about two different things. We're talking about two different things. Just so people know. I'm talking about the number of new cases, the seven-day trend --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FOREST: Yes --</p><p>BERMAN: Is going up. You're talking --</p><p>FOREST: In --</p><p>BERMAN: About the percentage of positive tests --</p><p>FOREST: In --</p><p>BERMAN: Which is going down.</p><p>FOREST: The percentage is the important thing because the number of tests goes up rapidly. So the percentage is the number you actually want to track. The actual number when it spiked is what you're probably showing is that spike. What you're not showing is that there was no testing done on Friday, Saturday or Sunday --</p><p>BERMAN: OK --</p><p>FOREST: The testing labs were actually shut down. So, we knew last week there was going to be a spike. But again, as I said at the beginning, full disclosure is important. So, full disclosure of all the facts is really important here. When you have a spike, you need to tell people why you have a spike in a single day.</p><p>BERMAN: Look, all I was doing was putting the numbers up on the screen, and also telling people you've had your single highest day of hospitalizations which is important to keep in mind also. OK, so now people know what the numbers are. Both of the things we have said are out there. But what I want to know is, how you would conduct this convention safely. What is your idea?</p><p>What would you like to see the Republican National Committee come forward with how to do it safely?</p><p>FOREST: Well, there's -- like I said, there's a big span of time between now and then. I think right now we have to operate under the conditions that trend lines are heading down. Things are flattening in North Carolina. What's your ultimate goal? I think somebody needs to declare what the goal is in this pandemic response. It was to flatten the curve. Well, our curve in North Carolina --</p><p>BERMAN: Let's just talk about the convention --</p><p>FOREST: Has always been flat --</p><p>BERMAN: Let's just talk -- I just want to talk about the convention --</p><p>FOREST: Yes --</p><p>BERMAN: Because the president has threatened to pull the convention.</p><p>FOREST: Yes --</p><p>BERMAN: I want to know what you think should be done to do it safely.</p><p>FOREST: Sure --</p><p>BERMAN: So, if the president is given a week-long ultimatum. You keep saying there's three months to decide, I agree. There are three months. The president seems to think there's a week. What I want to know is looking forward, what would your plan be to do it safely?</p><p>FOREST: Well, the plan is to have the convention, to protect the most vulnerable amongst us. We know very clearly, John, who the most vulnerable are. Who the people are that are impacted by this virus, and we can take real strong measures to protect them, 70 percent of the deaths in North Carolina are from nursing homes. So, we know exactly who those folks are.</p><p>The vast majority or the average age of death is over 80 years old in North Carolina. So, protect the most vulnerable, do everything you need to do in that regard, and then allow healthy people to go back about their lives and to start planning for a full convention in North Carolina --</p><p>BERMAN: A full convention?</p><p>FOREST: Just like I would say start planning for sporting events to take place --</p><p>BERMAN: A full convention --</p><p>FOREST: And getting people to fill the stands and all those kinds of things.</p><p>BERMAN: A full convention -- well, sporting events, they're not allowing --</p><p>FOREST: Yes --</p><p>BERMAN: Fans to be in the stands. There was just a NASCAR race in your state where there were no fans in the stands. That may be something that's similar to, you know, the idea of conventions. President Trump says he wants it to be a fully occupied convention. The spectrum center has what, 17,000 seats in it? Would you like --</p><p>FOREST: Something like that, yes --</p><p>BERMAN: Would you like to see --</p><p>FOREST: Something around that range, yes --</p><p>BERMAN: Would you like to see 17,000 people in the Spectrum Center?</p><p>FOREST: I would love to see 17 -- I would love to see 17,000 people, just like I would love to see people at football games again, I would love to see things get back to normal. I think you're going to have to continue to make decisions on things as time goes forward based on, you know, the data that you have at the time. But full disclosure on data is really important. And our --</p><p>BERMAN: Total --</p><p>FOREST: State has not been hit hard compared to other states, all sides --</p><p>BERMAN: Understood. So, I understand -- I mean, everyone wants to see --</p><p>FOREST: And in New York City, New York City may have very different approach to this than North Carolina --</p><p>BERMAN: Everyone wants to see full occupancy -- you keep saying that we need to see and react as things develop. So, why do you need a guarantee today that 17,000 people will be in the Spectrum Centre or allowed to be in the Spectrum Center at the end of August? How can you keep 17,000 --</p><p>FOREST: I didn't say that. Those are -- those are not my words that we need a guarantee today, John. You know, that's the words of other folks, then that's OK, but that's not my words. I said we need to move forward as a team and plan for this. This is a potential great boost to the economy. It's a great boost to the folks of Charlotte.</p><p>I think we should be looking forward and providing some positive input here and some good hope for the future and getting things opened up, and saying to the people who have been planning this convention for two years and the hospitality industry out there that we can move forward with this thing, and let's start planning as if we're going to, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.</p><p>BERMAN: So you said they're not your words. Just to be clear then, do you want the president to back off saying that the governor has to fully guarantee within a week? Because that's what the president has done. He's put an ultimatum. He says within a week, the governor --</p><p>FOREST: I'm not going to tell the president of the United States what to do or what to say. That's a fully --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>This is his convention.</p><p>BERMAN: Is it fair -- is it fair to issue that ultimatum -- is it fair to issue that ultimatum that you need to guarantee within this week?</p><p>FOREST: I think it's fair to issue the ultimatum to say we can move forward with this convention. Let's work together --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BERMAN: But that's not what he's saying, he's saying the full guarantee of 17,000 people --</p><p>FOREST: Well, then talk to the president. Then talk to the president, don't talk to me. You're asking my opinion. I think it's fair to say we can -- these two groups would get together and move forward to have a full convention.</p><p>[07:35:00]</p><p>We should have a positive approach to this. Let's talk about protecting the most vulnerable --</p><p>(CLEARS THROAT)</p><p>Excuse me, how do we do that? How do we protect the most vulnerable and move forward in a reasonable way? I think we should do that? But I think it's the president's prerogative to say, hey, we need to have some guarantee from the state of North Carolina before we spend $35 million down there right now on top of the other millions that have been spent that we can have a convention in Charlotte.</p><p>BERMAN: Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, thanks for being with us this morning. Wish you the best over the course --</p><p>FOREST: Thanks, John --</p><p>BERMAN: Of the Summer. Take care.</p><p>FOREST: Thanks, you too. BERMAN: Alisyn?</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CO-ANCHOR, NEW DAY: Really interesting conversation, John, thank you for all of that. Meanwhile, there are new questions this morning about the future of one coronavirus vaccine trial. The Oxford University trial is now said to have a 50/50 chance of success. CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen joins us with the details. Is that good or bad 50/50?</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Alisyn, I'll say that it's different than what they've been saying for months. This was this past weekend, one of the lead researchers from Oxford saying only that there's a 50 percent chance they'll get no results. That is a very different tone than what the Oxford researchers have been striking for months. They've been saying an 80 percent chance of success.</p><p>One of the researchers telling me in an interview we will be first. He was very confident about that. He also disparaged other vaccine makers, calling their technology weird and nearly noise from the boys. Now, what I'm hearing from emphasis and from infectious disease experts is that there's no -- this is -- there's no time, this is not the time to be insulting other people's products, this is not the time to be bragging and making prognostications that you're going to have to change later.</p><p>Some people are feeling that Oxford has put a spin on their monkey data and made it seem more positive, made the monkey data seem more like the vaccine will work than perhaps what the reality is. So, now these emphasis and doctors saying, look, we need to stop all this, put our nose to the grind stone, pay attention to the science and do what we need to get the data out so that we can have a vaccine on the market. Alisyn?</p><p>CAMEROTA: Elizabeth, thank you very much for all of that update. So, even for those who survived coronavirus, their battle is rarely easy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was a perfectly healthy guy. And you know, in a very short period of time he became deathly ill.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: A family doctor describes his ordeal after nearly two months in the hospital, and the treatment that ultimately saved his life, next.</p><p>[07:40:00]</p><p>CAMEROTA: Now to an incredible story. An Arizona doctor has recovered from a near fatal bout with coronavirus. He spent 55 days in the hospital. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is back with his story. What did he tell you, Sanjay? SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, we're learning so much about this disease, and I can tell you that he's doing well. You're going to see him here in just a second. But the question that he was trying to answer for us is what happens if you try everything in the midst of this disease and nothing seems to work. What options do you have left? Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KARL VIDDAL, FAMILY PHYSICIAN: I started coming down with symptoms. And they're just chills and a cough, and Saturday that kind of progressed into shortness of breath.</p><p>GUPTA: That was late March. And even though 46-year-old Karl Viddal is a family medicine doctor, he still wasn't too worried at first when he returned from a trip feeling sick.</p><p>ROSS BREMNER, DIRECTOR, DIGNITY HEALTH SAINT JOSEPH'S NORTON THORACIC INSTITUTE: We thought that he really had contacted some sort of strange virus.</p><p>GUPTA: Dr. Ross Bremner is a surgeon and the executive director of St. Joseph's Norton Thoracic Institute in Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>BREMNER: He was a perfectly healthy guy. And you know, in a short very period of time, he became deathly ill.</p><p>GUPTA: That sudden decline is something we have heard about over and over again. X-rays that go from looking like this to looking like this. Dr. Viddal managed to face-time with his family right before he had a breathing tube placed.</p><p>(on camera): You were sedated obviously through this. But at some point, it sounds like that wasn't enough.</p><p>VIDDAL: You know, the ventilator settings were maxed out and they decided to go ahead and do ECMO on me.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, think of it as a sort of artificial lung. A last resort when the lungs had become just too stiff, too sick to work. The blood is then pumped out of the body.</p><p>VIDDAL: It runs through a circuit. That circuit oxygenates the blood and removes the carbon dioxide, and then returns that to the right atrium of the heart. It allowed my lungs to rest and heal, and then oxygenate my body and essentially saved my life.</p><p>GUPTA (on camera): Do you think you wouldn't have survived without it, doc?</p><p>VIDDAL: Absolutely not.</p><p>BREMNER: About half of the patients who go on ECMO for COVID don't survive. And he certainly had many brushes with death. GUPTA (voice-over): Because here's the thing. The process of removing all the blood from the body increases both your risk for clotting as well as your risk for bleeding.</p><p>BREMNER: He basically saturated his left lung with blood. He subsequently had some significant bleeding from his airway as well.</p><p>GUPTA: As you might imagine, none of this has been easy for him. Fifty five days in the hospital, 55 pounds of weight gone.</p><p>VIDDAL: Some few weeks ago, I couldn't give you a thumbs up. Now, I'm walking. My strength is coming back slowly, but surely, yes, if I walk up a couple sets of stairs, I do compensate a little bit and I'm huffing and puffing. So, it's going to take a long time to get that physical back.</p><p>[07:45:00]</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's good to get back home, to be back home and be together with family and friends. You know, I'm doing well. Just looking forward to, you know, making hopefully a full recovery.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh, my gosh. Sanjay, the herculean effort that teams of doctors --</p><p>GUPTA: Yes --</p><p>CAMEROTA: Go to, to save just one life. I mean, that's incredible. Can anything that they learned from that be used on other patients, or is that just too extreme of a case?</p><p>GUPTA: Well, this type of technology is becoming more available, but I think what they're learning, and I think what can be applied elsewhere, Alisyn, is this idea that the virus for -- we're not sure why? But for some reason it really seems to cause this very significant decline. Someone who is doing fine, even able to talk to their family on the phone, and then all of a sudden needs a breathing tube.</p><p>The lungs not only develop this infection, but they become so stiff, it's this respiratory distress-like syndrome. And in that case, no matter what, I mean, you can try pumping air in and removing carbon dioxide all you want, but if you think of the lungs like a sponge, but the sponge is hard. No matter how hard you squeeze on it, you're not really going to move air in and out of it.</p><p>So, that's why they have to do this. So, this may become more of an option for people. It is risky as you heard the doctors say. When Dr. Viddal went on this, he had about a 50/50 chance of survival. Luckily, he's doing well, seems to have gotten through the side effects. But as a result of what people are learning from him, they might be able to apply this to other patients.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Sanjay, what an incredible story. Thank you very much for sharing it with us.</p><p>GUPTA: You got it. Thank you.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, up next, we're going to take you to Cape Canaveral, Florida, ahead of the historic SpaceX launch and what this means for the future of America's space program.</p><p>[07:50:00]</p><p>CAMEROTA: We are just hours away from the historic launch of the SpaceX first-man mission. But the weather is not cooperating at the moment. Look at all of that fog on your screen. Two American astronauts hope to blast off to the International Space Station, this would be the first launch with astronauts from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. CNN's Rachel Crane is live at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida with more. How is it looking on your end, Rachel?</p><p>RACHEL CRANE, CNN BUSINESS INNOVATION &amp; SPACE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Alisyn, you know, this launch is a decade in the making, and so much planning goes into having a successful mission. But, of course, one variable NASA has no control over is the weather. As you can see, it's raining here at Kennedy Space Center today, but we still have a couple of hours until that plan lift off. So fingers crossed, the weather will cooperate. As of now, it's still 60 percent favorable.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CRANE (voice-over): SpaceX and NASA are set to launch the Crew Dragon spacecraft, and for the first time, humans will be on board. The Demo 2 mission is a culmination of a decade-long partnership between the agency and Elon Musk's space company.</p><p>JIM BRIDENSTINE, ADMINISTRATOR, NASA: This is really the dawn in a new era of space flight.</p><p>CRANE: The launch is expected to be the first time a private company has ever sent people into orbit.</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: We need to have affordable access to the International Space Station. And that's really what this launch represents.</p><p>CRANE: The two veteran astronauts on board, Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley could stay on the ISS for up to 110 days.</p><p>(on camera): You and Doug have known each other for ages. You were even at each other's weddings. So, does that relationship -- how does that help you in the cockpit at history?</p><p>ROBERT BEHNKEN, NASA ASTRONAUT: You know, we're kind of at the point in our experience, whether it's flying in the T-38 or executing in a SpaceX simulation or approaching a docking to the International Space Station where we, in addition to, you know, finishing each other's sentences, you know, we can predict, you know, almost by body language what the person's opinion is or what they're going to -- what their next action is going to be.</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: In theory, this is the safest spacecraft NASA has ever had. It has to be proven. We haven't proven it yet. That's why we're doing this test flight.</p><p>CRANE (voice-over): The historic flight is happening in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. NASA and SpaceX are both taking serious precautions to keep the astronauts and their staff safe. Beyond quarantine that is standard before any launch, the astronauts have been tested for the virus multiple times. The agency and SpaceX are also urging the public to watch from home. That's despite the fact that SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has called stay-at-home orders fascist.</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: This agency has a history of doing stunning things in very difficult times. And we're going to create this moment in time where everybody can look up, see something very bright and hopeful, and say, look, the future is great.</p><p>CRANE: For NASA, the future involves putting astronauts back on the moon, Mars and even beyond. But for now, Bridenstine's focus is on the Crew Dragon launch.</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: Look, I'm very nervous. I would be -- I would be lying to you if I told you I wasn't. I'll tell you when I spend time with Bob and Doug today, they are both cool as cucumbers. They're ready to go.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CRANE: You know, Bob and Doug both flew on the shuttle, but there's something quite poetic here, because Doug Hurley, he also piloted that final flight of Shuttle Atlantis back in July of 2011. So, you know, something really special about him being in that pilot seat for the end of one era, and also for the dawn of a new one. Alisyn?</p><p>CAMEROTA: Rachel, we're monitoring this and we can see the rocket a little bit more clearly now. I mean, as you point out, anything is possible in Florida, the weather changes, you know, every 10 minutes. But how does this capsule that we're looking at differ from the, you know, now retired shuttles of the past?</p><p>CRANE: Well, the shuttle was shaped like a plane, it was designed to land on a runway. Crew Dragon is a capsule, much like the Apollo era. It's designed to land in the ocean via parachutes. You can hear the thunder above us as you said the weather. Also, there is something very special about this spacecraft. It has an end-to-end abort system, something that NASA says potentially makes this the safest spacecraft they've ever had.</p><p>Meaning that all along the assent path, they would be able to jettison the capsule away from the rocket in the unlikely event of an emergency. Alisyn? CAMEROTA: Really interesting, Rachel, thank you.</p><p>[07:55:00]</p><p>BERMAN: All right, very excited for this, we're watching it very closely. So, new this morning, President Trump is threatening to, quote, \"strongly regulate or close down social media platforms after Twitter fact-checked the president really for the first time, his false claims, dishonest statements about widespread fraud with mail-in ballots. There isn't. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan joins me now. Donie, first, tell us what Twitter is doing for the first time?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN REPORTER: Sure, that's right, John. Thousands of tweets and years later -- at Twitter yesterday for the first time fact-checked its most prolific user. The president was making claims about mail-in ballots. Of course that being considered now as we prepare for an election in the age of COVID-19. And he's even falsely claiming that the governor of California is sending those ballots to undocumented immigrants.</p><p>So, last night, Twitter took action, it was a small action at least, you can see here, it placed a label, a little one on the president's tweet, didn't quite say it was false. It says \"get the facts about mail-in ballots.\" And then if a user clicked on that label, it would bring them to a page that said Trump makes unsubstantiated claims that mail-in ballots would lead to voter fraud.</p><p>Now, unsurprisingly, and really right on cue, Trump and his supporters were outraged by this, saying it was a sign of Silicon Valley's anti- conservative bias, and Trump tweeted last night, saying that Twitter was in some way trying to stifle his free speech. And even as you mentioned, of course, this morning now, the president is tweeting that maybe it's time to regulate big tech.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes, interesting --</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes --</p><p>BERMAN: That he's threatening to shut them down or somehow regulate them. That's not generally what happens in a democracy. Twitter is not the only place though, where the president has been posting these claims or these false statements, these lies. He's also put them on Facebook. What's Facebook doing?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: That's right. The same message has been posted to Facebook by the president, the exact same message. In fact, and I mean, Facebook and Twitter and Google too, they often go to Congress, they'll appear in front of lawmakers, and they'll present a united front to say we are all on the same page in Silicon Valley about fighting voter misinformation ahead of the 2020 election.</p><p>They've been on Capitol Hill multiple times since 2016 when obviously misinformation on social media played a very big role. But overnight, Facebook telling us that, that -- those claims by the president, they're not going to take any action on it. That it's -- the company says that they believe in robust debate and basically just saying that they're not going to take any action here. So with just a few months to go until the election, really just the most basic objective facts about voter information, these companies are not in sync at all.</p><p>BERMAN: And back to Twitter for a moment, if we could. So Twitter did put that little tiny blue fact-check on mail-in ballots but didn't do anything about the president's lies in his -- just flat-out repugnant tweets about Joe Scarborough. Why isn't Twitter doing anything about that?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Well, I mean, you can see there is inconsistency across the different companies in terms of how they fact-check, what they do with this president and what they do with lies more generally. But also even within the company, within Twitter, in the space of 24 hours, Twitter decided to place a label, a fact-check some might call it on voter misinformation from the president.</p><p>But on claims, false claims alleging murder by Joe Scarborough, they decided to not -- that's despite even pleas from the widower of Scarborough's staffer who had died in 2001, asking Twitter to take action. So, to sum it all up really, what Twitter is saying is voter misinformation, not OK, false claims of murder, OK.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes, I mean, look, it's repugnant. It's just shocking that Twitter is allowing it, but that's not the whole story. It's flat-out repugnant that the president's writing it to begin with. All right, Donie O'Sullivan, thank you very much for your reporting.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Thank you --</p><p>BERMAN: NEW DAY continues right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The trajectory of what's going to happen with a pandemic in each state is really very much in the hands of the people in those states.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please wear the masks. The masks are absolutely critical.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The CDC is saying that those antibody tests are wrong, maybe half of the time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We still have a long way of going to get to where we need to be.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The man in the video pleading for his life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This was not a sudden mistake or a procedure gone bad. This was over a period of time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can no longer just stand idly by and think it's going to go away. Because it's not!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2020052704CNV42</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600N-JN61-JB20-G08Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4129\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>North Carolina</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GOP Convention</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Oxford University Vaccine Trial</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Karl Viddal</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

D- Day doesn't get the attention of the drama of the moment, but it deserves the ultimate respect. Thank you to the brave souls who served. Thank you for the gift that you give those of us who reap the benefits of what you wrought with your hearts and heads and hands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you, you and your families. The more we look to you and what you were about 75 years ago the better off we will be today. Thanks for watching. Let me get you quickly to \"CNN TONIGHT\" with D. Lemon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DON LEMON, CNN HOST: Yes, makes you proud to be an American.</p><p>CUOMO: They are the best of us and then there are the rest of us and we need to look to them especially now.</p><p>LEMON: Yes. And you're right, they don't get the fanfare. We talk about the greatest generation and I'm so glad you pointed out the type of people who were fighting in World War I and World War II. These were immigrants, these are people who came over, as you said, some didn't speak English, many of them were vilified by people who, you know, thought they were the so-called -- the elites back then.</p><p>There's a similar narrative as to what's going on right now and we should learn from our history, because now those people who may have been vilified or may have been looked upon as other were the rocks and the foundations of American society and democracy.</p><p>CUOMO: That is how it's always been here, our diversity has always been our strength.</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: We were never the best, we were the rest. And we came together and we made this country what it was. I remember my grandmother saying to me about why my Uncle Frankie and why on my other side, my Uncle Frankie and Uncle Sam, why they went off. Because my stories that I had heard was about them being prejudiced against here.</p><p>You know, pop used to tell the joke, Christopher's a white guy. We finally made it. You know, because he didn't feel like that, he was excluded as an ethnics.</p><p>LEMON: Italians, yes. They were ethnics, right.</p><p>CUOMO: And I remember my grandmother looking at me and even more stranger than usual and she was like what do you mean, we got everything here, America gave us everything, of course we sent them to fight. This is our country too. The profound sense. We can't lose that. We can't lose that sense of belonging no matter what you come from.</p><p>LEMON: I look at my ancestors and the folks who were not allowed to vote, the folks who were not allowed to get an education, just like many people who come to this country, they don't have educations, you know, higher education and look what we became, because we moved -- we came to America even though we were brought here, right, I was, on my ancestors were.</p><p>Here in America we were finally allowed to get an education, to move up the ranks when it comes to work and hopefully in the future, wealth as well. So imagine that with the folks who are coming over now who are seeking a better life. They're not perfect people. Neither of our ancestors were perfect people.</p><p>CUOMO: No, they were highly imperfect.</p><p>LEMON: At all.</p><p>CUOMO: Worked like crazy.</p><p>LEMON: Right. And some of them still don't speak the King's English, let's be honest.</p><p>CUOMO: They weren't going to make the cut today. Not by the president's standards. I don't know if he'd make it by his own standards. What he says he's looking for.</p><p>LEMON: Certainly not with the King's English part.</p><p>CUOMO: Once he figures out where his family comes from. But look, who would have thought, Don, two, or three generations back where your family was that someday you would get to live the dream of being an Italian guy from Brooklyn in a made for TV commercial.</p><p>LEMON: By the way, I don't know if you noticed in that commercial --</p><p>CUOMO: What was the chance that I didn't see that commercial?</p><p>LEMON: I was wearing an Italian horn on my --</p><p>CUOMO: Oh, I saw it. I saw it. El Corno (ph), we call that. That can have very different connotations.</p><p>LEMON: We're talking about a promo for our original series, it's called the movies, we're doing a documentary here on CNN and several of the anchors dressed up as characters from very famous movies. I was John Travolta doing the opening scene from \"Saturday Night Fever\" when he is walking next to that --</p><p>CUOMO: They asked me to do that, but they thought it was too on the nose.</p><p>LEMON: You guys do kind of look alike. You definitely do sound alike.</p><p>CUOMO: my mother used to tell me that I would look like him which is she is complimenting me. But you looked good and you pulled it off very well.</p><p>LEMON: Thank you.</p><p>CUOMO: Eating the pizza was natural for you.</p><p>LEMON: Of course.</p><p>CUOMO: They say you went through 16 slices in that shoot.</p><p>LEMON: I got it from you. You showed me how to do all of that.</p><p>CUOMO: I do love pizza. You did a great job. You can have a great show. Will Hurd is the right guest.</p><p>LEMON: I can't wait. Will Hurd, we got a lot and we've got John Kasich as well. He is standing by. So got to get to him. Thank you, Chris. I will see you soon.</p><p>CUOMO: All right, Don.</p><p>LEMON: This is CNN TONIGHT. I'm Don Lemon. So President Trump in Ireland tonight after wrapping up his state visit to the U.K., but not before joining the queen and other heads of state to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-day and once again showing us a side that we're not always used to seeing with this president, a president honored to stand at the queen's side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a great honor to be with you, great woman, great, great woman.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: But there is also -- there's also what he said in Ireland just a few hours later, defending his plan to slap tariffs on all Mexican goods sold in this country and denying the fact that those tariffs will inflict pain on Americans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[22:05:10] TRUMP: I think I have to step up and if they don't, tariffs will go on and if they go high then companies are going to move back into the United States. That is all. It's very simple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: It's not at all simple. Here at home a Republican rebellion may be brewing, Senators urging the president to hold off and meet with them next week. It is not clear whether enough Republicans would actually break with him or whether they're just delaying in hope that this whole thing will just go away, but make no mistake about this.</p><p>This is a humanitarian crisis at the border. What's at issue in this country is why that is. And what to do about it. The fact is there was a 32 percent increase in migrants encountered or arrested at the Southern Border last month, more than 144,000 people. And of those nearly 133,000 crossed the border illegally. Including over 11,000 unaccompanied children, imagine that.</p><p>Since the first of this year there has been a steady increase in migrants apprehended at the border. So you can call it whatever you want. It is a huge, huge problem. Is the answer slapping tariffs on goods imported from Mexico, if they don't stop the flow of migrants with no clear idea of what it will take to satisfy the president? Is the answer raising prices for Americans on goods from cars, tomatoes to air conditioners to beer while complaining we have nothing to worry about?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The people are going to have to worry about paying the tax, because the companies are going to move back into the United States and there won't be any tariff.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: That is just not true. Tariffs could do real damage to our economy. That's a fact here. And it's not just higher prices. According to an analysis by an economic consulting firm more than 400,000 Americans, more than 400,000 American jobs could be lost. The good news is, though, the White House and Mexican officials are talking tonight. With more talks scheduled tomorrow. As the clock ticks towards Monday's deadline.</p><p>But we're in this mess, because this is a president who refuses to accept the facts when they don't suit him. Surrounding himself with just some yes men and women who will tell him exactly what he wants to hear, but as we say around here, facts first. And whether this president likes it or not he can't just ignore the facts. I want you to listen to what he said about climate change. OK, listen very closely, this is an interview he did with Piers Morgan on \"Good morning Britain\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I believe that there's a change in weather and I think it changes both ways. Don't forget, it used to be called global warming and that wasn't working then it was called climate change and now it's actually called extreme weather.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: OK. So I want -- again, the facts. The president is implying, he is implying that climate change or global warming is nothing more than weather. That is not true. According to NASA, quote, \"Global warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet since the early 20th century that is a result of fossil fuel emission accumulating in the atmosphere.\" That is science.</p><p>The past five years have all been the warmest on record for our planet. And 18 of the hottest 19 years have occurred since 2001. Those are the facts. Weather? Climate change? Two different things. The facts. Prince Charles spent 90 minutes talking one on one with the president trying to convince him of the reality of climate change.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I'll tell you what moved me is his passion for future generations, he is really not doing this for him. He is doing this for future generations. He really feels -- and this is real. He believes that. He wants to have a world that is good for future generations, and I do too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: Ok. I just have to say there, a very, very simple thing would have said Mr. President, do you understand that the difference between climate change and weather patterns that they are two separate things? But I digress. Platitudes with no action behind them. It's really kind of sad.</p><p>Even Prince Charles, a future king of England, a member of a royal family, President Trump admires so much. Even he couldn't get the president to admit that climate change is real and that it threatens future generations all over the world. He couldn't get him to admit the truth. Listen to what the president said today in Ireland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[22:10:03] TRUMP: We have the cleanest air in the world in the United States and it gotten better since I'm president. We have the cleanest water, crystal clean and I always say I want crystal clean water and air.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: This from the president who torches the Paris Climate Agreement, which may have been our best hope of actually doing something to stop climate change. And there's more. I want you to listen to this claim about the reasons for his ban on transgender troops in the military.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They take massive amounts of drugs. They have to. And also, and you're not allowed to take drugs. You are in the military, you're not allowed to take any drugs, you take an aspirin and they have to after the operation. They have to. They have no choice. They have to. And you would actually have to break rules and regulations in order to have that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: OK. Well, that is not true, because the fact is U.S. military personnel can and do take prescription drugs with approval for medical conditions. It's just not true that prescription drug use in the military is not allowed. That is an excuse for a ban that plainly discriminates against transgender people who are willing to risk their lives to serve their country.</p><p>And then there is this. The president claiming in that interview that he has a 94 percent approval rating with Republicans, which he says is an all-time record. \"The Washington Post\" is pointing out that he has made some version of this claim 14 times, but here's the thing. Again, it's just not true. Gallup had the president at a 90 percent -- a 90 percent approval among Republicans in February. He is pretty much stayed there, you know, though, through the most recent Gallup poll in May.</p><p>So -- and Trump is actually in sixth place among Republican presidents since World War II. George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower all had higher approval ratings at some point in their presidencies. So again, these are the facts, facts first. So why is the president lying about that?</p><p>Why claim you're the most popular president in the history of the party when it is so easily proven false? Like I said before, if you lie about anything, you'll lie about everything.</p><p>So will the president stick to his plan to slap tariffs on Mexico on Monday and just how much pain will all of that cost you, the American people? That is the question for former Ohio Governor John Kasich. He is here and he is next.</p><p>[22:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LEMON: Republican Senators want President Trump to hold off on his tariffs in Mexico until they can meet with him when he returns from Europe, but so far -- well, anyway the president's standing firm insisting that tariffs will kick in Monday, if Mexico doesn't agree to somehow stop the flow of migrants to the border.</p><p>I want to talk about this now with John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio. Good evening, sir. I love our conversation. So, let's get started right away. Give me your take on this issue. Tariffs on Mexico and whether this ends up going into effect on Monday. Go.</p><p>JOHN KASICH, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I mean, first of all, the idea is not to have people coming in the country so the president slaps a tariff on Mexico which makes Mexico poorer so then all the sudden Mexicans say, I better cross the border to go get a job in the United States. OK, that is number one.</p><p>Number two, it's going to raise prices for everybody. It is just ridiculous. And the president is using this as a weapon. And do I think it's going to go in on Monday? Who knows? I don't know what's going to happen on Monday. The Senators, yes, they are all saying, you know they are all upset, they're worked up.</p><p>Where are they going to be when he comes home, are they going to be tough enough to say this to him when he comes home? Or are they going to cave? Because I haven't been too impressed with their ability to stand up and speak out. And we'll have to see.</p><p>But you know what, all politics are local, Don, you know, Tip O'Neill said that. It's true. So when all the sudden the farmers and the ranchers and all of these folks and the auto dealers start telling you that you're killing they're business, guess what, all the senators go, well, I'm very concerned about this. As all politics are local.</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>KASICH: So, you know, they may get a little more spine, because their constituents are yelling at them and so, you know, they've got to walk the streets. Donald Trump's not with them when they're out there on their own.</p><p>LEMON: When they're doing those town halls.</p><p>KASICH: You know, I think they're mad about it. But Don, you go to a town hall, you know, I think people are going to yell at them. They're yelling at them about the environment, I know that is true and they don't like these tariffs.</p><p>One other thing, Don, we better stop the war on children that come into this country. You know, there was an article, CBS did extensive reporting on a facility for children in Homestead. I could not read it the first time I saw it, because it made me sick to my stomach. I read it the second time, and the stories in there are horrific.</p><p>The idea that we're going to solve this problem by punishing children that come into this country that is not America. That is not the spirit of what we did on D-day. It's wrong. And if you want to fix this problem how about some comprehensive immigration reform, how about a guest worker program and how about helping all those countries where people are in trouble physically being threatened, help them out there to stop this so they don't have to leave their country.</p><p>LEMON: I take your point. I take your point in that. Let's -- I want to talk about tariffs. Because I don't know if you saw this. One of President Trump's trade advisers is Peter Navarro. He was on CNN this morning with Jim Sciutto. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Does the president know who pays the tariffs?</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING TARIFFS: When you say you and I know I don't know that at all. Here's what I know. We have the same discussion --</p><p>SCIUTTO: The Coke brothers say it's a tax on American businesses.</p><p>NAVARRO: The Coke brothers, come on now. Let's talk about this discussion on who bears the burden of these tariffs. We had the same discussion with the China tariffs. Everybody's trying to claim that somehow American consumers bear that burden. That is exactly wrong. China --</p><p>SCIUTTO: How is that wrong? American companies have to pay the tariffs on the goods they import and they pass those costs on to consumers. It's not a discussion.</p><p>NAVARRO: You want to let me explain this?</p><p>SCIUTTO: Absolutely, but the facts are facts.</p><p>NAVARRO: can you give me a minute here without interrupting me, Jim. OK? Here's the way this works. China bears most of the burden of the tariffs. What happens when we put the tariffs on is China is forced to lower their price, they have fewer exports, lower profits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[22:20:05] LEMON: So I just want to get your reaction to that, governor. Because the truth is --</p><p>KASICH: I don't -- I mean, I don't know where he gets his economics from. Here's what I do know. Because of the tariffs, right, because of all the disruption with China, we now have a welfare program for farmers to give them money, because they can't get their products out of here.</p><p>When we say that these tariffs and this trade wars don't hurt us, why is the head of the Federal Reserve beginning to talk now about cutting interest rates because he is worried the economy is going to slow. I don't agree with him. Look, I don't want to go and, you know, personally attack somebody or -- but I will tell you this, I could not more profoundly disagree.</p><p>So when a car comes in -- when an auto part comes in from Mexico with a high tariff on it and gets put in a car when I go to buy the car I pay a higher price. I mean this is not complicated. I have no clue what --</p><p>LEMON: OK. Let's talk about the election. I want to move on and talk about the election with you. All right. Because this is a new poll. I found that a majority of Americans, 54 percent think that President Trump will win reelection, 41 percent think that he'll lose.</p><p>And that is a reversal from December when a narrow majority thought that Trump would lose reelection. Where do you fall on this? Do you think that he has a good shot of winning reelection?</p><p>KASICH: I don't personally think he is going to win. I'll tell you why. I don't know, it depends who they pick. If the Democrats pick Biden or somebody like Biden that is sort of center left, if they pick Biden, I can tell you, Pennsylvania's gone. You know, the Democrats will win Pennsylvania, probably win Michigan as well. Wisconsin, you know, they probably will win that. I was told tonight that Trump is trailing in North Carolina by 12 points.</p><p>Now, I mean, he is likely to win that narrowly, but you've got to look at the math. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, critical. And now the Trump people are beginning to say that they want to go to New Mexico, maybe, or go to New Hampshire.</p><p>I don't think that is going to work. Now if the Democrats are crazy, which they have the full capability of being, then anything can happen, but all things being said a moderate candidate can carry himself well, I think wins the election and not just on the basis of issues, but on the basis of the disruption, the character issues, the criticisms.</p><p>That's -- we saw it in the midterm elections where suburban people said no thank you to the Republicans. There was a poll out the other day that shows young people leaving the Republican Party in droves particularly because of issues like the environment. So -- and immigration. So this is not a good thing. I happen to be a Republican and it's falling apart.</p><p>LEMON: So, listen, Governor Kasich, at the start of the week, you shot off a tweet. And let me read it, you said, we mark our anniversaries this week of two great events, that had inspired freedom loving people around the world by reminding us how fragile our freedoms remain in the face of modern day tyranny. I mean, you point out -- you point to D-day in Tiananmen Square. How do you view the importance of those two events through the prism of Trump's presidency?</p><p>KASICH: Well, I'm just very concerned about the attack on basic institutions in this country and look I talk about those two things because we have to be very wary of autocrats and we just had Urban, who is the leader over in Europe, Central Europe, he came to the White House, he was given a great come on in kind of thing, that was ridiculous. This guy is -- he is harassing the press, he harasses the courts. We shouldn't be honoring people who are autocrats. I just simply don't agree with that.</p><p>And so, you know, when it comes to the world we are dividing ourselves, including using tariffs, trade wars, dividing ourselves from the very people who their people fought with us on D-day, the very people who helped us to defeat the Nazis all across the world. And think about this, we better get a reality check, by the way, when it comes to China.</p><p>You know, we tried to coddle them, and I don't disagree with the president going after China on trade, but he should not have done it alone. He should have done it with our friends around the world who are as frustrated with China as we are. We've coddled them.</p><p>Gerald Baker at the Wall Street Journal wrote a piece, in fact, I want to call him and he said we've tried to coddle them economically forever. Have they changed? No. In fact, they're getting worse. Look at the facial recognition cameras, Don, you know about that over there?</p><p>You get on a bus, they're watching everything you do. If you happen to be a member of an ethnic group they're watching you. They're watching everything you do. And I worry, ultimately, about what's happening in Hong Kong and the fact that Hong Kong's going to lose their freedom.</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>KASICH: This is very serious matter.</p><p>LEMON: Well, let's hope something is done about it and it doesn't spread here. We don't need an autocrat here, thank you, sir.</p><p>KASICH: No, and we've got to stop this business of attacking our institutions and attacking the press. You can ask the press to be fair, you can ask them to be more objective, but the press is the watch guard on all these powerful figures, all these politicians and all the stuff that happens. Thank god for the press. They've got a responsibility and you understand that.</p><p>[22:25:10] LEMON: You're speaking my language. Thank you. I'll see you soon. We will have a conversation soon. Thank you, governor. I really appreciate it.</p><p>KASICH: All right, sir, thank you.</p><p>LEMON: Border apprehensions are soaring right now. What is behind the spike in arrest? I'm going to talk to Texas Congressman Will Hurd, who represents the longest stretch of the Southern Border next.</p><p>LEMON: There was a 32 percent increase in migrants arrested or encountered at our Southern Border in May, Customs and Border Patrol announcing today that there were over 144,000 in May, the highest monthly total in 13 years, but -- so why is this happening?</p><p>That is the question. Why is this happening? Let's talk now to Congressman Will Hurd, he is a Republican from Texas and a member of the Homeland Security Committee. It's so good to have you on. And you're the right person to explain this, because I mean, this is -- you have the longest stretch of border.</p><p>REP. WILL HURD (R), TEXAS: I do, 820 miles of border.</p><p>LEMON: Of any representative here in the United States. So the numbers are staggering now, 144,000 people in the month of May alone. The longest stretch of border in the country.</p><p>[22:30:00] You and your constituents are witnessing this crisis firsthand. So what's happening? What's driving this?</p><p>REP. WILL HURD (D), TEXAS: So the ultimate root causes is, is people are leaving the northern triangle, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras because of violence and lack of economic opportunities in those countries. But why are we seeing these staggering numbers now at our border? And you showed the stat of comparing May of 2019 to May of 2018. But all of last year, 400,000 people came in the country illegally, right?</p><p>And so this is how staggering this current crisis really is. What is happening is every person that's coming into our country illegally, and the best way to think of it is many of these folks are surrendering to border patrol, right? And then you have one border patrol agent that has to corral sometimes dozens, sometimes hundreds of people in El Paso.</p><p>Recently, about a thousand people were arrested all at one time. And they're all being treated as an asylum seeker.</p><p>LEMON: Did that not used to happen?</p><p>HURD: It did not used to happen. I think over a little bit over thousand at the most it happened. I think all of last year, there was about a dozen groups that were apprehended.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEMON: Why did that change?</p><p>HURD: It changed because everybody is being treated as an asylum seeker when they're coming here, even though when they're originally arrested, they're not actually -- not all of them are claiming asylum.</p><p>LEMON: Why is everyone being -- what changed it to make everyone be treated as an asylum seeker?</p><p>HURD: This is a Department of Homeland Security policy on how they're interpreting the laws.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEMON: From the executive branch?</p><p>HURD: From the executive branch.</p><p>LEMON: OK. All right, so then the policy is different. More people are coming over, but also, the policy is different, and more people have realized or the interpretation of the policy.</p><p>HURD: Yeah. So yeah, so the policy is the interpretation of the law.</p><p>LEMON: Got it.</p><p>HURD: And the law on asylum is very simple. If you have to be part of a protected class, there are five protected classes. You have to be persecuted by your government. Or if you're persecuted by a group, let's say MS-13, you have to be able to prove that the government can't or won't protect you, all right? And so those are the foundations for asylum.</p><p>Our asylum laws have basically been the same since the 80s. Most of our immigration laws haven't -- the last changes were in 2011, 2008.</p><p>LEMON: OK. This is what I am getting, and maybe I am wrong. It sounds like the interpretation of the law with this change, treat everyone as an asylum seeker, is somehow incentivizing more people to come over because they realize I can be treated as an asylum seeker because the other way they may have been...</p><p>HURD: Deported.</p><p>LEMON: Right.</p><p>HURD: Yeah.</p><p>LEMON: Of which was under the former administration.</p><p>HURD: Sure, yes.</p><p>LEMON: So it sounds like under this administration they have somehow incentivized people to come over more.</p><p>HURD: By treating everybody as an asylum seeker, which then means they basically stay in the United States for almost five years before they go through their complete immigration court case, they're able to be released into a chaperon or a sponsor somewhere else in the country, and that is what is driving -- that is the pull that is pulling people here.</p><p>LEMON: They get here and say what?</p><p>HURD: Credible fear, right? I have credible fear. And usually what's happening, though, they're not doing it when they're arrested. They get arrested. They get put in a holding tank. They're in a room with dozens of other people. And those people say, hey, you've got to claim credible fear. And then you get processed differently instead of doing what's called expedited removal, which is deportation.</p><p>LEMON: And the folks at home, they call them or they hear about it?</p><p>HURD: Yeah. They hear about it and you start seeing more people coming.</p><p>LEMON: All right.</p><p>HURD: That's the other reason why you're also -- so probably two months ago, 90 percent -- so my -- the border is broken up into sectors, and so the sectors that I represented, the 90 percent of the people who are coming from the northern triangle, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras.</p><p>What you're starting to see now is you're seeing people coming from the Congo. You're starting to see people come from Cuba, because they're all hearing what's happening. And that's why we've got to fix some of these asylum laws.</p><p>LEMON: I think that has helped to explain this -- all the sudden this number of people is coming over. It is the way the law that is being interpreted now, the policy. It is incentivizing people to come over in large numbers. OK, so then the question is, as someone who represents the largest stretch, what is the fix? How would you fix it?</p><p>[22:34:48] HURD: Well, there's multiple fixes. A quick fix is we are working on some fixes to the asylum laws. If you -- usually, when you apply for asylum, you should apply in the country next to the country you're leaving, right? That's generally what's accepted around the world. And then if you come through Mexico, where there is a U.N. facility to have people claim asylum in Oaxaca, Mexico.</p><p>And then you don't do that, and then you come in between our ports of entry. You're trying to sneak into the country. That shows that your motivations are not pure. So you've got to make sure that you're following the rules that way. That's one fix. Don't treat everybody that comes here as an asylum seeker. The way the law is written now, the individual that is adjudicating the asylum claim can take into account that individual's credibility.</p><p>Does it make sense? And so a lot of times what happens, border patrol is hearing the exact same story, same words from 50 different people, from different places, because that's the story that's been told. The other thing I would do is I would make sure the intelligence community is collecting intelligence on the human smugglers.</p><p>The other reason you're seeing more people coming here as well is it's hard to get from Tegucigalpa to El Paso. And it used to take, lie, two weeks. Now, you see drug cartels invest in bussing companies, and you've seen them now getting here within four or five days.</p><p>LEMON: Collect intelligence on that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HURD: And work with our people.</p><p>LEMON: Are tariffs the answer?</p><p>HURD: Absolutely not. Tariffs are a tax on the American consumer, period. End of story.</p><p>LEMON: Yeah. Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>HURD: Of course.</p><p>LEMON: Appreciate that, Congressman Will Hurd. YouTube is removing hundreds of thousands of videos because of extremist views and hateful speech. But is it too little, too late?</p><p>[22:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LEMON: Hate is big online. And now, some tech companies are working to stop it. Just today, YouTube said it will ban accounts that post hateful videos on its site, which is a good start, especially because hate speech online and hate crimes are on the rise. YouTube says that it will ban videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation, or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status.</p><p>On top of that, they are going to remove videos that deny well documented atrocities like the holocaust or the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. YouTube says hundreds of thousands of videos will be removed. That's a lot of videos. But in the case of some videos, the damage has already been done, like the videos that claim that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax.</p><p>In reaction to today's announcement, a lawyer representing families of Sandy Hook victims put it this way, saying it's too late to undo the harm that has been caused by conspiracy theories that have been circulating on the site. The lawyer added, at the same time better late than never. How will these sites navigate the line between free speech and hate speech?</p><p>It was only yesterday when YouTube said videos mocking a news video producer for his sexual orientation did not violate the websites policies. I want you to listen to what Carlos Maza. Carlos Maza is a video producer for the Web site VOX. What he says he's been attacked over his sexual orientation by a YouTube user for years. He says the videos mocking him have made him the target of harassment.</p><p>And to bring attention to it, Maza put together a compilation of homophobic insults being hurled at him in right wing commentator, Steven Crowder's YouTube videos. We're going to play you a little of bit, but not a lot.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN CROWDER, RIGHT WING COMMENTATOR: You're being given a free pass as a crappy writer because you're gay. Set a line on the queer graph there. Now the graph is queer.</p><p>Is this violence, fear?</p><p>CROWDER: The little queer can eat his chips all nonchalantly. (Inaudible) chip, chip, bet you can't eat just one, like dicks. Let's be queer from VOX. What were you holding, gay Latino from VOX?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: Disgusting. In a tweet to Carlos Maza, YouTube says that they conducted an in depth review of the videos that were flagged to them. They say that what they saw was clearly hurtful, but the videos do not violate their policies. This issue is not limited to one person targeted or even one social media site. Hate online is everywhere.</p><p>According to the ADL, 37 percent of Americans experience severe hate and harassment in 2018 across the internet. And when it comes to white supremacy online, U.S. white nationalists have thrived. For example, on Twitter, American white nationalist movements have seen their followers grow by more than 600 percent since 2012. In fact, growth in white nationalists and Nazi accounts on Twitter outpaced ISIS by almost every metric, in part because they faced less pressure from suspensions. That's all according to a 2016 study from George Washington University. And like YouTube, other big tech is starting to take hate seriously. It was only just a few months ago that Facebook said that it was banning white nationalist content from its platform.</p><p>That ban came two weeks after the suspect in that terror attack at two New Zealand mosques streamed part of the massacre live on Facebook. Remember that? A manifesto allegedly written by suspect reveals white nationalist views. But how seriously is the U.S. government taking the hate online? That's a really big question.</p><p>Well, Congress held a hearing just yesterday on white supremacy. And they talked about how people can become radicalized online. And at the hearing, an official from the Trump administration admitted that they are not doing enough to combat hate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[22:45:01] ELIZABETH NEUMANN, HOMELAND SECURITY ASSISTANT SECRETARY: We know we're not doing enough. Part of the reason we haven't done enough is because things have not -- it's bureaucratic, it's boring. Things haven't been institutionalized. In order for government to work, you have to institutionalize it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: Well, the Trump administration could be doing more to combat hate online. In fact, there was a huge missed opportunity just a few weeks ago. The White House recently announced that the U.S. will not be joining the Christ's Church Call for Action, a global effort to encourage tech companies in countries to work together to end the use of social media in acts of terrorism in the wake of the New Zealand terror attack.</p><p>This all begs the question. Who is responsible for curbing hate online? The internet is a big place, and there's a lot of hate to get rid of. We've got a lot more to break down here so make sure you stay with us.</p><p>[22:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LEMON: YouTube is taking down hundreds of thousands of video in an attempt to curb hate online. The site says that it will ban supremacist content and remove videos that deny well documented atrocities like the holocaust. So let's discuss. Wes Lowery is here as well Adam Serwer, good evening, gentlemen, so good to have you on.</p><p>Adam, we're going to start with you. What do you think? Is YouTube taking a step in the right direction? Is this something that they should have done a long time ago?</p><p>ADAM SERWER, SENIOR EDITOR, THE ATLANTIC: Well, look. YouTube's rules work a lot like the American criminal justice system. If you're small and unimportant, they apply to you. And you're influential, they don't really. And that's just the way it works. You know, obviously they're under the First Amendment. You have the right to be as extreme and nasty and racist or bigoted as you want.</p><p>But YouTube, as a private company, is not obligated to provide you with a platform for that kind of message. But unfortunately, as a private company, their profit motive is making money. And so if their -- if your content is extreme and it brings eye balls, they're not going to police that content unless they feel like it's not going to cost them not to. And that's what's happening here.</p><p>LEMON: Yeah. Wesley, listen, I want to talk to you about this, because, you know, we played a little bit of that hate video. Again, it's Carlos Maza. We don't usually like to play that stuff. But I think it's important for people to see it, because then they don't have an idea. And they may not believe it or something that they go, OK, well, why don't you turn off your thing.</p><p>But it's more serious than that. This is according to a source that's familiar with YouTube's actions. One of the accounts removed belonged to a Norwegian man, Wes, who is associated with neo-Nazism. And based on the data reviewed by CNN, this account had more than 250,000 subscribers. Online extremist had huge followings. And they do disgusting things like we saw in that video against Carlos.</p><p>WESLEY LOWERY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Of course. We were talking about this (Inaudible). It can be hard for folks who themselves don't have comment platforms -- haven't gone through this type of harassment when suddenly your phone gets 300 txt messages. Or you're getting death threats which I know many folks here at CNN have dealt with.</p><p>It's a type of harassment that really is horrifying. It's incumbent upon these platforms to do something about it. Now, I don't mean to point (Inaudible) important, that very often the rules of these platforms -- and it's not just YouTube, but Twitter, Facebook or others getting forced -- the lowest level people but not the highest level people.</p><p>In reality it should be the opposite, right? They want to have a broad policy. This thing you get removed or if you post this thing, you get removed. But we have to remember power and platform relate each other. It's not one person making one racist remark who has no followers is very different that someone who has millions of followers making that of remark or homophobic remark or harassment remark.</p><p>And so in some ways, platforms -- people have larger platforms need to be policed more tightly.</p><p>LEMON: But there's also this sneaky think that they claim they sort of couch it, Adam, in -- well, this is about free speech. Well, you don't have the right to go to a platform, especially if it's a private platform to spread hate. But they say this is free speech and you're trying to ban, and they wrap it in conservatism. And not because -- but not all conservatives believe that. But they try to do that because they want to wrap it in free speech and they want an excuse to be able to continue spreading hate online. SEWER: Well, that's part of the reason why you saw these platforms be very successful at removing ISIS-related extremist content, because conservatives didn't feel targeted by that. But when platforms say they're going to start policing bigotry, a lot of conservatives start feeling you're going to start policing my speech because liberals think everything that conservatives say is racist.</p><p>So I think unlike with the ISIS content, when YouTube starts actually trying to enforce rules against things like racial slurs or homophobic slurs, they're worried about a larger political backlash that simply isn't going to happen when you're policing ISIS videos or ISIS extremists messages.</p><p>LEMON: So Wes, the -- here's what the ADL found. White supremacists accounted for 78 percent of the extremist related fatalities in 2018, 39 deaths. That was up 59 percent in 2017, up from 59 percent -- excuse me in 2017. How big of a role does social media play in that, you think?</p><p>LOWERY: It's a massive role. Now, again, a lot of online conversation is different from the real world. There are a lot of people who go on the internet and just talk and talk and talk and aren't going to do anything. But what we see in all of typed (Inaudible) international as well domestic terror groups is that there's a radicalization process that happens online as well as a communal process (Inaudible).</p><p>So your buddy in Pittsburgh is talking to a person in LA. And they're sharing memes and they're sharing conspiracy theories. And then one of those people goes, you know, what people talk about with extremists' rhetoric, both in online spaces, but also we have to add from the president of the United States and others, people who kind of flirt with some of this language and these discussions.</p><p>[22:55:06] It deputizes people, right? If there's a really crisis at the border, if people are invading, and they're going to come and take your jobs, well then don't you have to go do something about that. If the black people are stealing all of your -- or the gay agenda is taking over the -- well then if that was really true, wouldn't you have to go do something about that.</p><p>And that's the logic that leads very often to these actual acts of terrorism is the extremist rhetoric, the extreme rhetoric deputizes people to take extreme physical, and that imperils all of our safety.</p><p>LEMON: Wes and Adam, important conversation. I appreciate you joining us and we'll continue the discussion. Thank you so much. We'll be right back.</p><p>SEWER: Thank you for having me.</p><p>LEMON: Absolutely. Well be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019060501CNV68</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8W-SJP1-DXH2-605R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6978\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00054EM</classCode><className>S A WHITE MARTINS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>D-Day</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.K.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mexico</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tariffs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Border</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Prince Charles</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Department of Homeland Security</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>YouTube</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Carlos Maza</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Administrative Proceedings</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDVDQzJDOTlBMjVENDAwNjg5RjU5RkUyNzM1QzgzOEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFEMUZENzNBNkY0NDlEREI3MDBDMTRFM0IwQ0Y2NTk</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Eligibility Requirements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTU3REE1NDlEQ0FCNEE2Rjk3OTNGMEIwREQ1NUY1Mjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MERBRUQyMkNCODY5NEI5MkFERkU4Qjc5MkZDRDRCN0I</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Immigration Officers</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTM0NTNBODQ1Q0FFNDZDREJBRDA0MTgzQTdGQTZEMTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MThGRjk5N0E2MTI4NEJGQjkwMDBCRjc5NkZDQUE4NzU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Asylum</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0IyQzc2NTFGMjM2NDRBMkEwQUFBREJBNUI1Q0RCN0M7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Labor &amp;

That rare move by \"New York Times\" to publish an anonymous op-ed by a  quote, \"senior official inside the White House in D.C.\" Saying there is a  quite resistance within the administration of people choosing to put  country first. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And that the cabinet earlier has discussed invoking the 25 amendment to  remove the president. We've got immediate reaction from Kayleigh McEnany of  the RNC coming up. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And we are awaiting the president to come out during a meeting with  sheriffs. He may comment on this anonymous op-ed. </p><p> And big tech taken to the woodshed on Capitol Hill. Senators threatening  the government will take action to regulate social media like Facebook,  Twitter, and Google. The Justice Department now looking into claims of  conservative censorship on social media. More on that story.</p><p> Another day of chaos, more protests during day two of Kavanaugh's hearing.  We've got the highlights. We are monitoring the ongoing hearing. </p><p> Plus, a Fox Business exclusive. Tonight, Uber CEO here to talk to Susan Li.  He has to prove to Wall Street that Uber is ready to go public despite a  deluge of controversy and scandal. </p><p> And a story flying under the radar, President Trump plans to chair a U.N.  Security Council meeting to take on Iran. You heard me right. The U.N., a  place that President Trump has blasted for wasteful spending and  ineffectiveness. We've got that story.</p><p> Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth  MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p> First to your money, the Dow closing slightly higher, ending the day at  25,974. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P falling. Netflix lead a steep tech sell-off.  More on your money in just a second. </p><p> But first to that \"New York Times\" anonymous op-ed, it appears to be  written by a male senior official, that's according to the Times Twitter  account. </p><p> With me now live from White House is Blake Burman with the latest. Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Liz. Don't know exactly  who this person is, the New York Times op-ed page in which this article is  published, identifies as person as a senior administration official. The  title here is, quote, \"I am part of the resistance inside the Trump  administration.\" </p><p> When you boil down this op-ed this person says that themselves along with  others are working inside the Trump administration to essentially keep it  on track as they see it. This is what the senior administration official  writes anonymously in this op-ed at one point. </p><p> Quote, speaking of the president, \"The dilemma - which he does not fully  grasp, is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are  working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his  worst inclination.\" </p><p> This anonymous senior administration official also goes on to write in that  op-ed the following. Quote, \"Given the instability, many witnessed there  were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25 amendment which  would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted  to precipitate a constitutional crisis, so we will do what we can to steer  the administration in the right direction until one way or the other it is  over.\" </p><p> We need to point out, Liz, that this person is identified as a senior  administration official, so we don't know if that person works within this  very White House or if they are an official within the Trump administration  somewhere here in Washington D.C.</p><p> The president is here about to speak inside the White House right now, Liz.  Let's listen in.</p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MASSACHUSETTS:  Great job, keep up  the good work. Thanks, everybody. </p><p> Mr. President, we remember when you first were giving your acceptance  speech of the nomination at the GOO convention, you said at that time that  one year from now when I take over the White House I am going to  reestablish the rule of law in this country, and you have done that, Mr.  President. We thank you for that.</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thank you.</p><p> HODGSON:  Very, very much. </p><p> TRUMP:  Thank you. </p><p> HODGSON:  You know, behind me, Mr. President, are 44 sheriffs, who are  representing 35 states that came here to Washington for two reasons. The  first is to go to Congress to the Capitol today hold a press conference and  let Congress know enough is enough. </p><p> We've been for 20 years, asking Congress to move on the security aspects of  immigration reform, and nothing has happened for 20 years. </p><p> But what's really amazing, Mr. President, with your strength and purpose  the commitment to your convictions you've done more in less than two years  in supporting law enforcement and dealing with this illegal immigration  problem that we've been asking for solutions on in less than two years. </p><p> And again, all these sheriffs and sheriffs across the nation are grateful  to you for that, Mr. President. </p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> HODGSON:  And like so many of the promises that you made, you have come  through and the energy that you put behind law enforcement in supporting us  on our partnership with 287G, going after MS-13 and getting them out of our  neighborhoods, t building the wall, Mr. President, you've really did  amazing.</p><p> And so, before I president this plaque I just want to add one thing that  maybe you heard about, maybe you didn't. But when we were on the Hill  today, we announced that the National Sheriff Association has done a crowd  funding page to raise money and mobilize the citizens of this nation to get  behind you, to get behind the sheriffs to build this wall. </p><p> So, in having said that, I would like to present this to you, Mr.  President, because, it's not surprising for any of the sheriffs who are  here, that shortly after you took office, people started saying the  citizens and members of the media saying, there is a new sheriff in town. </p><p> And that's an endearing statement, and all these sheriffs know it. Because  what it denotes is that there are problems and somebody is coming in that's  going to be able to fix those problems. You've done that, Mr. President, we  can't thank you enough for your support, you said you have our back. And  the sheriffs across this nation, have yours. And God bless you. Thank you,  Mr. President.</p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, that's really nice. This is an honor because when I was  running I think number one on our list of law enforcement, taking care of  law enforcement, working with law enforcement. </p><p> And really we have to create guidelines and principles for the incredible  job you've done, and you've done an amazing job. </p><p> And I will tell you, a lot of times you are scorned and you are looked at  by the media, because the media is very dishonest, much of it in this  country, very, very dishonest. And the job that you've done in light of all  the things that you have to go through, I guess a little bit like me also,  but I will say that you have been really outstanding, incredible people. </p><p> Crime statistics are down. We're really doing well other than you take a  couple of places on a nation where they have different policies than we  would put, and you know where I'm talking about. </p><p> But there are a couple of places they don't believe in what we believe, but  we have together done something very special. </p><p> I also remember so well, sheriff, when we were together, I said we're going  to get a lot of military equipment that you weren't able to get and it was  sitting in warehouses all over the country. </p><p> And in many cases like in other countries, you remember, and we brought it  back home, and you were able to get great military equipment that you  couldn't afford to buy in your budgets and we gave it to you and it  protected a lot of people. </p><p> We have a lot of people living today in your profession that would not  frankly be around right now without the protection of that kind of  equipment that we have sitting around, waiting and doing nothing, and just  drawing dust. </p><p> So, the fact that you gave me this award is very meaningful. I will put  that in a place of great honor in the Oval Office. But I really appreciate  it. Thank you very much, it's a great honor. Thank you. </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> TRUMP:  Thank you, all. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you very much.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. President, keep up the good work.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We stand behind you.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BURMAN:  Liz, you are hearing the President of United States at an event  with sheriff officers here inside the White House. One of the big question  is whether or not the president will answer any questions from the press  pool inside that event. Of course the biggest question will be about this  New York Times op-ed. </p><p> I'll send it back to you in case you want to (Inaudible) the president.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Blake, and we are going to need you to monitor the press pool,  we want to know what are the questions, and what the president says about  this anonymous bombshell op-ed by a senior White House official. </p><p> Apparently, a man, who is alleging a bunch of things about the president,  including that there were early whispers that amongst cabinet members to  evoke the 25 amendment to remove President Trump.</p><p> Thank you, Blake. You're going to stay on that story for us throughout the  hour. </p><p> Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You read the op-ed. What's your reaction?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Well there obviously  are substantial forces very close to the president that candidly do not  believe he's fit for office. This is calling a bombshell, which is the  phrase that you used is actually being charitable. </p><p> I mean, this devastating to the president, the president should have around  him people who believe in him and trust him. This is obvious somebody who  he thinks believes in him and trust him who has revealed a consensus  amongst those around him that question his fitness for office. And it was  also revealed that there were serious discussions about the 25th amendment. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, so in the piece, whoever the writer is said we want  the administration to succeed. They bring up that the president is in their  mind, anti-trade an anti-democratic. They say the root of the problem is  the president's immorality he's not more to discern with first principle,  and that he acted in a manner detrimental to the health of the Republican.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  That is a serious an allegation as could be. That is a code  phrase for worthy of impeachment. If he is acting in the opinion of this  writer whoever it is.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Acting in a manner injurious to the health of the republic. </p><p> MACDONALD:  And as Melissa Francis has said pointed out earlier in the  hour, opinions usually, you own the opinion with your name on it. Let's  listen to the president.</p><p> TRUMP:  -- working today that at any point ever in our history. We've  created 400,000 manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs are growing at the  fastest pace in more than 30 years, economic growth last quarter was 4.2  percent. </p><p> And as you people know it was headed down, big, and it was a low number,  very low number. It would have been, in my opinion, it would have been less  than zero, it was heading to negative numbers. </p><p> New employment claims recently hit a -- think of that. The unemployment  picture in the country is the best it has been in 49 years, African- American unemployment is lowest in the history of the country. </p><p> Asian-American unemployment lowest in the history of our country, Hispanic- American unemployment lowest in the history of our country. </p><p> I mean, I'm just looking at this point after point. Under my  administration, veteran's unemployment reached its lowest in many years.  The -- let's see, almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food  stamps just since my election. </p><p> Then you go into all of the benefits that we got from the tax cuts, all of  you people benefitted tremendously from the tax cuts.</p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> TRUMP:  We're going to regulation cuts, we're going to right to try, right  to try is where you have right is if a person is terminally  ill you have a  right to go and try and see whether or not a drug that's not approved yet  can be used. They didn't allow that. </p><p> A point after point we're getting rid of the individual mandate, the most  unpopular thing there is in Obamacare. Coming up with new healthcare plans. </p><p> We've never had a period, even if you look at the Olympics, we got the  Olympics, the World Cup, you say them, they were in my office, got the  World Cup, nobody has -- and we have started the wall. Nobody has ever done  in less than a two-year period what we've done.</p><p> So when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration,  probably it was failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons, no.  And the New York Times is failing. If I weren't here I believe the New York  Times probably wouldn't even exist.</p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> TRUMP:  And some day -- and some day when I'm not president, which  hopefully will be in about six and a half years from now. The New York  Times and CNN, and all of these phony media outlets will be out of  business, folks. They'll be out of business because they'll be nothing to  write, and they'll be nothing of interest. </p><p> So nobody has been what this administration has done. And I agree, it's  different from an agenda which is much different than ours, and it's  certainly not your agenda, that I can tell you. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you. </p><p> TRUMP:  It's about open borders, it's about letting people flee into our  country, it's about a disaster and crime for our country. </p><p> So, they don't like Donald Trump, and I don't like them, because they are  very dishonest people. Remember this also, about the New York Times, when I  won they were forced to apologize to their subscribers. They wrote a letter  of apology it was the first time anybody has ever done it because they  covered the election incorrectly.</p><p> So if the failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial -- can you  believe it, anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial -- we are doing  a great job. The poll numbers are through the roof. Our poll numbers are  great. </p><p> And guess what, nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because  of what we've done. We've done more than anybody ever thought possible in - - it's not even two years. So thank you very much. We appreciate it. </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. That was President Trump taking on directly this anonymous  op-ed in the New York Times that is quoting a senior White House official - - let me back up, it was written by a senior White House official. We at  Fox Business believe it a man, according on the New York Times own Twitter  account he is identified as a he, the author of this anonymous piece.</p><p> Let's bring the judge back here. You saw the president really going hard at  New York Times with his comments that, basically the Times is failing  according to his mindset and that it wouldn't exist without him and when he  is going to -- he says he is going to be here for six an half more years.  And CNN and New York Times may not exist then.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, I thought that his impromptu response now was actually a  pretty good one. If he started to go through line by line the anonymous op- ed a, he is going to give it more credibility than he wants to give it, and  b, he is going to find himself going down rabbit holes of attempting to  retort anonymous allegations which are incendiary, in which he doesn't want  to give the credence to. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, the other thing the president brought up which is  interesting is about the New York Times letter of apology that New York  Times wrote to its readers about -- I guess people are trying to contact  you about this op-ed that basically--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  This is not from the author of the op-ed. I don't think it is. </p><p> MACDONALD:  That is, it looks like I'm looking at the New York Times  apology letter to readers after the election. Basically, the New York Times  is taking accountability for the coverage, because they too were surprised  that Trump won. What do you make of President Trump bringing up the Times  apology letter to readers there? </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, it's the Trump strategy, go on the offensive, he is not  going to dignify this op-ed piece or New York Times by going through it  line by line, he is going to attack the messenger here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Judge--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  The 25th amendment is something that in my view can only be  invoked if a vice president personally authorizes it, not going to happen. </p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Wow. We've got an hour of thick and fast breaking  news. Judge, thank you so much for your insights here.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p> MACDONALD:  The anti-Trump resistance movement in the White House. We're  staying on story of this anonymous current senior Trump official in the  White House writing that New York Times op-ed. We're going to have more on  that story after the break, stay there. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Moments ago, addressing that anonymous New York Times op-ed by  a senior official within the administration while talking with the nation's  sheriffs at White House. </p><p> Let's talk more with the judge more about what happened with that op-ed. It  says a senior official, that's a pretty elastic term. It could be anybody  in the executive branch. </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Right. As our colleague Blake Burman just pointed out, it  could be anybody in the executive branch which means all around the world.  You're talking about the diplomatic correlate the military, the State  Department, it sounds to me. And I read this now three or four times as  though it's somebody who works daily with the president and interacts with  them daily, which means somebody in the West Wing.</p><p> But I don't want to begin speculation because the speculation I could tell  you from my iPhone is rampant with proper names in there and I'm not going  to go because it's just speculation. </p><p> But it does sound as though this is a human being that knows the president  well and interacts with him on a daily basis.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You said it's the one two punch because we have a Bob Woodward  book coming out.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, the Bob Woodward book is been excerpted in the  Washington Post. He is an editor and a reporter for the Washington Post  with two Pulitzer Prizes who notoriously tape records every conversation he  has every interview that he has.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Currently there are recording for that.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Correct. So the one-two punch is the Washington Post and the  New York Times same time same subject, same week. This is more ganging up  on a president than they did on Richard Nixon. And as I said before--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  And have you ever seen an anonymous op-ed. </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  No, I've never seen or heard of an anonymous op-ed which means  the New York Times wants to keep this person employed there. So this person  can be a source for them as this person obviously was in tomorrow's paper.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That's an interesting take on it. Yes. So, here's the thing. We  may have New York Times reporter trying to crack and find out who this  person is.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  What if the New York Times would let its own reporters figure  out who this person is.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. All right. Gang, in the control room where fast and thick  news breaking in this hour. Do we want to get the judge's reaction on Judge  Kavanaugh.</p><p> So, let's -- I want your reaction to the sound bite, judge. Let's watch  what happened at that Judge Kavanaugh's hearing today. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Justice Jackson--</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ask them to suspend.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Your reaction to the protest and disruption.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  The protest and distraction are a sideshow. The senators  didn't lay a glove on him today. They attempted to but they didn't. Now  much of the questioning was boring. Some of that was highly academic and  really into the weeds except for people that monitor the stuff.</p><p> But politically speaking, the consensus is he's worthy of confirmation and  will more likely than not receive it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Judge Napolitano, thank you so much.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Really rolling with the breaking news with us. OK. We've got  this story for you coming up. Despite fans threat to boycott, Nike is  doubling down on Colin Kaepernick. The new ad will air tomorrow night at  the launch of the NFL season. It isn't just do it ad campaign. It is coming  tomorrow night. We're going to have that debate coming up after the break.  Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> COLIN KAEPERNICK, FORMER NFL PLAYER:  MACDONALD:  Believe in something even  if it means sacrificing everything. </p><p> When they talk about the greatest team in the history of the sport, make  sure it's your team. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. That's just part of Nike's new just do it ad  campaign, featuring Colin Kaepernick. It is set to debut during the NFL  season open tomorrow night. It's featuring athletes who have overcome  adversity.</p><p> Now social justice warrior Kaepernick he launched the anthem protest by  first taking a knee. Nike's stock took a knee too, a loss nearly $4 billion  in market value after this ad news broke under threats of boycotts from  customers. </p><p> The tag line sacrificing everything now also being criticized. Here are the  facts. Kaepernick earned $43 million from the NFL, millions more coming his  way from this new advertising campaign. </p><p> Now Colin Kaepernick has not played in two years, he is suing the NFL for  alleged collusion, claiming no team will hire him. The NFL offering a  measured response ahead of tomorrow's kick-off. Saying quote, \"The social  justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised have  deserve our attention and action.\" </p><p> Now a new report says Nike stock may drop further, maybe 10 percent due to  these ads.</p><p> Let's take it up with Investmark Advisory Group principal, Michael Lee, and  conservative commentator, Lawrence Jones. Mike, Nike specifically decided  to hire Kaepernick not for his athleticism but for his political views.  What does that mean for Nike's bottom line that it is now face of NFL  national anthem protest? </p><p> MICHAEL LEE, PRINCIPAL, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP:  So, Nike just decided  to get political, not only get political, they decided to shove a certain  brand of politics down everyone's throat. </p><p> I do not think this is a good decision for any corporation regardless of  the politics. Colin Kaepernick has every right to be a social justice  warrior, to kneel during the anthem. </p><p> But let's face it. His politics are that he hates America, and he hates law  enforcement. That not popular. That is not going to go over well with large  swaths of the population. And I think Nike has permanently damaged its  brand. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So, you know, here's the thing, Lawrence Jones, there is a  question of do millennials like this, is the Nike playing to millennials,  that millennial like to protest according to polls. I mean, one marketing  group says Nike got tens of millions of dollars worth of free media  exposure.</p><p> But here's the other side of that, Lawrence. Critics say Nike is charging  $100 plus for fancy sneakers made by poor workers in Asia earning a lot low  pay, it then uses the profit to pay millions to athletes like LeBron James  or Kaepernick. Your take in all of this. </p><p> LAWRENCE JONES, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes, Liz. This is complicated  because I have conflicting views, on one hand you want a private business  to be able to do whatever they want and then suffer the consequences that  may come. But I think when it comes with Nike, I don't even think it about  politics for them, I don't even think they care about social justice, I  think that they just made a business decision, and they felt like getting  behind this Colin Kaepernick movement would somehow benefit them.  Remember  when Colin Kaepernick left the league and he was a superstar at that point,  he was the number one failing jersey at the time because he decided to take  a knee.  </p><p> The men was on the bench was still the number one jersey and so I think  they plan on capitalizing on this, some way, I don't know how it will turn  up even the President of United States, who has been very vocal on this  issue pivoted on this issue, because as he said, Nike pays a lot of rent.   And so he has been more critical in past, but because there a business  investment there, he kind of backed off some of his criticism.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, you know, to Lawrence's point, Michael, Nike, it looks  like making a bet, that its biggest gross market is China, it is Asia, they  don't care about the U.S. protest over there, I mean, 40 percent of Nike's  sale comes from the very (inaudible) of North America and Nike's biggest  athletes in its ads are basketball players like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant  and LeBron James, not football games.  </p><p> JONES:  LeBron James.  </p><p> LEE:  yes, I would say that very conspicuous timing here, this is coming  out the day that tariffs go into effect in China.  A lot of their products  is made over there.  That is the biggest opportunity for growth so a little  bit of anti-American sentiment might go a long way to sell some more  sneakers over there.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Mike and Lawrence, you had been great tonight.  Thank you so  much for coming in.  </p><p> JONES:  Thank you, Liz.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.  We are staying on this story about the anti-Trump  resistance movement in the White House that is allegedly anonymous.   Current senior Trump official in the White House writing a New York Times  Op-ed, saying he is working against President Trump.  This is a story that  is now being questioned, because who exactly is the author.  And why did  the Times run an anonymous opinion piece?  We are staying on this for you.  </p><p> But first, an exclusive one-on-one interview with Uber's new CEO is next,  coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, we have an exciting exclusive interview coming up.  Our  own Susan Li sat down with Uber's new boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, who is now  in the fight of his life.  He has to clean up Uber's toxic image, just one  of the scandals we give any executive a cold sweat.  Hundreds of thousands  of customers deleting Uber's app and protest over its pricing.  Uber's  Freight House executive culture leaning to charges, and settlements for  alleged sexual harassment and discrimination and cities like New York and  London blocking Uber drivers, Uber testing of a self-driving car also  killed a pedestrian, Susan Lee is all over the story.  You know, Uber,  still had the biggest fight of his life.  Are they kind of prove to Wall  Street that can be profitable?  This is a story filled with scandal.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESSES:  There is a lot of different angles to it and  Dara has been in job for one year.  Just one year, 12 months and he had a  lot to fix.  Today in midtown Manhattan it was all about safety that is the  focus, that is what they are here to do, there are some new safety features  that includes tracking your ride.  If it takes a little bit longer to get  there, if you make an executive stops, Uber will now check in, that is what  they call the new ride check in feature.  Also they are going to make it  your locations, your drop off, your phone numbers anonymous, so that means  drivers cannot tell where you are going, they can't reach you in the  future.  But yes, we talked about IPO, we talked about liberal bias.  And  let's listen in to -- first of all his thoughts on this new safety  features.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO)  </p><p> DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, CEO, UBER:  When you have 15 million trips on a daily  basis on a global platform, such as ours.  The vast majority of time is  everything is OK. But once in a while something happens, and we as a  company leadership got together last year and we declared that safety is  going to be top priority for us as a company in 2018.  </p><p> LI:  Why.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Frankly beyond -- because safety is universal, because  anyone who is at home or they are home or going to a ball game or going to  work, you want to feel safe.  And we believe that we can use the power of  technology and the innovation that we have brought to bear to  revolutionized transportation to make Uber the safest transportation  platform on earth.  And what you are seeing is very early in the game.   But, features such as 911 button that location aware so that 911 dispatch  can react to anything that might happen incredibly quickly with a huge  determine and success or failure.  Trust the contact, tracking where you  are going, and improve background checks and continuous background checks  as well, both available for riders and drivers.  </p><p> And now some of the new future, that were introducing privacy, for example,  you may not want a driver partner to know the exact address where you are  dropped off, because that is something private, location information is  incredibly important, we have masked that, and we masked your phone number  if you ever speak to your driver partner and then we have introduced some  really cool wiz ban technology, where we know where you started, we know  where you ended, we know how long your trip should take, and if for some  reason your trip is taking longer than it should, we will send you a  notification to make sure that you are OK, and in some cases, we can  actually detect an accident, if it ever happens to again make sure the  rider and driver partner are OK too.  </p><p> LI:  You are mining a lot of data off of driver and the passenger's  smartphone, in terms of speed, where they are going, how do you assure that  user data is safe?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I think it is a great question.  We made very significant  investments in data privacy, we do know a lot of data about payment  information and location information, but the religion, at Uber is that we  are going to use that information for you the rider or the driver.  So, for  example, in the morning now my (inaudible) that in mornings I go to work,  so it is one click.  It is one click, we have an idea where you are going,  but ultimately we're not selling data, we don't have any advertising, et  cetera.  So ultimately the use of data is to make life easier for you, to  make it faster, to make it more affordable, and now, to make riding on an  Uber safe as possible we can.  </p><p> LI:  So, you are celebrating your one near anniversary as CEO.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Yes I am.  I made it.  </p><p> LI:  You made it.  That is very true, now people want to know, are you  still sticking with your timeline of an IPO in perhaps 2019, because you  are new CFO who will start in a few days.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I would be starting next week, yes.  </p><p> LI:  Nelson, he says he is not on board yet though for 2019 Mustang.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I would expect nothing less of Nelson, he is independent  minded, he is rigorous, and so far he is on the outside, so I think, I  absolutely want Nelson to come in and I think that when he sees all of the  work that the teams are doing, I think that he will agree that we're ready  for a 2019 IPO, there is a bunch of systems first that is going on,  financial work that is going on, the company is big enough, the company is  incredibly important to the world.  And we have some incredibly talented  technologists out there, so, I think we are going to be ready, but I  absolutely want that stamp of approval from our CFO.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, there is always a but.  (Inaudible) The thinking on street, if  they IPO before you, they would take up all the IPO capital in the market,  are you concerned?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I'm not concern.  This is Lyft and ourselves are part of a  transportation revolution this is about ultimately ending car ownership,  the transportation market is 6 trillion dollar business, you may think that  Uber's big.  We're 50 billion, we account for less than 1 percent of miles  driven, and really what ourselves and Lyft are trying to do is to break  apart all the use cases of owning a car.  You owned a car, you get to work,  and you owned a car to pick up the kids at school.  You owned a car to get  groceries, etcetera and we're building out services to solve each of those  use cases and ultimately make it unnecessary for you to own a car.  And we  think that there are plenty of companies who can be a part of that  evolution.  I think investors are going to line up behind us and Lyft.  I  certainly hope they are.  </p><p> LI:  Are you guarantee a 2019 IPO?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Well, there is no guarantee, you don't know what the market  is doing.  I can guarantee that we'll be ready, hopefully markets will be  ready for us.  </p><p> LI:  So, you talk about how big Uber is and the ride hailing services.   Some say you owned 73 percent of the market, given that the U.S. President  has talked about anti-trust situation with big tech company, Google, Amazon  and Facebook.  Do you think that big tech company like Uber may be  regulated in the future?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Listen, we're regulated now.  We work in every single city  and et cetera.  We look at market as 6 trillion dollar transportation  market, we're a tiny, tiny, tiny part of the market, and we account for  less than 1 percent of miles driven on the road.  So, I think Uber can be  ultimately 20, sounds bigger than it is today.  </p><p> LI:  So, no fear of being broken up at all?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  No fear of being broken up and listen, I think that  ultimately, regulators are our partners, you know, we work with -- we  operate on the streets of New York City and while we may not agree on  everything, ultimately we think that we as a transportation service are  incredibly valuable for every city around.  And that ultimately we have a  be partners in building this solution together.  It takes dialogue,  sometimes you agree, sometimes you don't agree, but we think that  opportunity is enormous, and we think there is a need for rider and drivers  around all around the world for or service.  </p><p> LI:  Well, talking with our audience, you know, there has been a lot of  concern of political bias in Silicon Valley.  There are giants, respectable  (inaudible) at Silicon Valley, so I have to ask you this question,  President Trump thinks that there is a liberal bias in Silicon Valley with  big tech companies, employees of big tech companies, and so that they feel  that their conservatives voices have been silenced.  You think that is  true?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I guarantee that your wait times for your Uber are going to  be equal whether you're Republican or not or Democrat.  I don't think -- I  think that biases, if there's a bias, I don't think that is a bias on  purpose.  We as a company's leadership team have been trained on biases as  well.  There are some implicit policies that you may not be aware of as a  person and I think awareness is step one.  So I don't think that there's  any bias on purpose, but if you have a bunch of like-minded people building  product, you may get product that straight one or the other.  That's one  for sample from our standpoint, we want to have more women.  We want to  have more underrepresented people working as engineers and product people  and have representation at all parts of our company so that the products  that were building reflect our driver partners in our rider partners and  aren't with any biases that were not aware of.  So, listen, we are human,  all of this is vulnerable.  I think that all of these companies are trying  to do the right thing, but they got some learning to do.  And I think the  way that they operate going forward have to change.  </p><p> LI:  Dara, thank you so much.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I appreciate it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO)  </p><p> MACDONALD:  that was a great interview.  Are they going to go public?  Uber  is going public?  </p><p> LI:  I would be surprised if they did not.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Next year.  </p><p> LI:  Next year 2019.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Wow.  Great interview, Susan.  Thanks for bringing it to us.  </p><p> LI:  Thank you.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.  We're staying on this anti-Trump resistant movement in the  White House, it has been somewhere in the executive branch, we don't know  if it is in the White House, is some of the executive branch.  Stay with us  here for time of the anonymous op-ed story for you.  Kayleigh Mcenany is  coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York Times\"  has an anonymous editorial, can you believe it?  Anonymous.  Meaning  gutless.  Gutless editorial.  We're doing a great job, the poll numbers  through the roof, our poll numbers are great, and guess what nobody is  going to come close to beating me in 2020, because of what we've done.  We  have done more than anybody ever thought possible in -- it is not even two  years, so thank you very much, appreciate it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MACDONALD:  That was President Trump, just moments ago refuting \"New York  Times\" anonymous op-ed from someone allegedly in the administration said  that person and others are working against the President.  The op-ed writer  say and we had identify him as a he.  Actually New York Times did in a  tweet saying he is a he, quote, I am part of the resistance under the Trump  administration and said they work for President, and they unlike my  colleagues and have vowed to thwart parts of President Trump's agenda and  his worse quote, his worse inclination.  Let us get RNC spokesperson,  Kayleigh Mcenany joins me now, over the phone, Kayleigh what do you hear  from your people on who they think wrote it?  </p><p> KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON:  Hi, Liz.   Great to join you, I don't think there is any indication at-this-point as  who wrote it -- who wrote the op-ed, but I can give you a description of  them, he is a coward.  He is an absolute coward to leak in this fashion, to  write anonymously in this fashion, to come out and say that he wants this  agenda and this administration to succeed and write an op-ed.  In direct  contradiction of anything that would behoove this administration.  This  person called himself an unsung hero, I don't know who he is, but he is a  coward, he is very far from an unsung hero.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know Kayleigh, the debate now is up though New York Times  and the Washington Post or another news outlet would run it but here -- I  want you reaction to this.  Some are very unimpressed by this.  Walter  Schaub, he is a former director of the office of Government ethics.  He  said this op-ed is ridiculous on so many levels.  We now present an opinion  piece with no substantive content by an anonymous contributor who no  employer should ever trust again.  Your reaction.  </p><p> MCENANY:  Yes, he is absolutely spot on here.  What a great mistake by the  New York Time, the media and newspaper are already out of his story low and  trustworthiness among the American people.  In fact they hit their lowest  approval rating in the history of Gallup asking the question.  But for the  New York Times to run with a fake news story from a fake news source, we  don't even know if this individual really exists, this is a big hit to  their credibility, President talks about making up sources, well this  certainly looks a lot like that.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Walter Shaub of the government ethics former official  satirize this op-ed saying, dear America, in other words, this is the tone  of the anonymous op-ed, quote dear America, this administration is  wonderful but I'm trying to so sabotage from the inside also be super  afraid and no you owe me.  Your take.  </p><p> MCENANY:  Yes.  That is right, this is a quiet resistant on how it is  described, from inside the administration, their goal to frustrate part of  the agenda is what he said frustrate parts of the agenda.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  We have to leave it there, Kayleigh, sorry, we had a hard  break.  Kayleigh Mcenany weighing in.  We will have Kayleigh on soon on  another show.  More on this story and your money after the break, stay  there </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, how is your money doing today.  Let us take a  check on your money, the markets finishing and here is our finish the DOW  up to 22 points.  Let us get right Nicole Petallides on the floor of the  big board with latest, Nicole.  </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Stocks finished mixed, the DOW is  higher, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ hold back, you saw the worries about trade and  tariffs and emerging market.  And we have job reports on Friday, the NASDAQ  though was a big loser, in fact it got crash on 1.1 percent.  While the  others were not too far off from the unchanged line.  As you look at the  NSADQ, you can break down social media stocks today, as we heard testimony  from Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sandburg from Facebook, and with that this  group got hit hard, we saw Facebook down 2 percent, Twitter down 6 percent.   Snapchat, yelp all lower, some of the others lagers on the NASDAQ, would  also be jd.com micron and PayPal.  Back to you.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Great to see you Nicole.  We'll be right back with a jam-pack  hour.  We will be right back after the break.  Stay there.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, President Trump just tweeting quote, the failing \"New  York Times\" in response to that anonymous New York Times op-ed.  The  president will be traveling to Montana tomorrow where he plans to host a  Make America Great Again rally in the evening.  He is expected to hold an  official event following that rally.  We will stay on that story for you.   Thank you so much for having us in your home.  It's been a jack-packed  hour.  Thank you so much for watching.  Charles Payne is here now with  Making Money.

The Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p>First to your money, the Dow closing slightly higher, ending the day at  25,974. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P falling. Netflix lead a steep tech sell-off.  More on your money in just a second. </p><p>But first to that \"New York Times\" anonymous op-ed, it appears to be  written by a male senior official, that's according to the Times Twitter  account. </p><p>With me now live from White House is Blake Burman with the latest. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Liz. Don't know exactly  who this person is, the New York Times op-ed page in which this article is  published, identifies as person as a senior administration official. The  title here is, quote, \"I am part of the resistance inside the Trump  administration.\" </p><p>When you boil down this op-ed this person says that themselves along with  others are working inside the Trump administration to essentially keep it  on track as they see it. This is what the senior administration official  writes anonymously in this op-ed at one point. </p><p>Quote, speaking of the president, \"The dilemma - which he does not fully  grasp, is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are  working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his  worst inclination.\" </p><p>This anonymous senior administration official also goes on to write in that  op-ed the following. Quote, \"Given the instability, many witnessed there  were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25 amendment which  would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted  to precipitate a constitutional crisis, so we will do what we can to steer  the administration in the right direction until one way or the other it is  over.\" </p><p>We need to point out, Liz, that this person is identified as a senior  administration official, so we don't know if that person works within this  very White House or if they are an official within the Trump administration  somewhere here in Washington D.C.</p><p>The president is here about to speak inside the White House right now, Liz.  Let's listen in.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MASSACHUSETTS:  Great job, keep up  the good work. Thanks, everybody. </p><p>Mr. President, we remember when you first were giving your acceptance  speech of the nomination at the GOO convention, you said at that time that  one year from now when I take over the White House I am going to  reestablish the rule of law in this country, and you have done that, Mr.  President. We thank you for that.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thank you.</p><p>HODGSON:  Very, very much. </p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you. </p><p>HODGSON:  You know, behind me, Mr. President, are 44 sheriffs, who are  representing 35 states that came here to Washington for two reasons. The  first is to go to Congress to the Capitol today hold a press conference and  let Congress know enough is enough. </p><p>We've been for 20 years, asking Congress to move on the security aspects of  immigration reform, and nothing has happened for 20 years. </p><p>But what's really amazing, Mr. President, with your strength and purpose  the commitment to your convictions you've done more in less than two years  in supporting law enforcement and dealing with this illegal immigration  problem that we've been asking for solutions on in less than two years. </p><p>And again, all these sheriffs and sheriffs across the nation are grateful  to you for that, Mr. President. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>HODGSON:  And like so many of the promises that you made, you have come  through and the energy that you put behind law enforcement in supporting us  on our partnership with 287G, going after MS-13 and getting them out of our  neighborhoods, t building the wall, Mr. President, you've really did  amazing.</p><p>And so, before I president this plaque I just want to add one thing that  maybe you heard about, maybe you didn't. But when we were on the Hill  today, we announced that the National Sheriff Association has done a crowd  funding page to raise money and mobilize the citizens of this nation to get  behind you, to get behind the sheriffs to build this wall. </p><p>So, in having said that, I would like to present this to you, Mr.  President, because, it's not surprising for any of the sheriffs who are  here, that shortly after you took office, people started saying the  citizens and members of the media saying, there is a new sheriff in town. </p><p>And that's an endearing statement, and all these sheriffs know it. Because  what it denotes is that there are problems and somebody is coming in that's  going to be able to fix those problems. You've done that, Mr. President, we  can't thank you enough for your support, you said you have our back. And  the sheriffs across this nation, have yours. And God bless you. Thank you,  Mr. President.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, that's really nice. This is an honor because when I was  running I think number one on our list of law enforcement, taking care of  law enforcement, working with law enforcement. </p><p>And really we have to create guidelines and principles for the incredible  job you've done, and you've done an amazing job. </p><p>And I will tell you, a lot of times you are scorned and you are looked at  by the media, because the media is very dishonest, much of it in this  country, very, very dishonest. And the job that you've done in light of all  the things that you have to go through, I guess a little bit like me also,  but I will say that you have been really outstanding, incredible people. </p><p>Crime statistics are down. We're really doing well other than you take a  couple of places on a nation where they have different policies than we  would put, and you know where I'm talking about. </p><p>But there are a couple of places they don't believe in what we believe, but  we have together done something very special. </p><p>I also remember so well, sheriff, when we were together, I said we're going  to get a lot of military equipment that you weren't able to get and it was  sitting in warehouses all over the country. </p><p>And in many cases like in other countries, you remember, and we brought it  back home, and you were able to get great military equipment that you  couldn't afford to buy in your budgets and we gave it to you and it  protected a lot of people. </p><p>We have a lot of people living today in your profession that would not  frankly be around right now without the protection of that kind of  equipment that we have sitting around, waiting and doing nothing, and just  drawing dust. </p><p>So, the fact that you gave me this award is very meaningful. I will put  that in a place of great honor in the Oval Office. But I really appreciate  it. Thank you very much, it's a great honor. Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you, all. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you very much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. President, keep up the good work.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We stand behind you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BURMAN:  Liz, you are hearing the President of United States at an event  with sheriff officers here inside the White House. One of the big question  is whether or not the president will answer any questions from the press  pool inside that event. Of course the biggest question will be about this  New York Times op-ed. </p><p>I'll send it back to you in case you want to (Inaudible) the president.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Blake, and we are going to need you to monitor the press pool,  we want to know what are the questions, and what the president says about  this anonymous bombshell op-ed by a senior White House official. </p><p>Apparently, a man, who is alleging a bunch of things about the president,  including that there were early whispers that amongst cabinet members to  evoke the 25 amendment to remove President Trump.</p><p>Thank you, Blake. You're going to stay on that story for us throughout the  hour. </p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You read the op-ed. What's your reaction?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Well there obviously  are substantial forces very close to the president that candidly do not  believe he's fit for office. This is calling a bombshell, which is the  phrase that you used is actually being charitable. </p><p>I mean, this devastating to the president, the president should have around  him people who believe in him and trust him. This is obvious somebody who  he thinks believes in him and trust him who has revealed a consensus  amongst those around him that question his fitness for office. And it was  also revealed that there were serious discussions about the 25th amendment. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, so in the piece, whoever the writer is said we want  the administration to succeed. They bring up that the president is in their  mind, anti-trade an anti-democratic. They say the root of the problem is  the president's immorality he's not more to discern with first principle,  and that he acted in a manner detrimental to the health of the Republican.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That is a serious an allegation as could be. That is a code  phrase for worthy of impeachment. If he is acting in the opinion of this  writer whoever it is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Acting in a manner injurious to the health of the republic. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And as Melissa Francis has said pointed out earlier in the  hour, opinions usually, you own the opinion with your name on it. Let's  listen to the president.</p><p>TRUMP:  -- working today that at any point ever in our history. We've  created 400,000 manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs are growing at the  fastest pace in more than 30 years, economic growth last quarter was 4.2  percent. </p><p>And as you people know it was headed down, big, and it was a low number,  very low number. It would have been, in my opinion, it would have been less  than zero, it was heading to negative numbers. </p><p>New employment claims recently hit a -- think of that. The unemployment  picture in the country is the best it has been in 49 years, African- American unemployment is lowest in the history of the country. </p><p>Asian-American unemployment lowest in the history of our country, Hispanic- American unemployment lowest in the history of our country. </p><p>I mean, I'm just looking at this point after point. Under my  administration, veteran's unemployment reached its lowest in many years.  The -- let's see, almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food  stamps just since my election. </p><p>Then you go into all of the benefits that we got from the tax cuts, all of  you people benefitted tremendously from the tax cuts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to regulation cuts, we're going to right to try, right  to try is where you have right is if a person is terminally  ill you have a  right to go and try and see whether or not a drug that's not approved yet  can be used. They didn't allow that. </p><p>A point after point we're getting rid of the individual mandate, the most  unpopular thing there is in Obamacare. Coming up with new healthcare plans. </p><p>We've never had a period, even if you look at the Olympics, we got the  Olympics, the World Cup, you say them, they were in my office, got the  World Cup, nobody has -- and we have started the wall. Nobody has ever done  in less than a two-year period what we've done.</p><p>So when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration,  probably it was failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons, no.  And the New York Times is failing. If I weren't here I believe the New York  Times probably wouldn't even exist.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP:  And some day -- and some day when I'm not president, which  hopefully will be in about six and a half years from now. The New York  Times and CNN, and all of these phony media outlets will be out of  business, folks. They'll be out of business because they'll be nothing to  write, and they'll be nothing of interest. </p><p>So nobody has been what this administration has done. And I agree, it's  different from an agenda which is much different than ours, and it's  certainly not your agenda, that I can tell you. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP:  It's about open borders, it's about letting people flee into our  country, it's about a disaster and crime for our country. </p><p>So, they don't like Donald Trump, and I don't like them, because they are  very dishonest people. Remember this also, about the New York Times, when I  won they were forced to apologize to their subscribers. They wrote a letter  of apology it was the first time anybody has ever done it because they  covered the election incorrectly.</p><p>So if the failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial -- can you  believe it, anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial -- we are doing  a great job. The poll numbers are through the roof. Our poll numbers are  great. </p><p>And guess what, nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because  of what we've done. We've done more than anybody ever thought possible in - - it's not even two years. So thank you very much. We appreciate it. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. That was President Trump taking on directly this anonymous  op-ed in the New York Times that is quoting a senior White House official - - let me back up, it was written by a senior White House official. We at  Fox Business believe it a man, according on the New York Times own Twitter  account he is identified as a he, the author of this anonymous piece.</p><p>Let's bring the judge back here. You saw the president really going hard at  New York Times with his comments that, basically the Times is failing  according to his mindset and that it wouldn't exist without him and when he  is going to -- he says he is going to be here for six an half more years.  And CNN and New York Times may not exist then.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I thought that his impromptu response now was actually a  pretty good one. If he started to go through line by line the anonymous op- ed a, he is going to give it more credibility than he wants to give it, and  b, he is going to find himself going down rabbit holes of attempting to  retort anonymous allegations which are incendiary, in which he doesn't want  to give the credence to. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, the other thing the president brought up which is  interesting is about the New York Times letter of apology that New York  Times wrote to its readers about -- I guess people are trying to contact  you about this op-ed that basically--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  This is not from the author of the op-ed. I don't think it is. </p><p>MACDONALD:  That is, it looks like I'm looking at the New York Times  apology letter to readers after the election. Basically, the New York Times  is taking accountability for the coverage, because they too were surprised  that Trump won. What do you make of President Trump bringing up the Times  apology letter to readers there? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, it's the Trump strategy, go on the offensive, he is not  going to dignify this op-ed piece or New York Times by going through it  line by line, he is going to attack the messenger here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Judge--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The 25th amendment is something that in my view can only be  invoked if a vice president personally authorizes it, not going to happen. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Wow. We've got an hour of thick and fast breaking  news. Judge, thank you so much for your insights here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The anti-Trump resistance movement in the White House. We're  staying on story of this anonymous current senior Trump official in the  White House writing that New York Times op-ed. We're going to have more on  that story after the break, stay there. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Moments ago, addressing that anonymous New York Times op-ed by  a senior official within the administration while talking with the nation's  sheriffs at White House. </p><p>Let's talk more with the judge more about what happened with that op-ed. It  says a senior official, that's a pretty elastic term. It could be anybody  in the executive branch. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right. As our colleague Blake Burman just pointed out, it  could be anybody in the executive branch which means all around the world.  You're talking about the diplomatic correlate the military, the State  Department, it sounds to me. And I read this now three or four times as  though it's somebody who works daily with the president and interacts with  them daily, which means somebody in the West Wing.</p><p>But I don't want to begin speculation because the speculation I could tell  you from my iPhone is rampant with proper names in there and I'm not going  to go because it's just speculation. </p><p>But it does sound as though this is a human being that knows the president  well and interacts with him on a daily basis.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You said it's the one two punch because we have a Bob Woodward  book coming out.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the Bob Woodward book is been excerpted in the  Washington Post. He is an editor and a reporter for the Washington Post  with two Pulitzer Prizes who notoriously tape records every conversation he  has every interview that he has.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Currently there are recording for that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct. So the one-two punch is the Washington Post and the  New York Times same time same subject, same week. This is more ganging up  on a president than they did on Richard Nixon. And as I said before--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  And have you ever seen an anonymous op-ed. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No, I've never seen or heard of an anonymous op-ed which means  the New York Times wants to keep this person employed there. So this person  can be a source for them as this person obviously was in tomorrow's paper.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That's an interesting take on it. Yes. So, here's the thing. We  may have New York Times reporter trying to crack and find out who this  person is.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  What if the New York Times would let its own reporters figure  out who this person is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. All right. Gang, in the control room where fast and thick  news breaking in this hour. Do we want to get the judge's reaction on Judge  Kavanaugh.</p><p>So, let's -- I want your reaction to the sound bite, judge. Let's watch  what happened at that Judge Kavanaugh's hearing today. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Justice Jackson--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ask them to suspend.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Your reaction to the protest and disruption.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The protest and distraction are a sideshow. The senators  didn't lay a glove on him today. They attempted to but they didn't. Now  much of the questioning was boring. Some of that was highly academic and  really into the weeds except for people that monitor the stuff.</p><p>But politically speaking, the consensus is he's worthy of confirmation and  will more likely than not receive it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Judge Napolitano, thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Really rolling with the breaking news with us. OK. We've got  this story for you coming up. Despite fans threat to boycott, Nike is  doubling down on Colin Kaepernick. The new ad will air tomorrow night at  the launch of the NFL season. It isn't just do it ad campaign. It is coming  tomorrow night. We're going to have that debate coming up after the break.  Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COLIN KAEPERNICK, FORMER NFL PLAYER:  MACDONALD:  Believe in something even  if it means sacrificing everything. </p><p>When they talk about the greatest team in the history of the sport, make  sure it's your team. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. That's just part of Nike's new just do it ad  campaign, featuring Colin Kaepernick. It is set to debut during the NFL  season open tomorrow night. It's featuring athletes who have overcome  adversity.</p><p>Now social justice warrior Kaepernick he launched the anthem protest by  first taking a knee. Nike's stock took a knee too, a loss nearly $4 billion  in market value after this ad news broke under threats of boycotts from  customers. </p><p>The tag line sacrificing everything now also being criticized. Here are the  facts. Kaepernick earned $43 million from the NFL, millions more coming his  way from this new advertising campaign. </p><p>Now Colin Kaepernick has not played in two years, he is suing the NFL for  alleged collusion, claiming no team will hire him. The NFL offering a  measured response ahead of tomorrow's kick-off. Saying quote, \"The social  justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised have  deserve our attention and action.\" </p><p>Now a new report says Nike stock may drop further, maybe 10 percent due to  these ads.</p><p>Let's take it up with Investmark Advisory Group principal, Michael Lee, and  conservative commentator, Lawrence Jones. Mike, Nike specifically decided  to hire Kaepernick not for his athleticism but for his political views.  What does that mean for Nike's bottom line that it is now face of NFL  national anthem protest? </p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PRINCIPAL, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP:  So, Nike just decided  to get political, not only get political, they decided to shove a certain  brand of politics down everyone's throat. </p><p>I do not think this is a good decision for any corporation regardless of  the politics. Colin Kaepernick has every right to be a social justice  warrior, to kneel during the anthem. </p><p>But let's face it. His politics are that he hates America, and he hates law  enforcement. That not popular. That is not going to go over well with large  swaths of the population. And I think Nike has permanently damaged its  brand. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, you know, here's the thing, Lawrence Jones, there is a  question of do millennials like this, is the Nike playing to millennials,  that millennial like to protest according to polls. I mean, one marketing  group says Nike got tens of millions of dollars worth of free media  exposure.</p><p>But here's the other side of that, Lawrence. Critics say Nike is charging  $100 plus for fancy sneakers made by poor workers in Asia earning a lot low  pay, it then uses the profit to pay millions to athletes like LeBron James  or Kaepernick. Your take in all of this. </p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes, Liz. This is complicated  because I have conflicting views, on one hand you want a private business  to be able to do whatever they want and then suffer the consequences that  may come. But I think when it comes with Nike, I don't even think it about  politics for them, I don't even think they care about social justice, I  think that they just made a business decision, and they felt like getting  behind this Colin Kaepernick movement would somehow benefit them.  Remember  when Colin Kaepernick left the league and he was a superstar at that point,  he was the number one failing jersey at the time because he decided to take  a knee.  </p><p>The men was on the bench was still the number one jersey and so I think  they plan on capitalizing on this, some way, I don't know how it will turn  up even the President of United States, who has been very vocal on this  issue pivoted on this issue, because as he said, Nike pays a lot of rent.   And so he has been more critical in past, but because there a business  investment there, he kind of backed off some of his criticism.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, you know, to Lawrence's point, Michael, Nike, it looks  like making a bet, that its biggest gross market is China, it is Asia, they  don't care about the U.S. protest over there, I mean, 40 percent of Nike's  sale comes from the very (inaudible) of North America and Nike's biggest  athletes in its ads are basketball players like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant  and LeBron James, not football games.  </p><p>JONES:  LeBron James.  </p><p>LEE:  yes, I would say that very conspicuous timing here, this is coming  out the day that tariffs go into effect in China.  A lot of their products  is made over there.  That is the biggest opportunity for growth so a little  bit of anti-American sentiment might go a long way to sell some more  sneakers over there.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mike and Lawrence, you had been great tonight.  Thank you so  much for coming in.  </p><p>JONES:  Thank you, Liz.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.  We are staying on this story about the anti-Trump  resistance movement in the White House that is allegedly anonymous.   Current senior Trump official in the White House writing a New York Times  Op-ed, saying he is working against President Trump.  This is a story that  is now being questioned, because who exactly is the author.  And why did  the Times run an anonymous opinion piece?  We are staying on this for you.  </p><p>But first, an exclusive one-on-one interview with Uber's new CEO is next,  coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, we have an exciting exclusive interview coming up.  Our  own Susan Li sat down with Uber's new boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, who is now  in the fight of his life.  He has to clean up Uber's toxic image, just one  of the scandals we give any executive a cold sweat.  Hundreds of thousands  of customers deleting Uber's app and protest over its pricing.  Uber's  Freight House executive culture leaning to charges, and settlements for  alleged sexual harassment and discrimination and cities like New York and  London blocking Uber drivers, Uber testing of a self-driving car also  killed a pedestrian, Susan Lee is all over the story.  You know, Uber,  still had the biggest fight of his life.  Are they kind of prove to Wall  Street that can be profitable?  This is a story filled with scandal.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESSES:  There is a lot of different angles to it and  Dara has been in job for one year.  Just one year, 12 months and he had a  lot to fix.  Today in midtown Manhattan it was all about safety that is the  focus, that is what they are here to do, there are some new safety features  that includes tracking your ride.  If it takes a little bit longer to get  there, if you make an executive stops, Uber will now check in, that is what  they call the new ride check in feature.  Also they are going to make it  your locations, your drop off, your phone numbers anonymous, so that means  drivers cannot tell where you are going, they can't reach you in the  future.  But yes, we talked about IPO, we talked about liberal bias.  And  let's listen in to -- first of all his thoughts on this new safety  features.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)  </p><p>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, CEO, UBER:  When you have 15 million trips on a daily  basis on a global platform, such as ours.  The vast majority of time is  everything is OK. But once in a while something happens, and we as a  company leadership got together last year and we declared that safety is  going to be top priority for us as a company in 2018.  </p><p>LI:  Why.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Frankly beyond -- because safety is universal, because  anyone who is at home or they are home or going to a ball game or going to  work, you want to feel safe.  And we believe that we can use the power of  technology and the innovation that we have brought to bear to  revolutionized transportation to make Uber the safest transportation  platform on earth.  And what you are seeing is very early in the game.   But, features such as 911 button that location aware so that 911 dispatch  can react to anything that might happen incredibly quickly with a huge  determine and success or failure.  Trust the contact, tracking where you  are going, and improve background checks and continuous background checks  as well, both available for riders and drivers.  </p><p>And now some of the new future, that were introducing privacy, for example,  you may not want a driver partner to know the exact address where you are  dropped off, because that is something private, location information is  incredibly important, we have masked that, and we masked your phone number  if you ever speak to your driver partner and then we have introduced some  really cool wiz ban technology, where we know where you started, we know  where you ended, we know how long your trip should take, and if for some  reason your trip is taking longer than it should, we will send you a  notification to make sure that you are OK, and in some cases, we can  actually detect an accident, if it ever happens to again make sure the  rider and driver partner are OK too.  </p><p>LI:  You are mining a lot of data off of driver and the passenger's  smartphone, in terms of speed, where they are going, how do you assure that  user data is safe?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I think it is a great question.  We made very significant  investments in data privacy, we do know a lot of data about payment  information and location information, but the religion, at Uber is that we  are going to use that information for you the rider or the driver.  So, for  example, in the morning now my (inaudible) that in mornings I go to work,  so it is one click.  It is one click, we have an idea where you are going,  but ultimately we're not selling data, we don't have any advertising, et  cetera.  So ultimately the use of data is to make life easier for you, to  make it faster, to make it more affordable, and now, to make riding on an  Uber safe as possible we can.  </p><p>LI:  So, you are celebrating your one near anniversary as CEO.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Yes I am.  I made it.  </p><p>LI:  You made it.  That is very true, now people want to know, are you  still sticking with your timeline of an IPO in perhaps 2019, because you  are new CFO who will start in a few days.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I would be starting next week, yes.  </p><p>LI:  Nelson, he says he is not on board yet though for 2019 Mustang.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I would expect nothing less of Nelson, he is independent  minded, he is rigorous, and so far he is on the outside, so I think, I  absolutely want Nelson to come in and I think that when he sees all of the  work that the teams are doing, I think that he will agree that we're ready  for a 2019 IPO, there is a bunch of systems first that is going on,  financial work that is going on, the company is big enough, the company is  incredibly important to the world.  And we have some incredibly talented  technologists out there, so, I think we are going to be ready, but I  absolutely want that stamp of approval from our CFO.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, there is always a but.  (Inaudible) The thinking on street, if  they IPO before you, they would take up all the IPO capital in the market,  are you concerned?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I'm not concern.  This is Lyft and ourselves are part of a  transportation revolution this is about ultimately ending car ownership,  the transportation market is 6 trillion dollar business, you may think that  Uber's big.  We're 50 billion, we account for less than 1 percent of miles  driven, and really what ourselves and Lyft are trying to do is to break  apart all the use cases of owning a car.  You owned a car, you get to work,  and you owned a car to pick up the kids at school.  You owned a car to get  groceries, etcetera and we're building out services to solve each of those  use cases and ultimately make it unnecessary for you to own a car.  And we  think that there are plenty of companies who can be a part of that  evolution.  I think investors are going to line up behind us and Lyft.  I  certainly hope they are.  </p><p>LI:  Are you guarantee a 2019 IPO?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Well, there is no guarantee, you don't know what the market  is doing.  I can guarantee that we'll be ready, hopefully markets will be  ready for us.  </p><p>LI:  So, you talk about how big Uber is and the ride hailing services.   Some say you owned 73 percent of the market, given that the U.S. President  has talked about anti-trust situation with big tech company, Google, Amazon  and Facebook.  Do you think that big tech company like Uber may be  regulated in the future?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Listen, we're regulated now.  We work in every single city  and et cetera.  We look at market as 6 trillion dollar transportation  market, we're a tiny, tiny, tiny part of the market, and we account for  less than 1 percent of miles driven on the road.  So, I think Uber can be  ultimately 20, sounds bigger than it is today.  </p><p>LI:  So, no fear of being broken up at all?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  No fear of being broken up and listen, I think that  ultimately, regulators are our partners, you know, we work with -- we  operate on the streets of New York City and while we may not agree on  everything, ultimately we think that we as a transportation service are  incredibly valuable for every city around.  And that ultimately we have a  be partners in building this solution together.  It takes dialogue,  sometimes you agree, sometimes you don't agree, but we think that  opportunity is enormous, and we think there is a need for rider and drivers  around all around the world for or service.  </p><p>LI:  Well, talking with our audience, you know, there has been a lot of  concern of political bias in Silicon Valley.  There are giants, respectable  (inaudible) at Silicon Valley, so I have to ask you this question,  President Trump thinks that there is a liberal bias in Silicon Valley with  big tech companies, employees of big tech companies, and so that they feel  that their conservatives voices have been silenced.  You think that is  true?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I guarantee that your wait times for your Uber are going to  be equal whether you're Republican or not or Democrat.  I don't think -- I  think that biases, if there's a bias, I don't think that is a bias on  purpose.  We as a company's leadership team have been trained on biases as  well.  There are some implicit policies that you may not be aware of as a  person and I think awareness is step one.  So I don't think that there's  any bias on purpose, but if you have a bunch of like-minded people building  product, you may get product that straight one or the other.  That's one  for sample from our standpoint, we want to have more women.  We want to  have more underrepresented people working as engineers and product people  and have representation at all parts of our company so that the products  that were building reflect our driver partners in our rider partners and  aren't with any biases that were not aware of.  So, listen, we are human,  all of this is vulnerable.  I think that all of these companies are trying  to do the right thing, but they got some learning to do.  And I think the  way that they operate going forward have to change.  </p><p>LI:  Dara, thank you so much.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I appreciate it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO)  </p><p>MACDONALD:  that was a great interview.  Are they going to go public?  Uber  is going public?  </p><p>LI:  I would be surprised if they did not.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Next year.  </p><p>LI:  Next year 2019.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow.  Great interview, Susan.  Thanks for bringing it to us.  </p><p>LI:  Thank you.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.  We're staying on this anti-Trump resistant movement in the  White House, it has been somewhere in the executive branch, we don't know  if it is in the White House, is some of the executive branch.  Stay with us  here for time of the anonymous op-ed story for you.  Kayleigh Mcenany is  coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York Times\"  has an anonymous editorial, can you believe it?  Anonymous.  Meaning  gutless.  Gutless editorial.  We're doing a great job, the poll numbers  through the roof, our poll numbers are great, and guess what nobody is  going to come close to beating me in 2020, because of what we've done.  We  have done more than anybody ever thought possible in -- it is not even two  years, so thank you very much, appreciate it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MACDONALD:  That was President Trump, just moments ago refuting \"New York  Times\" anonymous op-ed from someone allegedly in the administration said  that person and others are working against the President.  The op-ed writer  say and we had identify him as a he.  Actually New York Times did in a  tweet saying he is a he, quote, I am part of the resistance under the Trump  administration and said they work for President, and they unlike my  colleagues and have vowed to thwart parts of President Trump's agenda and  his worse quote, his worse inclination.  Let us get RNC spokesperson,  Kayleigh Mcenany joins me now, over the phone, Kayleigh what do you hear  from your people on who they think wrote it?  </p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON:  Hi, Liz.   Great to join you, I don't think there is any indication at-this-point as  who wrote it -- who wrote the op-ed, but I can give you a description of  them, he is a coward.  He is an absolute coward to leak in this fashion, to  write anonymously in this fashion, to come out and say that he wants this  agenda and this administration to succeed and write an op-ed.  In direct  contradiction of anything that would behoove this administration.  This  person called himself an unsung hero, I don't know who he is, but he is a  coward, he is very far from an unsung hero.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know Kayleigh, the debate now is up though New York Times  and the Washington Post or another news outlet would run it but here -- I  want you reaction to this.  Some are very unimpressed by this.  Walter  Schaub, he is a former director of the office of Government ethics.  He  said this op-ed is ridiculous on so many levels.  We now present an opinion  piece with no substantive content by an anonymous contributor who no  employer should ever trust again.  Your reaction.  </p><p>MCENANY:  Yes, he is absolutely spot on here.  What a great mistake by the  New York Time, the media and newspaper are already out of his story low and  trustworthiness among the American people.  In fact they hit their lowest  approval rating in the history of Gallup asking the question.  But for the  New York Times to run with a fake news story from a fake news source, we  don't even know if this individual really exists, this is a big hit to  their credibility, President talks about making up sources, well this  certainly looks a lot like that.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Walter Shaub of the government ethics former official  satirize this op-ed saying, dear America, in other words, this is the tone  of the anonymous op-ed, quote dear America, this administration is  wonderful but I'm trying to so sabotage from the inside also be super  afraid and no you owe me.  Your take.  </p><p>MCENANY:  Yes.  That is right, this is a quiet resistant on how it is  described, from inside the administration, their goal to frustrate part of  the agenda is what he said frustrate parts of the agenda.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  We have to leave it there, Kayleigh, sorry, we had a hard  break.  Kayleigh Mcenany weighing in.  We will have Kayleigh on soon on  another show.  More on this story and your money after the break, stay  there </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, how is your money doing today.  Let us take a  check on your money, the markets finishing and here is our finish the DOW  up to 22 points.  Let us get right Nicole Petallides on the floor of the  big board with latest, Nicole.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Stocks finished mixed, the DOW is  higher, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ hold back, you saw the worries about trade and  tariffs and emerging market.  And we have job reports on Friday, the NASDAQ  though was a big loser, in fact it got crash on 1.1 percent.  While the  others were not too far off from the unchanged line.  As you look at the  NSADQ, you can break down social media stocks today, as we heard testimony  from Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sandburg from Facebook, and with that this  group got hit hard, we saw Facebook down 2 percent, Twitter down 6 percent.   Snapchat, yelp all lower, some of the others lagers on the NASDAQ, would  also be jd.com micron and PayPal.  Back to you.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you Nicole.  We'll be right back with a jam-pack  hour.  We will be right back after the break.  Stay there.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, President Trump just tweeting quote, the failing \"New  York Times\" in response to that anonymous New York Times op-ed.  The  president will be traveling to Montana tomorrow where he plans to host a  Make America Great Again rally in the evening.  He is expected to hold an  official event following that rally.  We will stay on that story for you.   Thank you so much for having us in your home.  It's been a jack-packed  hour.  Thank you so much for watching.  Charles Payne is here now with  Making Money.

That rare move by \"New York Times\" to publish an anonymous op-ed by a  quote, \"senior official inside the White House in D.C.\" Saying there is a  quite resistance within the administration of people choosing to put  country first. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And that the cabinet earlier has discussed invoking the 25 amendment to  remove the president. We've got immediate reaction from Kayleigh McEnany of  the RNC coming up. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we are awaiting the president to come out during a meeting with  sheriffs. He may comment on this anonymous op-ed. </p><p>And big tech taken to the woodshed on Capitol Hill. Senators threatening  the government will take action to regulate social media like Facebook,  Twitter, and Google. The Justice Department now looking into claims of  conservative censorship on social media. More on that story.</p><p>Another day of chaos, more protests during day two of Kavanaugh's hearing.  We've got the highlights. We are monitoring the ongoing hearing. </p><p>Plus, a Fox Business exclusive. Tonight, Uber CEO here to talk to Susan Li.  He has to prove to Wall Street that Uber is ready to go public despite a  deluge of controversy and scandal. </p><p>And a story flying under the radar, President Trump plans to chair a U.N.  Security Council meeting to take on Iran. You heard me right. The U.N., a  place that President Trump has blasted for wasteful spending and  ineffectiveness. We've got that story.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth  MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p>First to your money, the Dow closing slightly higher, ending the day at  25,974. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P falling. Netflix lead a steep tech sell-off.  More on your money in just a second. </p><p>But first to that \"New York Times\" anonymous op-ed, it appears to be  written by a male senior official, that's according to the Times Twitter  account. </p><p>With me now live from White House is Blake Burman with the latest. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Liz. Don't know exactly  who this person is, the New York Times op-ed page in which this article is  published, identifies as person as a senior administration official. The  title here is, quote, \"I am part of the resistance inside the Trump  administration.\" </p><p>When you boil down this op-ed this person says that themselves along with  others are working inside the Trump administration to essentially keep it  on track as they see it. This is what the senior administration official  writes anonymously in this op-ed at one point. </p><p>Quote, speaking of the president, \"The dilemma - which he does not fully  grasp, is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are  working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his  worst inclination.\" </p><p>This anonymous senior administration official also goes on to write in that  op-ed the following. Quote, \"Given the instability, many witnessed there  were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25 amendment which  would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted  to precipitate a constitutional crisis, so we will do what we can to steer  the administration in the right direction until one way or the other it is  over.\" </p><p>We need to point out, Liz, that this person is identified as a senior  administration official, so we don't know if that person works within this  very White House or if they are an official within the Trump administration  somewhere here in Washington D.C.</p><p>The president is here about to speak inside the White House right now, Liz.  Let's listen in.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MASSACHUSETTS:  Great job, keep up  the good work. Thanks, everybody. </p><p>Mr. President, we remember when you first were giving your acceptance  speech of the nomination at the GOO convention, you said at that time that  one year from now when I take over the White House I am going to  reestablish the rule of law in this country, and you have done that, Mr.  President. We thank you for that.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thank you.</p><p>HODGSON:  Very, very much. </p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you. </p><p>HODGSON:  You know, behind me, Mr. President, are 44 sheriffs, who are  representing 35 states that came here to Washington for two reasons. The  first is to go to Congress to the Capitol today hold a press conference and  let Congress know enough is enough. </p><p>We've been for 20 years, asking Congress to move on the security aspects of  immigration reform, and nothing has happened for 20 years. </p><p>But what's really amazing, Mr. President, with your strength and purpose  the commitment to your convictions you've done more in less than two years  in supporting law enforcement and dealing with this illegal immigration  problem that we've been asking for solutions on in less than two years. </p><p>And again, all these sheriffs and sheriffs across the nation are grateful  to you for that, Mr. President. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>HODGSON:  And like so many of the promises that you made, you have come  through and the energy that you put behind law enforcement in supporting us  on our partnership with 287G, going after MS-13 and getting them out of our  neighborhoods, t building the wall, Mr. President, you've really did  amazing.</p><p>And so, before I president this plaque I just want to add one thing that  maybe you heard about, maybe you didn't. But when we were on the Hill  today, we announced that the National Sheriff Association has done a crowd  funding page to raise money and mobilize the citizens of this nation to get  behind you, to get behind the sheriffs to build this wall. </p><p>So, in having said that, I would like to present this to you, Mr.  President, because, it's not surprising for any of the sheriffs who are  here, that shortly after you took office, people started saying the  citizens and members of the media saying, there is a new sheriff in town. </p><p>And that's an endearing statement, and all these sheriffs know it. Because  what it denotes is that there are problems and somebody is coming in that's  going to be able to fix those problems. You've done that, Mr. President, we  can't thank you enough for your support, you said you have our back. And  the sheriffs across this nation, have yours. And God bless you. Thank you,  Mr. President.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, that's really nice. This is an honor because when I was  running I think number one on our list of law enforcement, taking care of  law enforcement, working with law enforcement. </p><p>And really we have to create guidelines and principles for the incredible  job you've done, and you've done an amazing job. </p><p>And I will tell you, a lot of times you are scorned and you are looked at  by the media, because the media is very dishonest, much of it in this  country, very, very dishonest. And the job that you've done in light of all  the things that you have to go through, I guess a little bit like me also,  but I will say that you have been really outstanding, incredible people. </p><p>Crime statistics are down. We're really doing well other than you take a  couple of places on a nation where they have different policies than we  would put, and you know where I'm talking about. </p><p>But there are a couple of places they don't believe in what we believe, but  we have together done something very special. </p><p>I also remember so well, sheriff, when we were together, I said we're going  to get a lot of military equipment that you weren't able to get and it was  sitting in warehouses all over the country. </p><p>And in many cases like in other countries, you remember, and we brought it  back home, and you were able to get great military equipment that you  couldn't afford to buy in your budgets and we gave it to you and it  protected a lot of people. </p><p>We have a lot of people living today in your profession that would not  frankly be around right now without the protection of that kind of  equipment that we have sitting around, waiting and doing nothing, and just  drawing dust. </p><p>So, the fact that you gave me this award is very meaningful. I will put  that in a place of great honor in the Oval Office. But I really appreciate  it. Thank you very much, it's a great honor. Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you, all. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you very much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. President, keep up the good work.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We stand behind you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BURMAN:  Liz, you are hearing the President of United States at an event  with sheriff officers here inside the White House. One of the big question  is whether or not the president will answer any questions from the press  pool inside that event. Of course the biggest question will be about this  New York Times op-ed. </p><p>I'll send it back to you in case you want to (Inaudible) the president.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Blake, and we are going to need you to monitor the press pool,  we want to know what are the questions, and what the president says about  this anonymous bombshell op-ed by a senior White House official. </p><p>Apparently, a man, who is alleging a bunch of things about the president,  including that there were early whispers that amongst cabinet members to  evoke the 25 amendment to remove President Trump.</p><p>Thank you, Blake. You're going to stay on that story for us throughout the  hour. </p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You read the op-ed. What's your reaction?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Well there obviously  are substantial forces very close to the president that candidly do not  believe he's fit for office. This is calling a bombshell, which is the  phrase that you used is actually being charitable. </p><p>I mean, this devastating to the president, the president should have around  him people who believe in him and trust him. This is obvious somebody who  he thinks believes in him and trust him who has revealed a consensus  amongst those around him that question his fitness for office. And it was  also revealed that there were serious discussions about the 25th amendment. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, so in the piece, whoever the writer is said we want  the administration to succeed. They bring up that the president is in their  mind, anti-trade an anti-democratic. They say the root of the problem is  the president's immorality he's not more to discern with first principle,  and that he acted in a manner detrimental to the health of the Republican.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That is a serious an allegation as could be. That is a code  phrase for worthy of impeachment. If he is acting in the opinion of this  writer whoever it is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Acting in a manner injurious to the health of the republic. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And as Melissa Francis has said pointed out earlier in the  hour, opinions usually, you own the opinion with your name on it. Let's  listen to the president.</p><p>TRUMP:  -- working today that at any point ever in our history. We've  created 400,000 manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs are growing at the  fastest pace in more than 30 years, economic growth last quarter was 4.2  percent. </p><p>And as you people know it was headed down, big, and it was a low number,  very low number. It would have been, in my opinion, it would have been less  than zero, it was heading to negative numbers. </p><p>New employment claims recently hit a -- think of that. The unemployment  picture in the country is the best it has been in 49 years, African- American unemployment is lowest in the history of the country. </p><p>Asian-American unemployment lowest in the history of our country, Hispanic- American unemployment lowest in the history of our country. </p><p>I mean, I'm just looking at this point after point. Under my  administration, veteran's unemployment reached its lowest in many years.  The -- let's see, almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food  stamps just since my election. </p><p>Then you go into all of the benefits that we got from the tax cuts, all of  you people benefitted tremendously from the tax cuts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to regulation cuts, we're going to right to try, right  to try is where you have right is if a person is terminally  ill you have a  right to go and try and see whether or not a drug that's not approved yet  can be used. They didn't allow that. </p><p>A point after point we're getting rid of the individual mandate, the most  unpopular thing there is in Obamacare. Coming up with new healthcare plans. </p><p>We've never had a period, even if you look at the Olympics, we got the  Olympics, the World Cup, you say them, they were in my office, got the  World Cup, nobody has -- and we have started the wall. Nobody has ever done  in less than a two-year period what we've done.</p><p>So when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration,  probably it was failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons, no.  And the New York Times is failing. If I weren't here I believe the New York  Times probably wouldn't even exist.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP:  And some day -- and some day when I'm not president, which  hopefully will be in about six and a half years from now. The New York  Times and CNN, and all of these phony media outlets will be out of  business, folks. They'll be out of business because they'll be nothing to  write, and they'll be nothing of interest. </p><p>So nobody has been what this administration has done. And I agree, it's  different from an agenda which is much different than ours, and it's  certainly not your agenda, that I can tell you. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP:  It's about open borders, it's about letting people flee into our  country, it's about a disaster and crime for our country. </p><p>So, they don't like Donald Trump, and I don't like them, because they are  very dishonest people. Remember this also, about the New York Times, when I  won they were forced to apologize to their subscribers. They wrote a letter  of apology it was the first time anybody has ever done it because they  covered the election incorrectly.</p><p>So if the failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial -- can you  believe it, anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial -- we are doing  a great job. The poll numbers are through the roof. Our poll numbers are  great. </p><p>And guess what, nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because  of what we've done. We've done more than anybody ever thought possible in - - it's not even two years. So thank you very much. We appreciate it. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. That was President Trump taking on directly this anonymous  op-ed in the New York Times that is quoting a senior White House official - - let me back up, it was written by a senior White House official. We at  Fox Business believe it a man, according on the New York Times own Twitter  account he is identified as a he, the author of this anonymous piece.</p><p>Let's bring the judge back here. You saw the president really going hard at  New York Times with his comments that, basically the Times is failing  according to his mindset and that it wouldn't exist without him and when he  is going to -- he says he is going to be here for six an half more years.  And CNN and New York Times may not exist then.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I thought that his impromptu response now was actually a  pretty good one. If he started to go through line by line the anonymous op- ed a, he is going to give it more credibility than he wants to give it, and  b, he is going to find himself going down rabbit holes of attempting to  retort anonymous allegations which are incendiary, in which he doesn't want  to give the credence to. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, the other thing the president brought up which is  interesting is about the New York Times letter of apology that New York  Times wrote to its readers about -- I guess people are trying to contact  you about this op-ed that basically--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  This is not from the author of the op-ed. I don't think it is. </p><p>MACDONALD:  That is, it looks like I'm looking at the New York Times  apology letter to readers after the election. Basically, the New York Times  is taking accountability for the coverage, because they too were surprised  that Trump won. What do you make of President Trump bringing up the Times  apology letter to readers there? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, it's the Trump strategy, go on the offensive, he is not  going to dignify this op-ed piece or New York Times by going through it  line by line, he is going to attack the messenger here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Judge--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The 25th amendment is something that in my view can only be  invoked if a vice president personally authorizes it, not going to happen. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Wow. We've got an hour of thick and fast breaking  news. Judge, thank you so much for your insights here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The anti-Trump resistance movement in the White House. We're  staying on story of this anonymous current senior Trump official in the  White House writing that New York Times op-ed. We're going to have more on  that story after the break, stay there. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Moments ago, addressing that anonymous New York Times op-ed by  a senior official within the administration while talking with the nation's  sheriffs at White House. </p><p>Let's talk more with the judge more about what happened with that op-ed. It  says a senior official, that's a pretty elastic term. It could be anybody  in the executive branch. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right. As our colleague Blake Burman just pointed out, it  could be anybody in the executive branch which means all around the world.  You're talking about the diplomatic correlate the military, the State  Department, it sounds to me. And I read this now three or four times as  though it's somebody who works daily with the president and interacts with  them daily, which means somebody in the West Wing.</p><p>But I don't want to begin speculation because the speculation I could tell  you from my iPhone is rampant with proper names in there and I'm not going  to go because it's just speculation. </p><p>But it does sound as though this is a human being that knows the president  well and interacts with him on a daily basis.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You said it's the one two punch because we have a Bob Woodward  book coming out.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the Bob Woodward book is been excerpted in the  Washington Post. He is an editor and a reporter for the Washington Post  with two Pulitzer Prizes who notoriously tape records every conversation he  has every interview that he has.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Currently there are recording for that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct. So the one-two punch is the Washington Post and the  New York Times same time same subject, same week. This is more ganging up  on a president than they did on Richard Nixon. And as I said before--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  And have you ever seen an anonymous op-ed. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No, I've never seen or heard of an anonymous op-ed which means  the New York Times wants to keep this person employed there. So this person  can be a source for them as this person obviously was in tomorrow's paper.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That's an interesting take on it. Yes. So, here's the thing. We  may have New York Times reporter trying to crack and find out who this  person is.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  What if the New York Times would let its own reporters figure  out who this person is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. All right. Gang, in the control room where fast and thick  news breaking in this hour. Do we want to get the judge's reaction on Judge  Kavanaugh.</p><p>So, let's -- I want your reaction to the sound bite, judge. Let's watch  what happened at that Judge Kavanaugh's hearing today. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Justice Jackson--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ask them to suspend.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Your reaction to the protest and disruption.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The protest and distraction are a sideshow. The senators  didn't lay a glove on him today. They attempted to but they didn't. Now  much of the questioning was boring. Some of that was highly academic and  really into the weeds except for people that monitor the stuff.</p><p>But politically speaking, the consensus is he's worthy of confirmation and  will more likely than not receive it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Judge Napolitano, thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Really rolling with the breaking news with us. OK. We've got  this story for you coming up. Despite fans threat to boycott, Nike is  doubling down on Colin Kaepernick. The new ad will air tomorrow night at  the launch of the NFL season. It isn't just do it ad campaign. It is coming  tomorrow night. We're going to have that debate coming up after the break.  Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COLIN KAEPERNICK, FORMER NFL PLAYER:  MACDONALD:  Believe in something even  if it means sacrificing everything. </p><p>When they talk about the greatest team in the history of the sport, make  sure it's your team. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. That's just part of Nike's new just do it ad  campaign, featuring Colin Kaepernick. It is set to debut during the NFL  season open tomorrow night. It's featuring athletes who have overcome  adversity.</p><p>Now social justice warrior Kaepernick he launched the anthem protest by  first taking a knee. Nike's stock took a knee too, a loss nearly $4 billion  in market value after this ad news broke under threats of boycotts from  customers. </p><p>The tag line sacrificing everything now also being criticized. Here are the  facts. Kaepernick earned $43 million from the NFL, millions more coming his  way from this new advertising campaign. </p><p>Now Colin Kaepernick has not played in two years, he is suing the NFL for  alleged collusion, claiming no team will hire him. The NFL offering a  measured response ahead of tomorrow's kick-off. Saying quote, \"The social  justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised have  deserve our attention and action.\" </p><p>Now a new report says Nike stock may drop further, maybe 10 percent due to  these ads.</p><p>Let's take it up with Investmark Advisory Group principal, Michael Lee, and  conservative commentator, Lawrence Jones. Mike, Nike specifically decided  to hire Kaepernick not for his athleticism but for his political views.  What does that mean for Nike's bottom line that it is now face of NFL  national anthem protest? </p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PRINCIPAL, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP:  So, Nike just decided  to get political, not only get political, they decided to shove a certain  brand of politics down everyone's throat. </p><p>I do not think this is a good decision for any corporation regardless of  the politics. Colin Kaepernick has every right to be a social justice  warrior, to kneel during the anthem. </p><p>But let's face it. His politics are that he hates America, and he hates law  enforcement. That not popular. That is not going to go over well with large  swaths of the population. And I think Nike has permanently damaged its  brand. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, you know, here's the thing, Lawrence Jones, there is a  question of do millennials like this, is the Nike playing to millennials,  that millennial like to protest according to polls. I mean, one marketing  group says Nike got tens of millions of dollars worth of free media  exposure.</p><p>But here's the other side of that, Lawrence. Critics say Nike is charging  $100 plus for fancy sneakers made by poor workers in Asia earning a lot low  pay, it then uses the profit to pay millions to athletes like LeBron James  or Kaepernick. Your take in all of this. </p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes, Liz. This is complicated  because I have conflicting views, on one hand you want a private business  to be able to do whatever they want and then suffer the consequences that  may come. But I think when it comes with Nike, I don't even think it about  politics for them, I don't even think they care about social justice, I  think that they just made a business decision, and they felt like getting  behind this Colin Kaepernick movement would somehow benefit them.  Remember  when Colin Kaepernick left the league and he was a superstar at that point,  he was the number one failing jersey at the time because he decided to take  a knee.  </p><p>The men was on the bench was still the number one jersey and so I think  they plan on capitalizing on this, some way, I don't know how it will turn  up even the President of United States, who has been very vocal on this  issue pivoted on this issue, because as he said, Nike pays a lot of rent.   And so he has been more critical in past, but because there a business  investment there, he kind of backed off some of his criticism.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, you know, to Lawrence's point, Michael, Nike, it looks  like making a bet, that its biggest gross market is China, it is Asia, they  don't care about the U.S. protest over there, I mean, 40 percent of Nike's  sale comes from the very (inaudible) of North America and Nike's biggest  athletes in its ads are basketball players like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant  and LeBron James, not football games.  </p><p>JONES:  LeBron James.  </p><p>LEE:  yes, I would say that very conspicuous timing here, this is coming  out the day that tariffs go into effect in China.  A lot of their products  is made over there.  That is the biggest opportunity for growth so a little  bit of anti-American sentiment might go a long way to sell some more  sneakers over there.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mike and Lawrence, you had been great tonight.  Thank you so  much for coming in.  </p><p>JONES:  Thank you, Liz.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.  We are staying on this story about the anti-Trump  resistance movement in the White House that is allegedly anonymous.   Current senior Trump official in the White House writing a New York Times  Op-ed, saying he is working against President Trump.  This is a story that  is now being questioned, because who exactly is the author.  And why did  the Times run an anonymous opinion piece?  We are staying on this for you.  </p><p>But first, an exclusive one-on-one interview with Uber's new CEO is next,  coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, we have an exciting exclusive interview coming up.  Our  own Susan Li sat down with Uber's new boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, who is now  in the fight of his life.  He has to clean up Uber's toxic image, just one  of the scandals we give any executive a cold sweat.  Hundreds of thousands  of customers deleting Uber's app and protest over its pricing.  Uber's  Freight House executive culture leaning to charges, and settlements for  alleged sexual harassment and discrimination and cities like New York and  London blocking Uber drivers, Uber testing of a self-driving car also  killed a pedestrian, Susan Lee is all over the story.  You know, Uber,  still had the biggest fight of his life.  Are they kind of prove to Wall  Street that can be profitable?  This is a story filled with scandal.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESSES:  There is a lot of different angles to it and  Dara has been in job for one year.  Just one year, 12 months and he had a  lot to fix.  Today in midtown Manhattan it was all about safety that is the  focus, that is what they are here to do, there are some new safety features  that includes tracking your ride.  If it takes a little bit longer to get  there, if you make an executive stops, Uber will now check in, that is what  they call the new ride check in feature.  Also they are going to make it  your locations, your drop off, your phone numbers anonymous, so that means  drivers cannot tell where you are going, they can't reach you in the  future.  But yes, we talked about IPO, we talked about liberal bias.  And  let's listen in to -- first of all his thoughts on this new safety  features.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)  </p><p>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, CEO, UBER:  When you have 15 million trips on a daily  basis on a global platform, such as ours.  The vast majority of time is  everything is OK. But once in a while something happens, and we as a  company leadership got together last year and we declared that safety is  going to be top priority for us as a company in 2018.  </p><p>LI:  Why.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Frankly beyond -- because safety is universal, because  anyone who is at home or they are home or going to a ball game or going to  work, you want to feel safe.  And we believe that we can use the power of  technology and the innovation that we have brought to bear to  revolutionized transportation to make Uber the safest transportation  platform on earth.  And what you are seeing is very early in the game.   But, features such as 911 button that location aware so that 911 dispatch  can react to anything that might happen incredibly quickly with a huge  determine and success or failure.  Trust the contact, tracking where you  are going, and improve background checks and continuous background checks  as well, both available for riders and drivers.  </p><p>And now some of the new future, that were introducing privacy, for example,  you may not want a driver partner to know the exact address where you are  dropped off, because that is something private, location information is  incredibly important, we have masked that, and we masked your phone number  if you ever speak to your driver partner and then we have introduced some  really cool wiz ban technology, where we know where you started, we know  where you ended, we know how long your trip should take, and if for some  reason your trip is taking longer than it should, we will send you a  notification to make sure that you are OK, and in some cases, we can  actually detect an accident, if it ever happens to again make sure the  rider and driver partner are OK too.  </p><p>LI:  You are mining a lot of data off of driver and the passenger's  smartphone, in terms of speed, where they are going, how do you assure that  user data is safe?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I think it is a great question.  We made very significant  investments in data privacy, we do know a lot of data about payment  information and location information, but the religion, at Uber is that we  are going to use that information for you the rider or the driver.  So, for  example, in the morning now my (inaudible) that in mornings I go to work,  so it is one click.  It is one click, we have an idea where you are going,  but ultimately we're not selling data, we don't have any advertising, et  cetera.  So ultimately the use of data is to make life easier for you, to  make it faster, to make it more affordable, and now, to make riding on an  Uber safe as possible we can.  </p><p>LI:  So, you are celebrating your one near anniversary as CEO.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Yes I am.  I made it.  </p><p>LI:  You made it.  That is very true, now people want to know, are you  still sticking with your timeline of an IPO in perhaps 2019, because you  are new CFO who will start in a few days.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I would be starting next week, yes.  </p><p>LI:  Nelson, he says he is not on board yet though for 2019 Mustang.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I would expect nothing less of Nelson, he is independent  minded, he is rigorous, and so far he is on the outside, so I think, I  absolutely want Nelson to come in and I think that when he sees all of the  work that the teams are doing, I think that he will agree that we're ready  for a 2019 IPO, there is a bunch of systems first that is going on,  financial work that is going on, the company is big enough, the company is  incredibly important to the world.  And we have some incredibly talented  technologists out there, so, I think we are going to be ready, but I  absolutely want that stamp of approval from our CFO.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, there is always a but.  (Inaudible) The thinking on street, if  they IPO before you, they would take up all the IPO capital in the market,  are you concerned?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I'm not concern.  This is Lyft and ourselves are part of a  transportation revolution this is about ultimately ending car ownership,  the transportation market is 6 trillion dollar business, you may think that  Uber's big.  We're 50 billion, we account for less than 1 percent of miles  driven, and really what ourselves and Lyft are trying to do is to break  apart all the use cases of owning a car.  You owned a car, you get to work,  and you owned a car to pick up the kids at school.  You owned a car to get  groceries, etcetera and we're building out services to solve each of those  use cases and ultimately make it unnecessary for you to own a car.  And we  think that there are plenty of companies who can be a part of that  evolution.  I think investors are going to line up behind us and Lyft.  I  certainly hope they are.  </p><p>LI:  Are you guarantee a 2019 IPO?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Well, there is no guarantee, you don't know what the market  is doing.  I can guarantee that we'll be ready, hopefully markets will be  ready for us.  </p><p>LI:  So, you talk about how big Uber is and the ride hailing services.   Some say you owned 73 percent of the market, given that the U.S. President  has talked about anti-trust situation with big tech company, Google, Amazon  and Facebook.  Do you think that big tech company like Uber may be  regulated in the future?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Listen, we're regulated now.  We work in every single city  and et cetera.  We look at market as 6 trillion dollar transportation  market, we're a tiny, tiny, tiny part of the market, and we account for  less than 1 percent of miles driven on the road.  So, I think Uber can be  ultimately 20, sounds bigger than it is today.  </p><p>LI:  So, no fear of being broken up at all?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  No fear of being broken up and listen, I think that  ultimately, regulators are our partners, you know, we work with -- we  operate on the streets of New York City and while we may not agree on  everything, ultimately we think that we as a transportation service are  incredibly valuable for every city around.  And that ultimately we have a  be partners in building this solution together.  It takes dialogue,  sometimes you agree, sometimes you don't agree, but we think that  opportunity is enormous, and we think there is a need for rider and drivers  around all around the world for or service.  </p><p>LI:  Well, talking with our audience, you know, there has been a lot of  concern of political bias in Silicon Valley.  There are giants, respectable  (inaudible) at Silicon Valley, so I have to ask you this question,  President Trump thinks that there is a liberal bias in Silicon Valley with  big tech companies, employees of big tech companies, and so that they feel  that their conservatives voices have been silenced.  You think that is  true?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I guarantee that your wait times for your Uber are going to  be equal whether you're Republican or not or Democrat.  I don't think -- I  think that biases, if there's a bias, I don't think that is a bias on  purpose.  We as a company's leadership team have been trained on biases as  well.  There are some implicit policies that you may not be aware of as a  person and I think awareness is step one.  So I don't think that there's  any bias on purpose, but if you have a bunch of like-minded people building  product, you may get product that straight one or the other.  That's one  for sample from our standpoint, we want to have more women.  We want to  have more underrepresented people working as engineers and product people  and have representation at all parts of our company so that the products  that were building reflect our driver partners in our rider partners and  aren't with any biases that were not aware of.  So, listen, we are human,  all of this is vulnerable.  I think that all of these companies are trying  to do the right thing, but they got some learning to do.  And I think the  way that they operate going forward have to change.  </p><p>LI:  Dara, thank you so much.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I appreciate it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO)  </p><p>MACDONALD:  that was a great interview.  Are they going to go public?  Uber  is going public?  </p><p>LI:  I would be surprised if they did not.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Next year.  </p><p>LI:  Next year 2019.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow.  Great interview, Susan.  Thanks for bringing it to us.  </p><p>LI:  Thank you.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.  We're staying on this anti-Trump resistant movement in the  White House, it has been somewhere in the executive branch, we don't know  if it is in the White House, is some of the executive branch.  Stay with us  here for time of the anonymous op-ed story for you.  Kayleigh Mcenany is  coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York Times\"  has an anonymous editorial, can you believe it?  Anonymous.  Meaning  gutless.  Gutless editorial.  We're doing a great job, the poll numbers  through the roof, our poll numbers are great, and guess what nobody is  going to come close to beating me in 2020, because of what we've done.  We  have done more than anybody ever thought possible in -- it is not even two  years, so thank you very much, appreciate it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MACDONALD:  That was President Trump, just moments ago refuting \"New York  Times\" anonymous op-ed from someone allegedly in the administration said  that person and others are working against the President.  The op-ed writer  say and we had identify him as a he.  Actually New York Times did in a  tweet saying he is a he, quote, I am part of the resistance under the Trump  administration and said they work for President, and they unlike my  colleagues and have vowed to thwart parts of President Trump's agenda and  his worse quote, his worse inclination.  Let us get RNC spokesperson,  Kayleigh Mcenany joins me now, over the phone, Kayleigh what do you hear  from your people on who they think wrote it?  </p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON:  Hi, Liz.   Great to join you, I don't think there is any indication at-this-point as  who wrote it -- who wrote the op-ed, but I can give you a description of  them, he is a coward.  He is an absolute coward to leak in this fashion, to  write anonymously in this fashion, to come out and say that he wants this  agenda and this administration to succeed and write an op-ed.  In direct  contradiction of anything that would behoove this administration.  This  person called himself an unsung hero, I don't know who he is, but he is a  coward, he is very far from an unsung hero.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know Kayleigh, the debate now is up though New York Times  and the Washington Post or another news outlet would run it but here -- I  want you reaction to this.  Some are very unimpressed by this.  Walter  Schaub, he is a former director of the office of Government ethics.  He  said this op-ed is ridiculous on so many levels.  We now present an opinion  piece with no substantive content by an anonymous contributor who no  employer should ever trust again.  Your reaction.  </p><p>MCENANY:  Yes, he is absolutely spot on here.  What a great mistake by the  New York Time, the media and newspaper are already out of his story low and  trustworthiness among the American people.  In fact they hit their lowest  approval rating in the history of Gallup asking the question.  But for the  New York Times to run with a fake news story from a fake news source, we  don't even know if this individual really exists, this is a big hit to  their credibility, President talks about making up sources, well this  certainly looks a lot like that.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Walter Shaub of the government ethics former official  satirize this op-ed saying, dear America, in other words, this is the tone  of the anonymous op-ed, quote dear America, this administration is  wonderful but I'm trying to so sabotage from the inside also be super  afraid and no you owe me.  Your take.  </p><p>MCENANY:  Yes.  That is right, this is a quiet resistant on how it is  described, from inside the administration, their goal to frustrate part of  the agenda is what he said frustrate parts of the agenda.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  We have to leave it there, Kayleigh, sorry, we had a hard  break.  Kayleigh Mcenany weighing in.  We will have Kayleigh on soon on  another show.  More on this story and your money after the break, stay  there </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, how is your money doing today.  Let us take a  check on your money, the markets finishing and here is our finish the DOW  up to 22 points.  Let us get right Nicole Petallides on the floor of the  big board with latest, Nicole.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Stocks finished mixed, the DOW is  higher, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ hold back, you saw the worries about trade and  tariffs and emerging market.  And we have job reports on Friday, the NASDAQ  though was a big loser, in fact it got crash on 1.1 percent.  While the  others were not too far off from the unchanged line.  As you look at the  NSADQ, you can break down social media stocks today, as we heard testimony  from Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sandburg from Facebook, and with that this  group got hit hard, we saw Facebook down 2 percent, Twitter down 6 percent.   Snapchat, yelp all lower, some of the others lagers on the NASDAQ, would  also be jd.com micron and PayPal.  Back to you.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you Nicole.  We'll be right back with a jam-pack  hour.  We will be right back after the break.  Stay there.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, President Trump just tweeting quote, the failing \"New  York Times\" in response to that anonymous New York Times op-ed.  The  president will be traveling to Montana tomorrow where he plans to host a  Make America Great Again rally in the evening.  He is expected to hold an  official event following that rally.  We will stay on that story for you.   Thank you so much for having us in your home.  It's been a jack-packed  hour.  Thank you so much for watching.  Charles Payne is here now with  Making Money.

He has to prove to Wall Street that Uber is ready to go public despite a  deluge of controversy and scandal. </p><p> And a story flying under the radar, President Trump plans to chair a U.N.  Security Council meeting to take on Iran. You heard me right. The U.N., a  place that President Trump has blasted for wasteful spending and  ineffectiveness. We've got that story.</p><p> Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth  MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p> First to your money, the Dow closing slightly higher, ending the day at  25,974. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P falling. Netflix lead a steep tech sell-off.  More on your money in just a second. </p><p> But first to that \"New York Times\" anonymous op-ed, it appears to be  written by a male senior official, that's according to the Times Twitter  account. </p><p> With me now live from White House is Blake Burman with the latest. Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Liz. Don't know exactly  who this person is, the New York Times op-ed page in which this article is  published, identifies as person as a senior administration official. The  title here is, quote, \"I am part of the resistance inside the Trump  administration.\" </p><p> When you boil down this op-ed this person says that themselves along with  others are working inside the Trump administration to essentially keep it  on track as they see it. This is what the senior administration official  writes anonymously in this op-ed at one point. </p><p> Quote, speaking of the president, \"The dilemma - which he does not fully  grasp, is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are  working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his  worst inclination.\" </p><p> This anonymous senior administration official also goes on to write in that  op-ed the following. Quote, \"Given the instability, many witnessed there  were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25 amendment which  would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted  to precipitate a constitutional crisis, so we will do what we can to steer  the administration in the right direction until one way or the other it is  over.\" </p><p> We need to point out, Liz, that this person is identified as a senior  administration official, so we don't know if that person works within this  very White House or if they are an official within the Trump administration  somewhere here in Washington D.C.</p><p> The president is here about to speak inside the White House right now, Liz.  Let's listen in.</p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MASSACHUSETTS:  Great job, keep up  the good work. Thanks, everybody. </p><p> Mr. President, we remember when you first were giving your acceptance  speech of the nomination at the GOO convention, you said at that time that  one year from now when I take over the White House I am going to  reestablish the rule of law in this country, and you have done that, Mr.  President. We thank you for that.</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thank you.</p><p> HODGSON:  Very, very much. </p><p> TRUMP:  Thank you. </p><p> HODGSON:  You know, behind me, Mr. President, are 44 sheriffs, who are  representing 35 states that came here to Washington for two reasons. The  first is to go to Congress to the Capitol today hold a press conference and  let Congress know enough is enough. </p><p> We've been for 20 years, asking Congress to move on the security aspects of  immigration reform, and nothing has happened for 20 years. </p><p> But what's really amazing, Mr. President, with your strength and purpose  the commitment to your convictions you've done more in less than two years  in supporting law enforcement and dealing with this illegal immigration  problem that we've been asking for solutions on in less than two years. </p><p> And again, all these sheriffs and sheriffs across the nation are grateful  to you for that, Mr. President. </p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> HODGSON:  And like so many of the promises that you made, you have come  through and the energy that you put behind law enforcement in supporting us  on our partnership with 287G, going after MS-13 and getting them out of our  neighborhoods, t building the wall, Mr. President, you've really did  amazing.</p><p> And so, before I president this plaque I just want to add one thing that  maybe you heard about, maybe you didn't. But when we were on the Hill  today, we announced that the National Sheriff Association has done a crowd  funding page to raise money and mobilize the citizens of this nation to get  behind you, to get behind the sheriffs to build this wall. </p><p> So, in having said that, I would like to present this to you, Mr.  President, because, it's not surprising for any of the sheriffs who are  here, that shortly after you took office, people started saying the  citizens and members of the media saying, there is a new sheriff in town. </p><p> And that's an endearing statement, and all these sheriffs know it. Because  what it denotes is that there are problems and somebody is coming in that's  going to be able to fix those problems. You've done that, Mr. President, we  can't thank you enough for your support, you said you have our back. And  the sheriffs across this nation, have yours. And God bless you. Thank you,  Mr. President.</p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, that's really nice. This is an honor because when I was  running I think number one on our list of law enforcement, taking care of  law enforcement, working with law enforcement. </p><p> And really we have to create guidelines and principles for the incredible  job you've done, and you've done an amazing job. </p><p> And I will tell you, a lot of times you are scorned and you are looked at  by the media, because the media is very dishonest, much of it in this  country, very, very dishonest. And the job that you've done in light of all  the things that you have to go through, I guess a little bit like me also,  but I will say that you have been really outstanding, incredible people. </p><p> Crime statistics are down. We're really doing well other than you take a  couple of places on a nation where they have different policies than we  would put, and you know where I'm talking about. </p><p> But there are a couple of places they don't believe in what we believe, but  we have together done something very special. </p><p> I also remember so well, sheriff, when we were together, I said we're going  to get a lot of military equipment that you weren't able to get and it was  sitting in warehouses all over the country. </p><p> And in many cases like in other countries, you remember, and we brought it  back home, and you were able to get great military equipment that you  couldn't afford to buy in your budgets and we gave it to you and it  protected a lot of people. </p><p> We have a lot of people living today in your profession that would not  frankly be around right now without the protection of that kind of  equipment that we have sitting around, waiting and doing nothing, and just  drawing dust. </p><p> So, the fact that you gave me this award is very meaningful. I will put  that in a place of great honor in the Oval Office. But I really appreciate  it. Thank you very much, it's a great honor. Thank you. </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> TRUMP:  Thank you, all. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you very much.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. President, keep up the good work.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We stand behind you.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BURMAN:  Liz, you are hearing the President of United States at an event  with sheriff officers here inside the White House. One of the big question  is whether or not the president will answer any questions from the press  pool inside that event. Of course the biggest question will be about this  New York Times op-ed. </p><p> I'll send it back to you in case you want to (Inaudible) the president.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Blake, and we are going to need you to monitor the press pool,  we want to know what are the questions, and what the president says about  this anonymous bombshell op-ed by a senior White House official. </p><p> Apparently, a man, who is alleging a bunch of things about the president,  including that there were early whispers that amongst cabinet members to  evoke the 25 amendment to remove President Trump.</p><p> Thank you, Blake. You're going to stay on that story for us throughout the  hour. </p><p> Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You read the op-ed. What's your reaction?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Well there obviously  are substantial forces very close to the president that candidly do not  believe he's fit for office. This is calling a bombshell, which is the  phrase that you used is actually being charitable. </p><p> I mean, this devastating to the president, the president should have around  him people who believe in him and trust him. This is obvious somebody who  he thinks believes in him and trust him who has revealed a consensus  amongst those around him that question his fitness for office. And it was  also revealed that there were serious discussions about the 25th amendment. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, so in the piece, whoever the writer is said we want  the administration to succeed. They bring up that the president is in their  mind, anti-trade an anti-democratic. They say the root of the problem is  the president's immorality he's not more to discern with first principle,  and that he acted in a manner detrimental to the health of the Republican.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  That is a serious an allegation as could be. That is a code  phrase for worthy of impeachment. If he is acting in the opinion of this  writer whoever it is.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Acting in a manner injurious to the health of the republic. </p><p> MACDONALD:  And as Melissa Francis has said pointed out earlier in the  hour, opinions usually, you own the opinion with your name on it. Let's  listen to the president.</p><p> TRUMP:  -- working today that at any point ever in our history. We've  created 400,000 manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs are growing at the  fastest pace in more than 30 years, economic growth last quarter was 4.2  percent. </p><p> And as you people know it was headed down, big, and it was a low number,  very low number. It would have been, in my opinion, it would have been less  than zero, it was heading to negative numbers. </p><p> New employment claims recently hit a -- think of that. The unemployment  picture in the country is the best it has been in 49 years, African- American unemployment is lowest in the history of the country. </p><p> Asian-American unemployment lowest in the history of our country, Hispanic- American unemployment lowest in the history of our country. </p><p> I mean, I'm just looking at this point after point. Under my  administration, veteran's unemployment reached its lowest in many years.  The -- let's see, almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food  stamps just since my election. </p><p> Then you go into all of the benefits that we got from the tax cuts, all of  you people benefitted tremendously from the tax cuts.</p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> TRUMP:  We're going to regulation cuts, we're going to right to try, right  to try is where you have right is if a person is terminally  ill you have a  right to go and try and see whether or not a drug that's not approved yet  can be used. They didn't allow that. </p><p> A point after point we're getting rid of the individual mandate, the most  unpopular thing there is in Obamacare. Coming up with new healthcare plans. </p><p> We've never had a period, even if you look at the Olympics, we got the  Olympics, the World Cup, you say them, they were in my office, got the  World Cup, nobody has -- and we have started the wall. Nobody has ever done  in less than a two-year period what we've done.</p><p> So when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration,  probably it was failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons, no.  And the New York Times is failing. If I weren't here I believe the New York  Times probably wouldn't even exist.</p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> TRUMP:  And some day -- and some day when I'm not president, which  hopefully will be in about six and a half years from now. The New York  Times and CNN, and all of these phony media outlets will be out of  business, folks. They'll be out of business because they'll be nothing to  write, and they'll be nothing of interest. </p><p> So nobody has been what this administration has done. And I agree, it's  different from an agenda which is much different than ours, and it's  certainly not your agenda, that I can tell you. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you. </p><p> TRUMP:  It's about open borders, it's about letting people flee into our  country, it's about a disaster and crime for our country. </p><p> So, they don't like Donald Trump, and I don't like them, because they are  very dishonest people. Remember this also, about the New York Times, when I  won they were forced to apologize to their subscribers. They wrote a letter  of apology it was the first time anybody has ever done it because they  covered the election incorrectly.</p><p> So if the failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial -- can you  believe it, anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial -- we are doing  a great job. The poll numbers are through the roof. Our poll numbers are  great. </p><p> And guess what, nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because  of what we've done. We've done more than anybody ever thought possible in - - it's not even two years. So thank you very much. We appreciate it. </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. That was President Trump taking on directly this anonymous  op-ed in the New York Times that is quoting a senior White House official - - let me back up, it was written by a senior White House official. We at  Fox Business believe it a man, according on the New York Times own Twitter  account he is identified as a he, the author of this anonymous piece.</p><p> Let's bring the judge back here. You saw the president really going hard at  New York Times with his comments that, basically the Times is failing  according to his mindset and that it wouldn't exist without him and when he  is going to -- he says he is going to be here for six an half more years.  And CNN and New York Times may not exist then.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, I thought that his impromptu response now was actually a  pretty good one. If he started to go through line by line the anonymous op- ed a, he is going to give it more credibility than he wants to give it, and  b, he is going to find himself going down rabbit holes of attempting to  retort anonymous allegations which are incendiary, in which he doesn't want  to give the credence to. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, the other thing the president brought up which is  interesting is about the New York Times letter of apology that New York  Times wrote to its readers about -- I guess people are trying to contact  you about this op-ed that basically--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  This is not from the author of the op-ed. I don't think it is. </p><p> MACDONALD:  That is, it looks like I'm looking at the New York Times  apology letter to readers after the election. Basically, the New York Times  is taking accountability for the coverage, because they too were surprised  that Trump won. What do you make of President Trump bringing up the Times  apology letter to readers there? </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, it's the Trump strategy, go on the offensive, he is not  going to dignify this op-ed piece or New York Times by going through it  line by line, he is going to attack the messenger here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Judge--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  The 25th amendment is something that in my view can only be  invoked if a vice president personally authorizes it, not going to happen. </p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Wow. We've got an hour of thick and fast breaking  news. Judge, thank you so much for your insights here.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p> MACDONALD:  The anti-Trump resistance movement in the White House. We're  staying on story of this anonymous current senior Trump official in the  White House writing that New York Times op-ed. We're going to have more on  that story after the break, stay there. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Moments ago, addressing that anonymous New York Times op-ed by  a senior official within the administration while talking with the nation's  sheriffs at White House. </p><p> Let's talk more with the judge more about what happened with that op-ed. It  says a senior official, that's a pretty elastic term. It could be anybody  in the executive branch. </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Right. As our colleague Blake Burman just pointed out, it  could be anybody in the executive branch which means all around the world.  You're talking about the diplomatic correlate the military, the State  Department, it sounds to me. And I read this now three or four times as  though it's somebody who works daily with the president and interacts with  them daily, which means somebody in the West Wing.</p><p> But I don't want to begin speculation because the speculation I could tell  you from my iPhone is rampant with proper names in there and I'm not going  to go because it's just speculation. </p><p> But it does sound as though this is a human being that knows the president  well and interacts with him on a daily basis.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You said it's the one two punch because we have a Bob Woodward  book coming out.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, the Bob Woodward book is been excerpted in the  Washington Post. He is an editor and a reporter for the Washington Post  with two Pulitzer Prizes who notoriously tape records every conversation he  has every interview that he has.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Currently there are recording for that.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Correct. So the one-two punch is the Washington Post and the  New York Times same time same subject, same week. This is more ganging up  on a president than they did on Richard Nixon. And as I said before--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  And have you ever seen an anonymous op-ed. </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  No, I've never seen or heard of an anonymous op-ed which means  the New York Times wants to keep this person employed there. So this person  can be a source for them as this person obviously was in tomorrow's paper.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That's an interesting take on it. Yes. So, here's the thing. We  may have New York Times reporter trying to crack and find out who this  person is.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  What if the New York Times would let its own reporters figure  out who this person is.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. All right. Gang, in the control room where fast and thick  news breaking in this hour. Do we want to get the judge's reaction on Judge  Kavanaugh.</p><p> So, let's -- I want your reaction to the sound bite, judge. Let's watch  what happened at that Judge Kavanaugh's hearing today. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Justice Jackson--</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ask them to suspend.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Your reaction to the protest and disruption.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  The protest and distraction are a sideshow. The senators  didn't lay a glove on him today. They attempted to but they didn't. Now  much of the questioning was boring. Some of that was highly academic and  really into the weeds except for people that monitor the stuff.</p><p> But politically speaking, the consensus is he's worthy of confirmation and  will more likely than not receive it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Judge Napolitano, thank you so much.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Really rolling with the breaking news with us. OK. We've got  this story for you coming up. Despite fans threat to boycott, Nike is  doubling down on Colin Kaepernick. The new ad will air tomorrow night at  the launch of the NFL season. It isn't just do it ad campaign. It is coming  tomorrow night. We're going to have that debate coming up after the break.  Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> COLIN KAEPERNICK, FORMER NFL PLAYER:  MACDONALD:  Believe in something even  if it means sacrificing everything. </p><p> When they talk about the greatest team in the history of the sport, make  sure it's your team. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. That's just part of Nike's new just do it ad  campaign, featuring Colin Kaepernick. It is set to debut during the NFL  season open tomorrow night. It's featuring athletes who have overcome  adversity.</p><p> Now social justice warrior Kaepernick he launched the anthem protest by  first taking a knee. Nike's stock took a knee too, a loss nearly $4 billion  in market value after this ad news broke under threats of boycotts from  customers. </p><p> The tag line sacrificing everything now also being criticized. Here are the  facts. Kaepernick earned $43 million from the NFL, millions more coming his  way from this new advertising campaign. </p><p> Now Colin Kaepernick has not played in two years, he is suing the NFL for  alleged collusion, claiming no team will hire him. The NFL offering a  measured response ahead of tomorrow's kick-off. Saying quote, \"The social  justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised have  deserve our attention and action.\" </p><p> Now a new report says Nike stock may drop further, maybe 10 percent due to  these ads.</p><p> Let's take it up with Investmark Advisory Group principal, Michael Lee, and  conservative commentator, Lawrence Jones. Mike, Nike specifically decided  to hire Kaepernick not for his athleticism but for his political views.  What does that mean for Nike's bottom line that it is now face of NFL  national anthem protest? </p><p> MICHAEL LEE, PRINCIPAL, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP:  So, Nike just decided  to get political, not only get political, they decided to shove a certain  brand of politics down everyone's throat. </p><p> I do not think this is a good decision for any corporation regardless of  the politics. Colin Kaepernick has every right to be a social justice  warrior, to kneel during the anthem. </p><p> But let's face it. His politics are that he hates America, and he hates law  enforcement. That not popular. That is not going to go over well with large  swaths of the population. And I think Nike has permanently damaged its  brand. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So, you know, here's the thing, Lawrence Jones, there is a  question of do millennials like this, is the Nike playing to millennials,  that millennial like to protest according to polls. I mean, one marketing  group says Nike got tens of millions of dollars worth of free media  exposure.</p><p> But here's the other side of that, Lawrence. Critics say Nike is charging  $100 plus for fancy sneakers made by poor workers in Asia earning a lot low  pay, it then uses the profit to pay millions to athletes like LeBron James  or Kaepernick. Your take in all of this. </p><p> LAWRENCE JONES, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes, Liz. This is complicated  because I have conflicting views, on one hand you want a private business  to be able to do whatever they want and then suffer the consequences that  may come. But I think when it comes with Nike, I don't even think it about  politics for them, I don't even think they care about social justice, I  think that they just made a business decision, and they felt like getting  behind this Colin Kaepernick movement would somehow benefit them.  Remember  when Colin Kaepernick left the league and he was a superstar at that point,  he was the number one failing jersey at the time because he decided to take  a knee.  </p><p> The men was on the bench was still the number one jersey and so I think  they plan on capitalizing on this, some way, I don't know how it will turn  up even the President of United States, who has been very vocal on this  issue pivoted on this issue, because as he said, Nike pays a lot of rent.   And so he has been more critical in past, but because there a business  investment there, he kind of backed off some of his criticism.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, you know, to Lawrence's point, Michael, Nike, it looks  like making a bet, that its biggest gross market is China, it is Asia, they  don't care about the U.S. protest over there, I mean, 40 percent of Nike's  sale comes from the very (inaudible) of North America and Nike's biggest  athletes in its ads are basketball players like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant  and LeBron James, not football games.  </p><p> JONES:  LeBron James.  </p><p> LEE:  yes, I would say that very conspicuous timing here, this is coming  out the day that tariffs go into effect in China.  A lot of their products  is made over there.  That is the biggest opportunity for growth so a little  bit of anti-American sentiment might go a long way to sell some more  sneakers over there.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Mike and Lawrence, you had been great tonight.  Thank you so  much for coming in.  </p><p> JONES:  Thank you, Liz.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.  We are staying on this story about the anti-Trump  resistance movement in the White House that is allegedly anonymous.   Current senior Trump official in the White House writing a New York Times  Op-ed, saying he is working against President Trump.  This is a story that  is now being questioned, because who exactly is the author.  And why did  the Times run an anonymous opinion piece?  We are staying on this for you.  </p><p> But first, an exclusive one-on-one interview with Uber's new CEO is next,  coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, we have an exciting exclusive interview coming up.  Our  own Susan Li sat down with Uber's new boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, who is now  in the fight of his life.  He has to clean up Uber's toxic image, just one  of the scandals we give any executive a cold sweat.  Hundreds of thousands  of customers deleting Uber's app and protest over its pricing.  Uber's  Freight House executive culture leaning to charges, and settlements for  alleged sexual harassment and discrimination and cities like New York and  London blocking Uber drivers, Uber testing of a self-driving car also  killed a pedestrian, Susan Lee is all over the story.  You know, Uber,  still had the biggest fight of his life.  Are they kind of prove to Wall  Street that can be profitable?  This is a story filled with scandal.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESSES:  There is a lot of different angles to it and  Dara has been in job for one year.  Just one year, 12 months and he had a  lot to fix.  Today in midtown Manhattan it was all about safety that is the  focus, that is what they are here to do, there are some new safety features  that includes tracking your ride.  If it takes a little bit longer to get  there, if you make an executive stops, Uber will now check in, that is what  they call the new ride check in feature.  Also they are going to make it  your locations, your drop off, your phone numbers anonymous, so that means  drivers cannot tell where you are going, they can't reach you in the  future.  But yes, we talked about IPO, we talked about liberal bias.  And  let's listen in to -- first of all his thoughts on this new safety  features.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO)  </p><p> DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, CEO, UBER:  When you have 15 million trips on a daily  basis on a global platform, such as ours.  The vast majority of time is  everything is OK. But once in a while something happens, and we as a  company leadership got together last year and we declared that safety is  going to be top priority for us as a company in 2018.  </p><p> LI:  Why.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Frankly beyond -- because safety is universal, because  anyone who is at home or they are home or going to a ball game or going to  work, you want to feel safe.  And we believe that we can use the power of  technology and the innovation that we have brought to bear to  revolutionized transportation to make Uber the safest transportation  platform on earth.  And what you are seeing is very early in the game.   But, features such as 911 button that location aware so that 911 dispatch  can react to anything that might happen incredibly quickly with a huge  determine and success or failure.  Trust the contact, tracking where you  are going, and improve background checks and continuous background checks  as well, both available for riders and drivers.  </p><p> And now some of the new future, that were introducing privacy, for example,  you may not want a driver partner to know the exact address where you are  dropped off, because that is something private, location information is  incredibly important, we have masked that, and we masked your phone number  if you ever speak to your driver partner and then we have introduced some  really cool wiz ban technology, where we know where you started, we know  where you ended, we know how long your trip should take, and if for some  reason your trip is taking longer than it should, we will send you a  notification to make sure that you are OK, and in some cases, we can  actually detect an accident, if it ever happens to again make sure the  rider and driver partner are OK too.  </p><p> LI:  You are mining a lot of data off of driver and the passenger's  smartphone, in terms of speed, where they are going, how do you assure that  user data is safe?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I think it is a great question.  We made very significant  investments in data privacy, we do know a lot of data about payment  information and location information, but the religion, at Uber is that we  are going to use that information for you the rider or the driver.  So, for  example, in the morning now my (inaudible) that in mornings I go to work,  so it is one click.  It is one click, we have an idea where you are going,  but ultimately we're not selling data, we don't have any advertising, et  cetera.  So ultimately the use of data is to make life easier for you, to  make it faster, to make it more affordable, and now, to make riding on an  Uber safe as possible we can.  </p><p> LI:  So, you are celebrating your one near anniversary as CEO.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Yes I am.  I made it.  </p><p> LI:  You made it.  That is very true, now people want to know, are you  still sticking with your timeline of an IPO in perhaps 2019, because you  are new CFO who will start in a few days.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I would be starting next week, yes.  </p><p> LI:  Nelson, he says he is not on board yet though for 2019 Mustang.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I would expect nothing less of Nelson, he is independent  minded, he is rigorous, and so far he is on the outside, so I think, I  absolutely want Nelson to come in and I think that when he sees all of the  work that the teams are doing, I think that he will agree that we're ready  for a 2019 IPO, there is a bunch of systems first that is going on,  financial work that is going on, the company is big enough, the company is  incredibly important to the world.  And we have some incredibly talented  technologists out there, so, I think we are going to be ready, but I  absolutely want that stamp of approval from our CFO.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, there is always a but.  (Inaudible) The thinking on street, if  they IPO before you, they would take up all the IPO capital in the market,  are you concerned?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I'm not concern.  This is Lyft and ourselves are part of a  transportation revolution this is about ultimately ending car ownership,  the transportation market is 6 trillion dollar business, you may think that  Uber's big.  We're 50 billion, we account for less than 1 percent of miles  driven, and really what ourselves and Lyft are trying to do is to break  apart all the use cases of owning a car.  You owned a car, you get to work,  and you owned a car to pick up the kids at school.  You owned a car to get  groceries, etcetera and we're building out services to solve each of those  use cases and ultimately make it unnecessary for you to own a car.  And we  think that there are plenty of companies who can be a part of that  evolution.  I think investors are going to line up behind us and Lyft.  I  certainly hope they are.  </p><p> LI:  Are you guarantee a 2019 IPO?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Well, there is no guarantee, you don't know what the market  is doing.  I can guarantee that we'll be ready, hopefully markets will be  ready for us.  </p><p> LI:  So, you talk about how big Uber is and the ride hailing services.   Some say you owned 73 percent of the market, given that the U.S. President  has talked about anti-trust situation with big tech company, Google, Amazon  and Facebook.  Do you think that big tech company like Uber may be  regulated in the future?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Listen, we're regulated now.  We work in every single city  and et cetera.  We look at market as 6 trillion dollar transportation  market, we're a tiny, tiny, tiny part of the market, and we account for  less than 1 percent of miles driven on the road.  So, I think Uber can be  ultimately 20, sounds bigger than it is today.  </p><p> LI:  So, no fear of being broken up at all?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  No fear of being broken up and listen, I think that  ultimately, regulators are our partners, you know, we work with -- we  operate on the streets of New York City and while we may not agree on  everything, ultimately we think that we as a transportation service are  incredibly valuable for every city around.  And that ultimately we have a  be partners in building this solution together.  It takes dialogue,  sometimes you agree, sometimes you don't agree, but we think that  opportunity is enormous, and we think there is a need for rider and drivers  around all around the world for or service.  </p><p> LI:  Well, talking with our audience, you know, there has been a lot of  concern of political bias in Silicon Valley.  There are giants, respectable  (inaudible) at Silicon Valley, so I have to ask you this question,  President Trump thinks that there is a liberal bias in Silicon Valley with  big tech companies, employees of big tech companies, and so that they feel  that their conservatives voices have been silenced.  You think that is  true?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I guarantee that your wait times for your Uber are going to  be equal whether you're Republican or not or Democrat.  I don't think -- I  think that biases, if there's a bias, I don't think that is a bias on  purpose.  We as a company's leadership team have been trained on biases as  well.  There are some implicit policies that you may not be aware of as a  person and I think awareness is step one.  So I don't think that there's  any bias on purpose, but if you have a bunch of like-minded people building  product, you may get product that straight one or the other.  That's one  for sample from our standpoint, we want to have more women.  We want to  have more underrepresented people working as engineers and product people  and have representation at all parts of our company so that the products  that were building reflect our driver partners in our rider partners and  aren't with any biases that were not aware of.  So, listen, we are human,  all of this is vulnerable.  I think that all of these companies are trying  to do the right thing, but they got some learning to do.  And I think the  way that they operate going forward have to change.  </p><p> LI:  Dara, thank you so much.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I appreciate it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO)  </p><p> MACDONALD:  that was a great interview.  Are they going to go public?  Uber  is going public?  </p><p> LI:  I would be surprised if they did not.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Next year.  </p><p> LI:  Next year 2019.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Wow.  Great interview, Susan.  Thanks for bringing it to us.  </p><p> LI:  Thank you.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.  We're staying on this anti-Trump resistant movement in the  White House, it has been somewhere in the executive branch, we don't know  if it is in the White House, is some of the executive branch.  Stay with us  here for time of the anonymous op-ed story for you.  Kayleigh Mcenany is  coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York Times\"  has an anonymous editorial, can you believe it?  Anonymous.  Meaning  gutless.  Gutless editorial.  We're doing a great job, the poll numbers  through the roof, our poll numbers are great, and guess what nobody is  going to come close to beating me in 2020, because of what we've done.  We  have done more than anybody ever thought possible in -- it is not even two  years, so thank you very much, appreciate it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MACDONALD:  That was President Trump, just moments ago refuting \"New York  Times\" anonymous op-ed from someone allegedly in the administration said  that person and others are working against the President.  The op-ed writer  say and we had identify him as a he.  Actually New York Times did in a  tweet saying he is a he, quote, I am part of the resistance under the Trump  administration and said they work for President, and they unlike my  colleagues and have vowed to thwart parts of President Trump's agenda and  his worse quote, his worse inclination.  Let us get RNC spokesperson,  Kayleigh Mcenany joins me now, over the phone, Kayleigh what do you hear  from your people on who they think wrote it?  </p><p> KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON:  Hi, Liz.   Great to join you, I don't think there is any indication at-this-point as  who wrote it -- who wrote the op-ed, but I can give you a description of  them, he is a coward.  He is an absolute coward to leak in this fashion, to  write anonymously in this fashion, to come out and say that he wants this  agenda and this administration to succeed and write an op-ed.  In direct  contradiction of anything that would behoove this administration.  This  person called himself an unsung hero, I don't know who he is, but he is a  coward, he is very far from an unsung hero.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know Kayleigh, the debate now is up though New York Times  and the Washington Post or another news outlet would run it but here -- I  want you reaction to this.  Some are very unimpressed by this.  Walter  Schaub, he is a former director of the office of Government ethics.  He  said this op-ed is ridiculous on so many levels.  We now present an opinion  piece with no substantive content by an anonymous contributor who no  employer should ever trust again.  Your reaction.  </p><p> MCENANY:  Yes, he is absolutely spot on here.  What a great mistake by the  New York Time, the media and newspaper are already out of his story low and  trustworthiness among the American people.  In fact they hit their lowest  approval rating in the history of Gallup asking the question.  But for the  New York Times to run with a fake news story from a fake news source, we  don't even know if this individual really exists, this is a big hit to  their credibility, President talks about making up sources, well this  certainly looks a lot like that.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Walter Shaub of the government ethics former official  satirize this op-ed saying, dear America, in other words, this is the tone  of the anonymous op-ed, quote dear America, this administration is  wonderful but I'm trying to so sabotage from the inside also be super  afraid and no you owe me.  Your take.  </p><p> MCENANY:  Yes.  That is right, this is a quiet resistant on how it is  described, from inside the administration, their goal to frustrate part of  the agenda is what he said frustrate parts of the agenda.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  We have to leave it there, Kayleigh, sorry, we had a hard  break.  Kayleigh Mcenany weighing in.  We will have Kayleigh on soon on  another show.  More on this story and your money after the break, stay  there </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, how is your money doing today.  Let us take a  check on your money, the markets finishing and here is our finish the DOW  up to 22 points.  Let us get right Nicole Petallides on the floor of the  big board with latest, Nicole.  </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Stocks finished mixed, the DOW is  higher, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ hold back, you saw the worries about trade and  tariffs and emerging market.  And we have job reports on Friday, the NASDAQ  though was a big loser, in fact it got crash on 1.1 percent.  While the  others were not too far off from the unchanged line.  As you look at the  NSADQ, you can break down social media stocks today, as we heard testimony  from Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sandburg from Facebook, and with that this  group got hit hard, we saw Facebook down 2 percent, Twitter down 6 percent.   Snapchat, yelp all lower, some of the others lagers on the NASDAQ, would  also be jd.com micron and PayPal.  Back to you.  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Great to see you Nicole.  We'll be right back with a jam-pack  hour.  We will be right back after the break.  Stay there.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, President Trump just tweeting quote, the failing \"New  York Times\" in response to that anonymous New York Times op-ed.  The  president will be traveling to Montana tomorrow where he plans to host a  Make America Great Again rally in the evening.  He is expected to hold an  official event following that rally.  We will stay on that story for you.   Thank you so much for having us in your home.  It's been a jack-packed  hour.  Thank you so much for watching.  Charles Payne is here now with  Making Money.

Security Council meeting to take on Iran. You heard me right. The U.N., a place that President Trump has blasted for wasteful spending and ineffectiveness. We've got that story.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts right now.</p><p>First to your money, the Dow closing slightly higher, ending the day at 25,974. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P falling. Netflix lead a steep tech sell-off. More on your money in just a second.</p><p>But first to that \"New York Times\" anonymous op-ed, it appears to be written by a male senior official, that's according to the Times Twitter account.</p><p>With me now live from White House is Blake Burman with the latest. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, there, Liz. Don't know exactly who this person is, the New York Times op-ed page in which this article is published, identifies as person as a senior administration official. The title here is, quote, \"I am part of the resistance inside the Trump administration.\"</p><p>When you boil down this op-ed this person says that themselves along with others are working inside the Trump administration to essentially keep it on track as they see it. This is what the senior administration official writes anonymously in this op-ed at one point.</p><p>Quote, speaking of the president, \"The dilemma - which he does not fully grasp, is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclination.\"</p><p>This anonymous senior administration official also goes on to write in that op-ed the following. Quote, \"Given the instability, many witnessed there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25 amendment which would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis, so we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until one way or the other it is over.\"</p><p>We need to point out, Liz, that this person is identified as a senior administration official, so we don't know if that person works within this very White House or if they are an official within the Trump administration somewhere here in Washington D.C.</p><p>The president is here about to speak inside the White House right now, Liz. Let's listen in.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MASSACHUSETTS: Great job, keep up the good work. Thanks, everybody.</p><p>Mr. President, we remember when you first were giving your acceptance speech of the nomination at the GOO convention, you said at that time that one year from now when I take over the White House I am going to reestablish the rule of law in this country, and you have done that, Mr. President. We thank you for that.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you.</p><p>HODGSON: Very, very much.</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you.</p><p>HODGSON: You know, behind me, Mr. President, are 44 sheriffs, who are representing 35 states that came here to Washington for two reasons. The first is to go to Congress to the Capitol today hold a press conference and let Congress know enough is enough.</p><p>We've been for 20 years, asking Congress to move on the security aspects of immigration reform, and nothing has happened for 20 years.</p><p>But what's really amazing, Mr. President, with your strength and purpose the commitment to your convictions you've done more in less than two years in supporting law enforcement and dealing with this illegal immigration problem that we've been asking for solutions on in less than two years.</p><p>And again, all these sheriffs and sheriffs across the nation are grateful to you for that, Mr. President.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>HODGSON: And like so many of the promises that you made, you have come through and the energy that you put behind law enforcement in supporting us on our partnership with 287G, going after MS-13 and getting them out of our neighborhoods, t building the wall, Mr. President, you've really did amazing.</p><p>And so, before I president this plaque I just want to add one thing that maybe you heard about, maybe you didn't. But when we were on the Hill today, we announced that the National Sheriff Association has done a crowd funding page to raise money and mobilize the citizens of this nation to get behind you, to get behind the sheriffs to build this wall.</p><p>So, in having said that, I would like to present this to you, Mr. President, because, it's not surprising for any of the sheriffs who are here, that shortly after you took office, people started saying the citizens and members of the media saying, there is a new sheriff in town.</p><p>And that's an endearing statement, and all these sheriffs know it. Because what it denotes is that there are problems and somebody is coming in that's going to be able to fix those problems. You've done that, Mr. President, we can't thank you enough for your support, you said you have our back. And the sheriffs across this nation, have yours. And God bless you. Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Well, that's really nice. This is an honor because when I was running I think number one on our list of law enforcement, taking care of law enforcement, working with law enforcement.</p><p>And really we have to create guidelines and principles for the incredible job you've done, and you've done an amazing job.</p><p>And I will tell you, a lot of times you are scorned and you are looked at by the media, because the media is very dishonest, much of it in this country, very, very dishonest. And the job that you've done in light of all the things that you have to go through, I guess a little bit like me also, but I will say that you have been really outstanding, incredible people.</p><p>Crime statistics are down. We're really doing well other than you take a couple of places on a nation where they have different policies than we would put, and you know where I'm talking about.</p><p>But there are a couple of places they don't believe in what we believe, but we have together done something very special.</p><p>I also remember so well, sheriff, when we were together, I said we're going to get a lot of military equipment that you weren't able to get and it was sitting in warehouses all over the country.</p><p>And in many cases like in other countries, you remember, and we brought it back home, and you were able to get great military equipment that you couldn't afford to buy in your budgets and we gave it to you and it protected a lot of people.</p><p>We have a lot of people living today in your profession that would not frankly be around right now without the protection of that kind of equipment that we have sitting around, waiting and doing nothing, and just drawing dust.</p><p>So, the fact that you gave me this award is very meaningful. I will put that in a place of great honor in the Oval Office. But I really appreciate it. Thank you very much, it's a great honor. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you, all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you very much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, keep up the good work.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We stand behind you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURMAN: Liz, you are hearing the President of United States at an event with sheriff officers here inside the White House. One of the big question is whether or not the president will answer any questions from the press pool inside that event. Of course the biggest question will be about this New York Times op-ed.</p><p>I'll send it back to you in case you want to (Inaudible) the president.</p><p>MACDONALD: Blake, and we are going to need you to monitor the press pool, we want to know what are the questions, and what the president says about this anonymous bombshell op-ed by a senior White House official.</p><p>Apparently, a man, who is alleging a bunch of things about the president, including that there were early whispers that amongst cabinet members to evoke the 25 amendment to remove President Trump.</p><p>Thank you, Blake. You're going to stay on that story for us throughout the hour.</p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. You read the op-ed. What's your reaction?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well there obviously are substantial forces very close to the president that candidly do not believe he's fit for office. This is calling a bombshell, which is the phrase that you used is actually being charitable.</p><p>I mean, this devastating to the president, the president should have around him people who believe in him and trust him. This is obvious somebody who he thinks believes in him and trust him who has revealed a consensus amongst those around him that question his fitness for office. And it was also revealed that there were serious discussions about the 25th amendment.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, so in the piece, whoever the writer is said we want the administration to succeed. They bring up that the president is in their mind, anti-trade an anti-democratic. They say the root of the problem is the president's immorality he's not more to discern with first principle, and that he acted in a manner detrimental to the health of the Republican.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That is a serious an allegation as could be. That is a code phrase for worthy of impeachment. If he is acting in the opinion of this writer whoever it is.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Acting in a manner injurious to the health of the republic.</p><p>MACDONALD: And as Melissa Francis has said pointed out earlier in the hour, opinions usually, you own the opinion with your name on it. Let's listen to the president.</p><p>TRUMP: -- working today that at any point ever in our history. We've created 400,000 manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest pace in more than 30 years, economic growth last quarter was 4.2 percent.</p><p>And as you people know it was headed down, big, and it was a low number, very low number. It would have been, in my opinion, it would have been less than zero, it was heading to negative numbers.</p><p>New employment claims recently hit a -- think of that. The unemployment picture in the country is the best it has been in 49 years, African- American unemployment is lowest in the history of the country.</p><p>Asian-American unemployment lowest in the history of our country, Hispanic- American unemployment lowest in the history of our country.</p><p>I mean, I'm just looking at this point after point. Under my administration, veteran's unemployment reached its lowest in many years. The -- let's see, almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps just since my election.</p><p>Then you go into all of the benefits that we got from the tax cuts, all of you people benefitted tremendously from the tax cuts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: We're going to regulation cuts, we're going to right to try, right to try is where you have right is if a person is terminally ill you have a right to go and try and see whether or not a drug that's not approved yet can be used. They didn't allow that.</p><p>A point after point we're getting rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing there is in Obamacare. Coming up with new healthcare plans.</p><p>We've never had a period, even if you look at the Olympics, we got the Olympics, the World Cup, you say them, they were in my office, got the World Cup, nobody has -- and we have started the wall. Nobody has ever done in less than a two-year period what we've done.</p><p>So when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration, probably it was failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons, no. And the New York Times is failing. If I weren't here I believe the New York Times probably wouldn't even exist.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: And some day -- and some day when I'm not president, which hopefully will be in about six and a half years from now. The New York Times and CNN, and all of these phony media outlets will be out of business, folks. They'll be out of business because they'll be nothing to write, and they'll be nothing of interest.</p><p>So nobody has been what this administration has done. And I agree, it's different from an agenda which is much different than ours, and it's certainly not your agenda, that I can tell you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.</p><p>TRUMP: It's about open borders, it's about letting people flee into our country, it's about a disaster and crime for our country.</p><p>So, they don't like Donald Trump, and I don't like them, because they are very dishonest people. Remember this also, about the New York Times, when I won they were forced to apologize to their subscribers. They wrote a letter of apology it was the first time anybody has ever done it because they covered the election incorrectly.</p><p>So if the failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial -- can you believe it, anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial -- we are doing a great job. The poll numbers are through the roof. Our poll numbers are great.</p><p>And guess what, nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because of what we've done. We've done more than anybody ever thought possible in - - it's not even two years. So thank you very much. We appreciate it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. That was President Trump taking on directly this anonymous op-ed in the New York Times that is quoting a senior White House official - - let me back up, it was written by a senior White House official. We at Fox Business believe it a man, according on the New York Times own Twitter account he is identified as a he, the author of this anonymous piece.</p><p>Let's bring the judge back here. You saw the president really going hard at New York Times with his comments that, basically the Times is failing according to his mindset and that it wouldn't exist without him and when he is going to -- he says he is going to be here for six an half more years. And CNN and New York Times may not exist then.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, I thought that his impromptu response now was actually a pretty good one. If he started to go through line by line the anonymous op- ed a, he is going to give it more credibility than he wants to give it, and b, he is going to find himself going down rabbit holes of attempting to retort anonymous allegations which are incendiary, in which he doesn't want to give the credence to.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, the other thing the president brought up which is interesting is about the New York Times letter of apology that New York Times wrote to its readers about -- I guess people are trying to contact you about this op-ed that basically--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: This is not from the author of the op-ed. I don't think it is.</p><p>MACDONALD: That is, it looks like I'm looking at the New York Times apology letter to readers after the election. Basically, the New York Times is taking accountability for the coverage, because they too were surprised that Trump won. What do you make of President Trump bringing up the Times apology letter to readers there?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, it's the Trump strategy, go on the offensive, he is not going to dignify this op-ed piece or New York Times by going through it line by line, he is going to attack the messenger here.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Judge--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The 25th amendment is something that in my view can only be invoked if a vice president personally authorizes it, not going to happen.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Wow. We've got an hour of thick and fast breaking news. Judge, thank you so much for your insights here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You're welcome.</p><p>MACDONALD: The anti-Trump resistance movement in the White House. We're staying on story of this anonymous current senior Trump official in the White House writing that New York Times op-ed. We're going to have more on that story after the break, stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Moments ago, addressing that anonymous New York Times op-ed by a senior official within the administration while talking with the nation's sheriffs at White House.</p><p>Let's talk more with the judge more about what happened with that op-ed. It says a senior official, that's a pretty elastic term. It could be anybody in the executive branch.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right. As our colleague Blake Burman just pointed out, it could be anybody in the executive branch which means all around the world. You're talking about the diplomatic correlate the military, the State Department, it sounds to me. And I read this now three or four times as though it's somebody who works daily with the president and interacts with them daily, which means somebody in the West Wing.</p><p>But I don't want to begin speculation because the speculation I could tell you from my iPhone is rampant with proper names in there and I'm not going to go because it's just speculation.</p><p>But it does sound as though this is a human being that knows the president well and interacts with him on a daily basis.</p><p>MACDONALD: You said it's the one two punch because we have a Bob Woodward book coming out.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, the Bob Woodward book is been excerpted in the Washington Post. He is an editor and a reporter for the Washington Post with two Pulitzer Prizes who notoriously tape records every conversation he has every interview that he has.</p><p>MACDONALD: Currently there are recording for that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct. So the one-two punch is the Washington Post and the New York Times same time same subject, same week. This is more ganging up on a president than they did on Richard Nixon. And as I said before--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: And have you ever seen an anonymous op-ed.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: No, I've never seen or heard of an anonymous op-ed which means the New York Times wants to keep this person employed there. So this person can be a source for them as this person obviously was in tomorrow's paper.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's an interesting take on it. Yes. So, here's the thing. We may have New York Times reporter trying to crack and find out who this person is.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: What if the New York Times would let its own reporters figure out who this person is.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. All right. Gang, in the control room where fast and thick news breaking in this hour. Do we want to get the judge's reaction on Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>So, let's -- I want your reaction to the sound bite, judge. Let's watch what happened at that Judge Kavanaugh's hearing today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Justice Jackson--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ask them to suspend.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Your reaction to the protest and disruption.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The protest and distraction are a sideshow. The senators didn't lay a glove on him today. They attempted to but they didn't. Now much of the questioning was boring. Some of that was highly academic and really into the weeds except for people that monitor the stuff.</p><p>But politically speaking, the consensus is he's worthy of confirmation and will more likely than not receive it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Judge Napolitano, thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You're welcome.</p><p>MACDONALD: Really rolling with the breaking news with us. OK. We've got this story for you coming up. Despite fans threat to boycott, Nike is doubling down on Colin Kaepernick. The new ad will air tomorrow night at the launch of the NFL season. It isn't just do it ad campaign. It is coming tomorrow night. We're going to have that debate coming up after the break. Stay there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COLIN KAEPERNICK, FORMER NFL PLAYER: MACDONALD: Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything.</p><p>When they talk about the greatest team in the history of the sport, make sure it's your team.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. That's just part of Nike's new just do it ad campaign, featuring Colin Kaepernick. It is set to debut during the NFL season open tomorrow night. It's featuring athletes who have overcome adversity.</p><p>Now social justice warrior Kaepernick he launched the anthem protest by first taking a knee. Nike's stock took a knee too, a loss nearly $4 billion in market value after this ad news broke under threats of boycotts from customers.</p><p>The tag line sacrificing everything now also being criticized. Here are the facts. Kaepernick earned $43 million from the NFL, millions more coming his way from this new advertising campaign.</p><p>Now Colin Kaepernick has not played in two years, he is suing the NFL for alleged collusion, claiming no team will hire him. The NFL offering a measured response ahead of tomorrow's kick-off. Saying quote, \"The social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised have deserve our attention and action.\"</p><p>Now a new report says Nike stock may drop further, maybe 10 percent due to these ads.</p><p>Let's take it up with Investmark Advisory Group principal, Michael Lee, and conservative commentator, Lawrence Jones. Mike, Nike specifically decided to hire Kaepernick not for his athleticism but for his political views. What does that mean for Nike's bottom line that it is now face of NFL national anthem protest?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PRINCIPAL, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP: So, Nike just decided to get political, not only get political, they decided to shove a certain brand of politics down everyone's throat.</p><p>I do not think this is a good decision for any corporation regardless of the politics. Colin Kaepernick has every right to be a social justice warrior, to kneel during the anthem.</p><p>But let's face it. His politics are that he hates America, and he hates law enforcement. That not popular. That is not going to go over well with large swaths of the population. And I think Nike has permanently damaged its brand.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, you know, here's the thing, Lawrence Jones, there is a question of do millennials like this, is the Nike playing to millennials, that millennial like to protest according to polls. I mean, one marketing group says Nike got tens of millions of dollars worth of free media exposure.</p><p>But here's the other side of that, Lawrence. Critics say Nike is charging $100 plus for fancy sneakers made by poor workers in Asia earning a lot low pay, it then uses the profit to pay millions to athletes like LeBron James or Kaepernick. Your take in all of this.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Yes, Liz. This is complicated because I have conflicting views, on one hand you want a private business to be able to do whatever they want and then suffer the consequences that may come. But I think when it comes with Nike, I don't even think it about politics for them, I don't even think they care about social justice, I think that they just made a business decision, and they felt like getting behind this Colin Kaepernick movement would somehow benefit them. Remember when Colin Kaepernick left the league and he was a superstar at that point, he was the number one failing jersey at the time because he decided to take a knee.</p><p>The men was on the bench was still the number one jersey and so I think they plan on capitalizing on this, some way, I don't know how it will turn up even the President of United States, who has been very vocal on this issue pivoted on this issue, because as he said, Nike pays a lot of rent. And so he has been more critical in past, but because there a business investment there, he kind of backed off some of his criticism.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, you know, to Lawrence's point, Michael, Nike, it looks like making a bet, that its biggest gross market is China, it is Asia, they don't care about the U.S. protest over there, I mean, 40 percent of Nike's sale comes from the very (inaudible) of North America and Nike's biggest athletes in its ads are basketball players like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, not football games.</p><p>JONES: LeBron James.</p><p>LEE: yes, I would say that very conspicuous timing here, this is coming out the day that tariffs go into effect in China. A lot of their products is made over there. That is the biggest opportunity for growth so a little bit of anti-American sentiment might go a long way to sell some more sneakers over there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Mike and Lawrence, you had been great tonight. Thank you so much for coming in.</p><p>JONES: Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. We are staying on this story about the anti-Trump resistance movement in the White House that is allegedly anonymous. Current senior Trump official in the White House writing a New York Times Op-ed, saying he is working against President Trump. This is a story that is now being questioned, because who exactly is the author. And why did the Times run an anonymous opinion piece? We are staying on this for you.</p><p>But first, an exclusive one-on-one interview with Uber's new CEO is next, coming up.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, we have an exciting exclusive interview coming up. Our own Susan Li sat down with Uber's new boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, who is now in the fight of his life. He has to clean up Uber's toxic image, just one of the scandals we give any executive a cold sweat. Hundreds of thousands of customers deleting Uber's app and protest over its pricing. Uber's Freight House executive culture leaning to charges, and settlements for alleged sexual harassment and discrimination and cities like New York and London blocking Uber drivers, Uber testing of a self-driving car also killed a pedestrian, Susan Lee is all over the story. You know, Uber, still had the biggest fight of his life. Are they kind of prove to Wall Street that can be profitable? This is a story filled with scandal.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESSES: There is a lot of different angles to it and Dara has been in job for one year. Just one year, 12 months and he had a lot to fix. Today in midtown Manhattan it was all about safety that is the focus, that is what they are here to do, there are some new safety features that includes tracking your ride. If it takes a little bit longer to get there, if you make an executive stops, Uber will now check in, that is what they call the new ride check in feature. Also they are going to make it your locations, your drop off, your phone numbers anonymous, so that means drivers cannot tell where you are going, they can't reach you in the future. But yes, we talked about IPO, we talked about liberal bias. And let's listen in to -- first of all his thoughts on this new safety features.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, CEO, UBER: When you have 15 million trips on a daily basis on a global platform, such as ours. The vast majority of time is everything is OK. But once in a while something happens, and we as a company leadership got together last year and we declared that safety is going to be top priority for us as a company in 2018.</p><p>LI: Why.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: Frankly beyond -- because safety is universal, because anyone who is at home or they are home or going to a ball game or going to work, you want to feel safe. And we believe that we can use the power of technology and the innovation that we have brought to bear to revolutionized transportation to make Uber the safest transportation platform on earth. And what you are seeing is very early in the game. But, features such as 911 button that location aware so that 911 dispatch can react to anything that might happen incredibly quickly with a huge determine and success or failure. Trust the contact, tracking where you are going, and improve background checks and continuous background checks as well, both available for riders and drivers.</p><p>And now some of the new future, that were introducing privacy, for example, you may not want a driver partner to know the exact address where you are dropped off, because that is something private, location information is incredibly important, we have masked that, and we masked your phone number if you ever speak to your driver partner and then we have introduced some really cool wiz ban technology, where we know where you started, we know where you ended, we know how long your trip should take, and if for some reason your trip is taking longer than it should, we will send you a notification to make sure that you are OK, and in some cases, we can actually detect an accident, if it ever happens to again make sure the rider and driver partner are OK too.</p><p>LI: You are mining a lot of data off of driver and the passenger's smartphone, in terms of speed, where they are going, how do you assure that user data is safe?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I think it is a great question. We made very significant investments in data privacy, we do know a lot of data about payment information and location information, but the religion, at Uber is that we are going to use that information for you the rider or the driver. So, for example, in the morning now my (inaudible) that in mornings I go to work, so it is one click. It is one click, we have an idea where you are going, but ultimately we're not selling data, we don't have any advertising, et cetera. So ultimately the use of data is to make life easier for you, to make it faster, to make it more affordable, and now, to make riding on an Uber safe as possible we can.</p><p>LI: So, you are celebrating your one near anniversary as CEO.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: Yes I am. I made it.</p><p>LI: You made it. That is very true, now people want to know, are you still sticking with your timeline of an IPO in perhaps 2019, because you are new CFO who will start in a few days.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I would be starting next week, yes.</p><p>LI: Nelson, he says he is not on board yet though for 2019 Mustang.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I would expect nothing less of Nelson, he is independent minded, he is rigorous, and so far he is on the outside, so I think, I absolutely want Nelson to come in and I think that when he sees all of the work that the teams are doing, I think that he will agree that we're ready for a 2019 IPO, there is a bunch of systems first that is going on, financial work that is going on, the company is big enough, the company is incredibly important to the world. And we have some incredibly talented technologists out there, so, I think we are going to be ready, but I absolutely want that stamp of approval from our CFO.</p><p>LI: Yes, there is always a but. (Inaudible) The thinking on street, if they IPO before you, they would take up all the IPO capital in the market, are you concerned?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I'm not concern. This is Lyft and ourselves are part of a transportation revolution this is about ultimately ending car ownership, the transportation market is 6 trillion dollar business, you may think that Uber's big. We're 50 billion, we account for less than 1 percent of miles driven, and really what ourselves and Lyft are trying to do is to break apart all the use cases of owning a car. You owned a car, you get to work, and you owned a car to pick up the kids at school. You owned a car to get groceries, etcetera and we're building out services to solve each of those use cases and ultimately make it unnecessary for you to own a car. And we think that there are plenty of companies who can be a part of that evolution. I think investors are going to line up behind us and Lyft. I certainly hope they are.</p><p>LI: Are you guarantee a 2019 IPO?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: Well, there is no guarantee, you don't know what the market is doing. I can guarantee that we'll be ready, hopefully markets will be ready for us.</p><p>LI: So, you talk about how big Uber is and the ride hailing services. Some say you owned 73 percent of the market, given that the U.S. President has talked about anti-trust situation with big tech company, Google, Amazon and Facebook. Do you think that big tech company like Uber may be regulated in the future?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: Listen, we're regulated now. We work in every single city and et cetera. We look at market as 6 trillion dollar transportation market, we're a tiny, tiny, tiny part of the market, and we account for less than 1 percent of miles driven on the road. So, I think Uber can be ultimately 20, sounds bigger than it is today.</p><p>LI: So, no fear of being broken up at all?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: No fear of being broken up and listen, I think that ultimately, regulators are our partners, you know, we work with -- we operate on the streets of New York City and while we may not agree on everything, ultimately we think that we as a transportation service are incredibly valuable for every city around. And that ultimately we have a be partners in building this solution together. It takes dialogue, sometimes you agree, sometimes you don't agree, but we think that opportunity is enormous, and we think there is a need for rider and drivers around all around the world for or service.</p><p>LI: Well, talking with our audience, you know, there has been a lot of concern of political bias in Silicon Valley. There are giants, respectable (inaudible) at Silicon Valley, so I have to ask you this question, President Trump thinks that there is a liberal bias in Silicon Valley with big tech companies, employees of big tech companies, and so that they feel that their conservatives voices have been silenced. You think that is true?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I guarantee that your wait times for your Uber are going to be equal whether you're Republican or not or Democrat. I don't think -- I think that biases, if there's a bias, I don't think that is a bias on purpose. We as a company's leadership team have been trained on biases as well. There are some implicit policies that you may not be aware of as a person and I think awareness is step one. So I don't think that there's any bias on purpose, but if you have a bunch of like-minded people building product, you may get product that straight one or the other. That's one for sample from our standpoint, we want to have more women. We want to have more underrepresented people working as engineers and product people and have representation at all parts of our company so that the products that were building reflect our driver partners in our rider partners and aren't with any biases that were not aware of. So, listen, we are human, all of this is vulnerable. I think that all of these companies are trying to do the right thing, but they got some learning to do. And I think the way that they operate going forward have to change.</p><p>LI: Dara, thank you so much.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I appreciate it.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>MACDONALD: that was a great interview. Are they going to go public? Uber is going public?</p><p>LI: I would be surprised if they did not.</p><p>MACDONALD: Next year.</p><p>LI: Next year 2019.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow. Great interview, Susan. Thanks for bringing it to us.</p><p>LI: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. We're staying on this anti-Trump resistant movement in the White House, it has been somewhere in the executive branch, we don't know if it is in the White House, is some of the executive branch. Stay with us here for time of the anonymous op-ed story for you. Kayleigh Mcenany is coming up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The failing \"New York Times\" has an anonymous editorial, can you believe it? Anonymous. Meaning gutless. Gutless editorial. We're doing a great job, the poll numbers through the roof, our poll numbers are great, and guess what nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020, because of what we've done. We have done more than anybody ever thought possible in -- it is not even two years, so thank you very much, appreciate it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: That was President Trump, just moments ago refuting \"New York Times\" anonymous op-ed from someone allegedly in the administration said that person and others are working against the President. The op-ed writer say and we had identify him as a he. Actually New York Times did in a tweet saying he is a he, quote, I am part of the resistance under the Trump administration and said they work for President, and they unlike my colleagues and have vowed to thwart parts of President Trump's agenda and his worse quote, his worse inclination. Let us get RNC spokesperson, Kayleigh Mcenany joins me now, over the phone, Kayleigh what do you hear from your people on who they think wrote it?</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON: Hi, Liz. Great to join you, I don't think there is any indication at-this-point as who wrote it -- who wrote the op-ed, but I can give you a description of them, he is a coward. He is an absolute coward to leak in this fashion, to write anonymously in this fashion, to come out and say that he wants this agenda and this administration to succeed and write an op-ed. In direct contradiction of anything that would behoove this administration. This person called himself an unsung hero, I don't know who he is, but he is a coward, he is very far from an unsung hero.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know Kayleigh, the debate now is up though New York Times and the Washington Post or another news outlet would run it but here -- I want you reaction to this. Some are very unimpressed by this. Walter Schaub, he is a former director of the office of Government ethics. He said this op-ed is ridiculous on so many levels. We now present an opinion piece with no substantive content by an anonymous contributor who no employer should ever trust again. Your reaction.</p><p>MCENANY: Yes, he is absolutely spot on here. What a great mistake by the New York Time, the media and newspaper are already out of his story low and trustworthiness among the American people. In fact they hit their lowest approval rating in the history of Gallup asking the question. But for the New York Times to run with a fake news story from a fake news source, we don't even know if this individual really exists, this is a big hit to their credibility, President talks about making up sources, well this certainly looks a lot like that.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Walter Shaub of the government ethics former official satirize this op-ed saying, dear America, in other words, this is the tone of the anonymous op-ed, quote dear America, this administration is wonderful but I'm trying to so sabotage from the inside also be super afraid and no you owe me. Your take.</p><p>MCENANY: Yes. That is right, this is a quiet resistant on how it is described, from inside the administration, their goal to frustrate part of the agenda is what he said frustrate parts of the agenda.</p><p>MACDONALD: We have to leave it there, Kayleigh, sorry, we had a hard break. Kayleigh Mcenany weighing in. We will have Kayleigh on soon on another show. More on this story and your money after the break, stay there</p><p>MACDONALD: You know what, how is your money doing today. Let us take a check on your money, the markets finishing and here is our finish the DOW up to 22 points. Let us get right Nicole Petallides on the floor of the big board with latest, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Stocks finished mixed, the DOW is higher, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ hold back, you saw the worries about trade and tariffs and emerging market. And we have job reports on Friday, the NASDAQ though was a big loser, in fact it got crash on 1.1 percent. While the others were not too far off from the unchanged line. As you look at the NSADQ, you can break down social media stocks today, as we heard testimony from Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sandburg from Facebook, and with that this group got hit hard, we saw Facebook down 2 percent, Twitter down 6 percent. Snapchat, yelp all lower, some of the others lagers on the NASDAQ, would also be jd.com micron and PayPal. Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you Nicole. We'll be right back with a jam-pack hour. We will be right back after the break. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, President Trump just tweeting quote, the failing \"New York Times\" in response to that anonymous New York Times op-ed. The president will be traveling to Montana tomorrow where he plans to host a Make America Great Again rally in the evening. He is expected to hold an official event following that rally. We will stay on that story for you. Thank you so much for having us in your home. It's been a jack-packed hour. Thank you so much for watching. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money. Take it away Charles.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, MAKING MONEY THE FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Thank you very much E-mac. And good evening. I'm Charles Payne.

Well, we wish Tesla the very best. Thanks, gang. Bulls and Bears.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We don't like it. I believe they'll be opening up something else. I was very tough. I spoke with her when I heard they were closing. And I said, you know, this company has done a lot for General Motors. You better get back in there soon. That's Ohio. And you better get back in there soon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, we have a lot of pressure on them. You have senators, you have a lot of other people, a lot of pressure. They say the Chevy Cruise is not selling well. I said well, they get somebody -- get a car that is selling well and put it back in. So, I think you are going to see something else happen there, but I'm not happy about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: President Trump fighting to protect U.S. jobs, slamming General Motors over its new plan to lay off thousands of workers and close multiple factories. We've got the details straightening out the media hysteria now trying to politicize this one. Big hint. It potentially involves a let's make a deal throwdown from G.M. on tariffs. We've got the story.</p><p>To big tech now facing big problems at home and abroad. Facebook under historic pressure in the U.K. The Brits now say they do not believe Mark Zuckerberg anymore as the U.K. parliament seizes Facebook and Zuckerberg's private company e-mails. And they urge corporate boycotts.</p><p>Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn, she's fired up and ready to go on that one. And how President Trump was right about both Facebook and Google.</p><p>To Nancy Pelosi now facing a raucous, contentious vote Democrat leadership vote this week. Her first fight with President Trump is here. A possible government shutdown over the border wall. Matt Schlapp weighs on that.</p><p>And the big weakness in the Democrat Party that Trump can capitalize on. The Ukraine just declared martial law after a Russia fired on its navy ships over the weekend wounding several sailors. This after Ukrainian protesters swarmed the Russian consulate over the weekend. We've got General Jack Keane on that, coming up.</p><p>To President Trump threatening to shut the border permanently as Democrat Maxine Waters now tries to claim the border crisis is just a political stunt by President Trump. This, as border officials now say migrants purposely used women and children as human shields as migrants threw rocks at border agents.</p><p>We've got that and news on secret government documents showing how bad the crime really was pouring over the border during the Obama years. You will not believe the new numbers. We take that on.</p><p>And Republicans undercutting a defiant James Comey. Saying Comey is basically doing fake grandstanding about resisting a subpoena for closed- door testimony next week. Judge Napolitano joins us to explain and the common-sense solution to all that.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics, we're going to bring you the debate beyond tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now.</p><p>Welcome to the show. You're watching the Fox Business Network.</p><p>President Trump pushing back hard on General Motors today after G.M. said it may lay off up to 14,800 jobs in North America including jobs in the big swing state of Ohio. The UAW, the big labor union agrees with Trump, so does Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is here with more. Edward, here's the back story. The UAW union labor contract with G.M. expires next year. G.M. does not want a labor union strike. So, this could be a bargaining throw down by General Motors to get Trump to dial back on the tariffs. The White House already said it could give a waiver to save jobs for other companies when it granted waivers on steel tariffs to seven big corporations.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: To you, what do you say, Edward?</p><p>LAWRENCE: Well, you know, G.M., though, the cars haven't been selling as well as Ford, too. It comes down to sales too. But it could be a little of all of that mixed in here. The labor unions and automakers have always been at odds over and over and over again. And G.M. did not have a great deal the last time around for its investors. They're trying to get a better deal going forward.</p><p>But, again, it also boils down to sales. Now isn't it funny though, Liz, how some of these decisions by automakers bring political opponents together. You mention all of these folks in the same sentence supporting President Trump to get back into Ohio.</p><p>Well, the announcement shocks and many sent ripples to the White House today while President Donald Trump says he will pressure G.M. to bring those jobs back to Ohio. He says that he told the G.M. CEO, Mary Barra to get back into Ohio.</p><p>Barra met White House adviser or economic adviser Larry Kudlow today. And this is part of the pressure now to get G.M. to reconsider closing seven plants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I spoke with her when I heard they were closing and I said, you know, this one country has done a lot for General Motors. You better get back in there soon. That's Ohio. And you better get back in there soon.</p><p>So, we have a lot of pressure on them. You have senators, you have a lot of other people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now four factories in the U.S. and one in Canada could be closed by the end of 2019. The other two are outside North America. The plant closing in Ohio specifically angered the president and shocked Ohio Senator Rob Portman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO: General Motors has let down those workers who have done so much for General Motors. I'm disappointed on that. What I said several months ago to G.M., and again more recently, a couple of months ago in meetings with their CEO and in discussions with their executive is we need another product.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now Ohio is crucial for the 2020 presidential race. The president has made it a priority to help people especially there get back to work. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you, Edward. To our viewers, the issue is whether G.M. could retool U.S. factories to build SUVs and trucks. That's the issue too, right, Edward?</p><p>OK. We lost Edward there. We're going to move on.</p><p>Members of the U.K. parliament now urging big companies to boycott advertising on Google and Facebook because these guys still have not stopped terror content and other negative content on their platforms. Companies don't like when their ads to show up next to this content.</p><p>This is also what's happening. There's push back in Canada, Ireland, Argentina, Brazil, Singapore, and Latvia as well against Facebook and social media.</p><p>Let's bring in Tennessee Senator-elect Masha Blackburn. Great to see you, Marsha. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>SEN.-ELECT MARSHA BLACKBURN, (R), TENNESSEE: Good to see you. Thanks.</p><p>MACDONALD: What's your reaction to the story?</p><p>BLACKBURN: It just seems like there is no end to the number of messes that you see Google and Facebook and Twitter and that FAANGS as they are called getting themselves into these days. And I know that they have the ability to do a little bit more policing on their networks that they then they are doing.</p><p>But Liz, they are choosing not to do that. And I think that the American people are getting wise to this. They are tired of the privacy breaches that you are seeing, the invasion of privacy, and the data breaches. And what people want to know is that there is the ability for they themselves to protect their virtual you and protect their sensitive information.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. That's an important point because the pushback is Facebook and other social media, they are collecting data on you that you don't know about.</p><p>You know what's really interesting, Congressman and Senator-elect is that the U.K., the United Kingdom is really pushing back hard, they don't believe Facebook at all and they believe Facebook purposely built and knew about a back door so companies like Cambridge Analytica could get in and take our information. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>BLACKBURN: This is the reason I wrote the BROWSER Act. What you saw in 2015 and 2016 from the Obama administration was trying to put in privacy rules that would only affect your internet service provider and they did not want it to apply to the entire ecosystem.</p><p>Now the U.K. moved forward with some privacy regulations that are more stringent than anything we've considered in the U.S. But here is the thing and the nugget. You, the consumer should have the ability to protect your information and your sensitive data and say you do or do not want that shared. Then for non-sensitive data you should have the ability to say I'm going to opt out and not allow you to gather this information on me.</p><p>What we have seen some of these platforms to do and these are the apps, basically that are not present, if you will, on your screen. They go in they scrape your data.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN: And they pull all that information and then they sell that or they use it for their advertisers and you, the consumer, know nothing about and you can't stop it.</p><p>MACDONALD: And you know Jane Wong, she is a UMass Dartmouth underground, Marsha. She basically reverses engineered apps. She wants to see what they were collecting.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: She discovers shocking new information that we didn't know about, that these apps are actually tracking the cell towers and the Wi-Fi networks near you to find out where you're located, and now Google may track your movement and your behaviors inside your home via Google devices, including that of your children, Marsha.</p><p>BLACKBURN: That's exactly right. And here is the thing about that. Even if your device is not activated, turned off, the SIM card pulled that Google operating system still tracks every single base station that you are passing. And so, they are tracking you. And then also if it is an in-home device that you can say, OK, Google play this or do that it is recording and storing all of that and other conversation bits and pieces.</p><p>MACDONALD: It is unbelievable. We thought big brother--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN: Unbelievable.</p><p>MACDONALD: We thought big brother was in government. It's in Silicon Valley. Senator-elect--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN: Well, that's right.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn, it's been great to see you have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us. I appreciate it.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now is the time to break up big tech monopoly on things like that and public discourse. Let's bring in Reason magazine staff editor Robby Soave, and business attorney and tech expert, Domenic Romano. Domenic, what do you think.</p><p>DOMENIC ROMANO, BUSINESS ATTORNEY: I agree with Senator-elect Blackburn. I think a surgical approach is necessary. I don't think these companies can be trusted to regulate themselves. You know, they say the superpower, absolute power corrupts, absolutely, who controls the controllers. It's time for some regulation.</p><p>In fact, Zuckerberg and Cook are asking for that, at least earlier they expressed a willingness for some regulation.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's interesting. Robby, what do you think?</p><p>ROBBY SOAVE, STAFF EDITOR, REASON MAGAZINE: Well, I'm also concerned about privacy but I'm more concerned about the government having access to this information. I don't particularly trust Congress to regulate these companies very well. I don't think they have a strong base of knowledge for how to do so.</p><p>And you know, you can ultimately decide to opt out of some of these services just by not using now. I mean, Facebook is crashing and burning recently because people don't like it. So, there is a, there is a market check on their behavior. The only true monopoly is one actually maintained by the government and I worry that's what could happen inadvertently if we get the government to get involved.</p><p>ROMANO: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: And Robby makes an important point, Domenic. Facebook though does track you even if you unplug Facebook. In other words, Domenic Facebook still follows you around the internet even after you've killed off your Facebook.</p><p>ROMANO: Well, that's the whole point. I think it's an overstatement to say that Facebook is crushed and burned. They've loss the music but still the dominant platform. So, I think it's time to regulate, but it should be surgical, it should be measured. and that it should be very, very limited to start.</p><p>MACDONALD: And Robby, you know, the U.K., the United Kingdom Britain clearly not believing Zuckerberg anymore. They say he may have known about privacy abuses and other problems way earlier than he has said according to e-mails at U.K. parliament has seize. What do you think, Robby?</p><p>SOAVE: Well, that's true, but of course Europe has different laws in some important ways, right. Don't have a First Amendment, they can -- you can be arrested for hate speech there so they take kind of these matters a little differently.</p><p>Look, I just think it's going be quite difficult to put the genie back in the bottle relating to some of these privacy concerns.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>SOAVE: I'm concerned about privacy as well, but these are difficult questions.</p><p>MACDONALD: Robby and Domenic, that's why we want to have you guys back on to talk about it.</p><p>ROMANO: I love to.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's a developing story. Great to see both. Thank you so much.</p><p>ROMANO: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: In other headlines, the Supreme Court is appearing skeptical against Apple in arguments over whether customers of those iPhone apps can actually sue Apple over its potential illegal monopoly on app sales.</p><p>Let's get to black Friday and cyber Monday setting sales records, look at this, MasterCard projecting shoppers spent $23 billion on black Friday. Adobe says shoppers are on track to spend nearly $8 million during today's cyber Monday -- cyber Monday shopping extravaganza.</p><p>And we've got a stunning accomplishment for NASA high- fives all around. The Mars insight Lander successfully touched down on Mars earlier this afternoon. This lander made a 300-million-mile trek to Mars. This is the second U.S. robot to land on the red planet. The first was a curiosity rover in 2012.</p><p>And take a look at this. A brutal fight erupting during last night's football game between the Buffalo Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The brawl ended with running back Leonard Fournette of Jacksonville and the bills shock loss in getting ejected from the game. Fournette has since apologized on Twitter.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump holding not one but two rallies tonight in Mississippi. We're on the ground with the latest from the president.</p><p>Also coming up, a potential government shutdown. The first fight Nancy Pelosi faces as she is expected to win the Democratic House speakership. The election is coming up this Wednesday. We've got all those fights and we're going to show you what is really going on and what is going wrong with the Democrat Party behind the scenes.</p><p>Matta Schlapp, he's here. He is fired up and ready to take it on, next.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back.</p><p>A special Senate election is bringing President Trump to Tupelo, Mississippi. The president will be holding a make America great again rally in support of controversial junior Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith now accused of making racist comments.</p><p>Fox News reporter Kristin Fisher has more. Kristin?</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS REPORTER: Well, Liz, President Trump just wrapped his first of two rallies tonight in Mississippi in support of the Republican candidate in this race Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. You know, the president's track record is pretty good. He proved to be very helpful for all the Republican Senate candidates that he campaigned for earlier this month during the midterms.</p><p>And so, he's really helping that that same strategy is going to work tomorrow right here in Mississippi. Now Mississippi, this is a deep red state, so you might think that the Republican Senate candidate in this race might need any help. But she has come under a lot of heat for a racially tense remark that she made earlier this month.</p><p>She was caught on camera praising a supporter by saying, quote, \"if he invited me to a public hanging I'd be on the front row.\" Now she since apologized, but that remark has been following her nonstop on the campaign trail especially since her Democrat opponent in this race Mike Espy, he's trying to become Mississippi's first black senator since reconstruction.</p><p>He's dealing with his issues though, his baggage from his time in the Clinton administration when he was indicted for accepting improper gifts, though he was later acquitted on all counts.</p><p>And then there's also his more recent lobbying for an African dictator currently on trial for crimes against humanity. So, in the end, this race it is going to all come down to turn out as most elections are on non- election day. It's turned out absolutely key. That's why President Trump is coming here. And why he came here tonight in Tupelo and why he's going to Biloxi in just a few hours.</p><p>He's hoping that all of these folks, all of his supporters that came out to see him tonight he's hoping that they will get out and vote for Cindy Hyde- Smith tomorrow in what is the final Senate race to be decided in 2018. This is it, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Kristin, live in Tupelo, Mississippi. Great to see you, Kristin. Thank you so much. The clock now ticking on Capitol Hill to potential government shutdown over the border and it's unfolding as it is now show time for Nancy Pelosi. She is now set to reclaim her role this Wednesday as House speaker. High-fives there as the Dems did take 40 seats in the House.</p><p>But here's the problem with the Democrats. Massive leadership deterioration. No fresh talent. No fresh leadership, no accountability. Big losses over the last decade at all levels of government.</p><p>Joining me now is the American Conservative Union chair, Matt Schlapp. Great to see you, Matt. Your take here.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: I think the Democrats are in a world of hurt in the House. I think it's very interesting to watch. Nancy Pelosi was always considered the most progressive of progressive. She's from San Francisco. She's always been to the left on every major issue, but now it seems like she's lost the support of some of these new upstarts that just were elected to her caucus majority.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, here's the thing. The House Republicans have term limits on their committees of committee chairs and the chairs of subcommittees. The Democrats do not have that. So, there's no other Democrat running against Pelosi for speaker. What does that tell you about Dem leadership? Some critics say this is insane, Matt, that this is why the Democrat Party has imploded when it comes to leadership.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Well, the other thing is not only do they have these 70-year-olds who are wanting to take all these leadership positions at all these are committee gavels. You know, the other issue that's involved in all this is that you have a fair number of new Democrats who were elected partially on the promise that they wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Now if give Nancy Pelosi a lot of credit. She is arm twisting. She is hammering them. She is pressuring them to vote for her, but many of them in voting for Nancy Pelosi will break a campaign promise and they won -- and many of them won in districts that Republicans previously held.</p><p>So, as a Republican, I'm kind of just enjoying the whole spectacle.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, because Nancy Pelosi hands out the plum committee assignments and then they meet the Democrats of the top leadership, they meet behind closed doors and tell the junior Democrats how to vote.</p><p>Here's the thing, Matt. We saw Democrats Rahm Emanuel, Kirstjen Gillibrand, and Chris Van Hollen quit the House at the first good opportunity because of the sclerotic top-down leadership from Pelosi.</p><p>And here's the thing, Matt. Critics have said if Barack Obama had run for the House, as he did in 2001 and if he won back in 2000, Barack Obama might still be stuck. He might still be stuck trying to advance for--</p><p>SCHLAPP: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: -- trying to get beyond the House energy committee where Bobby Rush his opponent won and that's where he says.</p><p>SCHLAPP: It's a very fair point. Look at all the freshman senators who ran for president, you had people like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, you know, running for president, Rand Paul where they haven't even in the Senate that long on the Republican side.</p><p>The same is true with Barack Obama on the Democratic side. It seems like in politics these days in America you got to go up or you're out. And just hanging around the old phrase used to be, go along to get along and that seems to be dead because if you don't move up you just kind of stuck and when you're in the minority in the Houses as these Republicans are going to realize there is not a whole lot to do, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, let me ask you something. Will the House Republicans get more vocal and will the House Democrats get more vocal? Because if Nancy Pelosi is doing top-down, Nancy Pelosi may realize, she probably realizes, you do need electrifying new leadership to take on a guy like Trump, right?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes, that's exactly right. Look, I think Nancy Pelosi is in a fight here that she might very well win, but she's about yesterday, and I think there's a lot of Democrats in her caucus in the House that realize they got to find a new generation of leadership. And it's going to be very interesting.</p><p>Because let's face it. They elected a lot of new faces. Some of them were very interesting. Some of them don't. Are not that impressive for my point of view, but others are. And it's going to be very interesting to see if they can project a leader who represents these new diverse congresspeople who have been elected all over the country.</p><p>MACDONALD: Smart insights and analysis from Matt Schlapp. We love having you on, Matt. Great to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Thanks.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. We're coming into the bottom of the hour. Coming up, what do taxes and suburban Republican soccer mom have in common a lot. They've got a lot in common. Losing those suburban soccer moms that might be the Republican's biggest fear. We're going to explain that next.</p><p>And later in the show. Ukraine declares martial law after Russia fired on several of its navy ships, wounding numerous sailors. General Jack Keane is here to break it all down. That's up there. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: The Camp Fire in Northern California now contained. But tens of thousands still homeless, plus a number of missing statewide still 296. That is down from about 1,000 people thought to be missing just a few days ago. The death toll statewide hitting 88. Almost 19,000 buildings have been destroyed.</p><p>The scorch land amounts of the size of two Rhode Islands or one Delaware that has been burned in the state of California in his recent spate of fires.</p><p>Joining me now is a vice mayor of Paradise, California. He is Greg Bolin. Your honor, it's so great to have you on the show. It is a world of pain. We were talking about this here at the Fox Business Network.</p><p>And the town of Paradise it's an ashy eerie quiet right now. Can you bring us up to date what's going on?</p><p>GREG BOLIN, VICE MAYOR, PARADISE, CALIFORNIA: Well, right now we just have an army of people up there all doing their best to get through town and start putting power back in and get the water up and running. Our infrastructures just completely gone, so they're just trying to get to resources in there.</p><p>I just talked to someone today, one of the policemen. They have around 25 to 30 cranes in there, removing trees that are damaged or destroyed, and trying to set new poles and get things going again. It's a monumental task, but we've got a lot of people there to move it and make it happen.</p><p>MACDONALD: What is the prognosis for going forward and rebuilding?</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone): Well, that's a great question. I can't say that I've been here before. None of us have been here before. Even the experts are saying this is even new to them. You know, right now, it's one day at a time. The meeting I'm sitting in, they are very happy with their progress. They are moving forward very fast.</p><p>But the size of this thing, it is going to cost -- it will take some time to get it to where people can move back in, even into home that did not get destroyed.</p><p>MACDONALD: Again, people lost -- this is such a painful story. It is absolutely heartbreaking. It is heartache. We are showing images on camera right now of the rescue effort. Looking back, you know, years from now, vice mayor, what will stand out to you when it comes to what happened?</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone): Well, people are lost. We are here -- I'm here at the disaster center right now in Chico. We are meeting people, talking to them, answering what questions we can answer. But you know what, every time I leave here, I am more encouraged than I was before. There is a sense of optimism. They want to move back. They want to build their houses back again and make Paradise better than it was before.</p><p>So, even though the shock is devastating and most of us including myself lost everything we had, I live out of two bags right now, and most of the people in the same way.</p><p>MACDONALD: Vice mayor, you are living out of two bags? Is that what you just said? This is such a devastating situation that can drive people to their knees at night, at home, alone, in the shower, in the hallway. I mean, you're saying now that you're living out of two bags, is that what you just said?</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone): Well, all my possessions are in two bags. Those two bags, that's everything I got. We came out of -- we got what we could. We got some pictures out. But most of our possessions fit in our car.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone): That's the way everybody is. We had to flee and get out of there and we didn't have time to wait. But that's everybody. But you know, it's still amazing to see the optimism. I just got done talking to a guy. He is an elderly person who said, I'm going back, how long before I can start building?</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone): I'm going to be back up there. They want to get back to Paradise. That's home. They want to be back there.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Just be safe. We got to have you guys safe up there. You know, when things break down, humanity steps up. That's the story you just gave us, vice mayor. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone): Keep praying for us.</p><p>MACDONALD: We will.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone): Don't forget about us.</p><p>MACDONALD: We will. Absolutely we will.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone): Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Vice Mayor Greg Bolin of Paradise, California. Switching gears now, the Republicans' biggest fear in 2020 may be losing the Republican suburban soccer mom, those moms always worried about pocketbook issues. They won't be happy about Republicans capping a popular deduction for state and local taxes when they do their tax returns next year, may even lost Republican House seats in the midterms.</p><p>Let's bring in the political panel, Kelsey Harkness with The Daily Signal and look who is here, Democrat strategist Scott Bolden. We welcome you both. Thank you so much.</p><p>SCOTT BOLDEN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Thank you.</p><p>KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR NEWS PRODUCER, THE DAILY SIGNAL: Glad to be here.</p><p>MACDONALD: Kelsey, first to you. Five high tax states actually lost Republican seats in the midterms. What is your take on what is coming when it comes to the salt deductions?</p><p>HARKNESS: I think that tax reform is actually a winning issue for Republicans. I think if Republicans figure out how to communicate, how the tax reform plan has been good for them, and what more they could do if we continue down this path of lowering taxes for every day Americans and businesses to stimulate the economy, I do think it will suit President Trump very well in 2020.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's shift gear here, Scott. Socialist Democrats still talking about free things like Medicare for all. Everybody knows that taxpayers have to put (ph) the bill there. You know, we are not hearing much about from Democrat socialist free college, free college tuition. Why is that, Scott?</p><p>BOLDEN: I'm trying to get over the term socialist Democrats but I'll move on from there. The reality is that we really don't know how to figure out or get people to trust how we pay for one. But secondly, the white working class just simply aren't buying it. Sixty percent of Americans like the idea compared to 38 percent.</p><p>But the reality is it's not selling with that group that we need to pull from Trump in 2020 and bring them back to the -- bring them back to the Democratic Party.</p><p>MACDONALD: Kelsey --</p><p>BOLDEN: Those are two short answers.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, I hear you, Scott. Kelsey, federal aid to colleges has exploded to nearly $160 billion a year, but that has only fueled rampant tuition price hikes. The families out there watching know that. They know that we've also nationalized student loans. Taxpayers are on the hook for that. The more money you give to colleges, the more they raise tuition, Kelsey.</p><p>HARKNESS: Absolutely. College affordability is an issue that all Americans are --</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>HARKNESS: -- concerned about. It is something that moving forward I think Republicans and Democrats could come together, but providing free college is certainly not the answer. That is going to cause more trouble for the country.</p><p>MACDONALD: Scott, I'm so sorry. We ran out of time. Scott, we want to have you back on. Kelsey, too. You guys have been great.</p><p>BOLDEN: Sure.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you so much.</p><p>HARKNESS: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey says he will not agree to closed hearings before Congress next week. He wants a public hearing instead. Republicans say he is doing fake (ph) grandstanding. We've got a common sense fix to stop James Comey here. We bring in Judge Napolitano on that.</p><p>But first, the Ukraine declaring martial law after Vladimir Putin's forces opened fire on Ukrainian navy vessels over the weekend, wounding a number of sailors. Tensions ratcheting up. NATO calling an emergency meeting over this. We are going to tell you what it all means. That's coming up, next.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. The Ukraine declaring martial law today in regions bordering Russia. This after Russian forces opened fire on its naval vessels over the weekend. They seized three of those vessels and left several sailors wounded. NATO calling an emergency meeting, expressing full support of the Ukraine.</p><p>Joining me now, retired four stars army general and Fox News senior strategic analyst General Jack Keane. Great to see you, general.</p><p>JACK KEANE, SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST, FOX NEWS: Yeah, great to see you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: What's your take on the situation because Russia is trying to claim that it was provoked by the Ukraine navy.</p><p>KEANE: That's likely a bald-faced lie, to be frank about it. They lie through their teeth on all of these things. In every incident they have, they always claim that they were provoked and they just had to take action.</p><p>What this is really about, Putin's strategy here, five years after he moved into -- almost five years after he moved in to Crimea and the eastern part of Ukraine, he's already trying to squeeze Ukraine even more economically.</p><p>North of the Kerch Strait where this incident took place is the Sea of Azov. There are two or three ports there in Ukraine that are used to bring out a lot of exports out of that country particularly steel. They move down through the strait in to the Black Sea and then out into the European and global markets.</p><p>Putin, I think, is leading up to squeezing that as much as he possibly can. He doesn't like the fact that Ukraine looks to the west for economic support from the E.U. and also from the United States, and he's trying to continue to discourage that. So that's the strategic thing that's taken place on Putin's part.</p><p>MACDONALD: General, what was your reaction to Democrat Senator Ben Cardin criticizing President Trump today, saying that Trump is helping Vladimir Putin \"weaken the west by threatening NATO?\"</p><p>KEANE: Yeah, I was surprised by that. Senator Cardin is a knowledgeable and respected member of the Senate. I agree with the statement that Putin's strategy is to weaken the transatlantic alliance, NATO, that is, and in my perspective, I think eventually force its collapse.</p><p>But he is dead wrong when he suggests that President Trump is weakening NATO. Quite the contrary. This is the first president in years who has actually gone to lengths to strengthen NATO by forcing them to increase the funding of the fence. And that is absolutely taking place largely because of the criticism that President Trump has unleashed against the NATO members leaders.</p><p>Also, we are pushing troops, Liz, into Eastern Europe as a deterrence against Russian aggression. That's U.S. troops and NATO troops. So, the senator is off in his conclusion there about Trump weakening NATO. Quite the contrary.</p><p>MACDONALD: And general, he is also suggesting Trump is not confronting Putin. What's your take on that?</p><p>KEANE: Well, I don't get that either because the facts don't support it. I mean, people overreact to the president wanting to have good relationship with adversarial leaders. North Korea, China, and Russia to name the three of them.</p><p>But the truth is, quite the contrary. He has issued sanctions as result of election meddling, as result of killing the Russian critic in the U.K. with a chemical biological weapon close to consulate throughout scores of Russian officials from here.</p><p>He has provided Ukraine with lethal aid. Obama refused to do it for four years. President Trump has done that to provide even more lethal aid. And twice he has struck the Russian proxy in Syria, the Assad regime, for the use of chemical weapons.</p><p>So, despite the rhetoric that President Trump wants relations to be good with Putin to see if we can solve some tough problems together, the policies that he is enacting are clearly pushing back on Russian aggression.</p><p>MACDONALD: General Jack Keane, thank you so much for your insight and analysis tonight. It was terrific. Thank you for your service to our country. Great to see you, general.</p><p>KEANE: Always good talking to you, Liz. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up next, former FBI Director James Comey is grandstanding, says Republicans. Comey saying he will resist any subpoena from House Republicans. We are going to ask Judge Napolitano about how there is a common sense answer to stop Comey here from Trey Gowdy. That's next.</p><p>And then the crisis at the border. Migrants throwing rocks and other projectiles. The border patrol firing teargas. Border patrol now getting blasted. Border patrol now saying the migrants are actually pushing women and children to the front. Also new detail on how bad the crime really was pouring over the border under Obama.</p><p>Maxine Waters trying to say it is all political ploy by Trump. We are going to show how she is wrong. That's coming up with Senator-elect Kevin Cramer. He is up, next. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Former FBI Director James Comey now says he will stand up to any subpoena from House Republicans to testify behind closed doors unless he is allowed to testify in open public. There is a common sense fix here from Republican Trey Gowdy. He says forget the public congressional testimony. Instead, why not just videotape Comey's testimony and then make it public.</p><p>Let's bring in Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial analyst. What do you think of that?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST, FOX NEWS: You know, when he was the head of the FBI, a lot of my FBI buddies and I had a lot of admiration for him. He was very, very popular. He always supported the troops. But some of the stuff -- I mean, the FBI agents in the field who risk their lives every day, some of the stuff is so political.</p><p>I don't think he wants the public hearing for self-aggrandisement. I think he wants to run out the clock until the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee become the minority in six weeks.</p><p>Look, either a subpoena is valid or it's not, it's valid if it's properly served. And if they want to ask you questions that you likely don't know an answer about, you can't choose before --</p><p>MACDONALD: Does it stay valid when the Democrats take control?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: No. They would either not issue it because they don't care or they would issue their own. Now, on the substance, I would actually agree with him. I think the secret hearings are terrible. The public has the right to watch the questioner and watch the witness and draw their own conclusions.</p><p>If this hearing is held in secret, Republicans will leak their version, Democrats will leak their version, and the public, we pay all their salaries, are treated like children.</p><p>MACDONALD: Trey Gowdy is saying that's better than nothing. Actually, he is saying in a public hearing, it's actually worse because you only have five minutes to do a Q&amp;A with the guy.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, it doesn't have to be a videotape if they don't want a videotape. It can be a transcript of what has said. But when only certain people know the questions and answers and they got to do the leaking, that's government they leak.</p><p>MACDONALD: Are they going to get it done? Are Republicans get this done?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>MACDONALD: What took them so long? Why did it take so long?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That has been a very valid criticism of them because the Republicans have controlled the House of Representatives and the White House for the past two years. They didn't serve any subpoenas. They did it all by negotiating.</p><p>Now in the death rows of their tenure, they're finally serving a subpoena. They could have done this a year and a half ago at the time he was fired by the president.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Finishing off a tweet by -- the president has been tweeting about this. He has been very upset with of course again tweeting about the Mueller probe. What's your take now with the Mueller probe? Are we going to get the results?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I happen to believe that the president is being advised by his lawyers not to tweet, not to taunt the alligator until after he crosses the stream, and the president is rejecting that advice. I don't know where is this going to go but I have a feeling, a feeling a lot is going to come down from Bob Mueller before Christmas and some after the Democrats take control of the House after Christmas.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow. Judge, will you come back? We need you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Of course.</p><p>MACDONALD: Judge Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'll see you in the morning.</p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you. We love the judge. You know, Barney (ph) says this is a spin-off show.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Barney (ph) is trying to take credit for your success.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, he is.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up next, Democrat Maxine Waters is trying to say the crisis at the border is just a political ploy by President Trump. We will bring in Republican Senator-elect Kevin Cramer. He is fired up about that. He is ready to go. Stay there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: There's not one indictment, there's not one conviction that Mueller has that has anything to do with the Russians having anything to do with the election in 2016.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Fast-moving developments at the border. Border officials defending their use of teargas after 500 migrants rushed the border. They said migrants are shoving women and children to the front. If they were really peaceful asylum-seekers, the migrants would not be throwing rocks at border patrol officials.</p><p>Dozens of migrants were arrested on the U.S. side of the border for crossing illegally. Also, Democrat Maxine Waters says the crisis there is nothing but a political ploy by President Trump. Kevin Cramer is a Republican senator-elect from North Dakota. He joins us now. Great to see you, sir.</p><p>REP. KEVIN CRAMER (R), NORTH DAKOTA: Good to be with you. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Sir, what is your take on all of this?</p><p>CRAMER: I think that Congresswoman Waters is missing the entire point. I'm surprised because if there's one thing that the crisis at the border has shown us, it really should be a wake-up call for all of those who doubted the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>To somehow suggest that it is manufactured crisis when there are 6,000 people who walked all the way through their country of Mexico to come to our border and try to storm it, that's not a fabrication, that's not a Hollywood production, those are real people. I think that it deserves the type of scrutiny that our president is giving.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, sir, it's hard to say that it is not a crisis when there's a video showing what's happening. You know there are some 5,000 migrants camped in Tijuana. You know there has been information coming in that the government documents show that under Obama, there was something like more than 24,000 serious incidents that occurred in 2014 of crime and violence among illegal border crossers.</p><p>CRAMER: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: How can Maxine Waters say this is just a stunt?</p><p>CRAMER: Because Maxine Waters is doing the exact thing that she is accusing our president of doing and that is politicizing the crisis. That's exactly the wrong approach. I think, you know, few weeks ago, our voters voted in a divided government to replace the unified Republican government.</p><p>I think the message that I take away from that is that they want two sides to get together and come up with some solutions. I think there are solutions that should be acceptable to all sides as long as one side is willing to give the other side something in exchange for the thing that they want.</p><p>That's been the problem with the four pillars approach that the president offered up which I thought had winners all the way around but the winners didn't want to be winners unless somebody else is a loser. I think that's exactly what the borders are telling us they don't want in this next Congress.</p><p>MACDONALD: Here is Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Council. He said this -- Here's what he said this morning about what's going on. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRANDON JUDD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL UNION: Our agents did not deploy teargas until they were hit with projectiles. Rocks and bottles. That's when they in fact deploy the teargas. If you look at what this caravan did, they pushed the women and children up to the front. How monstrous is that?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Your reaction to that, sir?</p><p>CRAMER: Well, clearly, this is not the type of refugee crisis that is sponsored by your local church. The refugees have come here through the right process, come with sponsors. They come through the legal process. And I think that he's exactly right.</p><p>When you look at the video, when you think that they can't possibly be peace-loving asylum seekers, who would do this to children and women and innocent people, nor were they storm a border illegally, they've come through illegal (ph) process, in which case they would be met with the type of hospitality that is significant and that is our tradition.</p><p>MACDONALD: Kevin Cramer, senator-elect out of North Dakota. Great to see you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it. We welcome you back on soon.</p><p>CRAMER: My pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you for having us in your homes. It has been a jam- packed hour. Thank you so much for watching. Lou Dobbs is here next on the Fox Business Network.

We've got the details  straightening out the media hysteria now trying to politicize this one. Big  hint. It potentially involves a let's make a deal throwdown from G.M. on  tariffs. We've got the story.</p><p> To big tech now facing big problems at home and abroad.

We've got  General Jack Keane on that, coming up.</p><p> To President Trump threatening to shut the border permanently as Democrat  Maxine Waters now tries to claim the border crisis is just a political  stunt by President Trump. This, as border officials now say migrants  purposely used women and children as human shields as migrants threw rocks  at border agents.</p><p> We've got that and news on secret government documents showing how bad the  crime really was pouring over the border during the Obama years. You will  not believe the new numbers. We take that on.</p><p> And Republicans undercutting a defiant James Comey. Saying Comey is  basically doing fake grandstanding about resisting a subpoena for closed- door testimony next week. Judge Napolitano joins us to explain and the  common-sense solution to all that. </p><p> Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we're going to bring you the debate beyond tomorrow's headlines.  I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p> Welcome to the show. You're watching the Fox Business Network. </p><p> President Trump pushing back hard on General Motors today after G.M. said  it may lay off up to 14,800 jobs in North America including jobs in the big  swing state of Ohio. The UAW, the big labor union agrees with Trump, so  does Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. </p><p> Edward Lawrence is here with more. Edward, here's the back story. The UAW  union labor contract with G.M. expires next year. G.M. does not want a  labor union strike. So, this could be a bargaining throw down by General  Motors to get Trump to dial back on the tariffs. The White House already  said it could give a waiver to save jobs for other companies when it  granted waivers on steel tariffs to seven big corporations. </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  To you, what do you say, Edward? </p><p> LAWRENCE:  Well, you know, G.M., though, the cars haven't been selling as  well as Ford, too. It comes down to sales too. But it could be a little of  all of that mixed in here. The labor unions and automakers have always been  at odds over and over and over again. And G.M. did not have a great deal  the last time around for its investors. They're trying to get a better deal  going forward.</p><p> But, again, it also boils down to sales. Now isn't it funny though, Liz,  how some of these decisions by automakers bring political opponents  together. You mention all of these folks in the same sentence supporting  President Trump to get back into Ohio. </p><p> Well, the announcement shocks and many sent ripples to the White House  today while President Donald Trump says he will pressure G.M. to bring  those jobs back to Ohio. He says that he told the G.M. CEO, Mary Barra to  get back into Ohio. </p><p> Barra met White House adviser or economic adviser Larry Kudlow today. And  this is part of the pressure now to get G.M. to reconsider closing seven  plants.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I spoke with her when I heard they were closing and I said, you  know, this one country has done a lot for General Motors. You better get  back in there soon. That's Ohio. And you better get back in there soon. </p><p> So, we have a lot of pressure on them. You have senators, you have a lot of  other people.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now four factories in the U.S. and one in Canada could be closed  by the end of 2019. The other two are outside North America. The plant  closing in Ohio specifically angered the president and shocked Ohio Senator  Rob Portman.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  General Motors has let down those workers who  have done so much for General Motors. I'm disappointed on that. What I said  several months ago to G.M., and again more recently, a couple of months ago  in meetings with their CEO and in discussions with their executive is we  need another product. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now Ohio is crucial for the 2020 presidential race. The  president has made it a priority to help people especially there get back  to work. Liz? </p><p> MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. To our viewers, the issue is whether  G.M. could retool U.S. factories to build SUVs and trucks. That's the issue  too, right, Edward?</p><p> OK. We lost Edward there. We're going to move on.</p><p> Members of the U.K. parliament now urging big companies to boycott  advertising on Google and Facebook because these guys still have not  stopped terror content and other negative content on their platforms.  Companies don't like when their ads to show up next to this content.</p><p> This is also what's happening. There's push back in Canada, Ireland,  Argentina, Brazil, Singapore, and Latvia as well against Facebook and  social media.</p><p> Let's bring in Tennessee Senator-elect Masha Blackburn. Great to see you,  Marsha. Thanks for coming on.</p><p> SEN.-ELECT MARSHA BLACKBURN, (R), TENNESSEE:  Good to see you. Thanks.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What's your reaction to the story? </p><p> BLACKBURN:  It just seems like there is no end to the number of messes that  you see Google and Facebook and Twitter and that FAANGS as they are called  getting themselves into these days. And I know that they have the ability  to do a little bit more policing on their networks that they then they are  doing. </p><p> But Liz, they are choosing not to do that. And I think that the American  people are getting wise to this. They are tired of the privacy breaches  that you are seeing, the invasion of privacy, and the data breaches. And  what people want to know is that there is the ability for they themselves  to protect their virtual you and protect their sensitive information.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. That's an important point because the pushback is Facebook  and other social media, they are collecting data on you that you don't know  about. </p><p> You know what's really interesting, Congressman and Senator-elect is that  the U.K., the United Kingdom is really pushing back hard, they don't  believe Facebook at all and they believe Facebook purposely built and knew  about a back door so companies like Cambridge Analytica could get in and  take our information. What's your reaction to that?</p><p> BLACKBURN:  This is the reason I wrote the BROWSER Act. What you saw in  2015 and 2016 from the Obama administration was trying to put in privacy  rules that would only affect your internet service provider and they did  not want it to apply to the entire ecosystem.</p><p> Now the U.K. moved forward with some privacy regulations that are more  stringent than anything we've considered in the U.S. But here is the thing  and the nugget. You, the consumer should have the ability to protect your  information and your sensitive data and say you do or do not want that  shared. Then for non-sensitive data you should have the ability to say I'm  going to opt out and not allow you to gather this information on me. </p><p> What we have seen some of these platforms to do and these are the apps,  basically that are not present, if you will, on your screen. They go in  they scrape your data.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  And they pull all that information and then they sell that or  they use it for their advertisers and you, the consumer, know nothing about  and you can't stop it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And you know Jane Wong, she is a UMass Dartmouth underground,  Marsha. She basically reverses engineered apps. She wants to see what they  were collecting. </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  She discovers shocking new information that we didn't know  about, that these apps are actually tracking the cell towers and the Wi-Fi  networks near you to find out where you're located, and now Google may  track your movement and your behaviors inside your home via Google devices,  including that of your children, Marsha.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  That's exactly right. And here is the thing about that. Even if  your device is not activated, turned off, the SIM card pulled that Google  operating system still tracks every single base station that you are  passing. And so, they are tracking you. And then also if it is an in-home  device that you can say, OK, Google play this or do that it is recording  and storing all of that and other conversation bits and pieces. </p><p> MACDONALD:  It is unbelievable. We thought big brother--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Unbelievable.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We thought big brother was in government. It's in Silicon  Valley. Senator-elect--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Well, that's right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn, it's been great to see you  have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us. I appreciate it.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now is the time to break up big tech monopoly on things like  that and public discourse. Let's bring in Reason magazine staff editor  Robby Soave, and business attorney and tech expert, Domenic Romano.  Domenic, what do you think. </p><p> DOMENIC ROMANO, BUSINESS ATTORNEY:  I agree with Senator-elect Blackburn. I  think a surgical approach is necessary. I don't think these companies can  be trusted to regulate themselves. You know, they say the superpower,  absolute power corrupts, absolutely, who controls the controllers. It's  time for some regulation. </p><p> In fact, Zuckerberg and Cook are asking for that, at least earlier they  expressed a willingness for some regulation.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It's interesting. Robby, what do you think?</p><p> ROBBY SOAVE, STAFF EDITOR, REASON MAGAZINE:  Well, I'm also concerned about  privacy but I'm more concerned about the government having access to this  information. I don't particularly trust Congress to regulate these  companies very well. I don't think they have a strong base of knowledge for  how to do so. </p><p> And you know, you can ultimately decide to opt out of some of these  services just by not using now. I mean, Facebook is crashing and burning  recently because people don't like it. So, there is a, there is a market  check on their behavior. The only true monopoly is one actually maintained  by the government and I worry that's what could happen inadvertently if we  get the government to get involved.</p><p> ROMANO:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And Robby makes an important point, Domenic. Facebook though  does track you even if you unplug Facebook. In other words, Domenic  Facebook still follows you around the internet even after you've killed off  your Facebook.</p><p> ROMANO:  Well, that's the whole point. I think it's an overstatement to say  that Facebook is crushed and burned. They've loss the music but still the  dominant platform. So, I think it's time to regulate, but it should be  surgical, it should be measured. and that it should be very, very limited  to start.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And Robby, you know, the U.K., the United Kingdom Britain  clearly not believing Zuckerberg anymore. They say he may have known about  privacy abuses and other problems way earlier than he has said according to  e-mails at U.K. parliament has seize. What do you think, Robby?</p><p> SOAVE:  Well, that's true, but of course Europe has different laws in some  important ways, right. Don't have a First Amendment, they can -- you can be  arrested for hate speech there so they take kind of these matters a little  differently.</p><p> Look, I just think it's going be quite difficult to put the genie back in  the bottle relating to some of these privacy concerns. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> SOAVE:  I'm concerned about privacy as well, but these are difficult  questions.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Robby and Domenic, that's why we want to have you guys back on  to talk about it. </p><p> ROMANO:  I love to.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It's a developing story. Great to see both. Thank you so much. </p><p> ROMANO:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  In other headlines, the Supreme Court is appearing skeptical  against Apple in arguments over whether customers of those iPhone apps can  actually sue Apple over its potential illegal monopoly on app sales.</p><p> Let's get to black Friday and cyber Monday setting sales records, look at  this, MasterCard projecting shoppers spent $23 billion on black Friday.  Adobe says shoppers are on track to spend nearly $8 million during today's  cyber Monday -- cyber Monday shopping extravaganza. </p><p> And we've got a stunning accomplishment for NASA high- fives all around.  The Mars insight Lander successfully touched down on Mars earlier this  afternoon. This lander made a 300-million-mile trek to Mars. This is the  second U.S. robot to land on the red planet. The first was a curiosity  rover in 2012.</p><p> And take a look at this. A brutal fight erupting during last night's  football game between the Buffalo Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The  brawl ended with running back Leonard Fournette of Jacksonville and the  bills shock loss in getting ejected from the game. Fournette has since  apologized on Twitter.</p><p> Coming up, President Trump holding not one but two rallies tonight in  Mississippi. We're on the ground with the latest from the president. </p><p> Also coming up, a potential government shutdown. The first fight Nancy  Pelosi faces as she is expected to win the Democratic House speakership.  The election is coming up this Wednesday. We've got all those fights and  we're going to show you what is really going on and what is going wrong  with the Democrat Party behind the scenes.</p><p> Matta Schlapp, he's here. He is fired up and ready to take it on, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back.</p><p> A special Senate election is bringing President Trump to Tupelo,  Mississippi. The president will be holding a make America great again rally  in support of controversial junior Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith now accused of  making racist comments. </p><p>Fox News reporter Kristin Fisher has more. Kristin?</p><p> KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Well, Liz, President Trump just wrapped  his first of two rallies tonight in Mississippi in support of the  Republican candidate in this race Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. You know, the  president's track record is pretty good. He proved to be very helpful for  all the Republican Senate candidates that he campaigned for earlier this  month during the midterms.</p><p> And so, he's really helping that that same strategy is going to work  tomorrow right here in Mississippi. Now Mississippi, this is a deep red  state, so you might think that the Republican Senate candidate in this race  might need any help. But she has come under a lot of heat for a racially  tense remark that she made earlier this month.</p><p> She was caught on camera praising a supporter by saying, quote, \"if he  invited me to a public hanging I'd be on the front row.\" Now she since  apologized, but that remark has been following her nonstop on the campaign  trail especially since her Democrat opponent in this race Mike Espy, he's  trying to become Mississippi's first black senator since reconstruction.</p><p> He's dealing with his issues though, his baggage from his time in the  Clinton administration when he was indicted for accepting improper gifts,  though he was later acquitted on all counts. </p><p> And then there's also his more recent lobbying for an African dictator  currently on trial for crimes against humanity. So, in the end, this race  it is going to all come down to turn out as most elections are on non- election day. It's turned out absolutely key. That's why President Trump is  coming here. And why he came here tonight in Tupelo and why he's going to  Biloxi in just a few hours. </p><p> He's hoping that all of these folks, all of his supporters that came out to  see him tonight he's hoping that they will get out and vote for Cindy Hyde- Smith tomorrow in what is the final Senate race to be decided in 2018. This  is it, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD: OK. Kristin, live in Tupelo, Mississippi. Great to see you,  Kristin. Thank you so much. The clock now ticking on Capitol Hill to  potential government shutdown over the border and it's unfolding as it is  now show time for Nancy Pelosi. She is now set to reclaim her role this  Wednesday as House speaker. High-fives there as the Dems did take 40 seats  in the House. </p><p> But here's the problem with the Democrats. Massive leadership  deterioration. No fresh talent. No fresh leadership, no accountability. Big  losses over the last decade at all levels of government.</p><p> Joining me now is the American Conservative Union chair, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you, Matt. Your take here.</p><p> MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  I think the Democrats  are in a world of hurt in the House. I think it's very interesting to  watch. Nancy Pelosi was always considered the most progressive of  progressive. She's from San Francisco. She's always been to the left on  every major issue, but now it seems like she's lost the support of some of  these new upstarts that just were elected to her caucus majority. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So, here's the thing. The House Republicans have term limits on  their committees of committee chairs and the chairs of subcommittees. The  Democrats do not have that. So, there's no other Democrat running against  Pelosi for speaker. What does that tell you about Dem leadership? Some  critics say this is insane, Matt, that this is why the Democrat Party has  imploded when it comes to leadership.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Well, the other thing is not only do they have these 70-year-olds  who are wanting to take all these leadership positions at all these are  committee gavels. You know, the other issue that's involved in all this is  that you have a fair number of new Democrats who were elected partially on  the promise that they wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi. </p><p> Now if give Nancy Pelosi a lot of credit. She is arm twisting. She is  hammering them. She is pressuring them to vote for her, but many of them in  voting for Nancy Pelosi will break a campaign promise and they won -- and  many of them won in districts that Republicans previously held.</p><p> So, as a Republican, I'm kind of just enjoying the whole spectacle.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, because Nancy Pelosi hands out the plum committee  assignments and then they meet the Democrats of the top leadership, they  meet behind closed doors and tell the junior Democrats how to vote.</p><p> Here's the thing, Matt. We saw Democrats Rahm Emanuel, Kirstjen Gillibrand,  and Chris Van Hollen quit the House at the first good opportunity because  of the sclerotic top-down leadership from Pelosi.</p><p> And here's the thing, Matt. Critics have said if Barack Obama had run for  the House, as he did in 2001 and if he won back in 2000, Barack Obama might  still be stuck. He might still be stuck trying to advance for--</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  -- trying to get beyond the House energy committee where Bobby  Rush his opponent won and that's where he says.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  It's a very fair point. Look at all the freshman senators who ran  for president, you had people like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, you know,  running for president, Rand Paul where they haven't even in the Senate that  long on the Republican side. </p><p> The same is true with Barack Obama on the Democratic side. It seems like in  politics these days in America you got to go up or you're out. And just  hanging around the old phrase used to be, go along to get along and that  seems to be dead because if you don't move up you just kind of stuck and  when you're in the minority in the Houses as these Republicans are going to  realize there is not a whole lot to do, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So, let me ask you something. Will the House Republicans get  more vocal and will the House Democrats get more vocal? Because if Nancy  Pelosi is doing top-down, Nancy Pelosi may realize, she probably realizes,  you do need electrifying new leadership to take on a guy like Trump, right?</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Yes, that's exactly right. Look, I think Nancy Pelosi is in a  fight here that she might very well win, but she's about yesterday, and I  think there's a lot of Democrats in her caucus in the House that realize  they got to find a new generation of leadership. And it's going to be very  interesting.</p><p> Because let's face it. They elected a lot of new faces. Some of them were  very interesting. Some of them don't. Are not that impressive for my point  of view, but others are. And it's going to be very interesting to see if  they can project a leader who represents these new diverse congresspeople  who have been elected all over the country.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Smart insights and analysis from Matt Schlapp. We love having  you on, Matt. Great to see you.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Thanks.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We're coming into the bottom of the hour. Coming up, what  do taxes and suburban Republican soccer mom have in common a lot. They've  got a lot in common. Losing those suburban soccer moms that might be the  Republican's biggest fear. We're going to explain that next. </p><p> And later in the show. Ukraine declares martial law after Russia fired on  several of its navy ships, wounding numerous sailors. General Jack Keane is  here to break it all down. That's up there. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  The Camp Fire in Northern California now contained. But tens of  thousands still homeless, plus a number of missing statewide still 296.  That is down from about 1,000 people thought to be missing just a few days  ago. The death toll statewide hitting 88. Almost 19,000 buildings have been  destroyed.</p><p> The scorch land amounts of the size of two Rhode Islands or one Delaware  that has been burned in the state of California in his recent spate of  fires.</p><p> Joining me now is a vice mayor of Paradise, California. He is Greg Bolin.  Your honor, it's so great to have you on the show. It is a world of pain.  We were talking about this here at the Fox Business Network.</p><p> And the town of Paradise it's an ashy eerie quiet right now. Can you bring  us up to date what's going on?</p><p> GREG BOLIN, VICE MAYOR, PARADISE, CALIFORNIA:  Well, right now we just have  an army of people up there all doing their best to get through town and  start putting power back in and get the water up and running. Our  infrastructures just completely gone, so they're just trying to get to  resources in there. </p><p> I just talked to someone today, one of the policemen. They have around 25  to 30 cranes in there, removing trees that are damaged or destroyed, and  trying to set new poles and get things going again. It's a monumental task,  but we've got a lot of people there to move it and make it happen.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What is the prognosis for going forward and rebuilding?</p><p> BOLIN (via telephone):  Well, that's a great question. I can't say that  I've been here before. None of us have been here before. Even the experts  are saying this is even new to them. You know, right now, it's one day at a  time. The meeting I'm sitting in, they are very happy with their progress.  They are moving forward very fast.</p><p> But the size of this thing, it is going to cost -- it will take some time  to get it to where people can move back in, even into home that did not get  destroyed.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Again, people lost -- this is such a painful story. It is  absolutely heartbreaking. It is heartache. We are showing images on camera  right now of the rescue effort. Looking back, you know, years from now,  vice mayor, what will stand out to you when it comes to what happened?</p><p> BOLIN (via telephone):  Well, people are lost. We are here -- I'm here at  the disaster center right now in Chico. We are meeting people, talking to  them, answering what questions we can answer. But you know what, every time  I leave here, I am more encouraged than I was before. There is a sense of  optimism. They want to move back. They want to build their houses back  again and make Paradise better than it was before.</p><p> So, even though the shock is devastating and most of us including myself  lost everything we had, I live out of two bags right now, and most of the  people in the same way.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Vice mayor, you are living out of two bags? Is that what you  just said? This is such a devastating situation that can drive people to  their knees at night, at home, alone, in the shower, in the hallway. I  mean, you're saying now that you're living out of two bags, is that what  you just said?</p><p> BOLIN (via telephone):  Well, all my possessions are in two bags. Those two  bags, that's everything I got. We came out of -- we got what we could. We  got some pictures out. But most of our possessions fit in our car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BOLIN (via telephone):  That's the way everybody is. We had to flee and get  out of there and we didn't have time to wait. But that's everybody. But you  know, it's still amazing to see the optimism. I just got done talking to a  guy. He is an elderly person who said, I'm going back, how long before I  can start building?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Wow.</p><p> BOLIN (via telephone):  I'm going to be back up there. They want to get  back to Paradise. That's home. They want to be back there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Just be safe. We got to have you guys safe up there. You  know, when things break down, humanity steps up. That's the story you just  gave us, vice mayor. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p> BOLIN (via telephone):  Keep praying for us.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We will.</p><p> BOLIN (via telephone):  Don't forget about us.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We will. Absolutely we will.</p><p> BOLIN (via telephone):  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Vice Mayor Greg Bolin of Paradise, California. Switching gears  now, the Republicans' biggest fear in 2020 may be losing the Republican  suburban soccer mom, those moms always worried about pocketbook issues.  They won't be happy about Republicans capping a popular deduction for state  and local taxes when they do their tax returns next year, may even lost  Republican House seats in the midterms.</p><p> Let's bring in the political panel, Kelsey Harkness with The Daily Signal  and look who is here, Democrat strategist Scott Bolden. We welcome you  both. Thank you so much.</p><p> SCOTT BOLDEN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Thank you.</p><p> KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR NEWS PRODUCER, THE DAILY SIGNAL:  Glad to be here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Kelsey, first to you. Five high tax states actually lost  Republican seats in the midterms. What is your take on what is coming when  it comes to the salt deductions?</p><p> HARKNESS:  I think that tax reform is actually a winning issue for  Republicans. I think if Republicans figure out how to communicate, how the  tax reform plan has been good for them, and what more they could do if we  continue down this path of lowering taxes for every day Americans and  businesses to stimulate the economy, I do think it will suit President  Trump very well in 2020.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's shift gear here, Scott. Socialist Democrats still talking  about free things like Medicare for all. Everybody knows that taxpayers  have to put (ph) the bill there. You know, we are not hearing much about  from Democrat socialist free college, free college tuition. Why is that,  Scott?</p><p> BOLDEN:  I'm trying to get over the term socialist Democrats but I'll move  on from there. The reality is that we really don't know how to figure out  or get people to trust how we pay for one. But secondly, the white working  class just simply aren't buying it. Sixty percent of Americans like the  idea compared to 38 percent.</p><p> But the reality is it's not selling with that group that we need to pull  from Trump in 2020 and bring them back to the -- bring them back to the  Democratic Party.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Kelsey --</p><p> BOLDEN:  Those are two short answers.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, I hear you, Scott. Kelsey, federal aid to colleges has  exploded to nearly $160 billion a year, but that has only fueled rampant  tuition price hikes. The families out there watching know that. They know  that we've also nationalized student loans. Taxpayers are on the hook for  that. The more money you give to colleges, the more they raise tuition,  Kelsey.</p><p> HARKNESS:  Absolutely. College affordability is an issue that all Americans  are --</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> HARKNESS:  -- concerned about. It is something that moving forward I think  Republicans and Democrats could come together, but providing free college  is certainly not the answer. That is going to cause more trouble for the  country.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Scott, I'm so sorry. We ran out of time. Scott, we want to have  you back on. Kelsey, too. You guys have been great.</p><p> BOLDEN:  Sure.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you so much.</p><p> HARKNESS:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey says he will not  agree to closed hearings before Congress next week. He wants a public  hearing instead. Republicans say he is doing fake (ph) grandstanding. We've  got a common sense fix to stop James Comey here. We bring in Judge  Napolitano on that.</p><p> But first, the Ukraine declaring martial law after Vladimir Putin's forces  opened fire on Ukrainian navy vessels over the weekend, wounding a number  of sailors. Tensions ratcheting up. NATO calling an emergency meeting over  this. We are going to tell you what it all means. That's coming up, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. The Ukraine declaring martial law today in  regions bordering Russia. This after Russian forces opened fire on its  naval vessels over the weekend. They seized three of those vessels and left  several sailors wounded. NATO calling an emergency meeting, expressing full  support of the Ukraine.</p><p> Joining me now, retired four stars army general and Fox News senior  strategic analyst General Jack Keane. Great to see you, general.</p><p> JACK KEANE, SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST, FOX NEWS:  Yeah, great to see you,  Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What's your take on the situation because Russia is trying to  claim that it was provoked by the Ukraine navy.</p><p> KEANE:  That's likely a bald-faced lie, to be frank about it. They lie  through their teeth on all of these things. In every incident they have,  they always claim that they were provoked and they just had to take action.</p><p> What this is really about, Putin's strategy here, five years after he moved  into -- almost five years after he moved in to Crimea and the eastern part  of Ukraine, he's already trying to squeeze Ukraine even more economically.</p><p> North of the Kerch Strait where this incident took place is the Sea of  Azov. There are two or three ports there in Ukraine that are used to bring  out a lot of exports out of that country particularly steel. They move down  through the strait in to the Black Sea and then out into the European and  global markets.</p><p> Putin, I think, is leading up to squeezing that as much as he possibly can.  He doesn't like the fact that Ukraine looks to the west for economic  support from the E.U. and also from the United States, and he's trying to  continue to discourage that. So that's the strategic thing that's taken  place on Putin's part.</p><p> MACDONALD:  General, what was your reaction to Democrat Senator Ben Cardin  criticizing President Trump today, saying that Trump is helping Vladimir  Putin \"weaken the west by threatening NATO?\"</p><p> KEANE:  Yeah, I was surprised by that. Senator Cardin is a knowledgeable  and respected member of the Senate. I agree with the statement that Putin's  strategy is to weaken the transatlantic alliance, NATO, that is, and in my  perspective, I think eventually force its collapse.</p><p> But he is dead wrong when he suggests that President Trump is weakening  NATO. Quite the contrary. This is the first president in years who has  actually gone to lengths to strengthen NATO by forcing them to increase the  funding of the fence. And that is absolutely taking place largely because  of the criticism that President Trump has unleashed against the NATO  members leaders.</p><p> Also, we are pushing troops, Liz, into Eastern Europe as a deterrence  against Russian aggression. That's U.S. troops and NATO troops. So, the  senator is off in his conclusion there about Trump weakening NATO. Quite  the contrary.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And general, he is also suggesting Trump is not confronting  Putin. What's your take on that?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, I don't get that either because the facts don't support it. I  mean, people overreact to the president wanting to have good relationship  with adversarial leaders. North Korea, China, and Russia to name the three  of them.</p><p> But the truth is, quite the contrary. He has issued sanctions as result of  election meddling, as result of killing the Russian critic in the U.K. with  a chemical biological weapon close to consulate throughout scores of  Russian officials from here.</p><p> He has provided Ukraine with lethal aid. Obama refused to do it for four  years. President Trump has done that to provide even more lethal aid. And  twice he has struck the Russian proxy in Syria, the Assad regime, for the  use of chemical weapons.</p><p> So, despite the rhetoric that President Trump wants relations to be good  with Putin to see if we can solve some tough problems together, the  policies that he is enacting are clearly pushing back on Russian  aggression.</p><p> MACDONALD:  General Jack Keane, thank you so much for your insight and  analysis tonight. It was terrific. Thank you for your service to our  country. Great to see you, general.</p><p> KEANE:  Always good talking to you, Liz. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up next, former FBI Director James Comey is  grandstanding, says Republicans. Comey saying he will resist any subpoena  from House Republicans. We are going to ask Judge Napolitano about how  there is a common sense answer to stop Comey here from Trey Gowdy. That's  next.</p><p> And then the crisis at the border. Migrants throwing rocks and other  projectiles. The border patrol firing teargas. Border patrol now getting  blasted. Border patrol now saying the migrants are actually pushing women  and children to the front. Also new detail on how bad the crime really was  pouring over the border under Obama.</p><p> Maxine Waters trying to say it is all political ploy by Trump. We are going  to show how she is wrong. That's coming up with Senator-elect Kevin Cramer.  He is up, next. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Former FBI Director James Comey now says he will stand up to  any subpoena from House Republicans to testify behind closed doors unless  he is allowed to testify in open public. There is a common sense fix here  from Republican Trey Gowdy. He says forget the public congressional  testimony. Instead, why not just videotape Comey's testimony and then make  it public.</p><p> Let's bring in Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial analyst.  What do you think of that?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST, FOX NEWS:  You know, when he  was the head of the FBI, a lot of my FBI buddies and I had a lot of  admiration for him. He was very, very popular. He always supported the  troops. But some of the stuff -- I mean, the FBI agents in the field who  risk their lives every day, some of the stuff is so political.</p><p> I don't think he wants the public hearing for self-aggrandisement. I think  he wants to run out the clock until the Republicans who control the  Judiciary Committee become the minority in six weeks.</p><p> Look, either a subpoena is valid or it's not, it's valid if it's properly  served. And if they want to ask you questions that you likely don't know an  answer about, you can't choose before --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Does it stay valid when the Democrats take control?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No. They would either not issue it because they don't care or  they would issue their own. Now, on the substance, I would actually agree  with him. I think the secret hearings are terrible. The public has the  right to watch the questioner and watch the witness and draw their own  conclusions.</p><p> If this hearing is held in secret, Republicans will leak their version,  Democrats will leak their version, and the public, we pay all their  salaries, are treated like children.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Trey Gowdy is saying that's better than nothing. Actually, he  is saying in a public hearing, it's actually worse because you only have  five minutes to do a Q&amp;A with the guy.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, it doesn't have to be a videotape if they don't want a  videotape. It can be a transcript of what has said. But when only certain  people know the questions and answers and they got to do the leaking,  that's government they leak.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Are they going to get it done? Are Republicans get this done?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What took them so long? Why did it take so long?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That has been a very valid criticism of them because the  Republicans have controlled the House of Representatives and the White  House for the past two years. They didn't serve any subpoenas. They did it  all by negotiating.</p><p> Now in the death rows of their tenure, they're finally serving a subpoena.  They could have done this a year and a half ago at the time he was fired by  the president.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Finishing off a tweet by -- the president has been  tweeting about this. He has been very upset with of course again tweeting  about the Mueller probe. What's your take now with the Mueller probe? Are  we going to get the results?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I happen to believe that the president is being advised by his  lawyers not to tweet, not to taunt the alligator until after he crosses the  stream, and the president is rejecting that advice. I don't know where is  this going to go but I have a feeling, a feeling a lot is going to come  down from Bob Mueller before Christmas and some after the Democrats take  control of the House after Christmas.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Wow. Judge, will you come back? We need you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Of course.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Judge Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'll see you in the morning.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great to see you. We love the judge. You know, Barney (ph) says  this is a spin-off show.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Barney (ph) is trying to take credit for your success.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, he is.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up next, Democrat Maxine Waters is trying to say the  crisis at the border is just a political ploy by President Trump. We will  bring in Republican Senator-elect Kevin Cramer. He is fired up about that.  He is ready to go. Stay there.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL  COMMENTATOR:   There's not one indictment, there's not one conviction that Mueller has  that has anything to do with the Russians having anything to do with the  election in 2016.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Fast-moving developments at the border. Border officials  defending their use of teargas after 500 migrants rushed the border. They  said migrants are shoving women and children to the front. If they were  really peaceful asylum-seekers, the migrants would not be throwing rocks at  border patrol officials.</p><p> Dozens of migrants were arrested on the U.S. side of the border for  crossing illegally. Also, Democrat Maxine Waters says the crisis there is  nothing but a political ploy by President Trump. Kevin Cramer is a  Republican senator-elect from North Dakota. He joins us now. Great to see  you, sir.</p><p> REP. KEVIN CRAMER (R), NORTH DAKOTA:  Good to be with you. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Sir, what is your take on all of this?</p><p> CRAMER:  I think that Congresswoman Waters is missing the entire point. I'm  surprised because if there's one thing that the crisis at the border has  shown us, it really should be a wake-up call for all of those who doubted  the seriousness of the situation.</p><p> To somehow suggest that it is manufactured crisis when there are 6,000  people who walked all the way through their country of Mexico to come to  our border and try to storm it, that's not a fabrication, that's not a  Hollywood production, those are real people. I think that it deserves the  type of scrutiny that our president is giving.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, sir, it's hard to say that it is not a crisis when there's  a video showing what's happening. You know there are some 5,000 migrants  camped in Tijuana. You know there has been information coming in that the  government documents show that under Obama, there was something like more  than 24,000 serious incidents that occurred in 2014 of crime and violence  among illegal border crossers.</p><p> CRAMER:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  How can Maxine Waters say this is just a stunt?</p><p> CRAMER:  Because Maxine Waters is doing the exact thing that she is  accusing our president of doing and that is politicizing the crisis. That's  exactly the wrong approach. I think, you know, few weeks ago, our voters  voted in a divided government to replace the unified Republican government.</p><p> I think the message that I take away from that is that they want two sides  to get together and come up with some solutions. I think there are  solutions that should be acceptable to all sides as long as one side is  willing to give the other side something in exchange for the thing that  they want.</p><p> That's been the problem with the four pillars approach that the president  offered up which I thought had winners all the way around but the winners  didn't want to be winners unless somebody else is a loser. I think that's  exactly what the borders are telling us they don't want in this next  Congress.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Here is Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border  Council. He said this -- Here's what he said this morning about what's  going on. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRANDON JUDD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL UNION:  Our agents did not  deploy teargas until they were hit with projectiles. Rocks and bottles.  That's when they in fact deploy the teargas. If you look at what this  caravan did, they pushed the women and children up to the front. How  monstrous is that?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Your reaction to that, sir?</p><p> CRAMER:  Well, clearly, this is not the type of refugee crisis that is  sponsored by your local church. The refugees have come here through the  right process, come with sponsors. They come through the legal process. And  I think that he's exactly right.</p><p> When you look at the video, when you think that they can't possibly be  peace-loving asylum seekers, who would do this to children and women and  innocent people, nor were they storm a border illegally, they've come  through illegal (ph) process, in which case they would be met with the type  of hospitality that is significant and that is our tradition.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Kevin Cramer, senator-elect out of North Dakota. Great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it. We welcome you  back on soon.</p><p> CRAMER:  My pleasure. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you for having us in your homes.  It has been a jam- packed hour. Thank you so much for watching. Lou Dobbs is here next on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Well, we wish Tesla the  very best. Thanks, gang. Bulls and Bears.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We don't like it. I believe  they'll be opening up something else. I was very tough. I spoke with her  when I heard they were closing. And I said, you know, this company has done  a lot for General Motors. You better get back in there soon. That's Ohio.  And you better get back in there soon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, we have a lot of pressure on them. You have senators, you have a lot of  other people, a lot of pressure. They say the Chevy Cruise is not selling  well. I said well, they get somebody -- get a car that is selling well and  put it back in. So, I think you are going to see something else happen  there, but I'm not happy about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  President Trump fighting  to protect U.S. jobs, slamming General Motors over its new plan to lay off  thousands of workers and close multiple factories. We've got the details  straightening out the media hysteria now trying to politicize this one. Big  hint. It potentially involves a let's make a deal throwdown from G.M. on  tariffs. We've got the story.</p><p>To big tech now facing big problems at home and abroad. Facebook under  historic pressure in the U.K. The Brits now say they do not believe Mark  Zuckerberg anymore as the U.K. parliament seizes Facebook and Zuckerberg's  private company e-mails. And they urge corporate boycotts. </p><p>Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn, she's fired up and ready to go on that one.  And how President Trump was right about both Facebook and Google. </p><p>To Nancy Pelosi now facing a raucous, contentious vote Democrat leadership  vote this week. Her first fight with President Trump is here. A possible  government shutdown over the border wall. Matt Schlapp weighs on that. </p><p>And the big weakness in the Democrat Party that Trump can capitalize on.  The Ukraine just declared martial law after a Russia fired on its navy  ships over the weekend wounding several sailors. This after Ukrainian  protesters swarmed the Russian consulate over the weekend. We've got  General Jack Keane on that, coming up.</p><p>To President Trump threatening to shut the border permanently as Democrat  Maxine Waters now tries to claim the border crisis is just a political  stunt by President Trump. This, as border officials now say migrants  purposely used women and children as human shields as migrants threw rocks  at border agents.</p><p>We've got that and news on secret government documents showing how bad the  crime really was pouring over the border during the Obama years. You will  not believe the new numbers. We take that on.</p><p>And Republicans undercutting a defiant James Comey. Saying Comey is  basically doing fake grandstanding about resisting a subpoena for closed- door testimony next week. Judge Napolitano joins us to explain and the  common-sense solution to all that. </p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we're going to bring you the debate beyond tomorrow's headlines.  I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p>Welcome to the show. You're watching the Fox Business Network. </p><p>President Trump pushing back hard on General Motors today after G.M. said  it may lay off up to 14,800 jobs in North America including jobs in the big  swing state of Ohio. The UAW, the big labor union agrees with Trump, so  does Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. </p><p>Edward Lawrence is here with more. Edward, here's the back story. The UAW  union labor contract with G.M. expires next year. G.M. does not want a  labor union strike. So, this could be a bargaining throw down by General  Motors to get Trump to dial back on the tariffs. The White House already  said it could give a waiver to save jobs for other companies when it  granted waivers on steel tariffs to seven big corporations. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  To you, what do you say, Edward? </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Well, you know, G.M., though, the cars haven't been selling as  well as Ford, too. It comes down to sales too. But it could be a little of  all of that mixed in here. The labor unions and automakers have always been  at odds over and over and over again. And G.M. did not have a great deal  the last time around for its investors. They're trying to get a better deal  going forward.</p><p>But, again, it also boils down to sales. Now isn't it funny though, Liz,  how some of these decisions by automakers bring political opponents  together. You mention all of these folks in the same sentence supporting  President Trump to get back into Ohio. </p><p>Well, the announcement shocks and many sent ripples to the White House  today while President Donald Trump says he will pressure G.M. to bring  those jobs back to Ohio. He says that he told the G.M. CEO, Mary Barra to  get back into Ohio. </p><p>Barra met White House adviser or economic adviser Larry Kudlow today. And  this is part of the pressure now to get G.M. to reconsider closing seven  plants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I spoke with her when I heard they were closing and I said, you  know, this one country has done a lot for General Motors. You better get  back in there soon. That's Ohio. And you better get back in there soon. </p><p>So, we have a lot of pressure on them. You have senators, you have a lot of  other people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now four factories in the U.S. and one in Canada could be closed  by the end of 2019. The other two are outside North America. The plant  closing in Ohio specifically angered the president and shocked Ohio Senator  Rob Portman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  General Motors has let down those workers who  have done so much for General Motors. I'm disappointed on that. What I said  several months ago to G.M., and again more recently, a couple of months ago  in meetings with their CEO and in discussions with their executive is we  need another product. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now Ohio is crucial for the 2020 presidential race. The  president has made it a priority to help people especially there get back  to work. Liz? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. To our viewers, the issue is whether  G.M. could retool U.S. factories to build SUVs and trucks. That's the issue  too, right, Edward?</p><p>OK. We lost Edward there. We're going to move on.</p><p>Members of the U.K. parliament now urging big companies to boycott  advertising on Google and Facebook because these guys still have not  stopped terror content and other negative content on their platforms.  Companies don't like when their ads to show up next to this content.</p><p>This is also what's happening. There's push back in Canada, Ireland,  Argentina, Brazil, Singapore, and Latvia as well against Facebook and  social media.</p><p>Let's bring in Tennessee Senator-elect Masha Blackburn. Great to see you,  Marsha. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>SEN.-ELECT MARSHA BLACKBURN, (R), TENNESSEE:  Good to see you. Thanks.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What's your reaction to the story? </p><p>BLACKBURN:  It just seems like there is no end to the number of messes that  you see Google and Facebook and Twitter and that FAANGS as they are called  getting themselves into these days. And I know that they have the ability  to do a little bit more policing on their networks that they then they are  doing. </p><p>But Liz, they are choosing not to do that. And I think that the American  people are getting wise to this. They are tired of the privacy breaches  that you are seeing, the invasion of privacy, and the data breaches. And  what people want to know is that there is the ability for they themselves  to protect their virtual you and protect their sensitive information.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. That's an important point because the pushback is Facebook  and other social media, they are collecting data on you that you don't know  about. </p><p>You know what's really interesting, Congressman and Senator-elect is that  the U.K., the United Kingdom is really pushing back hard, they don't  believe Facebook at all and they believe Facebook purposely built and knew  about a back door so companies like Cambridge Analytica could get in and  take our information. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  This is the reason I wrote the BROWSER Act. What you saw in  2015 and 2016 from the Obama administration was trying to put in privacy  rules that would only affect your internet service provider and they did  not want it to apply to the entire ecosystem.</p><p>Now the U.K. moved forward with some privacy regulations that are more  stringent than anything we've considered in the U.S. But here is the thing  and the nugget. You, the consumer should have the ability to protect your  information and your sensitive data and say you do or do not want that  shared. Then for non-sensitive data you should have the ability to say I'm  going to opt out and not allow you to gather this information on me. </p><p>What we have seen some of these platforms to do and these are the apps,  basically that are not present, if you will, on your screen. They go in  they scrape your data.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  And they pull all that information and then they sell that or  they use it for their advertisers and you, the consumer, know nothing about  and you can't stop it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And you know Jane Wong, she is a UMass Dartmouth underground,  Marsha. She basically reverses engineered apps. She wants to see what they  were collecting. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  She discovers shocking new information that we didn't know  about, that these apps are actually tracking the cell towers and the Wi-Fi  networks near you to find out where you're located, and now Google may  track your movement and your behaviors inside your home via Google devices,  including that of your children, Marsha.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's exactly right. And here is the thing about that. Even if  your device is not activated, turned off, the SIM card pulled that Google  operating system still tracks every single base station that you are  passing. And so, they are tracking you. And then also if it is an in-home  device that you can say, OK, Google play this or do that it is recording  and storing all of that and other conversation bits and pieces. </p><p>MACDONALD:  It is unbelievable. We thought big brother--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We thought big brother was in government. It's in Silicon  Valley. Senator-elect--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, that's right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn, it's been great to see you  have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us. I appreciate it.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now is the time to break up big tech monopoly on things like  that and public discourse. Let's bring in Reason magazine staff editor  Robby Soave, and business attorney and tech expert, Domenic Romano.  Domenic, what do you think. </p><p>DOMENIC ROMANO, BUSINESS ATTORNEY:  I agree with Senator-elect Blackburn. I  think a surgical approach is necessary. I don't think these companies can  be trusted to regulate themselves. You know, they say the superpower,  absolute power corrupts, absolutely, who controls the controllers. It's  time for some regulation. </p><p>In fact, Zuckerberg and Cook are asking for that, at least earlier they  expressed a willingness for some regulation.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's interesting. Robby, what do you think?</p><p>ROBBY SOAVE, STAFF EDITOR, REASON MAGAZINE:  Well, I'm also concerned about  privacy but I'm more concerned about the government having access to this  information. I don't particularly trust Congress to regulate these  companies very well. I don't think they have a strong base of knowledge for  how to do so. </p><p>And you know, you can ultimately decide to opt out of some of these  services just by not using now. I mean, Facebook is crashing and burning  recently because people don't like it. So, there is a, there is a market  check on their behavior. The only true monopoly is one actually maintained  by the government and I worry that's what could happen inadvertently if we  get the government to get involved.</p><p>ROMANO:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And Robby makes an important point, Domenic. Facebook though  does track you even if you unplug Facebook. In other words, Domenic  Facebook still follows you around the internet even after you've killed off  your Facebook.</p><p>ROMANO:  Well, that's the whole point. I think it's an overstatement to say  that Facebook is crushed and burned. They've loss the music but still the  dominant platform. So, I think it's time to regulate, but it should be  surgical, it should be measured. and that it should be very, very limited  to start.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And Robby, you know, the U.K., the United Kingdom Britain  clearly not believing Zuckerberg anymore. They say he may have known about  privacy abuses and other problems way earlier than he has said according to  e-mails at U.K. parliament has seize. What do you think, Robby?</p><p>SOAVE:  Well, that's true, but of course Europe has different laws in some  important ways, right. Don't have a First Amendment, they can -- you can be  arrested for hate speech there so they take kind of these matters a little  differently.</p><p>Look, I just think it's going be quite difficult to put the genie back in  the bottle relating to some of these privacy concerns. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>SOAVE:  I'm concerned about privacy as well, but these are difficult  questions.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Robby and Domenic, that's why we want to have you guys back on  to talk about it. </p><p>ROMANO:  I love to.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's a developing story. Great to see both. Thank you so much. </p><p>ROMANO:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  In other headlines, the Supreme Court is appearing skeptical  against Apple in arguments over whether customers of those iPhone apps can  actually sue Apple over its potential illegal monopoly on app sales.</p><p>Let's get to black Friday and cyber Monday setting sales records, look at  this, MasterCard projecting shoppers spent $23 billion on black Friday.

He is fired up and ready to take it on, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back.</p><p>A special Senate election is bringing President Trump to Tupelo,  Mississippi. The president will be holding a make America great again rally  in support of controversial junior Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith now accused of  making racist comments. </p><p>Fox News reporter Kristin Fisher has more. Kristin?</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Well, Liz, President Trump just wrapped  his first of two rallies tonight in Mississippi in support of the  Republican candidate in this race Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. You know, the  president's track record is pretty good. He proved to be very helpful for  all the Republican Senate candidates that he campaigned for earlier this  month during the midterms.</p><p>And so, he's really helping that that same strategy is going to work  tomorrow right here in Mississippi. Now Mississippi, this is a deep red  state, so you might think that the Republican Senate candidate in this race  might need any help. But she has come under a lot of heat for a racially  tense remark that she made earlier this month.</p><p>She was caught on camera praising a supporter by saying, quote, \"if he  invited me to a public hanging I'd be on the front row.\" Now she since  apologized, but that remark has been following her nonstop on the campaign  trail especially since her Democrat opponent in this race Mike Espy, he's  trying to become Mississippi's first black senator since reconstruction.</p><p>He's dealing with his issues though, his baggage from his time in the  Clinton administration when he was indicted for accepting improper gifts,  though he was later acquitted on all counts. </p><p>And then there's also his more recent lobbying for an African dictator  currently on trial for crimes against humanity. So, in the end, this race  it is going to all come down to turn out as most elections are on non- election day. It's turned out absolutely key. That's why President Trump is  coming here. And why he came here tonight in Tupelo and why he's going to  Biloxi in just a few hours. </p><p>He's hoping that all of these folks, all of his supporters that came out to  see him tonight he's hoping that they will get out and vote for Cindy Hyde- Smith tomorrow in what is the final Senate race to be decided in 2018. This  is it, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Kristin, live in Tupelo, Mississippi. Great to see you,  Kristin. Thank you so much. The clock now ticking on Capitol Hill to  potential government shutdown over the border and it's unfolding as it is  now show time for Nancy Pelosi. She is now set to reclaim her role this  Wednesday as House speaker. High-fives there as the Dems did take 40 seats  in the House. </p><p>But here's the problem with the Democrats. Massive leadership  deterioration. No fresh talent. No fresh leadership, no accountability. Big  losses over the last decade at all levels of government.</p><p>Joining me now is the American Conservative Union chair, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you, Matt. Your take here.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  I think the Democrats  are in a world of hurt in the House. I think it's very interesting to  watch. Nancy Pelosi was always considered the most progressive of  progressive. She's from San Francisco. She's always been to the left on  every major issue, but now it seems like she's lost the support of some of  these new upstarts that just were elected to her caucus majority. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, here's the thing. The House Republicans have term limits on  their committees of committee chairs and the chairs of subcommittees. The  Democrats do not have that. So, there's no other Democrat running against  Pelosi for speaker. What does that tell you about Dem leadership? Some  critics say this is insane, Matt, that this is why the Democrat Party has  imploded when it comes to leadership.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, the other thing is not only do they have these 70-year-olds  who are wanting to take all these leadership positions at all these are  committee gavels. You know, the other issue that's involved in all this is  that you have a fair number of new Democrats who were elected partially on  the promise that they wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi. </p><p>Now if give Nancy Pelosi a lot of credit. She is arm twisting. She is  hammering them. She is pressuring them to vote for her, but many of them in  voting for Nancy Pelosi will break a campaign promise and they won -- and  many of them won in districts that Republicans previously held.</p><p>So, as a Republican, I'm kind of just enjoying the whole spectacle.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, because Nancy Pelosi hands out the plum committee  assignments and then they meet the Democrats of the top leadership, they  meet behind closed doors and tell the junior Democrats how to vote.</p><p>Here's the thing, Matt. We saw Democrats Rahm Emanuel, Kirstjen Gillibrand,  and Chris Van Hollen quit the House at the first good opportunity because  of the sclerotic top-down leadership from Pelosi.</p><p>And here's the thing, Matt. Critics have said if Barack Obama had run for  the House, as he did in 2001 and if he won back in 2000, Barack Obama might  still be stuck. He might still be stuck trying to advance for--</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- trying to get beyond the House energy committee where Bobby  Rush his opponent won and that's where he says.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a very fair point. Look at all the freshman senators who ran  for president, you had people like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, you know,  running for president, Rand Paul where they haven't even in the Senate that  long on the Republican side. </p><p>The same is true with Barack Obama on the Democratic side. It seems like in  politics these days in America you got to go up or you're out. And just  hanging around the old phrase used to be, go along to get along and that  seems to be dead because if you don't move up you just kind of stuck and  when you're in the minority in the Houses as these Republicans are going to  realize there is not a whole lot to do, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, let me ask you something. Will the House Republicans get  more vocal and will the House Democrats get more vocal? Because if Nancy  Pelosi is doing top-down, Nancy Pelosi may realize, she probably realizes,  you do need electrifying new leadership to take on a guy like Trump, right?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes, that's exactly right. Look, I think Nancy Pelosi is in a  fight here that she might very well win, but she's about yesterday, and I  think there's a lot of Democrats in her caucus in the House that realize  they got to find a new generation of leadership. And it's going to be very  interesting.</p><p>Because let's face it. They elected a lot of new faces. Some of them were  very interesting. Some of them don't. Are not that impressive for my point  of view, but others are. And it's going to be very interesting to see if  they can project a leader who represents these new diverse congresspeople  who have been elected all over the country.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Smart insights and analysis from Matt Schlapp. We love having  you on, Matt. Great to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We're coming into the bottom of the hour. Coming up, what  do taxes and suburban Republican soccer mom have in common a lot. They've  got a lot in common. Losing those suburban soccer moms that might be the  Republican's biggest fear. We're going to explain that next. </p><p>And later in the show. Ukraine declares martial law after Russia fired on  several of its navy ships, wounding numerous sailors. General Jack Keane is  here to break it all down. That's up there. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The Camp Fire in Northern California now contained. But tens of  thousands still homeless, plus a number of missing statewide still 296.  That is down from about 1,000 people thought to be missing just a few days  ago. The death toll statewide hitting 88. Almost 19,000 buildings have been  destroyed.</p><p>The scorch land amounts of the size of two Rhode Islands or one Delaware  that has been burned in the state of California in his recent spate of  fires.</p><p>Joining me now is a vice mayor of Paradise, California. He is Greg Bolin.  Your honor, it's so great to have you on the show. It is a world of pain.  We were talking about this here at the Fox Business Network.</p><p>And the town of Paradise it's an ashy eerie quiet right now. Can you bring  us up to date what's going on?</p><p>GREG BOLIN, VICE MAYOR, PARADISE, CALIFORNIA:  Well, right now we just have  an army of people up there all doing their best to get through town and  start putting power back in and get the water up and running. Our  infrastructures just completely gone, so they're just trying to get to  resources in there. </p><p>I just talked to someone today, one of the policemen. They have around 25  to 30 cranes in there, removing trees that are damaged or destroyed, and  trying to set new poles and get things going again. It's a monumental task,  but we've got a lot of people there to move it and make it happen.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What is the prognosis for going forward and rebuilding?</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Well, that's a great question. I can't say that  I've been here before. None of us have been here before. Even the experts  are saying this is even new to them. You know, right now, it's one day at a  time. The meeting I'm sitting in, they are very happy with their progress.  They are moving forward very fast.</p><p>But the size of this thing, it is going to cost -- it will take some time  to get it to where people can move back in, even into home that did not get  destroyed.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Again, people lost -- this is such a painful story. It is  absolutely heartbreaking. It is heartache. We are showing images on camera  right now of the rescue effort. Looking back, you know, years from now,  vice mayor, what will stand out to you when it comes to what happened?</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Well, people are lost. We are here -- I'm here at  the disaster center right now in Chico. We are meeting people, talking to  them, answering what questions we can answer. But you know what, every time  I leave here, I am more encouraged than I was before. There is a sense of  optimism. They want to move back. They want to build their houses back  again and make Paradise better than it was before.</p><p>So, even though the shock is devastating and most of us including myself  lost everything we had, I live out of two bags right now, and most of the  people in the same way.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Vice mayor, you are living out of two bags? Is that what you  just said? This is such a devastating situation that can drive people to  their knees at night, at home, alone, in the shower, in the hallway. I  mean, you're saying now that you're living out of two bags, is that what  you just said?</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Well, all my possessions are in two bags. Those two  bags, that's everything I got. We came out of -- we got what we could. We  got some pictures out. But most of our possessions fit in our car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  That's the way everybody is. We had to flee and get  out of there and we didn't have time to wait. But that's everybody. But you  know, it's still amazing to see the optimism. I just got done talking to a  guy. He is an elderly person who said, I'm going back, how long before I  can start building?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  I'm going to be back up there. They want to get  back to Paradise. That's home. They want to be back there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Just be safe. We got to have you guys safe up there. You  know, when things break down, humanity steps up. That's the story you just  gave us, vice mayor. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Keep praying for us.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We will.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Don't forget about us.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We will. Absolutely we will.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Vice Mayor Greg Bolin of Paradise, California. Switching gears  now, the Republicans' biggest fear in 2020 may be losing the Republican  suburban soccer mom, those moms always worried about pocketbook issues.  They won't be happy about Republicans capping a popular deduction for state  and local taxes when they do their tax returns next year, may even lost  Republican House seats in the midterms.</p><p>Let's bring in the political panel, Kelsey Harkness with The Daily Signal  and look who is here, Democrat strategist Scott Bolden. We welcome you  both. Thank you so much.</p><p>SCOTT BOLDEN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Thank you.</p><p>KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR NEWS PRODUCER, THE DAILY SIGNAL:  Glad to be here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Kelsey, first to you. Five high tax states actually lost  Republican seats in the midterms. What is your take on what is coming when  it comes to the salt deductions?</p><p>HARKNESS:  I think that tax reform is actually a winning issue for  Republicans. I think if Republicans figure out how to communicate, how the  tax reform plan has been good for them, and what more they could do if we  continue down this path of lowering taxes for every day Americans and  businesses to stimulate the economy, I do think it will suit President  Trump very well in 2020.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's shift gear here, Scott. Socialist Democrats still talking  about free things like Medicare for all. Everybody knows that taxpayers  have to put (ph) the bill there. You know, we are not hearing much about  from Democrat socialist free college, free college tuition. Why is that,  Scott?</p><p>BOLDEN:  I'm trying to get over the term socialist Democrats but I'll move  on from there. The reality is that we really don't know how to figure out  or get people to trust how we pay for one. But secondly, the white working  class just simply aren't buying it. Sixty percent of Americans like the  idea compared to 38 percent.</p><p>But the reality is it's not selling with that group that we need to pull  from Trump in 2020 and bring them back to the -- bring them back to the  Democratic Party.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Kelsey --</p><p>BOLDEN:  Those are two short answers.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, I hear you, Scott. Kelsey, federal aid to colleges has  exploded to nearly $160 billion a year, but that has only fueled rampant  tuition price hikes. The families out there watching know that. They know  that we've also nationalized student loans. Taxpayers are on the hook for  that. The more money you give to colleges, the more they raise tuition,  Kelsey.</p><p>HARKNESS:  Absolutely. College affordability is an issue that all Americans  are --</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>HARKNESS:  -- concerned about. It is something that moving forward I think  Republicans and Democrats could come together, but providing free college  is certainly not the answer. That is going to cause more trouble for the  country.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Scott, I'm so sorry. We ran out of time. Scott, we want to have  you back on. Kelsey, too. You guys have been great.</p><p>BOLDEN:  Sure.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you so much.</p><p>HARKNESS:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey says he will not  agree to closed hearings before Congress next week. He wants a public  hearing instead. Republicans say he is doing fake (ph) grandstanding. We've  got a common sense fix to stop James Comey here. We bring in Judge  Napolitano on that.</p><p>But first, the Ukraine declaring martial law after Vladimir Putin's forces  opened fire on Ukrainian navy vessels over the weekend, wounding a number  of sailors. Tensions ratcheting up. NATO calling an emergency meeting over  this. We are going to tell you what it all means. That's coming up, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. The Ukraine declaring martial law today in  regions bordering Russia. This after Russian forces opened fire on its  naval vessels over the weekend. They seized three of those vessels and left  several sailors wounded. NATO calling an emergency meeting, expressing full  support of the Ukraine.</p><p>Joining me now, retired four stars army general and Fox News senior  strategic analyst General Jack Keane. Great to see you, general.</p><p>JACK KEANE, SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST, FOX NEWS:  Yeah, great to see you,  Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What's your take on the situation because Russia is trying to  claim that it was provoked by the Ukraine navy.</p><p>KEANE:  That's likely a bald-faced lie, to be frank about it. They lie  through their teeth on all of these things. In every incident they have,  they always claim that they were provoked and they just had to take action.</p><p>What this is really about, Putin's strategy here, five years after he moved  into -- almost five years after he moved in to Crimea and the eastern part  of Ukraine, he's already trying to squeeze Ukraine even more economically.</p><p>North of the Kerch Strait where this incident took place is the Sea of  Azov. There are two or three ports there in Ukraine that are used to bring  out a lot of exports out of that country particularly steel. They move down  through the strait in to the Black Sea and then out into the European and  global markets.</p><p>Putin, I think, is leading up to squeezing that as much as he possibly can.  He doesn't like the fact that Ukraine looks to the west for economic  support from the E.U. and also from the United States, and he's trying to  continue to discourage that. So that's the strategic thing that's taken  place on Putin's part.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General, what was your reaction to Democrat Senator Ben Cardin  criticizing President Trump today, saying that Trump is helping Vladimir  Putin \"weaken the west by threatening NATO?\"</p><p>KEANE:  Yeah, I was surprised by that. Senator Cardin is a knowledgeable  and respected member of the Senate. I agree with the statement that Putin's  strategy is to weaken the transatlantic alliance, NATO, that is, and in my  perspective, I think eventually force its collapse.</p><p>But he is dead wrong when he suggests that President Trump is weakening  NATO. Quite the contrary. This is the first president in years who has  actually gone to lengths to strengthen NATO by forcing them to increase the  funding of the fence. And that is absolutely taking place largely because  of the criticism that President Trump has unleashed against the NATO  members leaders.</p><p>Also, we are pushing troops, Liz, into Eastern Europe as a deterrence  against Russian aggression. That's U.S. troops and NATO troops. So, the  senator is off in his conclusion there about Trump weakening NATO. Quite  the contrary.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And general, he is also suggesting Trump is not confronting  Putin. What's your take on that?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I don't get that either because the facts don't support it. I  mean, people overreact to the president wanting to have good relationship  with adversarial leaders. North Korea, China, and Russia to name the three  of them.</p><p>But the truth is, quite the contrary. He has issued sanctions as result of  election meddling, as result of killing the Russian critic in the U.K. with  a chemical biological weapon close to consulate throughout scores of  Russian officials from here.</p><p>He has provided Ukraine with lethal aid. Obama refused to do it for four  years. President Trump has done that to provide even more lethal aid. And  twice he has struck the Russian proxy in Syria, the Assad regime, for the  use of chemical weapons.</p><p>So, despite the rhetoric that President Trump wants relations to be good  with Putin to see if we can solve some tough problems together, the  policies that he is enacting are clearly pushing back on Russian  aggression.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General Jack Keane, thank you so much for your insight and  analysis tonight. It was terrific. Thank you for your service to our  country. Great to see you, general.</p><p>KEANE:  Always good talking to you, Liz. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up next, former FBI Director James Comey is  grandstanding, says Republicans. Comey saying he will resist any subpoena  from House Republicans. We are going to ask Judge Napolitano about how  there is a common sense answer to stop Comey here from Trey Gowdy. That's  next.</p><p>And then the crisis at the border. Migrants throwing rocks and other  projectiles. The border patrol firing teargas. Border patrol now getting  blasted. Border patrol now saying the migrants are actually pushing women  and children to the front. Also new detail on how bad the crime really was  pouring over the border under Obama.</p><p>Maxine Waters trying to say it is all political ploy by Trump. We are going  to show how she is wrong. That's coming up with Senator-elect Kevin Cramer.  He is up, next. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Former FBI Director James Comey now says he will stand up to  any subpoena from House Republicans to testify behind closed doors unless  he is allowed to testify in open public. There is a common sense fix here  from Republican Trey Gowdy. He says forget the public congressional  testimony. Instead, why not just videotape Comey's testimony and then make  it public.</p><p>Let's bring in Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial analyst.  What do you think of that?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST, FOX NEWS:  You know, when he  was the head of the FBI, a lot of my FBI buddies and I had a lot of  admiration for him. He was very, very popular. He always supported the  troops. But some of the stuff -- I mean, the FBI agents in the field who  risk their lives every day, some of the stuff is so political.</p><p>I don't think he wants the public hearing for self-aggrandisement. I think  he wants to run out the clock until the Republicans who control the  Judiciary Committee become the minority in six weeks.</p><p>Look, either a subpoena is valid or it's not, it's valid if it's properly  served. And if they want to ask you questions that you likely don't know an  answer about, you can't choose before --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Does it stay valid when the Democrats take control?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No. They would either not issue it because they don't care or  they would issue their own. Now, on the substance, I would actually agree  with him. I think the secret hearings are terrible. The public has the  right to watch the questioner and watch the witness and draw their own  conclusions.</p><p>If this hearing is held in secret, Republicans will leak their version,  Democrats will leak their version, and the public, we pay all their  salaries, are treated like children.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Trey Gowdy is saying that's better than nothing. Actually, he  is saying in a public hearing, it's actually worse because you only have  five minutes to do a Q&amp;A with the guy.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, it doesn't have to be a videotape if they don't want a  videotape. It can be a transcript of what has said. But when only certain  people know the questions and answers and they got to do the leaking,  that's government they leak.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Are they going to get it done? Are Republicans get this done?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What took them so long? Why did it take so long?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That has been a very valid criticism of them because the  Republicans have controlled the House of Representatives and the White  House for the past two years. They didn't serve any subpoenas. They did it  all by negotiating.</p><p>Now in the death rows of their tenure, they're finally serving a subpoena.  They could have done this a year and a half ago at the time he was fired by  the president.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Finishing off a tweet by -- the president has been  tweeting about this. He has been very upset with of course again tweeting  about the Mueller probe. What's your take now with the Mueller probe? Are  we going to get the results?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I happen to believe that the president is being advised by his  lawyers not to tweet, not to taunt the alligator until after he crosses the  stream, and the president is rejecting that advice. I don't know where is  this going to go but I have a feeling, a feeling a lot is going to come  down from Bob Mueller before Christmas and some after the Democrats take  control of the House after Christmas.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow. Judge, will you come back? We need you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Of course.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Judge Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'll see you in the morning.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you. We love the judge. You know, Barney (ph) says  this is a spin-off show.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Barney (ph) is trying to take credit for your success.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, he is.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up next, Democrat Maxine Waters is trying to say the  crisis at the border is just a political ploy by President Trump. We will  bring in Republican Senator-elect Kevin Cramer. He is fired up about that.  He is ready to go. Stay there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL  COMMENTATOR:   There's not one indictment, there's not one conviction that Mueller has  that has anything to do with the Russians having anything to do with the  election in 2016.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Fast-moving developments at the border. Border officials  defending their use of teargas after 500 migrants rushed the border. They  said migrants are shoving women and children to the front. If they were  really peaceful asylum-seekers, the migrants would not be throwing rocks at  border patrol officials.</p><p>Dozens of migrants were arrested on the U.S. side of the border for  crossing illegally. Also, Democrat Maxine Waters says the crisis there is  nothing but a political ploy by President Trump. Kevin Cramer is a  Republican senator-elect from North Dakota. He joins us now. Great to see  you, sir.</p><p>REP. KEVIN CRAMER (R), NORTH DAKOTA:  Good to be with you. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sir, what is your take on all of this?</p><p>CRAMER:  I think that Congresswoman Waters is missing the entire point. I'm  surprised because if there's one thing that the crisis at the border has  shown us, it really should be a wake-up call for all of those who doubted  the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>To somehow suggest that it is manufactured crisis when there are 6,000  people who walked all the way through their country of Mexico to come to  our border and try to storm it, that's not a fabrication, that's not a  Hollywood production, those are real people. I think that it deserves the  type of scrutiny that our president is giving.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, sir, it's hard to say that it is not a crisis when there's  a video showing what's happening. You know there are some 5,000 migrants  camped in Tijuana. You know there has been information coming in that the  government documents show that under Obama, there was something like more  than 24,000 serious incidents that occurred in 2014 of crime and violence  among illegal border crossers.</p><p>CRAMER:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  How can Maxine Waters say this is just a stunt?</p><p>CRAMER:  Because Maxine Waters is doing the exact thing that she is  accusing our president of doing and that is politicizing the crisis. That's  exactly the wrong approach. I think, you know, few weeks ago, our voters  voted in a divided government to replace the unified Republican government.</p><p>I think the message that I take away from that is that they want two sides  to get together and come up with some solutions. I think there are  solutions that should be acceptable to all sides as long as one side is  willing to give the other side something in exchange for the thing that  they want.</p><p>That's been the problem with the four pillars approach that the president  offered up which I thought had winners all the way around but the winners  didn't want to be winners unless somebody else is a loser. I think that's  exactly what the borders are telling us they don't want in this next  Congress.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Here is Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border  Council. He said this -- Here's what he said this morning about what's  going on. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRANDON JUDD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL UNION:  Our agents did not  deploy teargas until they were hit with projectiles. Rocks and bottles.  That's when they in fact deploy the teargas. If you look at what this  caravan did, they pushed the women and children up to the front. How  monstrous is that?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Your reaction to that, sir?</p><p>CRAMER:  Well, clearly, this is not the type of refugee crisis that is  sponsored by your local church. The refugees have come here through the  right process, come with sponsors. They come through the legal process. And  I think that he's exactly right.</p><p>When you look at the video, when you think that they can't possibly be  peace-loving asylum seekers, who would do this to children and women and  innocent people, nor were they storm a border illegally, they've come  through illegal (ph) process, in which case they would be met with the type  of hospitality that is significant and that is our tradition.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Kevin Cramer, senator-elect out of North Dakota. Great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it. We welcome you  back on soon.</p><p>CRAMER:  My pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you for having us in your homes.  It has been a jam- packed hour. Thank you so much for watching. Lou Dobbs is here next on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Well, we wish Tesla the  very best. Thanks, gang. Bulls and Bears.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We don't like it. I believe  they'll be opening up something else. I was very tough. I spoke with her  when I heard they were closing. And I said, you know, this company has done  a lot for General Motors. You better get back in there soon. That's Ohio.  And you better get back in there soon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, we have a lot of pressure on them. You have senators, you have a lot of  other people, a lot of pressure. They say the Chevy Cruise is not selling  well. I said well, they get somebody -- get a car that is selling well and  put it back in. So, I think you are going to see something else happen  there, but I'm not happy about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  President Trump fighting  to protect U.S. jobs, slamming General Motors over its new plan to lay off  thousands of workers and close multiple factories. We've got the details  straightening out the media hysteria now trying to politicize this one. Big  hint. It potentially involves a let's make a deal throwdown from G.M. on  tariffs. We've got the story.</p><p>To big tech now facing big problems at home and abroad. Facebook under  historic pressure in the U.K. The Brits now say they do not believe Mark  Zuckerberg anymore as the U.K. parliament seizes Facebook and Zuckerberg's  private company e-mails. And they urge corporate boycotts. </p><p>Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn, she's fired up and ready to go on that one.  And how President Trump was right about both Facebook and Google. </p><p>To Nancy Pelosi now facing a raucous, contentious vote Democrat leadership  vote this week. Her first fight with President Trump is here. A possible  government shutdown over the border wall. Matt Schlapp weighs on that. </p><p>And the big weakness in the Democrat Party that Trump can capitalize on.  The Ukraine just declared martial law after a Russia fired on its navy  ships over the weekend wounding several sailors. This after Ukrainian  protesters swarmed the Russian consulate over the weekend. We've got  General Jack Keane on that, coming up.</p><p>To President Trump threatening to shut the border permanently as Democrat  Maxine Waters now tries to claim the border crisis is just a political  stunt by President Trump. This, as border officials now say migrants  purposely used women and children as human shields as migrants threw rocks  at border agents.</p><p>We've got that and news on secret government documents showing how bad the  crime really was pouring over the border during the Obama years. You will  not believe the new numbers. We take that on.</p><p>And Republicans undercutting a defiant James Comey. Saying Comey is  basically doing fake grandstanding about resisting a subpoena for closed- door testimony next week. Judge Napolitano joins us to explain and the  common-sense solution to all that. </p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we're going to bring you the debate beyond tomorrow's headlines.  I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p>Welcome to the show. You're watching the Fox Business Network. </p><p>President Trump pushing back hard on General Motors today after G.M. said  it may lay off up to 14,800 jobs in North America including jobs in the big  swing state of Ohio. The UAW, the big labor union agrees with Trump, so  does Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. </p><p>Edward Lawrence is here with more. Edward, here's the back story. The UAW  union labor contract with G.M. expires next year. G.M. does not want a  labor union strike. So, this could be a bargaining throw down by General  Motors to get Trump to dial back on the tariffs. The White House already  said it could give a waiver to save jobs for other companies when it  granted waivers on steel tariffs to seven big corporations. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  To you, what do you say, Edward? </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Well, you know, G.M., though, the cars haven't been selling as  well as Ford, too. It comes down to sales too. But it could be a little of  all of that mixed in here. The labor unions and automakers have always been  at odds over and over and over again. And G.M. did not have a great deal  the last time around for its investors. They're trying to get a better deal  going forward.</p><p>But, again, it also boils down to sales. Now isn't it funny though, Liz,  how some of these decisions by automakers bring political opponents  together. You mention all of these folks in the same sentence supporting  President Trump to get back into Ohio. </p><p>Well, the announcement shocks and many sent ripples to the White House  today while President Donald Trump says he will pressure G.M. to bring  those jobs back to Ohio. He says that he told the G.M. CEO, Mary Barra to  get back into Ohio. </p><p>Barra met White House adviser or economic adviser Larry Kudlow today. And  this is part of the pressure now to get G.M. to reconsider closing seven  plants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I spoke with her when I heard they were closing and I said, you  know, this one country has done a lot for General Motors. You better get  back in there soon. That's Ohio. And you better get back in there soon. </p><p>So, we have a lot of pressure on them. You have senators, you have a lot of  other people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now four factories in the U.S. and one in Canada could be closed  by the end of 2019. The other two are outside North America. The plant  closing in Ohio specifically angered the president and shocked Ohio Senator  Rob Portman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  General Motors has let down those workers who  have done so much for General Motors. I'm disappointed on that. What I said  several months ago to G.M., and again more recently, a couple of months ago  in meetings with their CEO and in discussions with their executive is we  need another product. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now Ohio is crucial for the 2020 presidential race. The  president has made it a priority to help people especially there get back  to work. Liz? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. To our viewers, the issue is whether  G.M. could retool U.S. factories to build SUVs and trucks. That's the issue  too, right, Edward?</p><p>OK. We lost Edward there. We're going to move on.</p><p>Members of the U.K. parliament now urging big companies to boycott  advertising on Google and Facebook because these guys still have not  stopped terror content and other negative content on their platforms.  Companies don't like when their ads to show up next to this content.</p><p>This is also what's happening. There's push back in Canada, Ireland,  Argentina, Brazil, Singapore, and Latvia as well against Facebook and  social media.</p><p>Let's bring in Tennessee Senator-elect Masha Blackburn. Great to see you,  Marsha. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>SEN.-ELECT MARSHA BLACKBURN, (R), TENNESSEE:  Good to see you. Thanks.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What's your reaction to the story? </p><p>BLACKBURN:  It just seems like there is no end to the number of messes that  you see Google and Facebook and Twitter and that FAANGS as they are called  getting themselves into these days. And I know that they have the ability  to do a little bit more policing on their networks that they then they are  doing. </p><p>But Liz, they are choosing not to do that. And I think that the American  people are getting wise to this. They are tired of the privacy breaches  that you are seeing, the invasion of privacy, and the data breaches. And  what people want to know is that there is the ability for they themselves  to protect their virtual you and protect their sensitive information.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. That's an important point because the pushback is Facebook  and other social media, they are collecting data on you that you don't know  about. </p><p>You know what's really interesting, Congressman and Senator-elect is that  the U.K., the United Kingdom is really pushing back hard, they don't  believe Facebook at all and they believe Facebook purposely built and knew  about a back door so companies like Cambridge Analytica could get in and  take our information. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  This is the reason I wrote the BROWSER Act. What you saw in  2015 and 2016 from the Obama administration was trying to put in privacy  rules that would only affect your internet service provider and they did  not want it to apply to the entire ecosystem.</p><p>Now the U.K. moved forward with some privacy regulations that are more  stringent than anything we've considered in the U.S. But here is the thing  and the nugget. You, the consumer should have the ability to protect your  information and your sensitive data and say you do or do not want that  shared. Then for non-sensitive data you should have the ability to say I'm  going to opt out and not allow you to gather this information on me. </p><p>What we have seen some of these platforms to do and these are the apps,  basically that are not present, if you will, on your screen. They go in  they scrape your data.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  And they pull all that information and then they sell that or  they use it for their advertisers and you, the consumer, know nothing about  and you can't stop it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And you know Jane Wong, she is a UMass Dartmouth underground,  Marsha. She basically reverses engineered apps. She wants to see what they  were collecting. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  She discovers shocking new information that we didn't know  about, that these apps are actually tracking the cell towers and the Wi-Fi  networks near you to find out where you're located, and now Google may  track your movement and your behaviors inside your home via Google devices,  including that of your children, Marsha.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's exactly right. And here is the thing about that. Even if  your device is not activated, turned off, the SIM card pulled that Google  operating system still tracks every single base station that you are  passing. And so, they are tracking you. And then also if it is an in-home  device that you can say, OK, Google play this or do that it is recording  and storing all of that and other conversation bits and pieces. </p><p>MACDONALD:  It is unbelievable. We thought big brother--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We thought big brother was in government. It's in Silicon  Valley. Senator-elect--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, that's right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn, it's been great to see you  have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us. I appreciate it.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now is the time to break up big tech monopoly on things like  that and public discourse. Let's bring in Reason magazine staff editor  Robby Soave, and business attorney and tech expert, Domenic Romano.  Domenic, what do you think. </p><p>DOMENIC ROMANO, BUSINESS ATTORNEY:  I agree with Senator-elect Blackburn. I  think a surgical approach is necessary. I don't think these companies can  be trusted to regulate themselves. You know, they say the superpower,  absolute power corrupts, absolutely, who controls the controllers. It's  time for some regulation. </p><p>In fact, Zuckerberg and Cook are asking for that, at least earlier they  expressed a willingness for some regulation.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's interesting. Robby, what do you think?</p><p>ROBBY SOAVE, STAFF EDITOR, REASON MAGAZINE:  Well, I'm also concerned about  privacy but I'm more concerned about the government having access to this  information. I don't particularly trust Congress to regulate these  companies very well. I don't think they have a strong base of knowledge for  how to do so. </p><p>And you know, you can ultimately decide to opt out of some of these  services just by not using now. I mean, Facebook is crashing and burning  recently because people don't like it. So, there is a, there is a market  check on their behavior. The only true monopoly is one actually maintained  by the government and I worry that's what could happen inadvertently if we  get the government to get involved.</p><p>ROMANO:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And Robby makes an important point, Domenic. Facebook though  does track you even if you unplug Facebook. In other words, Domenic  Facebook still follows you around the internet even after you've killed off  your Facebook.</p><p>ROMANO:  Well, that's the whole point. I think it's an overstatement to say  that Facebook is crushed and burned. They've loss the music but still the  dominant platform. So, I think it's time to regulate, but it should be  surgical, it should be measured. and that it should be very, very limited  to start.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And Robby, you know, the U.K., the United Kingdom Britain  clearly not believing Zuckerberg anymore. They say he may have known about  privacy abuses and other problems way earlier than he has said according to  e-mails at U.K. parliament has seize. What do you think, Robby?</p><p>SOAVE:  Well, that's true, but of course Europe has different laws in some  important ways, right. Don't have a First Amendment, they can -- you can be  arrested for hate speech there so they take kind of these matters a little  differently.</p><p>Look, I just think it's going be quite difficult to put the genie back in  the bottle relating to some of these privacy concerns. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>SOAVE:  I'm concerned about privacy as well, but these are difficult  questions.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Robby and Domenic, that's why we want to have you guys back on  to talk about it. </p><p>ROMANO:  I love to.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's a developing story. Great to see both. Thank you so much. </p><p>ROMANO:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  In other headlines, the Supreme Court is appearing skeptical  against Apple in arguments over whether customers of those iPhone apps can  actually sue Apple over its potential illegal monopoly on app sales.</p><p>Let's get to black Friday and cyber Monday setting sales records, look at  this, MasterCard projecting shoppers spent $23 billion on black Friday.  Adobe says shoppers are on track to spend nearly $8 million during today's  cyber Monday -- cyber Monday shopping extravaganza. </p><p>And we've got a stunning accomplishment for NASA high- fives all around.  The Mars insight Lander successfully touched down on Mars earlier this  afternoon. This lander made a 300-million-mile trek to Mars. This is the  second U.S. robot to land on the red planet. The first was a curiosity  rover in 2012.</p><p>And take a look at this. A brutal fight erupting during last night's  football game between the Buffalo Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The  brawl ended with running back Leonard Fournette of Jacksonville and the  bills shock loss in getting ejected from the game. Fournette has since  apologized on Twitter.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump holding not one but two rallies tonight in  Mississippi. We're on the ground with the latest from the president. </p><p>Also coming up, a potential government shutdown. The first fight Nancy  Pelosi faces as she is expected to win the Democratic House speakership.  The election is coming up this Wednesday. We've got all those fights and  we're going to show you what is really going on and what is going wrong  with the Democrat Party behind the scenes.</p><p>Matta Schlapp, he's here. He is fired up and ready to take it on, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back.</p><p>A special Senate election is bringing President Trump to Tupelo,  Mississippi. The president will be holding a make America great again rally  in support of controversial junior Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith now accused of  making racist comments. </p><p>Fox News reporter Kristin Fisher has more. Kristin?</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Well, Liz, President Trump just wrapped  his first of two rallies tonight in Mississippi in support of the  Republican candidate in this race Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. You know, the  president's track record is pretty good. He proved to be very helpful for  all the Republican Senate candidates that he campaigned for earlier this  month during the midterms.</p><p>And so, he's really helping that that same strategy is going to work  tomorrow right here in Mississippi. Now Mississippi, this is a deep red  state, so you might think that the Republican Senate candidate in this race  might need any help. But she has come under a lot of heat for a racially  tense remark that she made earlier this month.</p><p>She was caught on camera praising a supporter by saying, quote, \"if he  invited me to a public hanging I'd be on the front row.\" Now she since  apologized, but that remark has been following her nonstop on the campaign  trail especially since her Democrat opponent in this race Mike Espy, he's  trying to become Mississippi's first black senator since reconstruction.</p><p>He's dealing with his issues though, his baggage from his time in the  Clinton administration when he was indicted for accepting improper gifts,  though he was later acquitted on all counts. </p><p>And then there's also his more recent lobbying for an African dictator  currently on trial for crimes against humanity. So, in the end, this race  it is going to all come down to turn out as most elections are on non- election day. It's turned out absolutely key. That's why President Trump is  coming here. And why he came here tonight in Tupelo and why he's going to  Biloxi in just a few hours. </p><p>He's hoping that all of these folks, all of his supporters that came out to  see him tonight he's hoping that they will get out and vote for Cindy Hyde- Smith tomorrow in what is the final Senate race to be decided in 2018. This  is it, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Kristin, live in Tupelo, Mississippi. Great to see you,  Kristin. Thank you so much. The clock now ticking on Capitol Hill to  potential government shutdown over the border and it's unfolding as it is  now show time for Nancy Pelosi. She is now set to reclaim her role this  Wednesday as House speaker. High-fives there as the Dems did take 40 seats  in the House. </p><p>But here's the problem with the Democrats. Massive leadership  deterioration. No fresh talent. No fresh leadership, no accountability. Big  losses over the last decade at all levels of government.</p><p>Joining me now is the American Conservative Union chair, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you, Matt. Your take here.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  I think the Democrats  are in a world of hurt in the House. I think it's very interesting to  watch. Nancy Pelosi was always considered the most progressive of  progressive. She's from San Francisco. She's always been to the left on  every major issue, but now it seems like she's lost the support of some of  these new upstarts that just were elected to her caucus majority. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, here's the thing. The House Republicans have term limits on  their committees of committee chairs and the chairs of subcommittees. The  Democrats do not have that. So, there's no other Democrat running against  Pelosi for speaker. What does that tell you about Dem leadership? Some  critics say this is insane, Matt, that this is why the Democrat Party has  imploded when it comes to leadership.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, the other thing is not only do they have these 70-year-olds  who are wanting to take all these leadership positions at all these are  committee gavels. You know, the other issue that's involved in all this is  that you have a fair number of new Democrats who were elected partially on  the promise that they wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi. </p><p>Now if give Nancy Pelosi a lot of credit. She is arm twisting. She is  hammering them. She is pressuring them to vote for her, but many of them in  voting for Nancy Pelosi will break a campaign promise and they won -- and  many of them won in districts that Republicans previously held.</p><p>So, as a Republican, I'm kind of just enjoying the whole spectacle.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, because Nancy Pelosi hands out the plum committee  assignments and then they meet the Democrats of the top leadership, they  meet behind closed doors and tell the junior Democrats how to vote.</p><p>Here's the thing, Matt. We saw Democrats Rahm Emanuel, Kirstjen Gillibrand,  and Chris Van Hollen quit the House at the first good opportunity because  of the sclerotic top-down leadership from Pelosi.</p><p>And here's the thing, Matt. Critics have said if Barack Obama had run for  the House, as he did in 2001 and if he won back in 2000, Barack Obama might  still be stuck. He might still be stuck trying to advance for--</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- trying to get beyond the House energy committee where Bobby  Rush his opponent won and that's where he says.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a very fair point. Look at all the freshman senators who ran  for president, you had people like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, you know,  running for president, Rand Paul where they haven't even in the Senate that  long on the Republican side. </p><p>The same is true with Barack Obama on the Democratic side. It seems like in  politics these days in America you got to go up or you're out. And just  hanging around the old phrase used to be, go along to get along and that  seems to be dead because if you don't move up you just kind of stuck and  when you're in the minority in the Houses as these Republicans are going to  realize there is not a whole lot to do, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, let me ask you something. Will the House Republicans get  more vocal and will the House Democrats get more vocal? Because if Nancy  Pelosi is doing top-down, Nancy Pelosi may realize, she probably realizes,  you do need electrifying new leadership to take on a guy like Trump, right?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes, that's exactly right. Look, I think Nancy Pelosi is in a  fight here that she might very well win, but she's about yesterday, and I  think there's a lot of Democrats in her caucus in the House that realize  they got to find a new generation of leadership. And it's going to be very  interesting.</p><p>Because let's face it. They elected a lot of new faces. Some of them were  very interesting. Some of them don't. Are not that impressive for my point  of view, but others are. And it's going to be very interesting to see if  they can project a leader who represents these new diverse congresspeople  who have been elected all over the country.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Smart insights and analysis from Matt Schlapp. We love having  you on, Matt. Great to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We're coming into the bottom of the hour. Coming up, what  do taxes and suburban Republican soccer mom have in common a lot. They've  got a lot in common. Losing those suburban soccer moms that might be the  Republican's biggest fear. We're going to explain that next. </p><p>And later in the show. Ukraine declares martial law after Russia fired on  several of its navy ships, wounding numerous sailors. General Jack Keane is  here to break it all down. That's up there. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The Camp Fire in Northern California now contained. But tens of  thousands still homeless, plus a number of missing statewide still 296.  That is down from about 1,000 people thought to be missing just a few days  ago. The death toll statewide hitting 88. Almost 19,000 buildings have been  destroyed.</p><p>The scorch land amounts of the size of two Rhode Islands or one Delaware  that has been burned in the state of California in his recent spate of  fires.</p><p>Joining me now is a vice mayor of Paradise, California. He is Greg Bolin.  Your honor, it's so great to have you on the show. It is a world of pain.  We were talking about this here at the Fox Business Network.</p><p>And the town of Paradise it's an ashy eerie quiet right now. Can you bring  us up to date what's going on?</p><p>GREG BOLIN, VICE MAYOR, PARADISE, CALIFORNIA:  Well, right now we just have  an army of people up there all doing their best to get through town and  start putting power back in and get the water up and running. Our  infrastructures just completely gone, so they're just trying to get to  resources in there. </p><p>I just talked to someone today, one of the policemen. They have around 25  to 30 cranes in there, removing trees that are damaged or destroyed, and  trying to set new poles and get things going again. It's a monumental task,  but we've got a lot of people there to move it and make it happen.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What is the prognosis for going forward and rebuilding?</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Well, that's a great question. I can't say that  I've been here before. None of us have been here before. Even the experts  are saying this is even new to them. You know, right now, it's one day at a  time. The meeting I'm sitting in, they are very happy with their progress.  They are moving forward very fast.</p><p>But the size of this thing, it is going to cost -- it will take some time  to get it to where people can move back in, even into home that did not get  destroyed.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Again, people lost -- this is such a painful story. It is  absolutely heartbreaking. It is heartache. We are showing images on camera  right now of the rescue effort. Looking back, you know, years from now,  vice mayor, what will stand out to you when it comes to what happened?</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Well, people are lost. We are here -- I'm here at  the disaster center right now in Chico. We are meeting people, talking to  them, answering what questions we can answer. But you know what, every time  I leave here, I am more encouraged than I was before. There is a sense of  optimism. They want to move back. They want to build their houses back  again and make Paradise better than it was before.</p><p>So, even though the shock is devastating and most of us including myself  lost everything we had, I live out of two bags right now, and most of the  people in the same way.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Vice mayor, you are living out of two bags? Is that what you  just said? This is such a devastating situation that can drive people to  their knees at night, at home, alone, in the shower, in the hallway. I  mean, you're saying now that you're living out of two bags, is that what  you just said?</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Well, all my possessions are in two bags. Those two  bags, that's everything I got. We came out of -- we got what we could. We  got some pictures out. But most of our possessions fit in our car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  That's the way everybody is. We had to flee and get  out of there and we didn't have time to wait. But that's everybody. But you  know, it's still amazing to see the optimism. I just got done talking to a  guy. He is an elderly person who said, I'm going back, how long before I  can start building?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  I'm going to be back up there. They want to get  back to Paradise. That's home. They want to be back there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Just be safe. We got to have you guys safe up there. You  know, when things break down, humanity steps up. That's the story you just  gave us, vice mayor. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Keep praying for us.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We will.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Don't forget about us.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We will. Absolutely we will.</p><p>BOLIN (via telephone):  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Vice Mayor Greg Bolin of Paradise, California. Switching gears  now, the Republicans' biggest fear in 2020 may be losing the Republican  suburban soccer mom, those moms always worried about pocketbook issues.  They won't be happy about Republicans capping a popular deduction for state  and local taxes when they do their tax returns next year, may even lost  Republican House seats in the midterms.</p><p>Let's bring in the political panel, Kelsey Harkness with The Daily Signal  and look who is here, Democrat strategist Scott Bolden. We welcome you  both. Thank you so much.</p><p>SCOTT BOLDEN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Thank you.</p><p>KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR NEWS PRODUCER, THE DAILY SIGNAL:  Glad to be here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Kelsey, first to you. Five high tax states actually lost  Republican seats in the midterms. What is your take on what is coming when  it comes to the salt deductions?</p><p>HARKNESS:  I think that tax reform is actually a winning issue for  Republicans. I think if Republicans figure out how to communicate, how the  tax reform plan has been good for them, and what more they could do if we  continue down this path of lowering taxes for every day Americans and  businesses to stimulate the economy, I do think it will suit President  Trump very well in 2020.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's shift gear here, Scott. Socialist Democrats still talking  about free things like Medicare for all. Everybody knows that taxpayers  have to put (ph) the bill there. You know, we are not hearing much about  from Democrat socialist free college, free college tuition. Why is that,  Scott?</p><p>BOLDEN:  I'm trying to get over the term socialist Democrats but I'll move  on from there. The reality is that we really don't know how to figure out  or get people to trust how we pay for one. But secondly, the white working  class just simply aren't buying it. Sixty percent of Americans like the  idea compared to 38 percent.</p><p>But the reality is it's not selling with that group that we need to pull  from Trump in 2020 and bring them back to the -- bring them back to the  Democratic Party.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Kelsey --</p><p>BOLDEN:  Those are two short answers.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, I hear you, Scott. Kelsey, federal aid to colleges has  exploded to nearly $160 billion a year, but that has only fueled rampant  tuition price hikes. The families out there watching know that. They know  that we've also nationalized student loans. Taxpayers are on the hook for  that. The more money you give to colleges, the more they raise tuition,  Kelsey.</p><p>HARKNESS:  Absolutely. College affordability is an issue that all Americans  are --</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>HARKNESS:  -- concerned about. It is something that moving forward I think  Republicans and Democrats could come together, but providing free college  is certainly not the answer. That is going to cause more trouble for the  country.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Scott, I'm so sorry. We ran out of time. Scott, we want to have  you back on. Kelsey, too. You guys have been great.</p><p>BOLDEN:  Sure.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you so much.</p><p>HARKNESS:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey says he will not  agree to closed hearings before Congress next week. He wants a public  hearing instead. Republicans say he is doing fake (ph) grandstanding. We've  got a common sense fix to stop James Comey here. We bring in Judge  Napolitano on that.</p><p>But first, the Ukraine declaring martial law after Vladimir Putin's forces  opened fire on Ukrainian navy vessels over the weekend, wounding a number  of sailors. Tensions ratcheting up. NATO calling an emergency meeting over  this. We are going to tell you what it all means. That's coming up, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. The Ukraine declaring martial law today in  regions bordering Russia. This after Russian forces opened fire on its  naval vessels over the weekend. They seized three of those vessels and left  several sailors wounded. NATO calling an emergency meeting, expressing full  support of the Ukraine.</p><p>Joining me now, retired four stars army general and Fox News senior  strategic analyst General Jack Keane. Great to see you, general.</p><p>JACK KEANE, SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST, FOX NEWS:  Yeah, great to see you,  Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What's your take on the situation because Russia is trying to  claim that it was provoked by the Ukraine navy.</p><p>KEANE:  That's likely a bald-faced lie, to be frank about it. They lie  through their teeth on all of these things. In every incident they have,  they always claim that they were provoked and they just had to take action.</p><p>What this is really about, Putin's strategy here, five years after he moved  into -- almost five years after he moved in to Crimea and the eastern part  of Ukraine, he's already trying to squeeze Ukraine even more economically.</p><p>North of the Kerch Strait where this incident took place is the Sea of  Azov. There are two or three ports there in Ukraine that are used to bring  out a lot of exports out of that country particularly steel. They move down  through the strait in to the Black Sea and then out into the European and  global markets.</p><p>Putin, I think, is leading up to squeezing that as much as he possibly can.  He doesn't like the fact that Ukraine looks to the west for economic  support from the E.U. and also from the United States, and he's trying to  continue to discourage that. So that's the strategic thing that's taken  place on Putin's part.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General, what was your reaction to Democrat Senator Ben Cardin  criticizing President Trump today, saying that Trump is helping Vladimir  Putin \"weaken the west by threatening NATO?\"</p><p>KEANE:  Yeah, I was surprised by that. Senator Cardin is a knowledgeable  and respected member of the Senate. I agree with the statement that Putin's  strategy is to weaken the transatlantic alliance, NATO, that is, and in my  perspective, I think eventually force its collapse.</p><p>But he is dead wrong when he suggests that President Trump is weakening  NATO. Quite the contrary. This is the first president in years who has  actually gone to lengths to strengthen NATO by forcing them to increase the  funding of the fence. And that is absolutely taking place largely because  of the criticism that President Trump has unleashed against the NATO  members leaders.</p><p>Also, we are pushing troops, Liz, into Eastern Europe as a deterrence  against Russian aggression. That's U.S. troops and NATO troops. So, the  senator is off in his conclusion there about Trump weakening NATO. Quite  the contrary.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And general, he is also suggesting Trump is not confronting  Putin. What's your take on that?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I don't get that either because the facts don't support it. I  mean, people overreact to the president wanting to have good relationship  with adversarial leaders. North Korea, China, and Russia to name the three  of them.</p><p>But the truth is, quite the contrary. He has issued sanctions as result of  election meddling, as result of killing the Russian critic in the U.K. with  a chemical biological weapon close to consulate throughout scores of  Russian officials from here.</p><p>He has provided Ukraine with lethal aid. Obama refused to do it for four  years. President Trump has done that to provide even more lethal aid. And  twice he has struck the Russian proxy in Syria, the Assad regime, for the  use of chemical weapons.</p><p>So, despite the rhetoric that President Trump wants relations to be good  with Putin to see if we can solve some tough problems together, the  policies that he is enacting are clearly pushing back on Russian  aggression.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General Jack Keane, thank you so much for your insight and  analysis tonight. It was terrific. Thank you for your service to our  country. Great to see you, general.</p><p>KEANE:  Always good talking to you, Liz. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up next, former FBI Director James Comey is  grandstanding, says Republicans. Comey saying he will resist any subpoena  from House Republicans. We are going to ask Judge Napolitano about how  there is a common sense answer to stop Comey here from Trey Gowdy. That's  next.</p><p>And then the crisis at the border. Migrants throwing rocks and other  projectiles. The border patrol firing teargas. Border patrol now getting  blasted. Border patrol now saying the migrants are actually pushing women  and children to the front. Also new detail on how bad the crime really was  pouring over the border under Obama.</p><p>Maxine Waters trying to say it is all political ploy by Trump. We are going  to show how she is wrong. That's coming up with Senator-elect Kevin Cramer.  He is up, next. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Former FBI Director James Comey now says he will stand up to  any subpoena from House Republicans to testify behind closed doors unless  he is allowed to testify in open public. There is a common sense fix here  from Republican Trey Gowdy. He says forget the public congressional  testimony. Instead, why not just videotape Comey's testimony and then make  it public.</p><p>Let's bring in Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial analyst.  What do you think of that?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST, FOX NEWS:  You know, when he  was the head of the FBI, a lot of my FBI buddies and I had a lot of  admiration for him. He was very, very popular. He always supported the  troops. But some of the stuff -- I mean, the FBI agents in the field who  risk their lives every day, some of the stuff is so political.</p><p>I don't think he wants the public hearing for self-aggrandisement. I think  he wants to run out the clock until the Republicans who control the  Judiciary Committee become the minority in six weeks.</p><p>Look, either a subpoena is valid or it's not, it's valid if it's properly  served. And if they want to ask you questions that you likely don't know an  answer about, you can't choose before --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Does it stay valid when the Democrats take control?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No. They would either not issue it because they don't care or  they would issue their own. Now, on the substance, I would actually agree  with him. I think the secret hearings are terrible. The public has the  right to watch the questioner and watch the witness and draw their own  conclusions.</p><p>If this hearing is held in secret, Republicans will leak their version,  Democrats will leak their version, and the public, we pay all their  salaries, are treated like children.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Trey Gowdy is saying that's better than nothing. Actually, he  is saying in a public hearing, it's actually worse because you only have  five minutes to do a Q&amp;A with the guy.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, it doesn't have to be a videotape if they don't want a  videotape. It can be a transcript of what has said. But when only certain  people know the questions and answers and they got to do the leaking,  that's government they leak.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Are they going to get it done? Are Republicans get this done?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What took them so long? Why did it take so long?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That has been a very valid criticism of them because the  Republicans have controlled the House of Representatives and the White  House for the past two years. They didn't serve any subpoenas. They did it  all by negotiating.</p><p>Now in the death rows of their tenure, they're finally serving a subpoena.  They could have done this a year and a half ago at the time he was fired by  the president.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Finishing off a tweet by -- the president has been  tweeting about this. He has been very upset with of course again tweeting  about the Mueller probe. What's your take now with the Mueller probe? Are  we going to get the results?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I happen to believe that the president is being advised by his  lawyers not to tweet, not to taunt the alligator until after he crosses the  stream, and the president is rejecting that advice. I don't know where is  this going to go but I have a feeling, a feeling a lot is going to come  down from Bob Mueller before Christmas and some after the Democrats take  control of the House after Christmas.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow. Judge, will you come back? We need you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Of course.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Judge Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'll see you in the morning.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you. We love the judge. You know, Barney (ph) says  this is a spin-off show.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Barney (ph) is trying to take credit for your success.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, he is.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up next, Democrat Maxine Waters is trying to say the  crisis at the border is just a political ploy by President Trump. We will  bring in Republican Senator-elect Kevin Cramer. He is fired up about that.  He is ready to go. Stay there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:   There's not one indictment, there's not one conviction that Mueller has  that has anything to do with the Russians having anything to do with the  election in 2016.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Fast-moving developments at the border. Border officials  defending their use of teargas after 500 migrants rushed the border. They  said migrants are shoving women and children to the front. If they were  really peaceful asylum-seekers, the migrants would not be throwing rocks at  border patrol officials.</p><p>Dozens of migrants were arrested on the U.S. side of the border for  crossing illegally. Also, Democrat Maxine Waters says the crisis there is  nothing but a political ploy by President Trump. Kevin Cramer is a  Republican senator-elect from North Dakota. He joins us now. Great to see  you, sir.</p><p>REP. KEVIN CRAMER (R), NORTH DAKOTA:  Good to be with you. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sir, what is your take on all of this?</p><p>CRAMER:  I think that Congresswoman Waters is missing the entire point. I'm  surprised because if there's one thing that the crisis at the border has  shown us, it really should be a wake-up call for all of those who doubted  the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>To somehow suggest that it is manufactured crisis when there are 6,000  people who walked all the way through their country of Mexico to come to  our border and try to storm it, that's not a fabrication, that's not a  Hollywood production, those are real people. I think that it deserves the  type of scrutiny that our president is giving.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, sir, it's hard to say that it is not a crisis when there's  a video showing what's happening. You know there are some 5,000 migrants  camped in Tijuana. You know there has been information coming in that the  government documents show that under Obama, there was something like more  than 24,000 serious incidents that occurred in 2014 of crime and violence  among illegal border crossers.</p><p>CRAMER:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  How can Maxine Waters say this is just a stunt?</p><p>CRAMER:  Because Maxine Waters is doing the exact thing that she is  accusing our president of doing and that is politicizing the crisis. That's  exactly the wrong approach. I think, you know, few weeks ago, our voters  voted in a divided government to replace the unified Republican government.</p><p>I think the message that I take away from that is that they want two sides  to get together and come up with some solutions. I think there are  solutions that should be acceptable to all sides as long as one side is  willing to give the other side something in exchange for the thing that  they want.</p><p>That's been the problem with the four pillars approach that the president  offered up which I thought had winners all the way around but the winners  didn't want to be winners unless somebody else is a loser. I think that's  exactly what the borders are telling us they don't want in this next  Congress.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Here is Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border  Council. He said this -- Here's what he said this morning about what's  going on. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRANDON JUDD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL UNION:  Our agents did not  deploy teargas until they were hit with projectiles. Rocks and bottles.  That's when they in fact deploy the teargas. If you look at what this  caravan did, they pushed the women and children up to the front. How  monstrous is that?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Your reaction to that, sir?</p><p>CRAMER:  Well, clearly, this is not the type of refugee crisis that is  sponsored by your local church. The refugees have come here through the  right process, come with sponsors. They come through the legal process. And  I think that he's exactly right.</p><p>When you look at the video, when you think that they can't possibly be  peace-loving asylum seekers, who would do this to children and women and  innocent people, nor were they storm a border illegally, they've come  through illegal (ph) process, in which case they would be met with the type  of hospitality that is significant and that is our tradition.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Kevin Cramer, senator-elect out of North Dakota. Great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it. We welcome you  back on soon.</p><p>CRAMER:  My pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you for having us in your homes.  It has been a jam- packed hour. Thank you so much for watching. Lou Dobbs is here next on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It was spectacular, I thought. We love you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: He asked his car to do a U-turn and to turn around to talk with those folks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shannon Bream and the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT team take it all from here. Shannon, that was a nice one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yes, you know, they had to be so shocked that the attorney general of the United States just, you know, turns around, pulls up and wants to talk to the people around demonstrate again in the middle of the street.</p><p>That happens every day, but around here in D.C., you never know. Thanks, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Exactly. Have a great show.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Well, we begin with a Fox News alert. President Trump says he's preparing aggressive executive action if his top White House negotiators can't forge a deal on a phase for COVID relief package with Democrats. Part of the holdup, Democrats demand that the Feds bail out big cities.</p><p>As tonight, New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, threatens he's going to have to take drastic action, unless, the federal government gives him $30 billion for his state over the next two years.</p><p>Well, by the way that states now rolling out coronavirus checkpoints set up around the five boroughs to crack down on visitors or residents returning home, mandating strict quarantines as wealthy New Yorkers say the combination of COVID lockdowns and violent looting mean that they and their tax dollars could be leaving the city for good as Cuomo begs them to return.</p><p>Plus, breaking tonight, former Vice President Biden trying to clean up his latest comments on African Americans, once again walking backwards that have him in hot water with some black leaders.</p><p>And tonight, even his attempt at clarification is sparking criticism from the right and the left. As we all await the Vice President's now his vice- presidential pick amid accusations he's far more progressive than he claims to be, we're digging into that.</p><p>And former presidential candidate, Tom Steyer, is here to weigh in.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT, I'm Shannon Brown. In Washington, breaking news coming in on the face for stimulus talks tonight, Leland Vittert is tracking. He's got all of the latest for us. Hey, Leland.</p><p>LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good evening, Shannon, to you we are just a few hours away from the July unemployment numbers which will tell us a lot about who is getting rehired from the mass coronavirus layoffs. But even the rosiest of estimates put the number of unemployed Americans north of 10 million.</p><p>And tonight, the senate adjourned and left town without a deal to provide any assistance to them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: We're still a considerable amount of part in terms of a compromise that could be signed into law.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We have always said that the Republicans and the president do not understand the gravity of the situation. And every time we meet with them, it is reinforced.</p><p>VITTERT: The White House Chief of Staff and House Speaker agree it's hard to agree on how to put money in the hands of unemployed Americans. Although both parties largely won a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks for those making less than 75,000 dollars, more money for schools, along with some type of enhanced unemployment benefit.</p><p>There are serious differences on amounts. For example, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would accept nothing less than an extension of the $600 per week in unemployment benefits. President Trump tweeted without a deal; he might go it alone. \"I've notified my staff to continue working on an executive order with respect to payroll tax cut eviction protections, unemployment extensions, and student loan repayment options.\"</p><p>Despite the vast constitutional powers entrusted to the commander in chief, there are serious questions on whether he can fulfill any of those promises by executive order.</p><p>But the pro-Trump group, the committee to defend the president, won't be able to argue the point using ads on Facebook. They are banned from advertising for sharing videos deemed false by fact checkers. It comes a day after Facebook and Twitter both flagged this video of the president as false.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you look at children, children are almost and I would almost say, definitely, but almost immune from this disease.</p><p>VITTERT: \"The committee to defend the president wrote the committee will not be silenced by woke Silicon Valley elites, as we expose the real Joe Biden. We have relocated our entire Facebook budget to other online platforms so Americans can see the whole truth, not just Facebook's truth.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VITTERT: All right. So, while Facebook will not say how long their advertising ban will last, the Trump campaign's Twitter account is back online with the campaign's communications director saying the Twitter employee who announced to the world why the account was briefly suspended is also Kamala Harris's former press secretary, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: It is a small world. All right, Leland, thank you.</p><p>New tonight, President Trump issuing two executive orders, targeting Chinese-run social media. The first would ban any transactions with ByteDance, now, that's the Chinese company that owns video-sharing app, TikTok, if it's not sold by the Chinese by September 20th. The same goes for an executive order on messaging app, WeChat.</p><p>Well, promising news on the COVID-19 vaccine front tonight as President Trump says a vaccine could be ready as early as November. And Pfizer today, claiming it could seek regulatory approval for its vaccine as early as October.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALBERT BOURLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PFIZER: We have now a contract with the U.S. government to provide them if the vaccine is successful, 100 million doses and we gave it to the U.S. government at the, I believe, very, very reasonable and low price, which is $19.5 a dose, but the U.S. government will give it to the Americans for free.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Well, the Trump administration rescinding its warning against all international travel because of the coronavirus. It says conditions no longer warrant a blanket worldwide alert. The State Department has lifted its level for health advisory for the entire world. It'll now return to country specific warnings.</p><p>The move comes just hours after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its COVID-19 travel advisory information. However, Americans still face travel restrictions from other world governments.</p><p>OK. Imagine going to get a COVID-19 test only to see a sign that says closed for vacation. Well, as they always do in August, including this August right as the coronavirus is spiking again in France. The staff at doctor's offices and testing labs are taking their annual August break. That means very long lines at the testing centers that are still open in cities like Paris.</p><p>New York democratic governor Bill de Blasio is now welcoming visitors to New York City with COVID-19 checkpoints designed to ensure cooperation with the state's 14-day quarantine mandate, at the same time dismissing residents who fled the city during the pandemic and violent looting as, quote, fair weather friends whose taxes should be raised.</p><p>Senior correspondent, Rick Leventhal, taking a look for us at that tonight. Hey, Rick.</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Shannon. Full disclosure, I'm one of the longtime New Yorkers who left the city this year, and I'm far from alone leading the governor to plead with the city's top earners to come back and prop up Manhattan's ailing finances.</p><p>New York City is a very different place since the pandemic struck. Many stores, bars, and restaurants remained shuttered, crime has spiked with shootings up 201 percent over last year, and robberies in some neighborhoods up almost 300 percent.</p><p>There's a rise in homeless and panhandlers and trash is piling up with cuts to essential services. A big chunk of the city's most well off escaped to second homes in the Hamptons or Catskills or beyond, and some may never return because of the high tax burden and deteriorating conditions, prompting the governor to say this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): They're not coming back right now. And you know what else they think? If I stay there, they pay a lower income tax because they don't pay the New York City surcharge.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Leventhal: And Mayor Bill de Blasio is giving the wealthiest city residents another reason to permanently change their address. He wants to raise taxes for the top one percent, criticizing the rich for getting richer, calling those who left fair-weather friends.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY: This city is for New Yorkers. This city is for people who live here, work here, fight to make this place better, fight through this crisis. Wealthy New Yorkers can afford to pay a little bit more so that everyone else can make it through this crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: The mayor also announced checkpoints are being set up across the five boroughs at airports, train stations, bridges and tunnels, to enforce the mandatory 14-day quarantine for travelers coming from viral hotspots in 34 states and Puerto Rico.</p><p>New arrivals are supposed to fill out forms, but police admit they can't stop everyone, so the city is threatening fines up to 10 grand for anyone who doesn't comply.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're requesting, yes. When we're visiting families, we plan on being here a couple weeks anyway.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I wish every state was doing this, because, you know, it's going to help to stop the virus, we hope.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: And here in Los Angeles, the city says it will start shutting off power and water to homes hosting illegal house parties, popping up in the hills, now that bars and nightclubs have closed. The mayor says he hopes to avoid a ripple effect of the virus spreading well beyond the boundaries of those parties. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right. Rick Leventhal, thank you so much.</p><p>So, Facebook under fire from the right again tonight after temporarily banning a pro-Trump Super PAC from advertising on the site for repeatedly sharing content that they deemed false. Sanction coming less than 24 hours after Facebook and Twitter removed and flagged posts of the president or his campaign making comments about COVID-19 and kids.</p><p>So, let's discuss with FCC Commissioner, Brendan Carr, and the author of, \"The MAGA Doctrine,\" Charlie Kirk. Good to have you both with us tonight.</p><p>CHARLIE KIRK, AUTHOR OF \"THE MAGA DOCTRINE\": Thank you.</p><p>BRENDAN CARR, COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION: Good to be with you.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, to read a little bit more from Andy Stone from Facebook talking about this pro-Trump Super PAC, he said, they repeatedly shared content determined by third-party fact-checkers to be false. So, they won't be permitted to advertise there. I mean, Charlie, they said this is part of the protocol.</p><p>KIRK: Look, I've dealt with this process personally. And it's first important to recognize that not all these tech companies are the same. I mean, Twitter has decided to basically become a left-wing activist portal and not even show up to testify in front of Congress.</p><p>I completely disagree with Facebook's approach to this. And I think that when they say it's third-party checkers, and in a lot of questions behind that, and they typically just delegate that authority to very left-wing journalists and individuals.</p><p>However, I will say as someone who does a lot on social media and has amassed millions of followers, Facebook, out of all the tech companies, at least has had dialogue with conservatives when there's disagreement. I think they're totally wrong here.</p><p>However, Twitter and even Google, they have decided not even to engage at all, and I think, look, the Social media space is where a lot of these conversations are happening. And I think, right now, we need to have a very serious, let's say like rules of engagement from these tech companies of if you're going to apply a rule to a conservative, it better apply to a liberal, especially when you see that impartiality is not something Silicon Valley can always embody.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. And Sharyl Attkisson, investigative journalist, had written a piece before these things happen this week. A couple days ago it came out talking about fact checkers. She says, \"Fact checkers are like-minded journalists or often liberal Silicon Valley gatekeepers, who frequently rely on partisan news sources and political activists to control narratives on a wide variety of issues and controversies. This small group of players exerts an oversized influence using fact checkers to shape and censor information.\"</p><p>But, Commissioner, they are private entities.</p><p>CARR: You're right. Look, when it comes to free speech, Facebook's relationship status is it's complicated. And when you compare Mark Zuckerberg to some of his counterparts in Silicon Valley, he actually does a far better job when it comes to standing up for free speech. He said that he doesn't want Facebook to be the arbiter of truth. And there's others in Silicon Valley who are more than happy to seize that mantle.</p><p>Nonetheless, Facebook continues to stumble along the way as we see right here. And I think that's because this fact checking approach, this content moderation, as you pointed out, is just fraud. So often fact-checking is just opinion journalism. And it really just invites people to try to work the rest at Facebook.</p><p>We saw just this week, 20 state AG's, all Democrats, filed a letter, sent a letter to Facebook, saying they needed to start taking down more speech. I think that's the opposite direction. We need more speech, more ideas, a diversity of opinion. That's why I said, we should just turn off these bias filters and let the American people make their own decisions about what they want to believe when it comes to these opinions.</p><p>BREAM: OK. There -- it was this headline we saw from The Hill today and some others reporting as well, \"Facebook takes down troll farm posing as black support for Trump.\" It says, \"The company took down 35 accounts, three pages and 88 Instagram accounts that were part of the operation.\"</p><p>So, Charlie, do you agree that sometimes they're getting this right?</p><p>KIRK: Look, I deal with these platforms probably 200 times a day. I mean, I'm posting and tweeting all the time. And I could tell you, at least, I do believe that more so than Google and Twitter, Facebook has at least resisted some of this left-wing pressure to remove posts. I could tell you, personally, from posts that would not be able to at least have a fair hearing on some of these other platforms. Facebook, at least, I think has had some commission of free expression, and Mark Zuckerberg was the only person who testified last week who actually thinks China is a threat to our country.</p><p>However, I think that this fact-checking process, as Brendan said, needs to be completely eliminated. I've had posts on my own that said they're fact- checking it. This is a Washington Post. I mean, these are activist organizations that are getting grants from Facebook. So, I think it is fraught and it's very, as Brendan, says absolutely complicated.</p><p>Last point I'll say is this, Shannon, this is not a minor issue, speech that used to be in the public, maybe outside of the state legislature is now all happening online. I think it's a civil right to have your voice heard on a social platform. We must demand that out of all of these tech companies.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Commissioner, have they been transformed into public forums that would have more legal protections for free speech?</p><p>CARR: Well, this is a question that's really being raised at the FCC where I work just right now. The Trump administration fought a petition with us last week, asking for us to adopt rules clarifying section 230, which a lot of people now know is a law passed in the 1990s that gives special protections to websites as opposed to other political actors.</p><p>We've now put that petition out for a comment, and we welcome the public feedback and whether we should take action there. I think, look, when it comes to, you know, these big tech platforms, we need more accountability, more transparency, more user-empowerment.</p><p>And really, this is a microcosm for, I think, a broader debate in the conservative movement. What do we do in the face of massive accumulation of power? I think we need to do more than just sit on our hands. That's why I've called for some accountability here because I don't think the status quo is acceptable.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and it's really said a lot of conservatives have been able to build massive followings on these platforms. So we'll continue to watch.</p><p>Commissioner, Charlie, good to have you both.</p><p>CARR: Thanks.</p><p>KIRK: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Breaking tonight, Canada vowing to retaliate with dollar for dollar counter measures after the Trump administration moved to re- impose tariffs on Canadian aluminum, saying our neighbor to the North has been taking advantage of us.</p><p>The action comes just weeks after a new North American trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico went into effect.</p><p>Presumptive democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, focusing on the African American votes. In new ads, urging black voters to stand up to the President. The way he says their ancestors stood up to what he calls violent racists of a generation ago.</p><p>But a comment Biden made about African Americans is getting a lot of attention tonight.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the campaign from Wilmington, Delaware.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>The Biden VP vetting process continues, how is it going, Kamala Harris?</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): You probably know more than I do.</p><p>DOOCY: As Biden moles, which woman he wants to possibly put a heartbeat away from the presidency?</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every one of the women I've -- we've interviewed is qualified, and I've narrowed it down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The promise of a better America.</p><p>DOOCY: His campaign staff is launching a new ad, focusing on black voters as part of an eight-figure ad buy, the largest investment ever by presidential campaign in African American media.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And just like our ancestors, who stood up to the violent races of a generation ago, we will stand up to this president.</p><p>DOOCY: But an unscripted Biden comment about race is now drawing scrutiny from his opponent, his comparison of African Americans to Latinos.</p><p>BIDEN: Unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.</p><p>DOOCY: It didn't take long for that comment to reach Marine One.</p><p>TRUMP: So, I guess watched the clip, and Joe Biden, this morning, totally disparaged and insulted the black community.</p><p>DOOCY: Biden is also pitching a major crackdown on guns; tweeting weapons of war have no place in our communities. When I was a senator, I took on the NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons. And as President, I'll ban these weapons again. And that's a line President Trump is using to draw a contrast between the candidates.</p><p>TRUMP: He's against God, he's against guns, he's against energy, our kind of energy.</p><p>DOOCY: Biden is pushing for green energy. That doesn't mean he still doesn't play around with the muscle car in the garage.</p><p>BIDEN: I didn't get a chance to flash shift in the second, I was afraid I'd go through those guys.</p><p>DOOCY: So that's what he's been doing in there, and that's the way the Biden campaign is trying to make Biden relatable to voters since he can no longer get safely close enough to any of them to shake a hand or take a selfie.</p><p>In Wilmington, Delaware, Peter Doocy, Fox News.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: Well, and tonight the former vice president is trying to clarify his remarks on race. He says in a tweet earlier today, he says this, \"I made some comments about diversity in the African-American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith, not by identity, not on issues, not at all.\"</p><p>Well, how far left has Biden moved? Former 2020 presidential candidate, Tom Steyer says, the former VP is much more progressive than he's been portrayed in the media. He joins us next.</p><p>BREAM: Well, today, Kanye West is running for president or he says walking for president to win. In a text message interview with a Forbes reporter, West deflected questions about being a spoiler and did not answer when asked if he would simply be siphoning votes away from Joe Biden.</p><p>West is already on the presidential ballot in Colorado, in Oklahoma, and has filed for candidacy in seven other states.</p><p>As Joe Biden inches closer to selecting a running mate, contenders like Kamala Harris, Susan Rice, and Karen Bass continue to stand by.</p><p>So let's talk about the ongoing drama and the latest developments surrounding the candidate at the top of the ticket with former democratic presidential candidate himself, Tom Steyer. Good to have you back, sir.</p><p>TOM STEYER, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Shannon, it's great to be with you again.</p><p>BREAM: OK. I want to play a characterization of what kind of candidates and what kind of leader Mr. Biden would be, this is President Trump and then Dr. Jill Biden.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: She's following the radical left agenda. Take away your guns, destroy your Second Amendment, no religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. He's against God, he's against guns, he's against energy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JILL BIDEN, FORMER SECOND LADY: He's not someone who's left, he's not someone who's right, he's a moderate, and that's who he's always been.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: A lot of folks out there, though diving into what he stands for now and digging through what he said, I think he's a lot more progressive than he's presented himself to be. So which characterization do you think is more accurate?</p><p>STEYER: Look, I think that Joe Biden is a forward-thinking, forward-looking person. He is absolutely standing up for the American people where they are now in this crisis, and where they're going to be and where he thinks they need to be.</p><p>And to me, he's somebody who has incredible heart and empathy for what people are going through now. And he couples that with experience and caring, so that he is somebody who listens to expert and comes up with real world solutions.</p><p>As far as I'm concerned --</p><p>BREAM: OK. Let me...</p><p>STEYER: -- this crisis has brought forward the person who's the answer to this crisis, and honestly, it's Joe Biden.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Here is how Vox characterizes him. It says, \"Progressives don't love Joe Biden, but they're learning to love his agenda.\" It says, \"His platform is in many ways, a surprisingly progressive approach to policy that the left sees as a triumph of their own work in trying to change the terms of debate in American politics.\"</p><p>I, mean, there are a lot of issues we could talk about one by one and where he has come to the left. We know that he's been heavily influenced now by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as they hope to draw him closer to their positions.</p><p>So, do you think it's fair to characterize him as a moderate who's neither left nor right?</p><p>STEYER: As I said before, Shannon, I think the right way to characterize Vice President Biden is someone who's really forward-thinking and forward- looking. And let me give you an example. When it comes to clean energy, he's put forward build back better plan that addresses our need as a nation to move towards clean energy and rebuild the country.</p><p>But as he's doing it, he's also addressing the problems of dirty air, dangerous pollution, dirty water across America, particularly in underserved communities, particularly in the black and the brown communities where this country has focused its pollution.</p><p>And in addition, that clean energy program is a huge jobs program to put to work working people across this country at the time of the highest unemployment rates in anybody's life. And he's got a program here that puts working people first that puts the job creations first, that's what's in his heart, that's what in his mind.</p><p>So when you ask me, what is he? I think he's someone who looks forward, takes in the evidence and relates to policy through his heart and through caring about people and he comes up with the right answer. I think that's who he is, and I think that's what this time calls for.</p><p>BREAM: OK. And a lot of folks, though, look at what he has rolled out on climate, and a number of issues saying they have enormous price tags. And he's not sure how -- they're not sure how he's going to get it done and that it is very progressive, but I know that lines up with where you are on that issue.</p><p>Let me ask you about this controversy tonight. His comment today saying, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things. He brought up, you know, in a tweet tonight saying I made some comments, I want to clarify, I didn't mean to suggest that the African American community is a monolith.</p><p>But he's had a number of these statements, including the one just weeks ago saying, you know, if you don't vote for me, you're not black, comments like this. Do you think he struggles on this issue of race a little bit and sometimes steps in it and hasn't been as eloquent as he should be in trying to appeal to black voters?</p><p>STEYER: I really don't, Shannon, I mean, his campaign clarified what he said today. But what I know is this, I've spent enough time with the Vice President and feel I know where his heart is well enough to know he absolutely empathizes. He absolutely relates to people across racial boundaries, across ethnicities, across gender, across geography and income levels.</p><p>This is somebody who suffered no suffering, personally, and who can relate to people. So anytime I see something like that, I believe that his heart, he leads with his heart. He leads with compassion and caring. He's very experienced and knowledgeable. And I think out of that, is going to be somebody who can pull this whole country, this whole divided partisan country together and lead us forward in a really positive, unified way. That's why I'm foursquare for Joe Biden.</p><p>BREAM: Well, I know you are, as we are looking forward to the debates and we get there in just a matter of weeks.</p><p>Tom Steyer, good to see you and your tie again. Thanks for coming back.</p><p>STEYER: Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: See you soon.</p><p>All right. New tonight in the debate of a returning to school, demonstrators marching in support of defunding the Seattle Police Department include teachers who say they want money taken from the police and given to their schools.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JESSE HAGOPIAN, SEATTLE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER: It looks like restorative justice counselors in every school, so we can solve conflicts. It looks like turning schools into community schools that have wraparound services like health care.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: And teachers unions are also protesting the very idea of going back to school at least for now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACKENZIE SATO, MICHIGAN TEACHER: What's the acceptable body count? I'm really asking. In order to send us completely virtual for the beginning of the year, how many people need to die?

A major firefight is brewing tonight over the future of the National Rifle Association. The Attorney General in New York wants the NRA dissolved over alleged financial corruption by its leaders. Correspondent David Lee Miller has the latest live tonight from New York City. Good evening, David.</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. New York's Attorney General is accusing the NRA leadership of using the nonprofit organization as a personal piggy bank, and in a lawsuit is calling for the organization to be disbanded. In the crosshairs is the longtime Executive Vice President of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, who has served as the public face of the organization.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LETITIA JAMES, NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL: LaPierre exploited the organization for his and his family's financial benefit, and the benefit of a close, close circle of NRA staff, board members and vendors.</p><p>MILLER: In a 169-page lawsuit, New York's Attorney General said LaPierre and three other NRA officials instituted an illegal culture of self- dealing, costing the organization $64 million over three years. According to the suit, New York's Attorney General Letitia James has jurisdiction overseeing the Fairfax, Virginia based NRA because it is chartered in New York as a non-profit corporation.</p><p>The Civil Lawsuit cites numerous examples of NRA money used to pay for expensive air travel, hotels, meals and gifts. Much of the lawsuit specifically targets LaPierre for allegedly lining his own pockets.</p><p>JAMES: He visited the Bahamas by private air charter at least eight times in an approximate three-year period with his family at a core at a cost of more than $500,000 to the NRA.</p><p>MILLER: LaPierre responding to the suit released a statement that says in part: \"The NRA is well-governed, financially solvent, and committed to good governance. We're ready for the fight. Bring it on.\" In a counter lawsuit filed by the NRA, the organization accuses New York's Attorney General of trying to silence a message she doesn't like: \"There can be no doubt that James' actions towards the NRA are motivated and substantially caused by her hostility toward the NRA's political advocacy.\" President Trump called the New York lawsuit a terrible thing and suggested the NRA relocate to a more friendly environment.</p><p>TRUMP: I think the NRA should move to Texas and lead a very good and beautiful life, and I told him that for a long time.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MILLER: In addition to the New York lawsuit, tonight the NRA has another legal problem. Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has announced a lawsuit targeting the NRA foundation, that suit claims that money intended for charitable causes was instead wasted by the NRA, as well as its executives. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, David Lee Miller in New York, thank you. So, in the wake of all this, wake up all this legal action against the NRA, the Attorney General of West Virginia sees an opportunity to try to entice gun manufacturers and organizations to relocate to his more industry-friendly state. So, let's discuss that push with West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey. Good to have you back, sir.</p><p>PATRICK MORRISEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL, WEST VIRGINIA: Hey, it's good to be with you tonight. Thank you very much.</p><p>BREAM: OK, so let's talk about this. This lawsuit today, the Washington Post talks about this and says: last spring, then NRA President Oliver North announced in Indianapolis that he would not seek a second term as president warning about exorbitant payments to Brewer's firm where the attorneys involved with NRA and reports of financial mismanagement. There's a clear crisis North said in his letter announcing his departure. So, general, as an attorney, do you think there is something to this that needs to be vetted out? Or do you see it purely as a political attack?</p><p>MORRISEY: Well, I think it's important to always look at these issues and why they're being filed, and then when they're being filed. And if there is evidence of wrongdoing, I would say you always want to pursue that. But what I think is happening here is you have a political lawsuit being filed within 90 days of a presidential election, and the goal of the lawsuit is literally to dissolve one of the political enemies of the Democrat Party.</p><p>This is a really terrible thing to do, not only based upon the timing before the election, but you have millions of members of the NRA, law abiding citizens trying to protect their first amendment rights, their second amendment rights, and their views are going to be stifled. So, when you see that kind of activity, come on the heels of when the NRA, literally it promised to spend tens of millions of dollars to tell President Trump, you know that it's a political lawsuit. It's a weaponizing of law enforcement for political purposes. It's wrong. It's abusive. We have to call it out.</p><p>BREAM: All right. General quickly, how does this work? I'm an attorney too, but certainly not an attorney general. If you think that there's wrongdoing by a handful of people in the organization, how does one suit to dissolve the entire thing?</p><p>MORRISEY: Sure. So, I think most states actually have -- their attorneys general have law enforcement powers or the ability to conduct oversight over charitable organizations and it's not uncommon to go after evidence of wrongdoing or self-dealing if you see it exists. But this is a little bit different. We're talking about a five-million-person membership organization.</p><p>And so, the goal of the lawsuit isn't just to try to remedy any potential fraud, it's actually to eradicate to dissolve the membership organization right before a big, very big election. That is highly unusual. It's a political move. If you were really just interested in going after fraud, you would have narrow provisions going after specific people where you have evidence of wrongdoing. I think you would leave out trying to eradicate, trying to dissolve a large political organization that is a supporter of President Trump's.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, I think that raises a lot of questions for folks across the spectrum. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey, good to have you back. Thank you.</p><p>MORRISEY: Great to be here. Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: All right, the latest on that massive explosion in Beirut as the death toll continues to climb, an update next.</p><p>BREAM: As the U.S. sends three cargo planes filled with relief supplies to Beirut, Lebanon's state-run News Agency said 16 employees at the city's port have been detained in the investigation into those massive explosions that killed more than 140 people and wounded thousands. Let's talk about the latest developments with Fox News Contributor Johnny Joey Jones. Good to have you back, Joey.</p><p>JOHNNY JOEY JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good evening, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. This is what the A.P. says. It says, the cabinet was previously warned by a security agency that a stockpile of explosive chemicals stored at the port was dangerous. A report that could raise questions of high-level neglect. I mean, for now, we don't know exactly what happened, but we know that there was a lot of ammonium nitrate in that area, and when it was ignited, the results were devastating.</p><p>JONES: No, that's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. I've seen a lot of explosions. I haven't seen anything like that. Obviously, not in person. It doesn't happen very often. You know, anyone who says they can watch that video and tell you what happened is probably a Twitter expert, not an actual expert. But what I can tell you is that was a lot of explosive material.</p><p>It makes sense that they're saying it is ammonium nitrate, you can see a red cloud come up once the vapor cloud kind of disperses really quickly. So, the big white cloud you see is kind of a vapor cloud. And then you see a red plume go up, and that's characteristic of ammonium nitrate, which is just a fertilizer we use all over the world, it's necessary for our survival with the amount of food we have to produce in agriculture, and it's also something that's, you know, a nitrated substance that's incredibly explosive when used the right way or now, in this case, the wrong way.</p><p>BREAM: I want to talk to you -- I'm so glad we have you on this date, it's actually your Alive Day, and you've got a very important story. 10 years ago, today, your life changed forever. You've got a special on Fox Nation as well but tell us a little bit about what that means, and then we'll play a little bit of it.</p><p>JONES: Yes, that a little levity. Ammonium nitrate was used to take my legs off explosively. So, it's a very common chemical use and pretty much every bomb in Afghanistan. So, on August 6 2010, I was working as an EOD or a bomb technician and on an offensive operation that was that we got really, really bad really quickly. I stepped on an IED that morning and in yes, that took my legs away. I landed on my back and I wasn't unconscious. I remembered what happened. I experienced everything that happened. And I would be remiss to say that today is about remembering Corporal Daniel Greer, who unfortunately lost his life to the same IED providing security for me.</p><p>BREAM: I want to play a little bit of it so people know when they get a chance to watch this special on Fox Nation what they're going to see.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: When I took that one step, everything changed. A big cloud of dust came up. I felt my body become weightless and I knew instantly what had happened. I'd seen it happen in front of me and responded to it happening to others. I'd stepped on an IED.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: I mean, you chose to go into this, as our men and women do now voluntarily into the service. How have you managed in the last 10 years to get through this to come to the other side with such what you often have is such an encouraging tone.</p><p>JONES: You know, I just talked about Corporal Greer and he didn't live that day. You know, he made a sacrifice I didn't have to make. August 6th is an important day. A good friend of mine, a year later, Dan Patron, was killed in action, and then the Extortion 17, that same day killed 31 U.S. Service Members. So, when this day crosses my path every year, I'm reminded how lucky I am that I'm alive and living life and loving my family. When it came to recovering in the hospital, I didn't have to look any further than the people that believed in me to have a reason.</p><p>And if I could share that with people and give other people an opportunity to kind of have that perspective, then my Alive Day is a good day for me. Every year I'm marking the occasion by simply being thankful and having gratitude for the life that I still have. And you know, when you, when you're pulling up like that, you relive that a few times a day, but the frustration is replaced with hope and happiness. And I hope people tune in and I learned quite a bit about that day. I didn't know about some of the people we tracked down the interview to include the general in charge and the surgeon that saved my life that day.</p><p>BREAM: Well, it's on Fox Nation. I hope folks will check it out and we can ever thank you enough and those who served along with you. Joey, thank you.</p><p>JONES: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: OK, we're currently monitoring Portland as protesters there take direct aim at the local police who tonight are saying, enough is enough.</p><p>BREAM: Portland Police declaring a riot yet again as protesters tried to break into a precinct building hitting officers with fireworks and other projectiles. Chief Correspondent Jonathan Hunt takes a look for us tonight. Hey, Jonathan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. It seems hard to fathom that these protests have been going on every single night since the end of May, but that is the reality in Portland, the withdrawal from the streets of federal agents whose presence had sparked so much anger appears to have simply shifted the focus of the protests away from the federal courthouse and toward local police precincts.</p><p>Police and protesters clashing last night for instance around Poland's East precinct where demonstrators started fires erected barricades, spray painted security cameras, pointed green lasers at police officers and threw fireworks toward police lines. Eventually, police declared a riot that's a step that enables them to order crowds to disperse and take action to enforce the dispersal order. Portland Police said they use tear gas and other crowd control munitions to do just that.</p><p>In another incident on Tuesday night, a pickup truck accelerated along the street lined by protesters at one point pushing a riderless motorcycle that had been thrown in front of it. It's not clear whether the truck driver had been previously driving at the protesters always trying to escape from them. No one was injured and the driver was interviewed by police and released without charge. Portland's police chief meantime says he believes the violence is hurting the Black Lives Matter cause and what he calls his beautiful vibrant city.</p><p>CHUCK LOVELL, PORTLAND POLICE CHIEF: Enough is enough. This is not forwarding the goals of things that are going to lead to better outcomes for people of color. This movement is very powerful, and I feel like the, the violence has taken away from it in a really kind of concerning way.</p><p>HUNT: Poland police have arrested more than 400 people since late May, while those federal agents I mentioned now largely withdrawn from the streets, arrested at least 94 people through July 30th. And in Portland, there appears to be no end in sight. Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: Indeed. All right, Jonathan, thank you. Finally, tonight, Marine Veteran Courtney Brown hit a rough patch when he lost his job just after buying his first home, and to make matters worse, he tested positive for COVID-19. That's when the RedCon One Foundation stepped in. Paying for six months of Brown's mortgage when he got the foundation's shield of Honor Award given to military families who've fallen on financial hardship. So, to the Marine and to his family getting another shot in this hard summer thanks to RedCon One Foundation all of you are \"MIDNIGHT HEROES\" tonight. That's it for us.

This is FIRST MOVE, and he is your need-to-know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Storming out. President Trump refusing to tackle infrastructure spending with the Democrats until the investigations stop. Playing the long game. The U.S. government looks at to subsidize firms hurt in the battle over Huawei's technology. And Tesla's tumble. More high profile analysts raising concerns for stock being sold premarket. It's Thursday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to FIRST MOVE once again where I can tell you, trade gloom is permeating the global markets I think. I think I've had enough of giving you some of the signs of rhetoric that we've seen over the past few days. What about the real economic spillovers that we're seeing right now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, look no further than Europe. The data there weakening and that's really setting the tone this morning. Take a look at U.S. futures at this moment. We are lower off some 1 percent for the NASDAQ, too, adding to yesterday's weakness though I will point out, we did end the session off the lows. So interesting price action going on here, too.</p><p>In aggregate, the S&amp;P and the Dow trading prissy flat since Monday on the month though down, some two and a half percent, the NASDAQ really feeling it, they are down 4 percent so far this month. Lots of names within that worse -- Apple down seven; Qualcomm down almost 10; Micron, the chip makers of course, front and center, down 15.</p><p>As we've been saying all week, something material has changed in these trade negotiations or non-negotiations. I'm not sure we're getting that right even with what we've priced right now.</p><p>Over in Europe, Germany, in particular, it's a sea of red, but Germany under pressure off over one and a half percent, 10-year yields in Germany also falling further into negative territory. Noises of woe across Europe from the survey data, but German business activity and confidence taking a hit.</p><p>Let's add some more salt to the wound, why don't we? The latest European Central Bank Minutes out today showing policymakers concerned that that second half bounce that a lot of people were hoping for here simply might not happen.</p><p>Over in Asia. Asia stocks ending at the lowest level in four months. We know currencies have been bearing the brunt of the trade concerns for a while. To add to the noise, the eye opening display, as I mentioned of what we can only call policy paralysis from Washington, D.C. yesterday, President Trump refusing to work on an infrastructure plan with the Democrats while, the array of investigations are going on.</p><p>You can imagine what the Chinese are the thinking of U.S. politics right now. What was that quote that I gave you yesterday talking of rhetoric from the editor of China's \"Global Times,\" \"Americans are about to have a nervous breakdown.\"</p><p>Let's get to the drivers because Joe Jones joins me from the White House. Joe, I don't think anybody really believed that we would see an infrastructure spending bill coming anytime soon. But what was that display yesterday?</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: It was an extraordinary display, Julia. I can tell you that. Highly unusual even for this White House. But you're right. The idea of a $2 trillion infrastructure program, probably some -- was not going to happen simply because there were a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill, including, also, by the way, the President's Chief of Staff who was a budget hawk when he was on Capitol Hill, all saying a $2 trillion proposal for infrastructure was simply a non-starter.</p><p>But what clearly happened here is the President went into this meeting with the Democrats from Capitol Hill. He had just heard the Speaker of the House announce on television that in her view, the President was engaging in a cover up, he came out to the Rose Garden in what appeared to be a preplanned speech that the journalists had only been told about shortly before, and he railed against the Democrats, their investigations, suggested he wouldn't work on infrastructure.</p><p>There was an inference there that he might not be able to work with Democrats on other important issues that must come through the Congress this year and then he left.</p><p>So today, here at the White House, the question is, what will the President work with the Democrats on? Just a few minutes ago, Sarah Sanders, the White House Press Secretary was out here and she said that the President would work on a number of administrative initiatives, particularly on the budget.</p><p>And we also know that as far as China goes, what you mentioned at the top, Sonny Perdue, the Agriculture Secretary is out here a little while ago and he said that some type of program was anticipated that would provide something like $16 billion for farmers in the United States who have been hurt by the continuing trade war with China.</p><p>[09:05:20] JOHNS: So it sounds like they're trying some workarounds, not clear how far they're going to go on legislation unless the Democrats, however, unlikely on Capitol Hill decided to end their investigations -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting isn't it? Innocent or otherwise, making policy in this kind of environment has to be tough for this government, and particularly the time when you have to show a united front to the rest of the world if you are tackling them on issues, like the Chinese intellectual property theft, the U.S. politicians are kind of undermining each other right now.</p><p>Do you think it makes a deal more or less likely, because this is one thing that unites them. Even Chuck Schumer, himself has said taking a break stance here against the Chinese is the right thing to do.</p><p>JOHNS: Well, I can tell you that this administration as a precedent- setting administration, they've thrown out the playbook in many ways. But on balance, if you look back to history, a variety of Presidents have worked through a number of investigations, including Richard Nixon, who was under investigation and an impeachment inquiry. Bill Clinton, same thing. Obama and Reagan, to a lesser extent -- all of them had investigations going on and they continued to do the business of the country in one way or another and they continued to work with the Congress on issues that could come together on.</p><p>So the question is whether this President will do the same thing? Or if we will see, what is a de facto, a government shutdown until the investigations are over; however difficult that could be on the country -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. And a problem for the economy, too, if that means a suspension of an ability to reach a deal on trade. Joe Jones, thank you so much for that. All right, sticking with this theme, of course, because as Joe mentioned there, support for farmers also, potential subsidies for tech firms caught in the crossfire between the crackdown on China's Huawei, too, and the technology there. This is more global networks, including the likes of Vodafone are now suspending business with Huawei in orders.</p><p>Samuel Burke joins me now. Samuel, as you and I discussed before the show, just continuing to count the cost here of the trade war.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, costs for American consumers or companies, interesting because now there's a proposal in the U.S. Congress to actually set aside $700 million of U.S. taxpayer money to help those rural carriers in the United States that have become so reliant on using Huawei's technology, especially their plans for 5G technology. So this bill would make it to they can't use that technology and then that money goes to help them remove that and replace it with other technology.</p><p>I just want to put up on the screen for your viewers the market share when it comes to 5G equipment, because there is no natural American successor. All those names that you see there are either Asian or European, you don't see one American company in there, although Intel does have some of that space, but nothing significant, as you see there.</p><p>So this would indicate that it would be for national security reasons, maybe in the short term, but maybe in the long term, an American company might want to get in that game, though, we've seen no sign of that whatsoever.</p><p>I do just want to note that just a few moments ago, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, telling one of the financial news networks that using Huawei is like putting your information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. I'm not so sure that he's ever put it that bluntly.</p><p>But this, of course, is the heart of their argument. That's never been proven, at least publicly, though plenty of experts agree that this is a real possibility, given that data law that requires companies to hand over data to the government in 2017 that went into effect in China.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and increasingly hard to see a carve out for this company, even in the event of some future trade deal given the rhetoric that we're seeing right now, how do you suddenly decide that this is no longer a risk, given how much weight you've put behind it?</p><p>Interesting comments from Huawei, too, overnight saying, look, in light of what we've seen from Google and them having to restrict their operating system and apps, Huawei could have their own operating system up and running by the end of this year.</p><p>How useful is that when we're looking at Huawei's international business? All those consumers are going to operate under a Huawei operating system? I'm not so sure.</p><p>BURKE: Never underestimate Huawei. I remember when people said they were just copying and then all the sudden they leapt ahead of Apple's phones.</p><p>I think it's really important to look at this new operating system that they're proposing in terms of China. That's, I think, a real possibility and they're saying, just for the Chinese market, they could have the operating system ready by the third quarter of this year.</p><p>The issue here is internationally. They're saying that operating system wouldn't be ready until the following year for all the other markets. But listen, even though I say don't underestimate China and Huawei, you also have to look at the history here.</p><p>[09:10:08] BURKE: This is an attempt that has been done by many companies to have their own app store, their own operating system, and it hasn't worked, not even for Blackberry, which for all intents and purposes, really invented the smartphone. And even now, when you see a Blackberry, that's actually an Android system. It hasn't played out that well for Microsoft either in their app store.</p><p>So to create a whole new environment, in it of itself is hard. But to get everybody into that ecosystem from Uber to Deliveroo, all the apps that would need to be on there, I mean, every app that you use now would need to buy into this system and re-engineer. That is a huge feat.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Such a great point -- BlackBerry and Microsoft -- although I have to say, I do miss my Blackberry, but maybe that's just me. Samuel Burke, I know, I know. Old habits die hard. Samuel Burke, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, let's move on to our next driver. Tesla -- stock down some three and a half percent premarket. Key bulls or former bulls like Morgan Stanley, Gene Munster, over at Loup Ventures weighing in here and raising fresh concerns.</p><p>Paul La Monica joins me now. There's been a sort of cascade effect since the latest results from Tesla. More and more analysts going at least in the short term, \"We're seriously worried right now.\" And some of them raising concerns about Chinese demand hereto in lights of the trade war, so another victim there, too, Paul?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, there are big problems at Tesla right now and Wall Street has grown increasingly bearish, Julia. You've seen analysts like Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas, who used to be a big bull, the company saying that in a worst case scenario, shares could fall all the way to $10.00.</p><p>Citi is a little bit more optimistic, you know, tongue in cheek, saying that in a bear case scenario, maybe the stock goes to $36.00. That's clearly also a big drop from current levels. But you look at Loup's Gene Munster, he is worried about the impact of the China trade war on Tesla. And then Dan Ives from Wedbush, who I know you're going to have on the show a little bit later, he is talking about the storm clouds are getting darker for Tesla. He used to be a very big bull on Tesla as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a huge sentiment shift all of a sudden, as I mentioned, the cascade effect and it'll be interesting to get Dan's take on this. You know, when we start to hear the nervousness about Tesla, and we've been through these periods before, I think in the past, particularly around that going private tweet, we talked about the possibility of them being bought by somebody like Apple, like Amazon, if the technology is that good. What do we make of this?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I struggle with the notion that Elon Musk would ever want to sell Tesla. I mean, yes, at some point, the cash concerns and the debt level that they have could make an acquisition more palatable for a company like Apple or Alphabet, or maybe even a big auto company in the U.S. or around the world.</p><p>But I don't see Elon Musk cashing in on Tesla. I don't see Musk working for someone else at a larger firm. Really, I think, unless it gets to the point where he gets so bored with Tesla and decides to go all in on SpaceX and the Hyperloop, the boring company that he's working on, it doesn't strike me as, you know, a rational idea for an investor to buy Tesla because they think this is an acquisition target. I just don't see it happening.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting, isn't it? ARK Invest of course, Cathie Wood, who's been on this show many times, too, they made their model free access yesterday to say, \"Guys, plug in some numbers. We remain bulls here.\" So we're going to be debating that later on in the show, too. For now, Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we are following around the world. Twenty nine tornadoes have been reported in the U.S. states of Missouri and Oklahoma in the last 24 hours according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>In Missouri's capital of Jefferson City, a violent tornado caused heavy damage and three people were killed during storms in another part of the state. Many others remain trapped in the wreckage of their homes.</p><p>At this moment, voting is underway for the European Parliamentary elections as people in the U.K. and the Netherlands take to the polls. Over the next four days, hundreds of millions of people within the 28-member Union will have the chance to vote for a new Parliament in the E.U.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the U.K., there's growing speculation that the end of May will come at the end of May. The Pound is sliding again under pressure as the Prime Minister's pressure intensifies. A senior Cabinet Minister quit after Theresa May's latest Brexit plan opened the door to a potential second referendum.</p><p>Nina dos Santos joins us now from London on this story. Nina, just bring us up to speed because we did see the intensification of pressure. We also had that high profile 1922 Committee meeting later on in the U.K. yesterday and we spoke to one of their members. What happened there, too?</p><p>[09:15:00] NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we're hearing, Julia is that overnight, at least yesterday evening, a lot of the political reporters in the United Kingdom was saying that there had been a secret ballot of members of that powerful backbench committee, the 1922 Committee that essentially decides the fate on who runs the Conservative Party, and therefore would be Prime Minister when they're in office.</p><p>And that the secret ballot has been held, that the ballots have been kept in sealed envelopes and that Theresa May, we know she is set to meet with the Chairman of that 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady on Friday. The logic here that is circulating as yet unconfirmed is that if she does not go on Friday, well, then they would unseal these ballots, and that could prompt a vote of no confidence, or at least be seen as a de facto vote of no confidence.</p><p>Confusion abounds here, though, Julia, I have to be honest, because the reality is, is that according to the current rules of the Conservative Party, Theresa May, has already faced one vote of confidence, and won it over the last 12 months, so in theory, she should be safe in her seat until at least the month of December.</p><p>But always, she's had a wild ride so far, and at the moment, she is still holding on despite the fact that late yesterday evening, we also saw one of her key Cabinet Ministers, Andrea Leadsom, a Brexiteer who was the Leader of the Commons, she resigned, saying she could no longer support Theresa May's new version of her Brexit plan -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Every day of these negotiations, and back and forth, is a day lost in working out what the heck the country does next. \"Capital Economics\" overnight came out and said the probability of every option here -- an election, a no-deal exit, whatever it is, a second referendum -- all rise here. What happens afterwards? How long does it get for the Conservative Party to find another leader and to move on here?</p><p>DOS SANTOS: Yes, well, we've got to be careful about what we say at the moment today, obviously, because it is the day when the U.K. is going to the polls. Voters in the U.K. and the Netherlands are voting as part of the European Parliamentary elections. And as such, any kind of speculation over the positioning of these parties is off limits.</p><p>But whatever the outcome is, obviously that will also have a significant outcome on the direction that Brexit takes. Now, in the meantime, what we know is that the planned Brexit vote that was earlier floated earlier on in this week when Theresa May gave a speech slightly a changing her Brexit stance as she prepares to bring this withdrawal agreement over to Parliament to vote for a fourth time that was supposed to take place on the third of June. It appears as though that has been pulled.</p><p>So the next round of voting again, is in disarray in terms of the timeframe. And as you pointed out, yet, again, each time we've seen the opportunity of a second referendum bubbling up, it appears to go away, a hard Brexit bubbling up, that goes away. Now, we could be into leadership territory and potentially as you said, a new election -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the three words I was going to say, \"Not anytime soon.\" Nina dos Santos, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break. Still ahead, facing a grilling. McDonald's work is taking their beef with management out into the streets as activists turn up the heat at the company's AGM.</p><p>And staying grounded, regulators meet to decide the fate of Boeing 737 MAX jets, but the plane's next takeoff is likely to be further delayed. Stay with us. You're watching FIRST MOVE.</p><p>[09:21:26] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE down on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and we are counting down to what looks like more losses for the U.S. equity markets at this moment, the NASDAQ under most pressure at this stage. Also Europe, the handover was weak with the ECB warning and perhaps that we won't see a recovery in the back half of this year. That's adding over in currency land to some dollar strength.</p><p>Remember, we were talking yesterday on the show about the weakness in Asian currencies as well. The pressure that we've seen on those -- all currency has -- related to what we're seeing in terms of the trade deal or the non- trade deal. Are we still too complacent?</p><p>Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management joins us now. Lisa, always a pleasure to have you on the show.</p><p>LISA SHALETT, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, MORGAN STANLEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Good to see you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You have been warning about complacency about the trade deal for a while and perhaps you don't get it? I mean, it's kind of coming to fruition here?</p><p>SHALETT: Well, look, I think we're at a point where both sides feel that they have the wherewithal to wait out a little bit of a standoff.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: To --</p><p>SHALETT: Exactly. You know, so in the United States, clearly, you know, President Trump feels like he's got enough economic strain, enough consumer and business confidence behind him, the markets are holding up, you know, and he wants to wait for his deal.</p><p>On the other side of it, I think, you know, Chinese policymakers feel like \"Wait, we're in a recovery. We just inserted about $250 billion worth of stimulus, and we're not prepared to just cave right when our economy is beginning to rebound as well.\"</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I know it's dangerous to talk in aggregate about these markets because when you look beneath the surface, particularly at some of the big tech stocks as well, we've seen far greater pressure that we've seen, in absolute terms. Do you think we can make fresh record highs here in stocks while we don't see a trade deal happening?</p><p>SHALETT: I do not.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No.</p><p>SHALETT: I do not. So fundamentally, from where I said, I think that the markets are really going to stall out here, I think as we get into the end of the second quarter and into June, people are going to have to start talking about those earnings estimates, again, for the quarter. And I just don't think the fundamentals, in fact, are all that strong.</p><p>Yesterday's U.S. retail sales results from some of the players, I think it's indication of that, that there is this disconnect between the confidence levels and what consumers are actually doing. I think we're going to see something similar with businesses where business confidence is held up. But I don't think capital spending and some of those investments are following through.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What you were just listening to there, by the way, was not cheering and clapping for us, unfortunately.</p><p>SHALETT: Unfortunately.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That was for the U.S. Armed Forces entering the New York Stock Exchange during the opening bell this morning. So I will just point that out.</p><p>SHALETT: It is saluting, yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it is. And to bring back to what you were saying, I think which is a really important point, we've almost forgotten about what's going on beneath the surface. Not necessarily with the fundamentals, but with earning season in particular.</p><p>I mean, if we look at what we've got, the bearishness that we had coming into earning season for the larger cap stocks, there have been expectations. The smaller caps --</p><p>SHALETT: Yes. Destroyed.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Destroyed. Talk me through that, too.</p><p>SHALETT: Yes, so it's very interesting and this is one of the things that we're trying to alert clients to, is that small cap stocks are typically much more correlated with the underlying health of the U.S. domestic economy.</p><p>And the weakness here really, we think, illustrates the broader trend. And so while some of the large cap multinational companies may be benefiting from some of the cross currents and some of the little bit stronger growth coming out of China, the smaller caps are not and that's the U.S. domestic economy.</p><p>[09:25:13] CHATTERLEY: It is very interesting, because -- and we spoke to Eric Rosengren of the Boston Federal Reserve this week and he said actually, if you could take the trade situation out of it, actually, the underlying strength of the economy, it is in pretty good shape. It looks pretty good at this stage.</p><p>And obviously, the debate over inflation, and when look at oil prices, and I look at the impact of tariffs, I think, actually, we could be quite dramatically surprised by inflation here.</p><p>SHALETT: Absolutely and this has been another one of our hypotheses at Morgan Stanley is that everyone is so convinced that inflation is dead. That's exactly when you get the surprise whether it comes from wages, it comes from commodities, it comes from tariffs, you know, or some other geopolitical event.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, so bottom line here what should investors be doing?</p><p>SHALETT: So I think now is the time to absolutely play defense here. So within the U.S. stock markets, we are you know kind of selling tech stocks and we're buying things like staples, like utilities, like energy and really playing it safe.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Defensive. Yes. Do not get excitable in these markets.</p><p>SHALETT: Not right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Be careful and particularly, as you said the point as we head into the summer as well and perhaps a further rationalization.</p><p>SHALETT: Sow in May.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Oh dear, now you've done it. Lisa Shalett, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>SHALETT: All right, good to see you, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The chief investment officer there at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. All right, we are counting down to the market open this morning. A weaker open as you can see, and you just heard there, avoid the tech stocks. Some of those, we will be discussing shortly, the likes of Qualcomm, Apple of course with that ruling yesterday, and of course Tesla and the pressure continuing on that stock, too.</p><p>Plenty more to come. Stay with us. You're watching FIRST MOVE and the open is next.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the New York Stock Exchange, a vigorous ringing of the opening bell from members of the U.S. Armed Forces, not enough to shake these markets into positive territory though. We're expecting a lower open and indeed that's what we've got right now.</p><p>The Dow in fact on track for five straight weeks of losses though it is only Thursday session, remember, continuing to keep an eye on what we're seeing in terms of the semiconductors as well. Those stocks under pressure this month, the Chip Index has fallen some 13 percent. Context, though, everything. Still up some 16 percent year-to-date, but we have to see as Lisa Shalett was just mentioning there, of course, the CIO of Morgan Stanley. If this pressure continues to intensify, if don't see a trade deal, then watch this space.</p><p>The flight to safety as well that I mentioned earlier on in the show going on in Europe also happening here in the United States. We've got 10-year U.S. bond yields down to 2.35 percent right now.</p><p>Okay, let me walk you through our global equity movers. Best Buy in focus posting better than expected profits, more people using the subscription- based tech support and shopping online. Q2 sales and profits forecast also beat testaments. However, they didn't raise their full year outlook.</p><p>The CEO said the impact of tariffs at 25 percent will result in price increases and will be felt by U.S. consumers.</p><p>All right, right now up some 0.7 percent, Qualcomm also in focus and Mizuho Securities downgrading the stock from buy to neutral. They're concerned over Wednesday's Financial Trade Commission -- the FTC's ruling, the judge said the chipmaker violated antitrust laws.</p><p>Qualcomm, of course said it's going to appeal the ruling. We will talk about this in few moments, but down a further 3 percent right now.</p><p>Tesla also in focus. Its stock has actually turned tired. It had been headed for a seven straight day of losses this week. The list of Wall Street analysts concerned about its finances have been growing. The likes of Loup Ventures, cofounder, Gene Munster says Tesla will likely fall short of delivery expectations this year as the U.S.-China trade will worsens.</p><p>He lowered his delivery estimates for this year by some 10 percent kicking off actually down half percent, so it is chopping around a bit here. We will continue to keep an eye on that.</p><p>Now kicking off what was a cascade, I think of analyst reviews here. Dan Ives, Managing Director of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities. And of course, he cut his target price early this week. And we discussed it the first time around, actually and the challenge that the numbers presented, what do you make of what we see now from a whole host of analysts? And actually a lot of bulls on the street turning far more concerned.</p><p>DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF EQUITY RESEARCH, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: I think the math doesn't lie. I mean, when you look at what's happening with unit growth, I think whisper numbers are coming down across the street. And it comes down to that \"P\" word, profitability.</p><p>If they can't hit profitability in the second half, they're going to have to raise another one to two billion in capital. Right now, there is a lot of fear out there in terms of Tesla, shorts are starting to press the name. But this is a huge white knuckle period for the name.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Why was this not evident before? I mean, I thought -- I agree that this quarter was alarming for a lot of people, but the bears here will go, \"Look, we've known this for a long time that the numbers here were really concerning and it was pretty binary one way or the other.\" Do you push back on that?</p><p>IVES: Well, I'd say if you look at their guidance, you know, at first it kind of looked like there was numbers that they could ultimately hit. But the big thing is, it is on the expense side. Expenses are ratcheting up that they can't hit profitability. I think that's why the bulls are now starting to get more and more nervous just given what's happening with that debt load. That's the albatross around Tesla's neck right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So ARK Invest who remain long term bulls, and we've spoken to them a number of times on this show, the likes of Cathie Wood, they came out yesterday and said, \"Look, guys, take our models, have a look. Input your own numbers. See what you think. We remain positive, we think that they've got enough cash. They're going to be cash flow positive for the rest of the year,\" given what they've raised in terms of cash.</p><p>They were all talking about the trade-ins that we're seeing for the Model 3, the demand in the premium demand segment, but also pulling demand from mass market buyers as well. They gave all sorts of reasons, at least in the short term to be more confident about what Tesla is doing here.</p><p>IVES: Look, it may all sound good on paper. But I think at this point, this may be a better chance of me playing in the NBA than them hitting profitability in the second half and that's the worry right here.</p><p>I think investors are seeing through those numbers in the second half. The bonds -- the spreads are not wide.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>IVES: I mean, the bond -- one of this is where you do the equity market or the bond market is wrong and even though what was happening is spreads blown out, that's why right now, whisper numbers are coming down. And it's in ever side battle for them to hit those numbers in the second half. Still a transformational company.</p><p>[09:35:10] IVES: But this is a defining period for Musk and Tesla to navigate this near term nightmare.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Very quickly, how low do you think this price could go given what you said about short activity? The pressure that we're seeing in the credit, the bonds as well here and the cost of credit, the cost of money effectively for this company rising quite dramatically.</p><p>IVES: Yes, right now, it's kind of a blindfold dark game in terms of where the stock could go because from a valuation perspective, if they don't hit profitability in the second half, all bets are off.</p><p>So I think that's why right now, this is definitely a period where they need to kind of get that demand up. You need to see some tea leaves to have confidence like some of you were talking about in the second half. If not, you're going to start seeing more and more negative numbers coming down here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's move on and talk the chips. Qualcomm, what do you make of the FTC ruling yesterday? I feel like investors had a big sigh of relief because of the settlement between Apple and Qualcomm. And now it feels to your point again, and I'll use the phrase again all bets are off. What do you make of this?</p><p>IVES: I mean, when Apple settled with Qualcomm, it was viewed the FTC had a weak argument. And ultimately, this really came out of left field at exactly the worst time given Huawei and the nervousness in the chip sector, it comes down to Qualcomm is the horse that the U.S. has bet on with 5G.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>IVES: It dents their model, it hurts 5G. Now, you can say over the long term, it could be positive, but it just throws another wrench with what's happened in the supply chain right now, and that's really the issue. It came by the worst time for tech investors. It's just adding to the odds with the Huawei situation.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Tech investors and the U.S. government as well because as you said, Qualcomm versus Huawei here, this is kind of the last thing you needed ultimately at this point in the sort of trade tensions, trade battle.</p><p>IVES: Yes, I could tell you, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, when this ruling came out --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Pencils were snapped.</p><p>IVES: Pencils were snapped because it gives ultimately less power in terms of what's happened with Qualcomm versus China and 5G with Huawei and ZTE and others. That's why right now, this is one where there's a game of poker right now. But in terms of what Apple and Qualcomm to negative for stocks, it adds uncertainty and it just further fans the flames of what's happening with the U.S.-China worries.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, Dan Ives. I'm sure we'll be talking about both of these subjects more and more as we push on throughout the next few weeks. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.</p><p>IVES: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you so much. All right, let's move on now because we're continuing to watch Boeing as well and their stock today. Boeing 737 MAX will be under intense scrutiny. Aviation regulators from around the world are meeting to discuss fixes to the model. That's following two deadly crashes, of course that we've talked through continuously on this show.</p><p>The American regulators who will shares its safety analysis that said that it had no timetable yet for the jets return to service. Drew Griffin joins us now with the details. Drew, 30 international regulators meeting today, but the acting head of the FAA already indicating that it could take far longer than anticipated to get these jets off the ground again. What do you think we'll hear today?</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we have learned is that software package that Boeing said was completed last week may have been a premature announcement, Julia. That package has not yet been delivered to the FAA. So today, here at FAA headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, with all of these global civil aviation partners, there is really nothing to present.</p><p>The FAA is going to tell these global aviation groups how it plans to certify the plane when Boeing presents that and also ask for feedback to make sure that the FAA, the U.S. authority knows exactly what the global partners are looking for, but this -- there is no timeline as you said.</p><p>Daniel Elwell, the acting Administrator saying there is no timeline in the FAA, they're going to take as long as it takes. The bigger problem for Boeing may be trying to earn back the trust of the people who fly these planes -- the pilots.</p><p>Dennis Tajer is with the Allied Pilots Association. They represent thousands of American airlines pilots. He's a 737 MAX pilot himself. Listen to what he said just yesterday about getting back into the cockpit of the 737 MAX.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAPT. DENNIS TAJER, SPOKESMAN, ALLIED PILOTS ASSOCIATION: The aircraft is grounded right now. But no, our pilots don't have confidence in the MAX as it was previously designed the MCAS. The MCAS is the thing here.</p><p>They are redesigning that. they're re-softwaring it, many of the things that we asked for, so we've got to see all those details. We're getting many of them and we like what we see. But yes, our pilots, they're not ready to jump in the airplane now. Good gosh, no.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFIN: Julia, Boeing has got to win back to trust of the pilots, of the flying public. The FAA here has to win back the trust of its global civil aviation partners. Look for a bifurcated kind of approval process where the FAA eventually may approve this plane.</p><p>[09:40:10] GRIFFIN: But then the international partners would take their time to evaluate exactly what the FAA did to certify the 737 MAX. A long way to go. I don't think that timetable that we heard about in August is going to make it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I agree with you. And I think probably the Chinese regulators will be right at the back of that queue. There's all sorts of things here.</p><p>Drew, fantastic to have you with us. Drew Griffin there. Thank you so much.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on the FIRST MOVE, but the biggest election in the world, turning into the one of the most incredible. Find out why as we head to India, for the election latest. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and an election that affects one in eight people on the planet has ended in a landslide. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed victory while the main opposition has conceded defeat. Sam Kiley is in New Delhi as we speak and actually, we're showing you live pictures there outside Narendra Modi's party, the BJP's headquarters in New Delhi as you can see.</p><p>I can see rose petals being thrown at him. His hands together huge celebrations going on there. Sam, just explain how astonishing actually the victory -- and a landslide victory that is for Narendra Modi at this moment.</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it was quite a staggering scale this victory. He was expected to win just by exit polls last Sunday, and indeed what we were seeing in the early stage of the of the polling. Now none of the seats or very few rather of the seats, Julia have been formally declared, but the Electoral Commission has been doing a running tally of the seats where the BJP is in the lead out of 542.</p><p>[09:45:06] KILEY: They are now holding about 305. We understand and as part of their wider electoral alliance that would take them up to about 350 against the next major rival, the Congress Party at 50 and their alliance being around 80.</p><p>So it gives the Modi camp a massive lead, a really dominant hold now on Indian parliamentary politics, and builds on the majority that he won the first majority success in 2014 in about 30 years. So he has emerged really as an indomitable force now in Indian politics.</p><p>The issue will be the extent to which his campaigning on a very strong Hindu nationalist line, whether he continues in that vein or whether he now feels sufficiently politically confident to be more liberal in his approach. Most commentators fear that he will actually probably harden his line.</p><p>Very quick to congratulate him on this victory were fellow populist leaders, Bibi Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin. Imran Khan of Pakistan, India's longtime rival, even enemy, also quick to tweet that he congratulated Mr. Modi and said that he looked forward to peaceful relations between the two countries.</p><p>Of course, it was Modi's handling of the response to what they said was a Pakistan-inspired terrorist attack in February, which led to Indian air strikes deep inside Pakistani territory, which really gave him a political bump in the polls. He had been dwindling a little, particularly on economic issues, but he seems to have been able to manipulate that into an enormous amount of electoral success -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, quite fascinating. Because if it had been about economic reform, perhaps it would have been a different story, as you point out, when the dust and the confetti and the rose petals settle, what does the outlook look like for India? It's going to be fascinating to watch. Sam Kiley, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, more to come on FIRST MOVE. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief,\" happening right now, U.S. Democratic presidential candidates are protesting alongside McDonald's employees across the country. This week, dozens of workers brought forth new allegations of workplace violence and sexual harassment.</p><p>They're also demanding wages be raised to $15.00 per hour. The company is set to be grilled on all of these issues and more at its Annual Shareholder Meeting today.</p><p>Clare Sebastian joins me live. Now, Clare, lively to say the least. We know that Bernie Sanders who is expected to be there too has been a key proponent of a higher minimum wage here as well. What more can we expect?</p><p>[09:50:04] CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, this is a serious escalation. These allegations -- sexual harassment, workers' rights, minimum wage -- all of these things is pressure that McDonald's has faced in the past, but a serious escalation today.</p><p>And I think a big part of that is the presence of these Democratic presidential candidates. It's not just Julian Castro that you see there in Durham, North Carolina. Jay Inslee, the Governor will be out today as well. Bernie Sanders is holding a Town Hall livestreamed at Town Hall with McDonald's workers. He has been, as you mentioned, particularly effective in getting big companies to change their ways.</p><p>Amazon, of course, raised its minimum wage. It said they had listened to its critics, including Bernie Sanders. Disney also raised the wage for its theme park workers. So this is something that could make the company really set up today. It's only a very important frontier for these presidential candidates to get their message heard.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're just looking at \"The Times\" though. It says Durham, North Carolina. I thought they were based in Chicago. Have we had a location shift for this meeting as well?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, we have. The meeting is actually in Dallas at a hotel near Dallas Fort Worth Airport. that has raised some eyebrows, because, you know, people have suggested that the company might have been trying to avoid protests, which are happening in 13 cities across the country, including Chicago and Durham, North Carolina, that you see there.</p><p>The company though told CNN that they did this simply to encourage the participation of more shareholders whether or not that is credible, you know, when Chicago is also a good airport hub is another matter. But certainly, the pressure from workers, these lawsuits and this protest has been mounting ahead of this meeting.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, or avoiding activist wrath. You can take your pick. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that. We will continue to watch that throughout the day.</p><p>All right, Amazon shareholders, meanwhile, rejecting a proposal for the company to stop selling facial recognition software to governments. There have been concerns over potential human rights violation, but investors rejected the proposals at the company's Annual General Meeting.</p><p>Now it's a week of AGMs, Deutsche Bank shares falling to an all-time low ahead of their Annual General Meeting, too. Investors, of course, wanting to know how Germany's biggest lender plans to move past its failed merger plans, and, of course, money laundering probes, too.</p><p>Deutsche Bank, as you can see, off a further 2.8 percent in the session Thursday. Anna Stewart joins me now. Anna, it doesn't rain, but it pours for Deutsche Bank. I mean, they've got a whole host of issues to deal with and very little clarity on the path forward here.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: And that's what everyone was really hoping to get from some of the speeches in the AGM today. And I'm not sure investors feel like they've really got the answer. And perhaps that's because there is no silver bullet to fix all of Deutsche Bank's problems.</p><p>It's facing, frankly, a very fragmented banking market. It still needs to make huge cutbacks, but it also needs to grow revenue. It has got huge problems. You'll see the share price there. It's at a 13-month low, a record low. It's not ideal for the CEO standing up and delivering his speech.</p><p>Now, you've got to feel him, let me bring you what he said in the opening remarks, because he is fairly new to the course, Christian Sewing, he says, \"Being the CEO is the full package. It's challenging, demanding, it's full of surprises. Now and then, it's highly emotional, and sometimes also quite exhausting.\" You've got to feel very sorry for him. Big focus today. Lots of far reaching cuts, lots of cuts generally particularly to investment banking, and more of a focus on the much less exciting, less sexy side of banking, global transaction banking -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the problem is as well, I'm just not even sure leadership change is the answer here, given the sheer quantity and the complexity of the struggles, particularly the timing as well, if you look at the economics in Europe.</p><p>STEWART: Particularly, what we're looking for at the moment from the AGM is the votes which still haven't come through, I believe. And the key one, of course, is just really interesting, when normally a very boring part of a German AGM, which is whether or not shareholders ratify what the Board has done in the past year.</p><p>Now, this was really interesting with Bayer, where we had over 50 percent of shareholders revolting, and refusing to ratify the Board's actions, we could potentially see the same today, that would be very interesting. There have been moves from some advisory groups that they should vote against the Board, particularly as the Chairman who has been there for many years. He is one of the only constants on the Board. So some people think that maybe that will help change. But as you say, it faces such huge problems here, it's going to take more than that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, well, I wonder what a merger with another European partner might do, or is that just still so toxic to the German government here that they won't allow it. Something has got to give here.</p><p>STEWART: Something has got to give and particularly after the failure of Commerzbank, and everyone wanted to know what the Plan B or Plan C was and there wasn't a direct replacement. You know, there were discussions many, many months ago, a potential other options out there in Europe. I feel like they all got ruled out.</p><p>And the problem is it does face so many problems, particularly with their money laundering probes, lots of investigations, you know, potentially that brings big fines on to the table as well. So I'm not sure who would want to really approach Deutsche Bank at this stage.</p><p>[09:55:10] CHATTERLEY: Yes, I agree -- and morale -- imagination the moral inside as well. Ouch. We watch. Watch for those votes. Anna Stewart, thank you so much for bringing us the latest on that.</p><p>All right, as we're wrapping up the show, let me give you a quick look at what we're seeing as far as that markets are concerned. We are right now accelerating to the downside. Some one and a half percent for the NASDAQ as you can see, lower there. Dow and the S&amp;P 500 also looking set to add to the losses that we saw in yesterday's trading session.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier on the show, we didn't bounce off the lows yesterday and closed off the lows, so the price action again is something to watch, important today.</p><p>Let me give you a look as well at what we're seeing for the energy sector. Oil prices also coming under a bit of pressure. It fits with the broader risk off sentiment that we're seeing. The flight to safety in bonds right now, WTI off almost 4 percent.</p><p>So we'll watch that in \"The Express\" because I'll be back with you in a couple of hours' time, but for now, that's it for FIRST MOVE. I'm Julia Chatterley. We'll see you tomorrow. Have a great day.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019052301cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5Y-GMD1-JB20-G542-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7915\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 23, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

President Trump says that he might shut Twitter down after the social media platform -- after two of his tweets, two tweets, have now been flagged.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Hong Kong, the protests continue. We need to assess exactly the severity and what the message from China will be on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the return to space. This is everybody's -- and it should probably the best story of the day. SpaceX and NASA are trying to put -- or will hopefully put people, astronauts, into space from U.S. soil, the first time for many years.</p><p>It is Wednesday. It's the middle of the week. This is FIRST MOVE.</p><p>A very good day to you. Julia Chatterley is off and I'm sitting in. We have an hour together to see what is happening. We will also have the opening bell, of course, in a little while. The Dow and the futures are solidly higher so far.</p><p>Now, bearing in mind what we saw yesterday and the way we're seeing the market and the enthusiasm at the moment. It could be a second day of good gains.</p><p>The NASDAQ futures are lagging. There is hope for improving economic activity in the United States. It is offsetting worsening U.S.-China relations. It is the same underlying current and on any given day, one or the other seems to be more dominant.</p><p>China is still readying tough new security laws for Hong Kong.</p><p>News on a potential COVID vaccine is also helping what is happening. The Novavex CEO says its vaccine is looking promising and could be ready by the end of the year. That still of course means we would have to go through the flu season for 2020 to get anywhere near the numbers.</p><p>As for the United States, the number of people who have died is now nearing 99,000, and 350,000 people worldwide have succumbed because of COVID.</p><p>Asia, a quick run around the Asia bosses. Japanese stocks gained on new stimulus. Japan's government has approved a $1.1 trillion package on top of everything else. Europe is higher with financial and travel stocks among the best gains, not surprising.</p><p>The economies are opening up. There are firm dates for different parts of the economy that is why you're seeing Paris up two percent.</p><p>Let's immediately get to the drivers that are moving the markets and that we will be following throughout the course of the day.</p><p>In Hong Kong there has been more violence and police taking a zero tolerance approach. Three hundred demonstrators have been arrested over the new controversial new security law that is passed by Beijing without Hong Kong's consent.</p><p>Ivan Watson is with us from Hong Kong and has been speaking in an exclusive interview with the Chief Secretary Carrie Lam.</p><p>Before we hear from Carrie Lam, the overnight demonstrations -- overnight to Europe and the United States day time of course for you -- the demonstrations that we've seen, how would you rank them?</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Look, nowhere near the numbers we saw last year in more than six months of protests. The police presence was enormous around the Legislative Council where this new law that would criminalize mocking the Chinese National Anthem was to be discussed, the final vote on that have been pushed back a week.</p><p>The other piece of legislation is this National Security Law which is being drafted by the National People's Congress in Beijing which would criminalize terrorism, sedition, subversion.</p><p>Police in Hong Kong say they arrested at least 300 people for illegal assembly, possessing weapons, things like that here in Hong Kong today.</p><p>I spoke with Matthew Cheung, he is the number two official in the Hong Kong administration and he tried to reassure business circles that the new National Security Law would only affect a fraction of the people in this former British colony. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEW CHEUNG, HONG KONG CHIEF SECRETARY FOR ADMINISTRATION: 99.99 percent of the Hong Kong population will not be affected.</p><p>They go about their lives, they continue their investments in Hong Kong, coming in and out of Hong Kong, free flow of capital, information, and so on.</p><p>Foreign media most welcome here in Hong Kong.</p><p>[09:05:09]</p><p>WATSON: Could someone who is deemed or accused of being a terrorist or of committing subversion be taken to Mainland China for prosecution under this new law?</p><p>CHEUNG: As I said, all of these are details yet to be announced. Everybody is waiting for it. So we are also following developments closely. We will cooperate fully in the process and reflect the views, aspirations, and concerns of course of the local and international community.</p><p>WATSON: There are these concerns and people raising these questions and you are saying trust us, it'll get figured out. But you, personally, don't have a say in the drafting of this legislation.</p><p>CHEUNG: The answers will be in the public arena before long. The drafting process takes a bit of time, but in the process, we take account of the views, aspirations and concerns.</p><p>WATSON: Let me ask another question. There is very strict censorship in nearby Mainland China. Would that trickle into Hong Kong society? Into social media sphere? Into media?</p><p>CHEUNG: I doubt it. I doubt it. It is Hong Kong's essential --</p><p>WATSON: Can you guarantee that?</p><p>CHEUNG: Well, it is commonsense.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So, you can hear there, he is trying to reassure people that life will not change in Hong Kong, but doesn't have any of the details and can't guarantee anything because he -- the number two official in the administration here is not a part of the drafting of this legislation, which is being handled in the Chinese capital, Beijing.</p><p>And that is one of the questions, Richard, that has been raised by a number of governments around the world. Hong Kong is supposed to be ruled autonomously in this one country two systems system that Hong Kongers are supposed to rule themselves until the year 2047.</p><p>And there is no indication whether this would be a one off, where Mainland China dictates to Hong Kong how it is governed or this is part of a slippery slope.</p><p>And, again, this important official here in Hong Kong cannot provide guarantees because he is not a party to the process -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Ivan Watson in Hong Kong. We'll continue to watch. Thank you. As of course, if there are more developments, please come back. We'll talk more about it.</p><p>Now, Elon Musk. History is to be made. There are so many firsts in what is happening today. SpaceX Falcon is to carry NASA astronauts to the Space Station. Donald trump will attend today's launch.</p><p>Rachel Crane is with us at the Kennedy Space Center. I say there are so many firsts concerning this because you have got the first U.S. astronauts taking off from the United States for a decade or more. You've got the first participation by a private company. There are lots of firsts. What for you is the most exciting part about today?</p><p>RACHEL CRANE, CNN BUSINESS INNOVATIONS AND SPACE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Richard, first of all, fingers crossed that this launch happens today. The weather is being closely monitored here at Kennedy Space Station.</p><p>As you can see now, the sun is shining, but a few minutes ago, there were torrential downpours and the weather isn't just important here at Kennedy Space Center, it is being monitored all across the Eastern Seaboard, across North Atlantic and off the coast of the island that's because Crew Dragon has a very, very unique end-to-end abort system.</p><p>This is something no other spacecraft in NASA's history has ever had. NASA says this potentially makes the spacecraft be most safe space craft they've ever operated.</p><p>And for me, personally, Richard, the most exciting part is here to witness this historic event that we hope will take off today.</p><p>It's been nearly nine years since U.S. astronauts have launched American rockets from American soil. So, this is hopefully, it will be a very, very historic day and we will be here to witness it.</p><p>QUEST: Now, the President will also be there to witness it, which adds an element to it. But I guess, what we're -- the other thing I'm fascinated about is that NASA is launching during a pandemic and the measures they've had to ensure that the astronauts, themselves, have not caught coronavirus and that those around them could not have infected them.</p><p>CRANE: That's correct, Richard. It is not just NASA having to take those precautions, also SpaceX. You know, a lot of their employees, the ones that can, working from home, but of course NASA proceeded forward with this launch deeming it mission critical.</p><p>You can feel, though, the difference here at the Kennedy Space Center today. The fact that this is happening during a pandemic. The crowds, they are nowhere to be seen. Even the media coverage.</p><p>Typically, there would be over 1,500 people credentialed for this event and there is just, you know, a few handfuls of us here today.</p><p>But NASA, you know, they tested the astronauts twice now to make sure they do not have COVID. As with any mission, they've been quarantined for two weeks prior to lift-off.</p><p>Temperature checks being taken all across Kennedy here, and anyone that is coming into contact with the astronauts and everyone wearing masks and protective gear.</p><p>So, you know, they are taking all of the proper precautions to make sure that the astronauts are safe, so they do not then infect anybody onboard the station -- Richard.</p><p>[09:10:32]</p><p>QUEST: Okay. Quick question for a quick answer. What is your gut feeling? Will it launch today?</p><p>CRANE: You know, we're at 60 percent favorable weather at this point. I am praying that it takes off, but all I can go is with the data and right now, they say 60 percent, so crossing these fingers, Richard. You'll be the first to see and know.</p><p>QUEST: All right. I will. Because if it launches, we will know hopefully with \"Quest Means Business,\" we'll be on air at the time. Rachel, I am very envious. Watching a launch is a tremendous experience. Thank you for joining us this morning. I appreciate it.</p><p>Donald Trump is threatening social media with more regulation or even closure after Twitter has now branded and put a mark against two of his tweets.</p><p>Donie O'Sullivan is with me. The President's words basically leave little room for doubt. He says that the conservatives are not getting a fair crack at the whip. They're being censored and he'll regulate or close them down. Can he?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Essentially not. No, Richard. I mean, he could -- what lawmakers in Washington could do is they could make it a lot more difficult and a lot more expensive for companies like Twitter to do business. They could bring in a whole lot of new laws and new rules.</p><p>Not about regulating speech as such, but making the companies responsible for threats that are made on their platform, hate that posted on their platform, which I guess is sort of ironic enough coming from the President of the United States.</p><p>But you know, this was entirely predictable. Over all Memorial Weekend, the holiday weekend here in the United States, President Trump was tweeting misinformation, falsely accused Joe Scarborough, a former Congressman and now TV host here of murder, was making false claims about mail-in ballots, saying that the Governor in California was sending mail-in ballots to undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Of course, mail-in ballots are becoming a big issue here as America prepares for an election in the time of COVID-19.</p><p>So, really, I think he was testing the limits of what he could say on the platform. It is the first time that Twitter has really taken any action against its most prolific user and right on cue pretty much on Tuesday evening when they did take this action, the President, his campaign, the White House were immediately out there saying, this is anticonservative bias and that Twitter, they say, is trying to stifle free speech.</p><p>QUEST: I guess, Facebook hasn't followed suit as far as I know and others are watching. Do you get the feeling, Donie, this is Twitter putting its toe in the water to see what would happen before doing anything more drastic such as actually removing a tweet or forbidding a tweet or taking it -- I mean, can't imagine taking the account down.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes, it is so hard to know, Richard. I mean, you know as well as I do that Silicon Valley, these technology executives, they really don't want to get in the fact checking business.</p><p>One, because it is politically explosive; but, two, it is pretty expensive. I mean, you can't really train algorithms to check facts in the way that is demanded, so they have to hire human beings which eventually cuts into their bottom line.</p><p>So they have been really, really been slow. I mean, Trump has tweeted hundreds, if not thousands of pieces of misinformation down through the years that Twitter has left to fly.</p><p>So, it's difficult to see or to really know I think what these companies want to do. They're inconsistent in implementing their own rules.</p><p>As you mentioned, Facebook, the exact same message actually. Trump posted the exact same message about mail-in ballots in California. He posted that exact same message on Facebook and Facebook did nothing about it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Twitter and Facebook will go to Congress together as they've testified numerous times and say when it comes to misinformation about the election, we're in sync, we're working together.</p><p>So, it is so difficult to know where this is going to go, but I think it is going to really be a hot political potato for Trump and for Democrats this political cycle.</p><p>[09:15:09]</p><p>QUEST: Donie O'Sullivan, thank you. Anna Stewart is next. We will talk about the E.U. bailout proposals and the idea that they are going to introduce some form of mutualized borrowing.</p><p>Anna Stewart is with me. The budget has been put out. This is a recovery plan. Is it part of the major normal budget or is this something special that they are planning? And to thread the whole lot in there, Anna, is this mutualization of debt?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: It is effectively mutualization of debt. It is not dissimilar to something we were talking about weeks and weeks ago that was highly controversial, corona bonds.</p><p>Now, this is being attached to the next seven-year budget, so it is part of those negotiations, but that is separate, and the proposal today from the E.U. Commission is for three quarters of a trillion euros to be given out to different sectors and different countries that need it most and are separating that into 500 billion euros that will be given out in grants that do not have to be paid back, and 250 billion euros in loans.</p><p>This is crucial for the Southern European member states. Those that entered the pandemic already with heavy levels of debt, also those of course that rely on tourism, so they are extremely badly hit economically due to lockdown -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Anna Stewart. Anna, thank you.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at the stories making news from around the world this morning.</p><p>And of course, we start with Latin America. It's become a new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic with more infections reported per day than in Europe or the United States.</p><p>More than 2.4 million cases have been diagnosed across the region and 140,000 people have died.</p><p>Here in the U.S., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, I do love the way we call him. That is -- in other words, he is likely to get the job as the nominee -- strongly criticized President Trump for not wearing a facemask.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He is a fool. An absolute fool to talk that way. I mean, every leading doctor in the world is saying we should wear a mask when you are in a crowd.</p><p>I think you've got a President that is supposed to lead by example, and I've watched the President yesterday wearing no mask, you know, and still making fun of the fact that I wore a mask.</p><p>The truth of the matter is that I think you're supposed to lead by example.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Still to come on FIRST MOVE live from the living room as they say, a new SpaceX mission is poised to make history. The head of NASA will tell me what it means for the U.S. Space Program.</p><p>And a kiosk that checks your temperature in under a second. The company whose technology could revolutionize the fight against COVID-19.</p><p>[09:20:54]</p><p>QUEST: A warm welcome back to FIRST MOVE as we await the opening bell, I should say will just be with us in about 15 minutes or so, and we'll have a look and see exactly how the markets are doing.</p><p>The futures are mixed, if you look at what is happening. Many big tech name firms are pulling back. The blue chips set to outperform after the Dow's two percent rise on Tuesday. They now seem to be the one that is going to do it on Wednesday as well.</p><p>Economically sensitive small caps have risen for the fourth straight session. The Russell 2000 up almost 3.5 percent since Tuesday.</p><p>JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon says the U.S. could see a fairly rapid recovery later this year. He says JPMorgan will continue to boost credit reserves for bad loans.</p><p>SpaceX is preparing to launch its first manned mission into space this afternoon. The SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule will carry NASA astronauts to the ISS, the International Space Station.</p><p>The Crew Dragon is a very different spacecraft than its predecessor, the shuttle. It was retired back in 2011. The crew sits in a capsule which is launched from a rocket called Falcon 9 and they will be wearing sleek, one- piece space suits, not at all like the previous bulkier space suits.</p><p>Jim Bridenstine is the Administrator of NASA and he joins me now. Mr. Administrator, thank you, very good of you to give us time. So good to have you.</p><p>Look, for you, what is the most significant part about what is being done today? Is it the return to space from U.S. soil? Is it the private participation of SpaceX? Is it the prospect for the future? What gets you about it?</p><p>JIM BRIDENSTINE, ADMINISTRATOR, NASA: So, I think it is all of the above. What we are doing -- and I think this is it in a nutshell, we are ushering in a new era in human space flight where NASA is a customer and we want to be one customer of many customers in a very robust commercial market place in lower earth orbit.</p><p>But also have numerous providers that are competing on cost and innovation. When I we are a customer, NASA used to purchase, own and operate all of its hardware to get to the International Space Station.</p><p>But now what we're saying is hey, we want to buy a service and we want you as the provider to go get customers that are not NASA, to drive down our costs, but we also want to have numerous providers that are competing on cost and innovation again to drive down cost.</p><p>So this is a new era in human space flight where it is going to be done commercially and of course NASA is ready to step up to the plate and be a customer.</p><p>QUEST: I'm glad you've taken us straight away down that road because we are a business program and we can now get our hands dirty on the business of space. But Administrator, is it a real commercial market? At the end of the day ...</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: ... besides launching satellites, aren't you the only real customer for putting manned space at the moment?</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: Yes, at the moment, we are. But we have to think about what is happening on the International Space Station.</p><p>We are proving that we can compound pharmaceuticals in the micro gravity of space which we cannot do here on earth. We can create immunizations, for example, we created an immunization for salmonella that we could not create in the gravity well of earth and because of that, lives around the world are being saved.</p><p>Now, it is not that big of a deal in the United States of America, but in a lot of other countries, salmonella is a serious cause of death.</p><p>When we think about, right now, we are proving on the International Space Station that we can create human organs using adult stem cells. In other words, we can use your skin cells to create an organ that is your own DNA.</p><p>Now, right now we are creating tissue, but eventually full organs and it is going to transform how we do Medicine here on earth.</p><p>These are commercial capabilities for the future and we believe a market in the future where there is going to be a lot of capitalization.</p><p>[09:25:10]</p><p>QUEST: If SpaceX, not that it would, but if SpaceX were to go bust, if Elon Musk's company goes out of business, are you obliged to bail them out?</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: No, I don't think so. Again, remember what we're doing, we are creating a marketplace where NASA is one customer of many customers, but we also have numerous providers that are competing on cost and innovation.</p><p>So, I wouldn't say that we're obliged to bail them out. What I would say is that in this process, we have been working with them in the development of their vehicle, but there is going to come a day where they have to stand on their own two feet.</p><p>And by the way, they're already getting customers that are not NASA.</p><p>QUEST: It is good to see you. We talked business, but the excitement of the day must not be overlooked. Congratulations, sir, on what I'm sure -- in a word, yes or no, do you think it'll launch today?</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Thank you very much. We wish you well. The Administrator of NASA and I am so glad we were able to talk business there, but the science will be today, the majesty of the moment.</p><p>The opening bell, I keep wanting to say closing bell because \"Quest Means Business\" of course, we are on the closing bell, but that is hours away, many hours away, so let's concentrate on the opening bell.</p><p>We have got the blue chips looking good. The techs are not so good, put it all together and it is going to be a great session on the New York Stock Exchange. Second day of trading on the floor in the post pandemic era.</p><p>It is FIRST MOVE. I'm Richard Quest.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>QUEST: The opening bell on Wall Street, off to the races. WarnerMedia, HBO Max ringing the opening bell this morning, ringing it virtually as it launches its streaming service. HBO Max more in a moment, that is of course, WarnerMedia, the parent company of CNN and we wish our colleagues and friends at HBO Max -- we'll talk more about this in just a moment, the significance of HBO Max and what it means.</p><p>Now, the market you can see there, really out of the gate has a fair old lick, up nearly 1.5 percent, a gain of 345 points as expected. Though it is a mixed open overall. The same themes as yesterday.</p><p>Global businesses are reopening and there is the hope for the vaccine. So the Dow is over 25,000 and the S&amp;P 500 has crossed a key support level, it is over 3,000. Bear in mind, as you look at these numbers where we were only two months ago for this level of recovery is quite extraordinary.</p><p>Twitter is down in early trading. This is after President Trump has threatened to regulate or even shut social media down after Twitter put a fact check label on his tweets.</p><p>Big day for WarnerMedia. HBO Max is launching today. They rang the opening bell. Brian Stelter is with me. What is the significance in the sense that there are plenty of streaming services, there are some new ones like Disney with Disney Plus, and arguably, HBO Max is late to the game?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Think back to At&amp;T and Time Warner and that announcement in 2016. The vision back then is what is actually happening now. A flagship streaming service that will take on the likes of Netflix and Disney.</p><p>Whether it will be as big and as successful, we will only know years from now, but at least, it is a major, major bet in this category.</p><p>Look, Richard, every major media company has to do something like this, some sort of online subscription model. Now we know what HBO and WarnerMedia looks like. I downloaded the app this morning. I didn't use my employee discount, Richard, I paid full price, I want you to know.</p><p>And you know, when you scroll through and you see a variety of content, there are a lot of options for kids, a lot of options for adults, a lot of options for families. There is a wide array of content.</p><p>So the question will be whether people will actually come and download it and check it out.</p><p>QUEST: You paid your own company full price?</p><p>STELTER: Full price.</p><p>QUEST: I am not sure whether to congratulate you or excoriate you, but regardless. We'll deal with that in a moment. The fact though, original content, Brian. When I look at Netflix, Amazon Prime which I think has some of the best stuff out there in terms of original content -- what is HBO Max going to do?</p><p>It has already making stuff for HBO and it has got Warner Brother Studios, but are they going to bespoke for the streaming service?</p><p>STELTER: They are. They call these Max Originals. There is a new one with Anna Kendrick called \"Love Lies\" it premiers today. There is a new Elmo show today.</p><p>There are some original series you'll only find on this service, but there are not a lot of them. And frankly, that's partly due to the pandemic.</p><p>Production has been shut down and that is a problem for HBO Max, but also a problem for its rivals. So HBO's argument is, hey, yes, we are going to be slowed down, but so are all of these other competitors.</p><p>Bob Greenblatt is the executive who is in charge of making HBO Max a huge success. He says this is all about streaming opportunities, not streaming wars. He believes four or five, most homes will pay for four or five of these services and that HBO Max will be in the mix.</p><p>That will be the real test to see if HBO Max can get in that mix. I'm the kind of person that subscribes to all of them. But most people are not like that. They are only going to subscribe to the ones they really, really want.</p><p>What this service has going for it is HBO. Shows like \"West World\" and all of those shows that people know really well, but there is a reason why HBO was never as popular as Netflix.</p><p>This company knows it needs to broaden the tent and have a lot more programming in order to compete with the Netflixes of the world.</p><p>QUEST: Our boss, the new CEO of WarnerMedia has said that going global is crucial. It is the future. Now, we know that.</p><p>[09:35:10]</p><p>QUEST: But for too long, U.S. executives have regarded the large part of domestic money as being the Holy Grail.</p><p>Now, do you think that mentality shifted so that the rest of the world is as significant, bearing in mind the language differences as the U.S. domestic market?</p><p>STELTER: I do, but I think Netflix is so far ahead on this front. Look at the way they are producing shows right now in South Korea and other countries, which is giving them new programming in the midst of a pandemic.</p><p>It is Netflix's game and everybody else is playing catch up. And one thing that HBO Max is going to have a challenge with is the price. $15.00 a month, unless there is a discount. That's going to be a challenge to get people on board for that reason.</p><p>But if anybody has the pockets and the will power to do this, it is AT&amp;T. We're looking at a few massive players in this field. Netflix, Disney, AT&amp;T, and don't forget Comcast, they are about to launch their version of this in the summer, but also very U.S. domestic focus, the first.</p><p>What we are going to see is they are going to launch in the U.S. and then try to go around the world.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Brian, while we were talking, I got a note from the boss, I've got fiver to give you back. You get your discount. I'll take it out of my own pocket if necessary. I am so distressed that you're paying full price.</p><p>I might not recover before lunch time. Brian Stelter who has paid full price and that's an amazing fact.</p><p>When we come back, after the break, changes are afoot in the hotel industry.</p><p>STELTER: All right, great. Thank you very much. See you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY TAUSCHER, GENERAL MANAGER, FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, NEW YORK: ... gone through financial crisis and 9/11 here in New York and now, COVID-19. It will reshape us. It will reshape this industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: And the Four Seasons Hotel here in New York. How does a luxury brand at the top end manage to reopen for guests in the era of coronavirus?</p><p>[09:40:20]</p><p>QUEST: Two of Florida's key tourist attractions may get the go ahead to reopen, they are Walt Disney World and Sea World.</p><p>Between them, they are presenting safety plans to local officials. Disney is going for a phased reopening with the theme park having suffered a 10 percent revenue drop in the company's last earnings report. Not really -- I mean, it doesn't really tell the whole story because of the way the dates all fell. The COVID-19, one will expect a second quarter, there will virtually be no revenue in the second quarter and it depends on just how they manage to reopen.</p><p>Hotels are slowly reopening across the world, but how do you open a hotel safely, bearing in mind the virus, the needs of the guests? It all becomes even more challenging when people are paying thousands of dollars a night and you are in the hotel luxury market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): No buffets, no mini bars, no frenetic power lunches. In this unprecedented crisis, hospitality is being reinvented. COVID-19 has changed everything.</p><p>On Manhattan's billionaire's row, we now find a barracks for those fighting on the front lines.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): The Four Seasons is one of New York's poshest hotels in midtown Manhattan on 57th Street.</p><p>The hotel is closed, of course, to the general public. Instead, half of it is being used to house medical staff.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): The art deco details are here. That's just about the only thing that hasn't changed.</p><p>The grand foyer is closed as part of a plan designed in consultation with doctors at Johns Hopkins.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): Mask on, as I'm now meeting other people.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): There's an alternate entrance where I'm greeted not by a concierge or a porter, rather a nurse in PPE.</p><p>A temperature check, a few medical questions, and the ubiquitous hand sanitizer. Only then am I admitted to the green zone and follow the arrows.</p><p>Near a makeshift front desk, fine dining and room service has been swapped for bottled water and boxed meals.</p><p>TAUSCHER: Difficult for us right now. Service is in our DNA. We love to connect as human beings and we cannot, we have to keep distance and we are providing without a human touch.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Rudy Tauscher, the hotel's General Manager recognizes this is hospitality in the era of COVID-19, but it goes against every fiber of his mine host being.</p><p>This Four Seasons is housing frontline workers so their precautions are extreme.</p><p>Now, that plan is being adapted for the general public.</p><p>TAUSCHER: The hotels will need to operate different. We are very fortunate here. We have a huge spatial layout. We have two entrances. We can design the hotel.</p><p>But if you don't have this opportunity and you have a small lobby and you have crammed restaurants, then you have to look at it differently.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): The world is starting to move. There's a glimmer of increasing demand for hotel bookings.</p><p>According to hospitality analysis from STR, occupancy last week hit 32 percent in the United States. That's up from last month, but let's be blunt, it's less than half of what it was this time last year.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): All hotels are now working out the logistics of how do you reopen in COVID world? Should room service be allowed in? How often do you clean? Guests who don't want their rooms cleaned, sanitizing all these rooms on a daily basis. Should gyms be allowed? Spas? The list goes on and on.</p><p>Can you imagine a situation whereby guests say to you, I don't want you to come in the room, don't worry about room service. Leave the sheets or the new fresh towels, I'll do it myself.</p><p>TAUSCHER: Yes, we expect the guests to tell us to not service our rooms today, come back tomorrow.</p><p>QUEST: But you never thought you would have to deal with these -- this sort of thing in your career?</p><p>TAUSCHER: No, never. That's a new one. I've gone through financial crisis and 9/11 here in New York and now COVID-19. It will reshape us. It will reshape this industry.</p><p>QUEST: The great advantage of a hotel is it is a refuge from home life. So said George Bernard Shaw. Now grand hotels like the Four Seasons have to redefine what it means to be mine host.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[09:45:18]</p><p>QUEST: Many us have been relying on the fact that we've had the virus and have had an antibody test which shows we've had it and have some protection.</p><p>Well, for those of us who have got that, alarming news from the C.D.C. The U.S. C.D.C. says that such tests are wrong up to 50 percent of the time. The tests look for evidence of an immune response of the infection, but the agency is warning the tests are too inaccurate to use to make for making important policy decisions such as whether an employee can go back into an office building.</p><p>In other words, it is telling healthcare providers to find the most accurate antibody test available and consider testing each patient twice.</p><p>And so do temperature testing, and a new idea, the Germany based Pyramid Computer offering which is a thermal sensing kiosk. The CEO, Josef Schneider is with me to talk about this, after the break. We'll discuss exactly what it means.</p><p>I beg your pardon --</p><p>QUEST: Josef Schneider is with me to tell me and to talk about this kiosk. Why is it different? What is different about it other than just pointing a temperature gun at somebody's head?</p><p>JOSEF SCHNEIDER, CEO, PYRAMID COMPUTER (via Skype): Hi, Richard. Actually, it is self-service and this will help a lot in order to make processes quicker and to integrate it in our normal life because the new normal will be nothing like the old normal.</p><p>And we have a lot of experience on the kiosk side. We are the largest producer of self-service kiosks. We have the most experience with over 33,000 kiosks in the quick serve restaurant area.</p><p>So, most of the people out there have already used one of our products, and we believe this will be the new normal very, very soon.</p><p>QUEST: So, looking at the demonstration that you were just doing on there, this isn't like the airports is it, where you walk past the thermal machine? This is where you stand in front of it, it does its business, and you get a print out.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Yes, because the point there would be to make it personal and to have the privacy rights opportunities with the person, so it is a cooperation between us who are doing hardware. We have a software company who does the interface and the database behind it which is IntraEdge, a privacy platform that is by Intel and that makes it very special that you are the master of your own data and it is privatized.</p><p>But all the venues like sports stadiums, and concert would have information on a person basis, but you are the master of your data and as you know, the output as well, I was in China during the SARS crisis in 2002, so that's when all the temperature kiosks came up and it was not clear back then, is it a one-time pony or it will last and it last and nobody sees it anymore.</p><p>[09:50:31]</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: So it is integrated in our normal way of flying and that is what we believe will happen as well, and therefore, it needs to be seamless. It needs to be something that you are not afraid to give away your data.</p><p>It is private data, your health data, and on the other hand, it needs to be quick and work on that end. And it is only a piece of the puzzle. Of course, it is only a first line of defense.</p><p>This is not everything. There are clear limits in temperature screening, so we believe that it needs to be more of a concept, but it is one piece to start the whole thing.</p><p>QUEST: Josef, thank you. We'll watch closely to see how it is used and how it is implemented. I am grateful. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>Now, the countdown is beginning for the historic SpaceX launch. The controversies and controversies -- depending on how you say it -- of Elon Musk. Clare Sebastian is with us.</p><p>You know my view, Ms. Sebastian. I'm always just amazed and impressed by Elon Musk despite the various vagrancies of his, let's just say, eccentricities.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Richard, I think you would have to be in the majority because despite the controversy which frankly has re-ramped up over the past few months during this pandemic, despite the various setbacks that he has faced in the past, his rise continues, his businesses, both Tesla and SpaceX have reached heights that few in the past would have deemed possible.</p><p>You only have to look at the stock price, Richard, up some 95 percent this year. But this is a man unlike other visionary CEOs that we see out there, unlike the likes of Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos who are so deeply intertwined with his brand and that is something that is going to continue with new challenges -- Richard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): Elon Musk's unfiltered style and unedited tweets haven't tempered his rise. Tesla is the clear market leader in electric vehicles. The company stock price has quadrupled in the past year and now, he is bringing back human space flight to American soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: He is almost viewed as half on-like in terms of when you look at the stock north of $800.00 going through this COVID-19 pandemic as a car company and everything that Tesla and Musk has been through on the cusp of launching another rocket into space with SpaceX.</p><p>The Musk brand has gone much more what I would say almost cultural iconic status among his fans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): Controversy is a big part of the brand and that has also hit new highs in the past few months. Musk tweeting, quote, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb,\" and proclaiming there would probably be no new cases in the U.S. by the end of April.</p><p>On Tesla's most recent earnings call, he railed against lockdown orders.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: To say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): His frustration culminating in mid-May when he reopened his California factory in defiance of local regulations.</p><p>While he eventually reached a deal with the county, experts say the move carries considerable reputational risk for Musk should the plant have health and safety issues later, not enough to deter a presidential tweet in support of Musk's battle to reopen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVES: As rebellious as he is, he is almost become viewed as such an asset within the country to both state government officials and others that have different transportational and logistical worries and that is why, I think you will continue to see that status elevate, especially not just on Tesla's side, but SpaceX is a big piece.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): Brand Musk has with stood multiple spats with investors.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MUSK: Boring bonehead questions are not cool, next.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): A lawsuit by U.S. regulators over a series of tweets that cost him the chairmanship of Tesla.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Musk's tweets were false and misleading.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): And a trial for defamation, which he won. And yet, as the global pandemic upends the auto market, competition in electric vehicles mounts, and he takes a giant leap into human space travel, the ultimate disrupter's brand faces a whole new set of challenges.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: You know, Richard, Elon Musk takes these big risks. He makes these bold moves, but he is willing to take on that risk personally.</p><p>The same CEO who said when he reopened his California factory in defiance of those local regulations, he said on Twitter, if anyone should be arrested, it should be me.</p><p>[09:55:07]</p><p>SEBASTIAN: He has gone on television this morning and said about today's launch, if anything goes wrong, it is my fault -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: I do admire that. It won't be his fault or may be his fault, but it is unlikely to be directly his fault but leadership from the front, one has to admire that, a great potential.</p><p>Thank you. Clare Sebastian with that.</p><p>Now, just a look at the markets very quickly just before I love you and leave you and how they're trading.</p><p>And bear in mind that we'll have the closing bell for you on \"Quest Means Business\" in just a few hours from now. Here they are.</p><p>The gains have evaporated from the Dow, likewise, for the S&amp;P. The NASDAQ is negative. I think it is going to be very hard for all three markets to end positive today.</p><p>\"Quest Means Business\" is in a few hours from now. I can't work out how many, but you know the answers. 3:00 New York. 8:00 London. 9:00 Central Europe.</p><p>And as always, whatever you're up to between now and then, I hope it's profitable.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020052701cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600V-PN41-DXH2-617W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Plus, how big tech is affecting your life and what government could and should do about it. This is Special Report.</p><p>Good evening and welcome to Washington. I'm John Roberts in for Brett Baier this evening. President Trump says, he wants meaningful commonsense background checks in order to keep guns out of the hands of in his words, crazy demented sick people.</p><p>The President also says the National Rifle Association one of his earliest and biggest supporters will not get in the way too much. The President made the comments during a wide-ranging impromptu news conference this morning before leaving Washington for a pair of fundraisers in New York.</p><p>Correspondent Rich Edson starts us out tonight. He is in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey where the President is arriving. Good evening, Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening John. And President Trump and Congress have departed Washington though the President and Congress are working remotely this August. The President says, he is confident that these vacation consultations will produce results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't want to have crazy people having guns.</p><p>EDSON: President Trump says this time is different. He can secure the support of skeptics in Congress for meaningful background checks.</p><p>TRUMP: I spoke to Mitch McConnell yesterday. He's totally onboard.</p><p>EDSON: And the National Rifle Association.</p><p>TRUMP: The NRA will either be there or maybe we'll be a little bit more neutral. And that would be OK.</p><p>EDSON: NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre says he opposes any proposal that prevents law abiding Americans from owning firearms. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he's encouraged bipartisan conversations about potential solutions.</p><p>Democratic leaders in Congress say, they spoke with President Trump and told him that \"the best way forward to address gun violence in our country is for Leader McConnell to let the Senate take up and pass the House passed universal background checks legislation.\" And for the President to sign it into law. But for some Democrats background checks don't go far enough.</p><p>REP. AL GREEN (D-TX): We have a duty, a responsibility and an obligation to go back to Washington D.C. and take up assault weapons. That's what people are crying for.</p><p>EDSON: McConnell says, senators will return next month as scheduled following August recess citing the alleged Dayton shooter. The President also focused on an Ohio state law requiring the government to expunge sealed records for minor offenders.</p><p>TRUMP: He did some things that were really bad. This school knew about it, when he turned 18, everything was fun. We're going to have to get rid of that.</p><p>EDSON: Other conservatives say, this is a crucial political issue.</p><p>JOHN FREDERICKS, HOST, \"THE JOHN FREDERICKS SHOW\": Here's my message to Republicans. If you don't do something here, you're going to get annihilated in the suburbs in 2019.</p><p>EDSON: And the President says his base is onboard.</p><p>TRUMP: On background checks, we have tremendous support for really commonsense, sensible, important background check.</p><p>EDSON: Before heading to BedminsterNew Jersey, the President stopped at fundraisers in the Hamptons. One of the hosts, Stephen Ross, the real estate developer whose company owns Equinox and Soul Cycle and some high- profile celebrities are now boycotting the fitness chains. The President says, he appreciates Ross's effort.</p><p>TRUMP: He likes me, he respects me. We're doing a fundraiser there. We're doing another fundraiser with another friend of mine and I understand the fundraiser was totally sold out and it's very successful</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: The Republican National Committee says, the President raised $12 million today. He has just returned here to New Jersey where he's scheduled to spend about the next week and a half. John.</p><p>ROBERTS: Rich Edson for us tonight in New Jersey. Rich, thanks. President Trump says, he received a very nice new letter yesterday from North Korean leader Kim Jong un. Meanwhile, the President is playing not so nice with China. And one of its big tech companies. Correspondent Gillian Turner shows us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: It's much simpler not to do any business with Huawei, so we're not doing business with Huawei.</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President Trump announced this afternoon the U.S. is washing its hands of any and all dealings with the Chinese telecom giant. A decision that caps off a week in which China halted purchases of American agricultural products and allowed its currency to drop against the dollar to levels not seen in a decade. He handed the Huawei freeze out might be a play to wrangle concessions out of China.</p><p>TRUMP: That doesn't mean we won't agree to something if and when we make a great deal, but we're not going to be doing business with Huawei.</p><p>TURNER: The President taking care to point out his policies have garnered fans in unexpected places.</p><p>TRUMP: Chuck Schumer in particular loves my China policy as you probably know. He said not like, love.</p><p>TURNER: A claim that would stand to Fox News fact check.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): I believe the President's instincts on China are right and I've not been afraid to say so.</p><p>TURNER: Trump also says when it comes to the next round of trade talks, he could take it or leave it.</p><p>TRUMP: We'll see whether or not we keep our meeting in September. China wants to do something, but I'm not ready to do anything yet. 25 years of abuse.</p><p>TURNER: National security sources say the impasse over trade has made it exponentially harder for the U.S. to lean into China for help deterring North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Though the President doesn't seem to bother.</p><p>TRUMP: I think we'll have another meeting. He really wrote a beautiful three page I mean right from top to bottom, a really beautiful letter.</p><p>TURNER: Trump and Kim share more than constant correspondence. The President says they're both wary of the U.S.'s annual joint military exercises with South Korea.</p><p>TRUMP: You know why? I don't like paying for it. We should be reimbursed for it.</p><p>TURNER: When it comes to the broader region, North Korea is not the only thorn in his side.</p><p>TRUMP: South Korea and Japan are fighting all the time. They've got to get along because it puts us in a very bad position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: Breaking tonight, John. South Korea's military reports North Korea has fired two more unidentified projectiles into the Sea of Japan. The Pentagon has yet to weigh in. But if these reports out of South Korea are confirmed, this would be the fifth time in two weeks this has happened. The question here in Washington now becomes, how will President Trump respond. John?</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, if the past is any guide, Gillian, short-term missiles, short range missiles, rather, he probably won't say a whole lot. Gillian Turner tonight. Gillian, thanks.</p><p>TURNER: You bet.</p><p>ROBERTS: Continued trade uncertainty with China drove stocks down again today. The Dow lost 91. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 19. The NASDAQ fell 80. For the roller coaster week, the Dow gave back just three quarters of a percentage point. The S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ were down about a half a point.</p><p>Authorities at El Paso, Texas, say the 21-year-old man accused of carrying out the deadly mass shootings at a Wal-Mart last weekend confessed after surrendering to police. An El Paso detective says Patrick Crusius said, he had been targeting Mexicans in the store.</p><p>The detective says, Crusius emerged with his hands up from a vehicle stopped at an intersection shortly after last Saturday's attack and told officers, \"I'm the shooter.\" Wal-Mart has ordered workers to remove video game signs and displays that depict violence from their stores nationwide. There is no known link between violent video games and acts of violence.</p><p>Wal-Mart will continue to sell the games. It will also continue to sell guns. Although workers have been told to shut off hunting season videos in the sporting goods department where the guns are sold.</p><p>A 20-year-old man is in a Springfield, Missouri jail tonight accused of carrying guns into a Wal-Mart in that city. Police say, Dimitri Andreychenko was wearing body armor, had a tactical rifle and another gun, along with more than 100 rounds of ammunition when he walked through the store on Thursday afternoon. He did not fire any shots and surrendered after he was stopped and held at gunpoint by an off-duty firefighter.</p><p>Senior Customs and Border Patrol officials confirmed to Fox News that agents came under fire early this morning along the Rio Grande River. They say multiple gunshots were fired from the Mexican Riverbank in an area known as the Fronton main landing near Fronton, Texas. No one was injured in those incidents.</p><p>President Trump is heralding Mexico's work in cutting illegal crossings at the U.S. southern border. He also says, the massive workplace immigration raid in Mississippi earlier this week should be a warning to people trying to get into the country illegally. Marianne Rafferty has details for us tonight from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: This serves as a very good deterrent.</p><p>MARIANNE RAFFERTY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President Trump weighed in on Wednesdays ICE raid at food processing plants in Mississippi that resulted in 680 arrests, saying it's part of a larger strategy to curb illegal immigration.</p><p>TRUMP: And when people see what they saw yesterday and like they will see for a long time. They know that they're not saying here.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>RAFFERTY: Trump defended the secretive nature of the raid, saying the element of surprise was necessary to catch undocumented workers. But the President's 2020 rivals say it had the effect of tearing families apart.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We should unite families. The priority should be keeping families together.</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They're simply good folks who are trying to live their lives, provide for their little sons and daughters.</p><p>RAFFERTY: The Justice Department says 300 of those detained during the raid have been released on \"humanitarian grounds.\" This massive enforcement action in the interior comes as apprehensions for illegal border crossings have declined for the second month in a row.</p><p>Just over 82,000 people were detained by Customs and Border Protection agents on the southern border in July, the first time that figure has dipped below 100,000 in five months and down 43 percent from a 13-year high of 144,000 in May.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAFFERTY: Administration officials are touting increased cooperation from the governments of Mexico and Guatemala under the threat of tariffs as a significant factor in decreasing the flow of migrants. The hot summer months usually see a decline in attempted border crossings, but the CBP says these latest figures represent a much steeper drop than the usual 9 percent seasonal decrease. John.</p><p>ROBERTS: Marianne Rafferty at our Los Angeles Bureau tonight. Marianne, thank you.</p><p>A federal judge says the Trump administration cannot withhold millions of dollars in law enforcement grants from Oregon to force the nation's first sanctuary state to cooperate with immigration enforcement.</p><p>A judge says the administration lacks the authority to impose conditions on the grants that were provided by Congress. The Justice Department is refusing to comment on the case.</p><p>President Trump says Joe Biden cannot answer a simple question and he says he hopes Biden gets the Democratic nomination next summer. The comments come following another embarrassing gaffe from the former Vice President. Fox Business Network Correspondent Hillary Vaughn reports tonight from the Iowa State Fair.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden calls himself a gaffe machine.</p><p>BIDEN: We choose truth over facts. You had people like Margaret - excuse me, you had people like the former Chairman and leader of the party in Germany. The fact is that the bills that the President that - excuse me, the future President here that the senator is talking about.</p><p>VAUGHN: Today, the former VP is doing damage control, cleaning up his latest misstep.</p><p>BIDEN: Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids, wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids.</p><p>VAUGHN: Biden advisor, Bedingfield, saying the former VP misspoke and immediately corrected himself. Still, Biden is getting blowback, but not from 2020 Democrats who are steering clear of criticism for the frontrunner.</p><p>ANDREW YANG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think that's Joe Biden being Joe Biden.</p><p>CASTRO: I don't believe that the vice president was being racist in that moment. You know, I think that like a lot of us when we're speaking, he just got tripped up in his words.</p><p>JOHN DELANEY (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I don't comment on vice president. I comment on my campaign and what I'm going to do as President.</p><p>VAUGHN: The President isn't holding back his attacks.</p><p>TRUMP: Joe Biden is not playing with a full deck. This is not somebody you can have as your President. But if he got the nomination, I'd be thrilled.</p><p>VAUGHN: Biden's campaign firing back, telling Fox, \"Donald Trump's deck is all jokers.\" President Trump also had a warning for 2020 Democrats that are pulling the race card on him.</p><p>TRUMP: They call anybody a racist when they run out of cards. I'm winning in the polls. They're desperate. They've got lousy candidates.</p><p>VAUGHN: But caucus goers are pushing candidates to explicitly label Trump as a white supremacist.</p><p>DELANEY: Well, that's what I'm basically saying.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, say it. Stop with the semantics.</p><p>DELANEY: I'm not saying semantics. I'm being very direct about it. I said it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, you didn't. Say, he is a white supremacist.</p><p>DELANEY: He supports white supremacy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: Delaney is not the only candidate to get cornered over labeling Trump like that. Joe Biden also got peppered with the same question during his Fair visit. He told the reporter, \"you just want me to say the words, so I sound like everybody else.\" John.</p><p>ROBERTS: Tough crowd there in Des Moines. Hillary Vaughn for us tonight. Hillary, thanks. Up next, Democrats in Congress get ready to go to war with other Democrats.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 9 in the Twin Cities as an FBI agent testifies. The accused Illinois militia leader charged with organizing the bombing of a Minnesota mosque kept a cache of guns, including assault rifles that were altered to be fully automatic. Prosecutors allege Michael Harry and two others drove from Illinois to bomb a mosque in Bloomington, Minnesota. No one was injured in the August 2017 attack. Harry has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>FOX 2 in St. Louis is the father of an African American teen killed by a white police officer five years ago asks for a new investigation. 18-year- old Michael Brown was unarmed when he was shot. Officer Darren Wilson said, Brown attacked him and was grabbing for his gun. Wilson resigned but was never charged.</p><p>And this is a live look at Salt Lake City from FOX 13 there in Utah. The big story there tonight. Crews worked to clear the aftermath of nine different mudslides in the area. Authorities say they began receiving reports of the mudslides about 8 o'clock Thursday evening.</p><p>Several people trapped in their cars for hours until crews can bring in heavy equipment to clear out a path. And that is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from Special Report. What a beautiful scene. We'll be right back.</p><p>ROBERTS: Democrats in Congress are getting ready for war with other Democrats. The rise of progressive such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has many incumbent lawmakers worried about primary challengers from the Left. Tonight, Correspondent Doug McKelway tells us what they are doing about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Former New York 14th District Congressman Joe Crowley was a strong candidate to become the next Speaker of the House. Then along came an upstart bartender to challenge him in the primary.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): So, that's why I threw my hat in the ring.</p><p>MCKELWAY: She had virtually no political experience. Little money and even less knowledge of how to raise it. But Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat Crowley in a district where Republicans stood no chance in a general election.</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ: I can feel the energy. The hope is kinetic.</p><p>MCKELWAY: Her brief tenure in Congress has shaken established norms. She has no seniority, little respect for more senior colleagues. But she does have 5.1 million Twitter followers and social media savvy that has 41 other Democratic incumbents fearful of future AOC like primary challengers.</p><p>Former DCCC chairman Steve Israel tells incumbents take nothing for granted. The AP found 16 House Democrats have already raised over $1 million campaign money to stave off primary challengers. 20 others have raised a half million dollars in the first six months of this year.</p><p>One of the godfathers of the Far-Left primary challenge to moderate Democrats is Saikat Chakrabarti. Until last week, he was AOC's Chief of Staff. Three years ago, he convinced her and nine other Far Left Democrats to mount primary challenges. He was the money man and described how his money bundling operation for inexperienced candidates worked.</p><p>SAIKAT CHAKRABARTI, BRAND NEW CONGRESS CO-FOUNDER: Really trying to find people who aren't career politicians and part of the advantage of having this sort of unified campaign where the campaign infrastructure and fundraising is turned aside from the candidates is you can actually get working people to run without them having to focus on fundraising.</p><p>MCKELWAY: Last March, AOC and Chakrabarti were hit with an FEC complaint that they, \"orchestrated an extensive off the books operation through two political action committees.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: In her private meeting with AOC last month, Nancy Pelosi reportedly told her to rein it in. The speaker's motivation may have been to protect her moderate incumbents from a new wave of Far-Left challenges. John.</p><p>ROBERTS: Going to be an interesting election year. Doug McKelway for us tonight. Doug, thanks. Democrats competing for the 2020 presidential nomination are not conceding the religious vote to Republicans but getting the faithful to switch sides may take divine strategy, if not outright intervention. Here is Religion Correspondent Lauren Green.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAUREN GREEN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Democrats are not ceding the religious vote to the Republicans.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Galatians 6, 7 reads, do not be deceived. God is not mocked.</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D-IN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm walking the way of a religious progressive.</p><p>GREEN: Presidential candidate, and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is hiring a faith adviser for his campaign. So was Cory Booker, as Democrats work to appeal to a different kind of faith voter.</p><p>MICHAEL WEAR, AND CAMPAIGN CHIEF STRATEGIST: Some candidates are going to do better among some slices of religious America than others. And I think that's a healthy thing. It shows that these candidates are running with a level of authenticity to who they are, and what their approach to the campaign is.</p><p>GREEN: In 2016, the evangelical vote helped Donald Trump take office. 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for him. And while the Republicans have cornered the religious market on pro-life issues and traditional marriage, Pastor Jim Wallis, founder of Sojourners Magazine and a political activist says, there are other faith issues Democrats can claim.</p><p>JIM WALLIS, SOJOURNERS FOUNDER: The Bible has 2000 verses about the poor. 2000 verses. I never hear any of that from Republicans. Never, ever.</p><p>GREEN: But conservatives like Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council pointed. Democrats support of a bill in Congress that he says emphasizes LGBTQ and abortion rights at the expense of individuals religious freedoms. Perkins believes voters are looking for more than mere words.</p><p>TONY PERKINS, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL PRESIDENT: People who follow the Bible, they believe the Bible that it gives direction to our lives are not going to be deceived by the rhetoric. They're going to look at the record.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GREEN: But there is one thing that both religious liberals and conservatives agree on, it is that God does not belong to any political party. John.</p><p>ROBERTS: Lauren Green on the higher political powers at work this election season. Lauren, thanks. A federal judge in Virginia says, a school board's transgender bathroom ban discriminated against a former student. The policy required Gavin Grimm to use girls' restrooms or private bathrooms. The judge says that violated Grimm's rights under the Constitution and a federal policy against gender-based discrimination.</p><p>Up next, our Whatever Happened To segment on the Arab Spring revolution and whether another one is underway?</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight. The utility company operating Japan's tsunami devastated nuclear power plant says, it will run out of space to store massive amounts of contaminated water in just three years. Three reactors at the plant suffered meltdowns at a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northeastern Japan.</p><p>Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam says her priority is to stop the violence rather than make political concessions as the city's two-month long protest movement continues this weekend with a demonstration at the new airport there. Uprisings that began as protests against an extradition law have now morphed into calls for broader democratic reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.</p><p>More than 2 million pilgrims are gathered in the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to perform initial rites at the Haj. Today, thousands of pilgrims circled the cube shaped Kaaba at Islam's holiest site. The Islamic pilgrimage takes the faithful along a path traversed by the Prophet Muhammad some 1400 years ago.</p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be right back.</p><p>ROBERTS: In tonight's Whatever Happened To segment, the Arab Spring Revolution from eight years ago. This year has already seen the toppling of two long serving leaders in Algeria and Sudan. That has led some to question whether another Arab Spring type movement might be underway. Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Greg Palkot takes a look tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The Arab world in 2011 was the scene of mass revolts led by young people angry by the lack of democracy and jobs. Activists took to the streets and the Internet, targeting brutal leaders in the region.</p><p>ABDEL BARI ATWAN, MIDDLE EAST EXPERT: A huge hope among the people, they want to get rid of these dictatorship, military dictatorship in particular. And they wanted to establish democracy and that rule over the people.</p><p>PALKOT: Early gains and hopes were mostly lost in the authoritarian crackdowns, violence and religious extremism. In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak was forced from power after an elected Muslim Brotherhood government triggered more tension. A military government led by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi took over and cracked down again.</p><p>ALAN MENDOZA, HENRY JACKSON SOCIETY: There's no change in terms of where Egypt is. There has been no reformation of the economy. There has been no reformation of security.</p><p>PALKOT: In neighboring Libya, Muammar Gaddafi fell with the help of the U.S. and allies. But that led to civil war and chaos as a new strong man now fights militias to gain control.</p><p>ABDEL BARI ATWAN, MIDDLE EAST EXPERT: It is actually drifting toward more, maybe, war, maybe instability. We don't know yet.</p><p>PALKOT: Next door Tunisia, where the movement started, saw the most gains. The young democracy took its knocks but kept on track.</p><p>ATWAN: They managed also to stick to their ambition to keep democracy.</p><p>PALKOT: Important there, respect for some civil society already in place. Unlike other countries, factions compromised and religious leaders avoided extremes. With the region still facing economic and governance challenges, moderation just might pay off, analysts say, as seen in recent leadership changes in Algeria and Sudan.</p><p>ALAN MENDOZA, HENRY JACKSON SOCIETY: Fortune will favor the brave and will favor those who are able to live a reform that will actually over a period of time, it won't happen in one year, but over a period of time will lead to a better future.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PALKOT: The U.S. role in the Arab Spring was mixed, according to analysts. They say to maintain stability and tamp down terror, it's in the west's interests to foster careful future change in the region. John?</p><p>ROBERTS: Greg Palkot in London tonight. Greg, thanks.</p><p>Does big tech have too much power over you and your family? We will talk about it and what can be done with one of the experts in Congress. That's coming up next.</p><p>ROBERTS: Tonight we focus on big tech, how it is affecting you and your family, and what your government could and should do about it. Bret Baier talked recently with one of the leaders on this issue in Congress, Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I want to talk to you about what's happening with big tech and your thoughts, first of all, in the big picture, how you view it, how you look at its, what are the concerns.</p><p>SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): First of all, they developed a business model that is premised on taking stuff from us, in this case, our information, and our private data, without telling us, then selling it without our permission. And then trying to get us addicted to their platforms so they can direct more ads to us and also extract more information from us, all of that without our consent. As a conservative, I believe in property rights. I think that consumers actually, their information is their information. They ought to be able to control it.</p><p>BAIER: Where does the regulation fall, though? You have got a number of different things happening. The FTC is looking at it, the DOJ is looking at it. Congress is looking at it. How do you put all that together for somebody saying what's going to happen to this industry.</p><p>HAWLEY: You have got the FTC and DOJ looking at antitrust aspect of it. So are these companies, and we're really talking here, Bret, about the biggest companies, Google, Facebook, Twitter, are they trying to stifle competition, are they stifling innovation? I'm worried that they are, and we need a DOJ, Department of Justice, inquiry into that. I'm glad that that is what the administration is doing. I think that's the right course.</p><p>BAIER: As a conservative, are you in favor of breaking them up almost like a utility?</p><p>HAWLEY: If they violated the law. So if they have in fact violated the antitrust laws by suppressing competition, if they have gone out there and run competitors out of business in violation of our antitrust laws, then yes, I think breaking up has got to be an option that's on the table.</p><p>BAIER: So let me just take the other side, and that is these companies are some of our most successful companies in the country. And if you do that, if you find that point and you break them up, then you are putting the U.S. at a disadvantage against somebody like China who will take over that big behemoth kind of company.</p><p>HAWLEY: I'm not sure these companies really are our most successful or really represent the best of America in the way they say they do. Google and Facebook, they say that, but you think about it, Bret, what is it exactly that have given the country in the last 10 or 15 years? They have been willing to partner with the repressive Chinese government to make a buck whenever it suits them. They have advanced a leftwing agenda whenever they can. Are they creating jobs in the middle of our economy, are they creating jobs in the middle of the country? No to all of those things.</p><p>BAIER: Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook was up on Capitol Hill, was asked about competition. And here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: The average American uses about eight different apps to communicate and stay connected to people. So there's a lot of competition that we feel every day. That's an important force that we definitely feel in running the company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAWLEY: Look at the market concentration Facebook enjoys, the social media space, it's enormous. And I think he is worried about competition. We know he's so worried that he's tried to buy out companies who he thinks will compete with him. He has tried to absorb them and roll them into Facebook. That's an anti-competitive strategy. And that's why President Trump's Justice Department is looking at this, they should be looking at it.</p><p>But, Bret, I will also say that Congress needs to take action. Whatever happens on antitrust, Congress needs to take action to protect people's data, to protect kids online, and also to make sure these companies aren't censoring conservative speech.</p><p>BAIER: There's some stats that talk about addiction to social media, which are pretty staggering.</p><p>HAWLEY: Yes.</p><p>BAIER: And 72 percent of the American public uses some type of social media, and when you go to 18 to 29 that number climbs to 90 percent. And it's kids who really are getting absorbed into this culture.</p><p>HAWLEY: Yes. And let me give you some statistics that I think are really alarming. That is the correlation that we're seeing in studies between social media usage among young people, especially teenagers, and depression. The correlation between social media use and suicide, between social media use and the inability to form useful relationships.</p><p>Look, this data is early, we need more of it, but the early returns are alarming. And I talk to parents all over my state who say I don't want big tech raising my kids. I want to raise my kids. I want to have the ability to say no to big tech. I don't want them tracking my kids, I don't want them exploiting my kids, I don't want them taking my kids' information and selling it. I think we need to give parents that power.</p><p>BAIER: There's some who cast doubt on this whole legitimacy of social media addiction.</p><p>HAWLEY: I would just say, I think we should listen to parents and I think we should always be willing to allow parents to raise their own children and to give them the tools to do that. And as a father myself, I've got two little boys at home, this is something that my wife and I think about literally every day.</p><p>BAIER: So look into your crystal ball, let's just say the FTC and the DOJ continue their investigations. What happens regulation-wise from Capitol Hill?</p><p>HAWLEY: I hope that we'll be able to begin where we ought to be able to all agree, and that is let's protect kids, number one. So let's stop the tech companies from tracking kids online. Number two, let's give every adult the right to opt out of being tracked. And then we ought to give every American the right the know, how much is my personal data worth to Google? I'd like to know what Google values it at, and I'd like to get it back. If Google has it, I don't want them to have it, they should delete it.</p><p>BAIER: A couple more issues. One is the deficit and debt. Just passed spending caps and debt ceiling increase. On the campaign trail in Missouri you talked about concern about the deficit and dealt. Is this dealing with that concern?</p><p>HAWLEY: Well, I voted no on that increase on the deal that would allow the debt and the deficit to rise. Look, Bret, I think that we need to rebuild our military. That's something that has been decimated by years of feckless leadership of President Obama and Democrats. But over and above that, my problem with the current proposals that have come out of Congress is that it increases spending way, way, way beyond what is required to rebuild the military on the nondefense side. It's massive increases to no clear purpose. I think we have got to stand up and say it's the American taxpayer who's on the line for this, and we can't just do this.</p><p>BAIER: But if you don't have a president in your party who is saying that, how do you fight that battle up on Capitol Hill?</p><p>HAWLEY: I think the president has been strong on this. I think the president negotiated, it was important to him to get the defense increases and to protect defense, and that was the right thing on do.</p><p>BAIER: I followed you around Missouri campaigning. It was a big win against Claire McCaskill. Seven months in, your biggest takeaway is that this place is broken?</p><p>HAWLEY: It's broken, it really is. And there's no reason to just keep doing things the same old way. I think if the people of my state send any message in 2016 and 2018, it's that they're tired of the old ways of doing things and they're tired of the political establishment in both parties.</p><p>BAIER: So you don't think they hear the noise that we hear in Washington?</p><p>HAWLEY: I don't think that they are focused on the noise. Washington focuses and creates noise day in and day out. The people at home are thinking about, how can I raise my kids, how can I get a raise in my job, how can I pay for my healthcare, and how can I hold my family and my community together? This town is focused on elites for too long. Our politics need to focus on the American middle, the people who are in the middle of our society who sustain this country. That's what we ought to be about.</p><p>BAIER: Senator, we appreciate the time.</p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump takes on the big issues, such as gun control. The heated campaign rhetoric, and Joe Biden's latest gaffe. We will talk about it with the panel when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have tremendous support for really common sense, sensible, important background checks. Leadership is doing a really good job. Mitch McConnell, Kevin, Nancy -- I spoke with Nancy Pelosi yesterday, I spoke with Chuck Schumer yesterday. There's a lot of goodwill about this issue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: In the wake of two mass shootings last weekend, President Trump saying that there is a lot of good will, there is a lot of political support for meaningful background checks. But is there really? Let's bring in our panel, Marc Thiessen, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post,\" and FOX News contributor Steve Hayes. Marc, start us off tonight. Is this just talk, or is there really an appetite for something to happen?</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: I don't think there's an appetite for background checks. The legislation, the bipartisan legislation that's in the Senate is the Manchin-Toomey bill, and that failed in a Democratic controlled Senate. There is not a lot of support for background checks.</p><p>And also keep this in mind, the Democrats, any time there's a mass shooting, the Democrats have the exact same playbook. Number one, blame the Republicans. They met with, they had the Gifford shooting in 2011, so it predates Trump, call Republicans racist if race is involved, and then use it, politicize the attack and then use it to push gun control legislation that would have not stopped the attack. There's no evidence that background checks would have had anything to do -- would have done anything to stop either of these attacks.</p><p>There are things that could be done if there was an interest in not politicizing this but getting something done like red flag laws, where there's bipartisan support where you do something to make sure that people, you create some mechanisms that people who are reporting to the police as having some mental problems or look like they might be causing harm to themselves or others, that you could temporarily take away their guns and have a hearing in front of a judge. That's something that could have actually stopped one of these attacks. But that's not what the interest is. And they want to politicize this and push gun control.</p><p>BAIER: The NRA said very much the same thing that you did about background checks, but President Trump believes he can't get them onboard. Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I really believe that the NRA, I've spoken to them numerous times, they're really good people. I really think they're going to get theirs done. I think in the end, Wayne and the NRA will either be there or maybe will be a little bit more neutral.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Charles, the president does have a good relationship with the NRA. But in the past, he has said very similar things, and then it's just gone away.</p><p>CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": I think a lot depends on what happens over the next three or four weeks. It's the August recess, a lot of members of the Senate and the House are going to be going home and listening to people talk about this. Everything Marc certainly said describes what happened in the past. But this was an extraordinary event. This is two mass shoot things the course of a single weekend, at least one carried out by, at least for political motives, we don't know about the other one. And that changes the dynamic.</p><p>The mere fact the president and the Senate majority leader who have been hostile to any gun control legislation feel they have to talk about maybe doing it shows how much the situation is --</p><p>ROBERTS: But Steve Hayes, much the same was said about Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting, that was supposed to be the tipping point, that was the mass casually event that was going to change people's minds. And it went away. And then we had Las Vegas, and we had all these other shootings, and still nothing happens.</p><p>STEVE HAYES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right, which is exactly the reason I think Marc is right. I don't think it's like anything is going to happen.</p><p>I will say, the one outside chance that something will happen would be if Donald Trump himself decides that he wants to get involved. We've seen that Donald Trump can move Republicans in Congress on virtually anything. They're afraid of him. If Donald Trump decides that he wants to make background checks and whatever is on his list on the list that the White House is now considering real priorities, he can make them priorities for the Republican Party. He's moved the Republican Party on a variety of other issues if he wanted to do it. The question will be, does he want to do it.</p><p>ROBERTS: The president brought up as he was leaving the White House again today the notion that the political rhetoric that has gotten to levels that I don't think we've seen before, the president continues to be accused of supporting white supremacy, continues to be accused of being a racist. Here's what the president said about it this morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I don't think it helps. First of all, I don't like it when they do it, because I am not any of those things. I think it's a disgrace. And I think it shows how desperate the Democrats are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: He said it hurts Democrats. And then he brought up the idea of racism as well, and said you play the race card because you have got no other cards left. Doesn't, in fact, Marc, hurt Democrats?</p><p>THIESSEN: I think he's right. First of all, again, this predates Donald Trump. In 2000 the NAACP ran millions of dollars of racist ads against George W. Bush comparing him to white supremacists involved in the lynching of James Byrd. In 2012, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee said that Mitt Romney was a racist because of welfare reform policies. They said the same thing about John McCain. To Democrats, it's not just Donald Trump that's a racist, all Republicans are racist. It's like the boy who cried wolf. When you say it enough times, then all of a sudden you actually -- no one believes you.</p><p>ROBERTS: Charles, 30 seconds left before we got to save time for winners and losers. But calling the president a white supremacist and a racist, are you not by association suggesting that anybody who would support him subscribes to the same ideology. And could that backfire on Democrats?</p><p>LANE: Sometimes the wolf is a wolf. And I do think you run that risk of alienating a lot of his voters, but I don't think that's what this is about. I think what this is about now is winning votes in the primary and selling yourself to the Democratic base, and you'll worry about the other thing later on.</p><p>HAYES: There's polling that that shows that 51 percent of Americans think that Donald Trump is a racist, but Democrats are always taking it one step further. No, he's not just a racist, he's a white supremacist. They would be smarter to confine their arguments to the place where the polls support them.</p><p>ROBERTS: It's Friday, so winners and losers. Marc?</p><p>THIESSEN: My loser is Joe Biden, who gave a shameful speech comparing President Trump to George Wallace. And this is not, again, not the first he's done it. He called Mitt Romney, he said when Mitt Romney is elected he's going to put you all back in chains. So again, all Republicans, not just Trump, are racist.</p><p>My winner are the heroes of the 1944 Warsaw uprising. I just came back from Poland where I attended the 75th anniversary ceremonies with my 91- year-old mother who was one of the insurgents who fought in the Warsaw uprising. And I took my kids so they could see what heroism and sacrifice really looks like.</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump will be going there Labor Day weekend. Charles?</p><p>LANE: My winner is the police chief of Dayton, Ohio, Richard Biehl, who not only supervised a force who performed heroically in that terrible crisis, but he also looked at the cameras and spoke truth to the American people about the fact that these weapons should not be on the street. He called them fundamentally problematic in a civilian environment.</p><p>And my loser, the American public's sense of safety. We have people running in panic from motorcycle backfires in Times Square.</p><p>HAYES: My winner quickly -- or my loser, excuse me, is the House Republicans. They saw Will Hurd retire this past week. I think there are a lot of retirements to come, including potentially some big names. My winner, Colonel Roy Knight Junior, Captain Bryan Knight. Captain Bryan Knight is a pilot for Southwest Airlines. He flew his father back, was lost after the Vietnam War, last time he saw his father he was five years old at Dallas Love Field in 1967. It's a fantastic video that has gone viral and one of the few viral videos that deserve to have gone viral.</p><p>ROBERTS: What a warming story. Thanks, panel.</p><p>When we come back, \"Notable Quotables.\" Stay with us.</p><p>ROBERTS: And finally tonight, \"Notable Quotables.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't have the numbers.

Goes up throughout the course of the  day, slightly off the best of the day so far, and there is one hour still  to trade on Wall Street.  I'm Richard Quest.  These are the top business -  these are the headlines on CNN.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran is the first as the new sanctions come into play.  The Trump  administration's renewed sanctions on Iran's energy.  US elections and the  questions of the midterm, almost upon us, which will go in different  directions?  And Amazon, is the Trump administration about to try an anti- trust deal or anti-trust attack on Amazon?  Tonight, live from London, this  is \"Quest Means Business.\"  I'm Richard Quest.  Now, let's go.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good evening.  It's the final frantic, dramatic push for votes.  Across the  United States, candidates and their supporters are making their closing  arguments.  President Trump is campaigning right now in Cleveland.  It's  been a bitter campaign season and the most expensive midterm election in US  history and this is why.  The entire House is up for grabs, along with 35  Senate seats and 36 state governorships.  </p><p> The decisions voters make will affect everything from the Supreme Court to  regulation.  President Trump's agenda even how and where the electoral  battle lines are drawn.  Bill Clinton's strategist famously said, \"It's the  economy, stupid.\"  But when it comes to economic developments, there's  plenty to campaign on.  </p><p> So first of all, you've got surging growth, raging trade wars and growing  deficits.  To voters, the importance of the economy hasn't changed much  since the last midterm elections four years ago.  Forty four percent of  registered voters polled nationally say the economy is extremely important  to their vote.  That's down 12 percentage points in the height of the  crisis in 2009-2010.  Even President Trump doesn't seem too eager to talk  about the economy.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They all say, speak about  the economy, speak about the economy.  Well, we have the greatest economy  in the history of our country, but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk  about the economy, right?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Since John King is tracking the races and the issues as seen from  Washington.  If there's one man who is absolutely under the hood of the  suffology in this midterm elections, John, it is you.  So get out the  crystal ball and have a fiddle around try to mix the metaphors beautifully,  what are you seeing in the last 24 hours before?  </p><p> JOHN KING, CHIEF US CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  In the last 24 hours, we're seeing  some evidence of a break toward the Democrats.  This is very complicated  because for the House of Representatives, the terrain does favor the  Democrats.  They need to pick up 23 seats in the United States House of  Representatives.  They have a clear path, Richard, to at least 25, some  Democrats think even 35.  </p><p> So the Democrats actually have no excuses if they don't take back the House  and the late polling numbers suggest things are breaking their way.  The  Senate is much more complicated by the Senate races on the ballot this  year, many of them were in states President Trump carried big.  Many of  them compare - let me put it this way, a lot of these competitive House  districts, they're close to the suburbs, they're in suburban areas.  That's  where the President is incredibly weak.  </p><p> The Senate races, bigger states with smaller towns and more rural areas.   That's where the President is strong.  Democrats look to make gains in the  House.  They look to make a lot of gains at the state level, races for  governor and state legislature.  The Senate, the day before the election,  more of a toss-up where the Republicans are favored to hold their majority,  maybe even add a seat or two, but there is some late hope for the  Democrats.  They do see some evidence of a possible late break that might  let them not only hold their Senate seats, but maybe surprise us.  We'll  count them tomorrow.  </p><p> QUEST:  Is it - for everybody I've been talking to, is it possible or  likely that the last election repeats itself?  And that President Trump,  well of course, it's possible, but is it probable I should really say or at  what level of possibility that he actually does much better than expected  and out of nowhere the red wave or little trickle does become much  stronger?  </p><p> KING:  I rule out nothing.  Based on our 2016 experience and based on our  recent American political experience, not just the Trump win in 2016.   Eight years before that, America elected its first African-American  President.  </p><p> [15:05:04]  </p><p> KING:  A lot of people thought that couldn't happen.  So, there's no doubt  volatility and unpredictability in the climate.  I will tell you this  though, Richard, as for a total Republican surprise, meaning the  Republicans hold the House, even the President himself doesn't seem to  believe that.  </p><p> Over the weekend, he conceded the Republicans are likely to lose the House.   Just today, he said with zero evidence, this is a farce and a fraud, but  the President said he sees all this evidence already of illegal immigrants  illegally voting in the US midterm election.  Remember, that's the same  excuse he used for why he said Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016  even though he won the Electoral College.  </p><p> So the Republicans will suffer some pain tomorrow, all Republicans agree on  that.  Though you raise a great question about how big, how much do we  trust the polling?  Which wasn't perfect in 2016 because the climate is so  different when you look at the House and then the Senate.  </p><p> And to your point about the economy, if this President - if this is a  referendum on Trump at the midterm about his achievements, wow, right?   Maybe you don't like the tax cuts, maybe you don't know how the US pays for  them in the long run, but the economy is gangbusters, but is it more a  referendum on the Trump tone, about tweets not tax cuts.  If it's about  tweets and tone, the President is going to have a shellacking tomorrow.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, so define for me as best one can what would be seen as a  disaster for or a verdict of total disaster for the President?  And  similarly, one would be saying, actually, he did really well.  How will we  judge tomorrow's results?  </p><p> KING:  If by any way Republicans hold the House and the Senate, that's a  huge victory for the President.  No way to sugar coat that for the  Democrats.  If the Republicans can somehow hold the House, that means limit  the Democrats to picking up 22 or fewer seats, you would have a very narrow  Republican majority, but if you still have a Republican majority come  January, this is a victory for the President and his party, if they can  hold the House and the Senate.  </p><p> Again, the President is going to try to spin this.  If he loses the House  and wins the Senate, he's going to say his campaigning in the Senate states  in the last days is what saved the Senate.  He'll take credit for that.  </p><p> I'll give you a longer range perspective though, Richard.  We focus a lot  on Washington, who controls the House?  Who controls the Senate?  These  races for governor, down ballot races for state legislature are critical  across America.  That is where Democrats were punished in the Obama years.  </p><p> First they lost the House in 2010, then they lost the Senate in 2014.   Republicans now have 33 governors, 1,000 state legislative seats in the  Obama years switched from Democrat to Republican.  Do Democrats tomorrow  start the rebuilding effort?  If that's the case, then we'll talk a lot  about the next two years of the Trump presidency, but the Democrats need to  plant the seeds of a revival because they frankly, they've had a terrible  decade.  </p><p> QUEST:  John, we'll let you go in just a second, but after - talk me  through tomorrow night and obviously once you get on air.  What should I be  looking for and when?  </p><p> KING:  It's a great question, and we will get, just as we did in 2016, some  very early clues.  We may not know control of the House until we get to the  West Coast which takes us into the early morning hours.  We may not know  control of the Senate then if the Democrats are surprising us, we could  come down to Nevada and Arizona in the Western time zones, but polls close  early in Kentucky and Ohio.  There is a very competitive House district  just outside of Louisville, Kentucky, the sixth congressional district.   There is a Republican incumbent, Andy Barr in a Republican district that in  a normal year, he should win.  </p><p> He is running against a retired Democratic fighter pilot, military  experience, shot all her ads with a fighter jet just over her shoulder.  If  Amy McGrath is winning in Kentucky's 6th, that tells you the Democrats not  only have a path to get to the House majority, maybe bigger than that.  </p><p> So look at Kentucky first, then you come along the East Coast, there are  some seats in New England, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  We will  know two scenarios.  Are the Democrats doing what they need to do to take  back the House or a Republican successfully blocking them and then when we  start to count the votes in the Florida Senate race, then we'll have a  sense.  Is there any prayer?  Any prayer to what would be the biggest shock  the Democrats taking the Senate, we'll start counting the votes.  It's  going to be a long night.  Espresso tomorrow, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  You know, I have no idea how you keep all those facts in your head  at once.  John, we'll be with you tomorrow night.  Thank you so much, sir.   We appreciate it.  Thank you.  </p><p> KING:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  John has put it into the big picture of the politics.  We need to  put it, as we always do, into what's happening in the markets.  The day  before the midterms and Wall Street has a stake in the election as  investors are waiting, the Dow is nearly at session highs.  It's bouncing  around.  It would not surprise me, bearing in mind that when it's 55  minutes of trading left, we could see just that hold - unlikely, unlikely  that you're just going to see it evaporate in the next 50 minutes.  But, so  I wouldn't put too much on that.  Holding roughly where I would like to is  what seems most reasonable at this point.  </p><p> The Dow is near the sessions high as the tech shares are down, and if you  look at Apple and Amazon - now, Apple and Amazon are big losers at the  moment.  They are on the back of economic news.  </p><p> [15:10:06]  </p><p> QUEST:  President Trump has unleashed what he calls the strongest ever  sanctions on Iran.  A move to re-impose all penalties lifted under the 2015  nuclear deal.  The target in an investment company with links to Iran's  supreme leader.  Some 70 financial institutions, if you look at here, there  are seven investment firms, financial institutions, maritime carriers, oil  transport -- these are the main targets, if you like, of the attack on the  sanctions.  </p><p> The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is warning the companies to  continue to trade with Iran will pay a heavy price.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MIKE POMPEO, US SECRETARY OF STATE:  It should be noted that if a country  evades our sanctions regime and secretly continues sanctionable commerce in  the Islamic Republic, the United States will levy severe swift penalties on  it, including potential sanctions.  I promise you that doing business with  Iran and defying some of our sanctions will ultimately be a much more  painful business decision than pulling out of Iran.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran, joins me now.  So the full weight of  sanctions back on, at least from the US and as you're aware, other nations  and companies being forced along.  When would we expect to see the first  effect in Tehran?  </p><p> FREDERIK PLEITGEN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, I think  some of the effects have already been felt over the past couple of months,  Richard.  You already had a first round of sanctions where large companies  have already pulled out.  But this is arguably the much bigger sanctions  weight that could fall on Iran very quickly.  </p><p> So far, what we're seeing is that you do see a lot of politicians here who  are still very defiant in the face of that.  Regular folks who are already  feeling the pinch of it really fear that things could go very, very badly.   It could happen in the not too distant future when a lot of countries stop  eyeing Iranian oil.  A lot have already stopped doing that.  </p><p> The interesting thing from Tehran's perspective is they sort of feel, just  a little bit, Richard, that Washington might have blinked just slightly  giving some of those sanctions waivers where some of the biggest importers  of Iranian oil can actually still do that.  Like for instance, China; like  for instance, Japan and India as well.  </p><p> So the Iranians sort of feeling they might still have a bit of a lifeline  with those countries being able to buy that oil, but certainly, if that's  something that stops, they think they're going to take a very, very big hit  here and all of the talk of defiance, we speak to regular folks, they are  saying, they are already feeling the pinch and they do think that it could  get a lot worse, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Is there any evidence that a return - excuse me - is there any  evidence that a return to false sanctions would strengthen any seedling  opposition within Iran against the government?  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  So far it's a very, very important question.  So far I don't  think that there's any evidence of that whatsoever.  One of the things that  you saw earlier this year is that there were some protests here in Iran  against the economic situation.  We have to keep in mind that it's not only  the sanctions that are strangling Iran's economy.  There is a lot of  economic mismanagement, there is a lot of corruption, there is price hikes  as well.  There is a lot of things that people are unhappy with.  </p><p> If you look at the situation now that these new sanctions have been put  into place that really isn't the case anymore.  So the President, Hassan  Rouhani, he was under a lot of fire a couple of months ago for putting the  nuclear agreement into play.  He was taking a lot of heat from the  hardliners, that's no longer the case either.  </p><p> It seems that a lot of that anger is now being channeled towards President  Trump, towards the US administration, and many people here feel that what's  going on right now in the Islamic public is being induced from the outside,  it is being induced from Washington, DC, so it doesn't seem as though, if  it is, the intention of the Trump administration to weaken the government,  to weaken the clergy and the military here, so far, it doesn't appear as  though, at least from our perspective that that is currently the case  right, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Fred Pleitgen who is in Tehran, thank you.  Now Swift, which is the  international payment system, is not taking any chances and is cutting its  services from some Iranian banks.  Swift is the international standard for  verifying money transfers, which is a posh way of saying it provides a  secure network between more than 10,000 financial institutions around the  world.  If I want to send you money internationally, or more likely,  hopefully, you're sending me money, and then probably, it will go via Swift  and our institutions will have a Swift code that will go backwards and  forwards.  </p><p> Now, this is long before the days of blockchain technology.  Some Iranian  banks are now unable to talk to Swift after the firm blocked them from its  messaging system.  Swift says the decision is regrettable.  John Defterios  is in Abu Dhabi to put this in perspective.  John, the Swift found itself  in an impossible position.  </p><p> On the one hand, the US is saying, you know, \"You do business with Iran and  we will penalize you.\"  On the other hand, the Europeans and others say,  \"If you give in to external pressure on sanctions, we will penalize you.\"  </p><p> [15:15:10]  </p><p> QUEST:  So now what?  </p><p> JOHN DEFTERIOS, EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR, CNN:  Well, Richard, it was not an  easy call for Swift because it's based in Belgium right at the heart of the  European Union, but it's an international player and it will target up to  50 banks going forward here that are on the target list from the United  States.  </p><p> They said it was regrettable as you suggested, but necessary for stability,  so that's the argument they are using, but I think, we should remind our  viewers, Richard, this was supposed to be the round of sanctions that  targeted oil, not financial institutions.  The first round was strong  against Iran, but the second round really targets the financial  institutions here.  </p><p> We have 900 entities, financial banks, insurance companies, the shipping  companies and also the airlines.  Now, we know Russia, China, Turkey, the  European Union were against the US sanctions, so that how do they work  around the US Federal Reserve and US Treasury is a key question.  </p><p> President Rouhani of Iran said he looks forward to breaking the sanctions.   That's very bold as Fred was suggesting here, but it will be hard times for  the Iranians going forward.  I was looking at a World Bank report, a month  ago, before we saw the full weight of these financial sanctions, and they  were projecting a decline of 4% - a recession of 4% in 2019, inflation of  30%, Richard, and again, this is where it is today.  It could come under  further pressure of the Swift banking sanctions that you were talking  about.  </p><p> QUEST:  If you look at oil, the movements we've seen in oil in the past few  days, there has been quite a sizeable drop in that price on the back of  what?  </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  Well, you know, this is very fascinating to me, because  remember, Donald Trump was saying in the summer, we're going to take Iran  down to zero when it comes to exports and this is where the midterm reality  settled in.  This is a chart looking back just a month, Richard, and when  North Sea Brent hit $86.00 a barrel, Donald Trump hit Twitter and was  calling out for more crude.  </p><p>Saudi Arabia responded.  The UAE where I am sitting responded, Kuwait even  Russia.  We saw that price go from $86.00 a barrel down to $73.00.  </p><p> But that's not the only factor, Richard.  Iran's production has been  dropping, but it's not collapsing just yet.  Let's take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> IMAN NASSERI, MIDDLE EAST MANAGING DIRECTOR, FGE:  We drew an expected   part of Iran's exports falling to less than a million barrels per day by  first quarter next year and around 700,000 to 800,000 a day by middle of  next year.  So far, it has come along that path.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  So Richard, we're at 1.5 million barrels a day.  Now, the Facts  Global Energy is suggesting we get to 700,000 to 800,000 barrels.  Let's  bring up, Richard, the eight exemptions that were made here.  I was  surprised over the fact, the Italian and the Greeks got the exemptions as  members of the European Union, which have been fighting against Donald  Trump.  China, Turkey and India never were going to go along.  So it's  almost like legalizing, Richard the ability for them to continue to import  Iranian crude and as Fred said, the big Asian importers are in there as  well.  </p><p> This by the way, Richard is proof to the fact, you can't replace Iranian  crude that easily.  They were exporting 2.8 million barrels a day back in  June.  Donald Trump admitted he didn't want to see the price go higher  right now.  </p><p> QUEST:  John Defterios, thank you.  Now, Britain and the European Union are  rallying against America's hash new sanctions on Tehran.  I'll discuss with  the former British Finance Minister, Lord Norman Lamont after the break.  </p><p> And Amazon's headlines are coming thick and fast today.  Accusations of  anti-trust violations in the White House, a Saudi boycott and new clues  around 8Q2.  </p><p> [15:15:0]  </p><p> QUEST:  The European Union is staunchly opposed to the US sanctions on  Iran, saying it will try to protect European companies doing legitimate  business with Tehran.  Joining me now to discuss this is Lord Lamont,  Chairman of the British Iranian Chamber of Commerce, and of course Prime  Minister's trade envoy to Iran, and Lord Lamont, the situation now is just  about you're damned if your company is doing business - you're damned if  you do and you're damned if you don't.  It's who you want to be sanctioned  by or fall out of favor with the Europeans or the Americans.  </p><p> LORD NORMAN LAMONT, CHAIRMAN, BRITISH IRANIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  Well,  that's got a fair amount of force behind it.  There are companies that  trade both with Iran and the US.  They will have to choose.  Many will  choose to trade with America - that is inevitable, but there are other  companies that trade only with Iran or for whom Iran is the more important  market.  </p><p> And the object of European policy is to protect them from the secondary  sanctions, the banking sanctions, that even when the nuclear deal was in  force, were inhibiting European companies from trading with Iran, because  they feared that the banks, their bank, which might deal with an American  bank, wouldn't finance their trade with Iran.  So this is trying to protect  the European banking system from American banking, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  But the moment a dollar becomes involved ...  </p><p> LAMONT:  Yes.  </p><p> QUEST:  The moment and never mind anything as complicated or as exotic as  dollar clearing, then you're into a different ball game, aren't you?   Because then the Treasury and the whole weight of this could be against  you.  </p><p> LAMONT:  You know, that's right.  Do business with America, have dealings  in dollars, employ American personnel, have any American content in your  product.  You have got to be very, very careful, obviously.  </p><p> QUEST:  Are you disappointed at the way in which Europe and the UK and  other countries, that they've not stood up to the US in this sense.   They've said, \"Okay, you go off with your sanctions, you withdraw from the  agreement,\" but they don't seem to protect it.  </p><p> LAMONT:  Well, it's not an easy problem to solve because of the combined  effect of trade, the effect of globalization, but the special purpose  vehicle that the EU is working on, that will take time to get going and in  the instance, that will essentially be a netting mechanism allowing  companies with debts and obligations to Iran to swap liabilities with each  other.  </p><p> But eventually the SPV is designed or intended to get a banking license and  process transactions themselves.  </p><p> QUEST:  But it is allowing an extra territorial aspect to US legislation.   I mean, even the right to - or as one reads - exemptions for this country  to trade for oil in this country, I mean, the argument is there because who  is the US to tell Japan that it can't buy oil from Iran?  </p><p> LAMON:  Well, I totally agree with you.  I think the American policy is  unreasonable.  I think the United States has an obsessions with Iran that  is not justified by the facts.  I think they're obsessed with still with  the hostage crisis.  They are influenced by Saudi Arabia, and we know when  it comes to which the worst regime, Iran or Saudi Arabia, Western policy is  not even handed.  It's do with selling armaments to Saudi Arabia, it's to  do a bit with Israel, but I don't think we've got a balance policy from  America towards Iran and Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> [15:25:00]  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you think that policy has become even more unbalanced?  I mean,  there's always a degree of an imbalance.  I mean, there is always a degree  of an imbalance on hypocrisy when putting foreign policy to work with some  of these countries.  But it seems to have become more egregious is what you  seem to be saying.  </p><p> LAMONT:  Well, I think what's happened here - I mean, frankly, Mr. Trump is  not telling the facts when he says Iran is breaking the agreement.  Iran is  fully compliant with the agreement and expert opinion from the  International Atomic Energy Agency says so.  I think the main reason in  Trump's mind, for having these sanctions, is because the nuclear deal was  done by Obama.  It was done by Obama, and therefore, he is against it.  </p><p> QUEST:  Let's turn very briefly if we may to the issue of Saudi Arabia  because you're obviously extremely involved in business.  But in terms of  government, you will have been party to Cabinets with negotiations with the  Saudis were involved for armaments.  Do you think it is time to get back to  business or something approaching business is normal, or do you think that  the West should hold armament sales up against the Crown Prince and the  Saudi government?  </p><p> LAMONT:  Well, the West including Britain is so deeply involved in armament  sales to Saudi Arabia.  I don't see that being reversed, but I think we  ought to aim for more diversified policy in arm sales, and I think above  all, we need more balanced approach.  </p><p> I mean, we've seen how the Saudis have been very economical with the truth  when it came to Mr. Khashoggi.  Are we going to trust them with everything  to do with the Yemen War that we're told by them.  </p><p> I think we ought to be a little bit more even handed.  I am not saying that  Iran is a desirable regime.  But I think we ought to be more balanced.  </p><p> QUEST:  But is it time to - is it time to start doing more business back  with Saudi Arabia?  Back to normal is what I am suggesting after the  Khashoggi ...  </p><p> LAMONT:  I think the West world to insist on getting a proper explanation  of what has happened and being sure that the people who are held  responsible for that are the people who really were responsible.  </p><p> QUEST:  Very good to have you, sir.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p> LAMONT:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  We didn't even get on to the midterms, that's next time.  The US  House of Representatives will stay red or it will turn blue, and that will  cause the US markets to turn red or indeed green - it depends on the  election, one way or another.  It is a good day.  We're off the highs of  the day by some - but that is up 170 on the Dow.  </p><p> [15:30:00]  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [15:30:00]  RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello, I'm Richard  Quest, there's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment.  When you will  hear from Sir Tim Berners-Lee; the father of the world wide web who wants  to make the internet a better place.</p><p>Amazon is warning potential hosts for its second headquarters.  Don't spoil  a surprise, as you and I continue tonight, this is Cnn, and on this  network, the facts always come first.  President Trump says there is great  electricity in the air on the eve of the high stakes midterm elections. </p><p> He's headlining three rallies -- key rallies in the states today, stumping  for Republican candidates.  Democrats hope a blue wave will help them  regain control of at least one house of Congress. </p><p>Indonesian diving teams have now identified 27 bodies from the Lion Air  flight that crashed last week killing 189 in all.  Officials are working  with Boeing to warn all carries but the risk of air speed indicator  malfunctions on the 727 MAX 8.  The Lion Air jet was found to have that  malfunction during its last four flights. </p><p> The sons of the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi are issuing an  emotional appeal for the return of their father's remains so he may be  buried.  The spoke exclusively to Cnn in their first public remarks since  their father's murder last month.  Khashoggi's eldest son says he has faith  in the Saudi-run investigation into his father's killing. </p><p>SoftBank says it will not sever financial ties to Saudi Arabia after the  killing of the journalist.  Chief Executive Masayoshi Son expressed strong  regret over Khashoggi's death, and says he won't take any new Saudi money  until the truth is known. </p><p> The U.S. political system, Tuesday is a big day.  For investors, it's a  week of big events.  Political shifts in the U.S. know they will certainly  hit the market.  The dollar, FANG stocks and emerging markets all likely to  face disruption as a result of events.  Now, the Fed will reveal its  interest rates decision on Thursday. </p><p> Policymakers have been facing pressure to soften their hawkish views, and  all week corporate earnings galore.  Some market watchers are concerned  profits have peaked.  Ben Phillips is watching it all, the Chief Investment  Officer at EventShares.  Of the events you are watching at the moment, Ben,  what are you most concerned? What are you watching particularly carefully?  </p><p> BEN PHILLIPS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, EVENTSHARES:  Well, so I think  everyone is focused on midterms this week, but we're worried about what's  going on after midterms.  So regardless of the outcome of midterms, we're  looking at Trump's policy towards global trade.</p><p> We think how he responds to China after midterms after some of this  campaigning we've seen really over the past few weeks, that's our biggest  concern is that global trade breaks down and supply chains are disrupted  because of trade policy.  </p><p> QUEST:  But I see where you're coming from, but haven't you neatly jumped  the hurdle of the midterms? Because the result tomorrow will factor in, you  know, becomes a sine qua non of all those other events.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Well, look, I mean, we're positioning our portfolio adventure as  the PLCY portfolio in things that really are going to continue regardless  of the outcome.  So financial deregulation, it's out of Congress' hands,  it's now in the agency, the Fed, the OCC, the CFPB. </p><p> You look at education deregulation, that's in the department of ED's hands.   So if we go down the list and see what's actually occurring, it looks like  regardless of the outcome, we're going to have, you know, some policy  catalyst that continue.  So deregulation, healthcare spending driven by  Obamacare, you know, those sorts of things. </p><p> Defense spending, want to stay elevated, our view.  So those are the types  of things we're watching and those are the type of things we're positioning  our portfolio on.  </p><p> QUEST:  In the event of a gridlock with the house going to the Democrats,  does the situation change? Does it get worse for investors or arguably, it  gets a great deal better because if Washington can't do anything, then  investors are free and the market is free to make its own direction.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes, I actually think that's right.  I think we'll see some more  noise potentially, maybe some more hearings and things like that.  I  haven't heard Democrats mention the impeachment word yet again with a split  Congress not even worth really taking that off the ground -- </p><p> [15:35:00]  QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Unless there's some really incriminating new evidence that comes  out.  But so, yes, I think what happens in a split Congress is less and  less is more for the market.  There's a whole congressional effect study  out there that says when Congress isn't doing anything, markets are happy. </p><p> So it's just as soon as we remove this uncertainty of midterms, then we  have certainty of what the outcome is within a week depending on California  races obviously if there's some delay there.  But so we'll get some clarity  here within the next week and see which direction Congress is going. </p><p> QUEST:  Right, quick-fire questions, Ben.  Volatility, more of it in the  midterm or less?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  More in the midterm because of trade.  </p><p> QUEST:  Turning to the question of interest rates.  Another one in  December, and what after that?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  It's going to be, again, the trade can really disrupt the growth  thesis of the U.S.  So I think if the Fed sees slower growth because of the  trade, they might delay their actions and hiking rates further, '19.   </p><p> QUEST:  Diversification and rotation, we've seen it out of tech into  defensive, does that continue, is it overdone? When does the tech come  back?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  I think it continues.  Tech really has had all this momentum  factor built up into it.  Now you're seeing people rotate more  structurally, longer term out of that momentum factor.  So what we're  seeing is more and more investors doing that, it's really just started. </p><p> So if people say, we're at the top of the cycle here, it's going to start - - this rotation continues in our view.  So I would be wary of tech and the  regulation of tech in big data regulation.    </p><p> QUEST:  Finally, tech and tech.  Does tech like Amazon which buys and sells  things on Netflix which delivers movies and has subscription basis, and  then there's tech like Facebook, obviously Twitter and Snap, we can sort of  leave somewhere in the doldrums down at the bottom.  But is there a  difference, as you say, the rotation out of tech?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  There is, but you know, we think the whole ecosystem is  affected.  But where we're most cautious is around those social media  names, the ones who have been data aggregators in our view, collecting  everyone's consumer data and then using it and selling it.  They're the  ones at biggest risk.  But China trade, we think hardware and the semi- conductors and really that whole supply chain is so integrated with China  that they're at risk too.</p><p> So we're broadly avoiding tech other than our 5G telecom exposure in PLCY. </p><p> QUEST:  Ben, do me a favor, make me a promise, you'll come back and help us  understand more in the future.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Absolutely, happy any time, thanks Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Excellent, new member of the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS family.  Help  give us the sort of information that we can all use and understand and put  into the wider context.  As we continue tonight from London, he created the  web in 1989 and now he's trying to keep it on track.  We'll hear from the  computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, and I'm talking tech and question of  the day.</p><p> I got off the word tech, it's technology.  Get your phones ready for a  question on technology -- where's my phone, it's here somewhere after the  break.  And get ready to head to cnn.com-slash-join.       </p><p> [15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  All right, I assume you have one of these devices, if not, where  have you been? Time for you to take your device and go to cnn.com-slash- join as we -- and join our question of the day.  Sir Tim Berners-Lee; now  he is the father of the internet, says he trusts the world's biggest tech  companies to take care of your data. </p><p> As the man who created the www, he told \"Reuters\" earlier in the week that  some big tech companies could one day have to be broken up.  You'll hear  Sir Tim in just a moment.  And whiles you think about all of that, is it  time for the big tech companies to be broken up? </p><p> Are they now the monopolies of yester-year but tomorrow? And I assume by  that, we'll let you define big tech, whether we're talking about an Amazon  or whichever sort of Facebook, I'm not sure how you break that one up.  Go  to cnn.com-slash-join now.  Voting is open and you'll see the results  update live on the screen. </p><p> I suppose Google is a good example, Alphabet would be another one.  Amazon  shares while you're voting, Amazon shares are taking a beating today  absolutely, down 2.5 percent or $41, there is the price.  It's not off the  lows of the week, but it is certainly down. </p><p> Investors are being scared off by threats from Donald Trump who is claiming  Amazon and other tech giants may have violated anti-trust laws.  And the  president says his administration is looking into the claims, but isn't  taking  action just yet.  Now, if that were alone, that would be bad enough  to push down the price, but it is not. </p><p> It's not the only thing weighing on the Amazon share price.  Remember,  cnn.com-slash-join.  Now, some customers are also looking to boycott.  The  customers in Saudi Arabia are boycotting the company, taking aim at the  Jeff Bezos and CEO who also owns the \"Washington Post\". </p><p> It's all over the outrage over how the post has covered the killing of one  of its journalists Jamal Khashoggi.  The thing has been pointed firmly at  the Saudi leadership.  So boycott Amazon is trending on Saudi social media.   Meanwhile, the company announced a new incentive to draw in new prime  members on the holiday season. </p><p> It's a free-shipping offer.  Now, if you're a prime member, you already get  free shipping.  It's reserved for paid subscribers.  Now all U.S. customers  will get it with no minimum purchase -- oh, and one other thing you do get,  though, they'll increase the number of things they get free same day  delivery. </p><p> So two developments -- if that wasn't enough, an article in the Bezos home  post is writing new clues about which city Amazon is going to or may choose  to HQ2.  Crystal City, Virginia, has become a frontrunner.  The \"Post\" is  claiming citing people close to the process.  By the way, Amazon said those  who know don't speak and those who speak don't know, and they've also  advised any city who is in the running to best keep stump in case this  suddenly find the knot.</p><p> A lot of Amazon news one way or the other.  Clare Sebastian puts it all  together for us.  Clare, taking all of these developments and the fact that  the share price is down some 2.5 percent today.  What is the driving factor  against that share price?  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, I think it's a combination of  factors, but I think the main one is these regulation comments by Donald  Trump.  Clearly, whether or not he intends to act imminently, he is still  obsessed with this company.  We've seen him through the past few months  talking about, you know, the exploitation of the postal service, the Bezos- Amazon \"Washington Post\" as he's called it, and he's had this company in  his sights. </p><p> And this is really the one thing that investors feel could interrupt the  growth of this company is some kind of regulation to break it up.  So I  think that is what is driving this share.  But don't forget, it comes after  a brutal month.  Amazon has lost about 20 percent of its values since its  peak in September.  </p><p> So there's jitters with that already.  This is just playing into it.</p><p> QUEST:  If the view and there was something of a view that Amazon was  overpriced, that may have been settled by a 20 cent correction.  But you  know, at the end of the day, Clare, I don't hear anybody suggesting that  Amazon is going to start losing customers or that in some way its business  from Amazon cloud services, Amazon web services through to the toilet paper  it will deliver to me in New York.</p><p> [15:45:00]  That it's in any way waning, it's getting bigger.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely, this is where we are in retail, the bigger -- are  getting bigger.  And in particular, Amazon, it's interesting to look at the  free shipping offer that they put out today and the context of that,  Richard, because that is one of the reasons why they can do that is because  they have the higher margin part of the business which is AWS, Amazon's web  services, the cloud and also the burgeoning advertising business because of  all the data they've got from their core retail business. </p><p> They can use those to funnel money into the lower margin -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Retail business, and that is why they can pay for these things  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Clare -- </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Like free shipping.  </p><p> QUEST:  Clare, forgive me for interrupting.  I just want to ask you very  quickly and briefly, are you surprised the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS viewer,  wise and wary of world, although they are, 71 percent says big tech  companies should be broken up, only 29 percent say no.  I'm surprised on  that, are you?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  I would say a little surprised, you know, these companies are  you know, ubiquitous to society.  I think the same people who voted the 70  percent who want to break them up are probably also Amazon users and are  relishing -- </p><p> QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  The lower prices and the free shipping that they're offering.   But I think the drumbeat around these companies, Richard, be it Amazon, be  it Facebook, be it Google has got a lot of people worried and they're  starting to take a second look here.  </p><p> QUEST:  Clare Sebastian, thank you.  The founder of the world wide web Tim  Berners-Lee is calling on governments, companies and individuals to back up  contracts for the web.  That contract he says would help protect people's  rights and freedoms on the internet.  Cnn's Laurie Segall asked him if we  can really trust tech companies to build that product in a safe and  trustworthy manner.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TIM BERNERS-LEE, FOUNDER, WORLD WIDE WEB:  I think because of things like  the data transfer project in which these four companies said you have the  right --you would be able to physically get your data from one of one  others and put it into the other or get -- then I think that for me is  saying, yes, actually they get it as a point and they're prepared to put  the work in.</p><p> So yes, I think that they will.  Yes, I think will have enough people who  are building in home devices that talk to me about their excitement.  We  have to solid put it, we should ask people to have their own data pods.   They've said OK, what would be good would be -- we can -- why don't we  actually put all these data in your data pods?</p><p> I think and there's a lot of excitement around that about -- and realizing  -- people realizing that if they give you data -- control over on your data  that they're generating value for you.  And a lot of companies are finding  it so exciting to be able to switch from trying to exploit you, trying to  make you buy something that you didn't want to buy to actually switch back  to the core business model of helping the user, generating data for the  user.</p><p> LAURIE SEGALL, CNN:  Can they do that and still make a profit? I mean,  could they do that and not sacrifice their billion-dollar business models?  </p><p> BERNERS-LEE:  You know, all these plugs you can find about how much if you  join the big social network and you give them all your data and you get  stuff  for free.  How much actually is the value date to all those  insurance companies themselves.  It turns out for example, one blog I  thought -- well, the value to them or if your data is less than you pay for  internet connectivity, anyway. </p><p> So actually if you subscribed to your social network and your feeds and  your data, you could actually replace that funding stream by turning around  and paying for yourself.  And it wouldn't be much, so it's actually -- it  says maybe it's a myth.  </p><p> SEGALL:  I'm going to give you two ideas of privacy, and you tell me which  one you think is right.  So one idea is that we just have to re-envision  privacy.  Privacy to an extent is dead.  Another one is that privacy is a  fundamental human right and we have the right to it.  So where do you stand  when it comes to the future, this current moment and looking at what it  means for us as users in our privacy?  </p><p> BERNERS-LEE:  You don't have to look for other guests, we aren't going to  be.  I am going to be with the far to see(ph) of human right.  I'd be say,  privacy of human rights as all placed in the United Nations have said  privacy is a -- those human rights and as you said, that is the right. </p><p> Web is a human right -- you know, so for me, it's very important that I  have control of my data.  That doesn't mean I'm going to afford it, that  doesn't mean that I won't share it with a company which will help me buy  the best presents for my family.  It means that I'll -- it also -- it means  that I'll be able to share it with my -- the people that I work with, that  will -- and so will be able to work more efficiently, I'll have a lot of  total control over who I share what with. </p><p> So the idea of control or own your own data is not just about sort of me  being my own silo, walking everything away, essentially having the joy of  being able to share it with whoever.  Like the joy, if you could know or  you take a selfie with somebody, you pass in the streets and they give you  a business card, just you know, they immediately share whatever it is with  them immediately just because they're a person, just because they have an  ID.</p><p> [15:50:00]  That whereas, in fact, you would have to go home and find out  which social networks they belong to.  So it's partly because -- you know,  control over data -- over your own data as a human right -- that's mine. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Bad news for Google and Facebook by a margin of 2-1.  Most of you  say big tech companies should be broken up.  Now, well, it's come off its - - the highs of 60s or whatever is -- that could mean separating Facebook  from Whatsapp and Instagram while splitting Google Search from its other  bets. </p><p> I'd say I'm surprised, I wouldn't have thought together would have -- would  go all the way very -- that's where we have it.  There is nothing high tech  about the Indonesian xylophone that I got to try out earlier today.  The  rest of the World Travel Market is getting a lot more digital.  We'll hear  from the tourism minister next on how a professional plays that.   </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  WTM London, 5th to the 7th November, one of the world's biggest  expos for one of the world's largest industries.  You need a stout pair of  shoes and a strong constitution if you're attending the World Travel Market  which began today at ExCeL in London. </p><p> Now, while some offerings are analog, like these Indonesian xylophone -- I  don't think it's properly called the xylophone, but you get the idea sort  of how difficult it is.  How to run somebody else's song.  Most of this  year's focus is on digital tourism, that's everything from targeted ads to  digital destinations including a holiday.</p><p> Everything -- look at the pictures.  Everything is geared not just in  taking the picture, but to putting it on mobile and sharing it with  someone.  If it doesn't look good on Instagram, it's not worth doing.   Indonesia's Tourism Minister told me digital tourism can help him get  millions more visitors.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ARIEF YAHYA, TOURISM MINISTER, INDONESIA:  We are doing all the promotion  using this digital media.  For example, we are using the Google, et cetera  for looking, booking, dot com, et cetera.  Even in China, we are using  Ctrip, et cetera.  </p><p> Seventy percent of our target allocated for digital media.</p><p> [15:55:00]  QUEST:  Do you -- I see also, you know, the use of the digital,  I see the word innovation.  But everybody in this building -- </p><p> YAHYA:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  Is saying the same thing.  </p><p> YAHYA:  Yes.   </p><p> QUEST:  So how are you going to do it better than them?  </p><p> YAHHA:  OK, there are two things actually.  First is, we have digital  destination, it only show you can see it.  We have at least five days here,  we are going to develop 100 digital destinations, and the second, how we  promote it.  We are going to promote our destination using digital media as  I said before. </p><p> QUEST:  Instagram and things like that?  </p><p> YAHYA:  Everything.  Digital -- I mean, this has to be inside a mobile, it  has to be nice in camera.  You see, that's the first criteria for digital  tourism.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Now, I'll have a lot more from the World Travel Market on Friday's  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS where Tourism Ministers from almost every continent.   And we'll take you on a whistle stop tour of the world's tourism as they  make their pitch.  We will have our profitable moment after the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, the midterm elections take place  tomorrow in the United States, and we can pass the results anywhere as  you'll try and understand who will vote, you know, white women from middle  class in northern states or young urban professionals in the Midwest, you  can get it so detailed as you're trying to understand what the voting  trends are and it eventually makes no sense. </p><p> But we will know tomorrow exactly who voted and how, and then we'll have  the problem of how the markets react.  If there is an element of gridlock,  further gridlock than we've already got, a greater divide in America if  that were possible, what does that mean for the markets? </p><p> There is that popular view that says when Washington is gridlocked, the  markets do well.  We'll find out in the next 24 hours because as the voting  and the results come in, we will be here to make sense of it all for you.  </p><p> And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. </p><p> (BELL RINGING) </p><p> The bell -- Avianca, an airline -- the bell is ringing, the Dow is up, the  day is done.    </p><p> END      </p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Goes up throughout the course of the  day, slightly off the best of the day so far, and there is one hour still  to trade on Wall Street.  I'm Richard Quest.  These are the top business -  these are the headlines on CNN.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran is the first as the new sanctions come into play.  The Trump  administration's renewed sanctions on Iran's energy.  US elections and the  questions of the midterm, almost upon us, which will go in different  directions?  And Amazon, is the Trump administration about to try an anti- trust deal or anti-trust attack on Amazon?  Tonight, live from London, this  is \"Quest Means Business.\"  I'm Richard Quest.  Now, let's go.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  It's the final frantic, dramatic push for votes.  Across the  United States, candidates and their supporters are making their closing  arguments.  President Trump is campaigning right now in Cleveland.  It's  been a bitter campaign season and the most expensive midterm election in US  history and this is why.  The entire House is up for grabs, along with 35  Senate seats and 36 state governorships.  </p><p>The decisions voters make will affect everything from the Supreme Court to  regulation.  President Trump's agenda even how and where the electoral  battle lines are drawn.  Bill Clinton's strategist famously said, \"It's the  economy, stupid.\"  But when it comes to economic developments, there's  plenty to campaign on.  </p><p>So first of all, you've got surging growth, raging trade wars and growing  deficits.  To voters, the importance of the economy hasn't changed much  since the last midterm elections four years ago.  Forty four percent of  registered voters polled nationally say the economy is extremely important  to their vote.  That's down 12 percentage points in the height of the  crisis in 2009-2010.  Even President Trump doesn't seem too eager to talk  about the economy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They all say, speak about  the economy, speak about the economy.  Well, we have the greatest economy  in the history of our country, but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk  about the economy, right?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Since John King is tracking the races and the issues as seen from  Washington.  If there's one man who is absolutely under the hood of the  suffology in this midterm elections, John, it is you.  So get out the  crystal ball and have a fiddle around try to mix the metaphors beautifully,  what are you seeing in the last 24 hours before?  </p><p>JOHN KING, CHIEF US CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  In the last 24 hours, we're seeing  some evidence of a break toward the Democrats.  This is very complicated  because for the House of Representatives, the terrain does favor the  Democrats.  They need to pick up 23 seats in the United States House of  Representatives.  They have a clear path, Richard, to at least 25, some  Democrats think even 35.  </p><p>So the Democrats actually have no excuses if they don't take back the House  and the late polling numbers suggest things are breaking their way.  The  Senate is much more complicated by the Senate races on the ballot this  year, many of them were in states President Trump carried big.  Many of  them compare - let me put it this way, a lot of these competitive House  districts, they're close to the suburbs, they're in suburban areas.  That's  where the President is incredibly weak.  </p><p>The Senate races, bigger states with smaller towns and more rural areas.   That's where the President is strong.  Democrats look to make gains in the  House.  They look to make a lot of gains at the state level, races for  governor and state legislature.  The Senate, the day before the election,  more of a toss-up where the Republicans are favored to hold their majority,  maybe even add a seat or two, but there is some late hope for the  Democrats.  They do see some evidence of a possible late break that might  let them not only hold their Senate seats, but maybe surprise us.  We'll  count them tomorrow.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is it - for everybody I've been talking to, is it possible or  likely that the last election repeats itself?  And that President Trump,  well of course, it's possible, but is it probable I should really say or at  what level of possibility that he actually does much better than expected  and out of nowhere the red wave or little trickle does become much  stronger?  </p><p>KING:  I rule out nothing.  Based on our 2016 experience and based on our  recent American political experience, not just the Trump win in 2016.   Eight years before that, America elected its first African-American  President.  </p><p>[15:05:04]  </p><p>KING:  A lot of people thought that couldn't happen.  So, there's no doubt  volatility and unpredictability in the climate.  I will tell you this  though, Richard, as for a total Republican surprise, meaning the  Republicans hold the House, even the President himself doesn't seem to  believe that.  </p><p>Over the weekend, he conceded the Republicans are likely to lose the House.   Just today, he said with zero evidence, this is a farce and a fraud, but  the President said he sees all this evidence already of illegal immigrants  illegally voting in the US midterm election.  Remember, that's the same  excuse he used for why he said Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016  even though he won the Electoral College.  </p><p>So the Republicans will suffer some pain tomorrow, all Republicans agree on  that.  Though you raise a great question about how big, how much do we  trust the polling?  Which wasn't perfect in 2016 because the climate is so  different when you look at the House and then the Senate.  </p><p>And to your point about the economy, if this President - if this is a  referendum on Trump at the midterm about his achievements, wow, right?   Maybe you don't like the tax cuts, maybe you don't know how the US pays for  them in the long run, but the economy is gangbusters, but is it more a  referendum on the Trump tone, about tweets not tax cuts.  If it's about  tweets and tone, the President is going to have a shellacking tomorrow.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, so define for me as best one can what would be seen as a  disaster for or a verdict of total disaster for the President?  And  similarly, one would be saying, actually, he did really well.  How will we  judge tomorrow's results?  </p><p>KING:  If by any way Republicans hold the House and the Senate, that's a  huge victory for the President.  No way to sugar coat that for the  Democrats.  If the Republicans can somehow hold the House, that means limit  the Democrats to picking up 22 or fewer seats, you would have a very narrow  Republican majority, but if you still have a Republican majority come  January, this is a victory for the President and his party, if they can  hold the House and the Senate.  </p><p>Again, the President is going to try to spin this.  If he loses the House  and wins the Senate, he's going to say his campaigning in the Senate states  in the last days is what saved the Senate.  He'll take credit for that.  </p><p>I'll give you a longer range perspective though, Richard.  We focus a lot  on Washington, who controls the House?  Who controls the Senate?  These  races for governor, down ballot races for state legislature are critical  across America.  That is where Democrats were punished in the Obama years.  </p><p>First they lost the House in 2010, then they lost the Senate in 2014.   Republicans now have 33 governors, 1,000 state legislative seats in the  Obama years switched from Democrat to Republican.  Do Democrats tomorrow  start the rebuilding effort?  If that's the case, then we'll talk a lot  about the next two years of the Trump presidency, but the Democrats need to  plant the seeds of a revival because they frankly, they've had a terrible  decade.  </p><p>QUEST:  John, we'll let you go in just a second, but after - talk me  through tomorrow night and obviously once you get on air.  What should I be  looking for and when?  </p><p>KING:  It's a great question, and we will get, just as we did in 2016, some  very early clues.  We may not know control of the House until we get to the  West Coast which takes us into the early morning hours.  We may not know  control of the Senate then if the Democrats are surprising us, we could  come down to Nevada and Arizona in the Western time zones, but polls close  early in Kentucky and Ohio.  There is a very competitive House district  just outside of Louisville, Kentucky, the sixth congressional district.   There is a Republican incumbent, Andy Barr in a Republican district that in  a normal year, he should win.  </p><p>He is running against a retired Democratic fighter pilot, military  experience, shot all her ads with a fighter jet just over her shoulder.  If  Amy McGrath is winning in Kentucky's 6th, that tells you the Democrats not  only have a path to get to the House majority, maybe bigger than that.  </p><p>So look at Kentucky first, then you come along the East Coast, there are  some seats in New England, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  We will  know two scenarios.  Are the Democrats doing what they need to do to take  back the House or a Republican successfully blocking them and then when we  start to count the votes in the Florida Senate race, then we'll have a  sense.  Is there any prayer?  Any prayer to what would be the biggest shock  the Democrats taking the Senate, we'll start counting the votes.  It's  going to be a long night.  Espresso tomorrow, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  You know, I have no idea how you keep all those facts in your head  at once.  John, we'll be with you tomorrow night.  Thank you so much, sir.   We appreciate it.  Thank you.  </p><p>KING:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  John has put it into the big picture of the politics.  We need to  put it, as we always do, into what's happening in the markets.  The day  before the midterms and Wall Street has a stake in the election as  investors are waiting, the Dow is nearly at session highs.  It's bouncing  around.  It would not surprise me, bearing in mind that when it's 55  minutes of trading left, we could see just that hold - unlikely, unlikely  that you're just going to see it evaporate in the next 50 minutes.  But, so  I wouldn't put too much on that.  Holding roughly where I would like to is  what seems most reasonable at this point.  </p><p>The Dow is near the sessions high as the tech shares are down, and if you  look at Apple and Amazon - now, Apple and Amazon are big losers at the  moment.  They are on the back of economic news.  </p><p>[15:10:06]  </p><p>QUEST:  President Trump has unleashed what he calls the strongest ever  sanctions on Iran.  A move to re-impose all penalties lifted under the 2015  nuclear deal.  The target in an investment company with links to Iran's  supreme leader.  Some 70 financial institutions, if you look at here, there  are seven investment firms, financial institutions, maritime carriers, oil  transport -- these are the main targets, if you like, of the attack on the  sanctions.  </p><p>The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is warning the companies to  continue to trade with Iran will pay a heavy price.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, US SECRETARY OF STATE:  It should be noted that if a country  evades our sanctions regime and secretly continues sanctionable commerce in  the Islamic Republic, the United States will levy severe swift penalties on  it, including potential sanctions.  I promise you that doing business with  Iran and defying some of our sanctions will ultimately be a much more  painful business decision than pulling out of Iran.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran, joins me now.  So the full weight of  sanctions back on, at least from the US and as you're aware, other nations  and companies being forced along.  When would we expect to see the first  effect in Tehran?  </p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, I think  some of the effects have already been felt over the past couple of months,  Richard.  You already had a first round of sanctions where large companies  have already pulled out.  But this is arguably the much bigger sanctions  weight that could fall on Iran very quickly.  </p><p>So far, what we're seeing is that you do see a lot of politicians here who  are still very defiant in the face of that.  Regular folks who are already  feeling the pinch of it really fear that things could go very, very badly.   It could happen in the not too distant future when a lot of countries stop  eyeing Iranian oil.  A lot have already stopped doing that.  </p><p>The interesting thing from Tehran's perspective is they sort of feel, just  a little bit, Richard, that Washington might have blinked just slightly  giving some of those sanctions waivers where some of the biggest importers  of Iranian oil can actually still do that.  Like for instance, China; like  for instance, Japan and India as well.  </p><p>So the Iranians sort of feeling they might still have a bit of a lifeline  with those countries being able to buy that oil, but certainly, if that's  something that stops, they think they're going to take a very, very big hit  here and all of the talk of defiance, we speak to regular folks, they are  saying, they are already feeling the pinch and they do think that it could  get a lot worse, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is there any evidence that a return - excuse me - is there any  evidence that a return to false sanctions would strengthen any seedling  opposition within Iran against the government?  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  So far it's a very, very important question.  So far I don't  think that there's any evidence of that whatsoever.  One of the things that  you saw earlier this year is that there were some protests here in Iran  against the economic situation.  We have to keep in mind that it's not only  the sanctions that are strangling Iran's economy.  There is a lot of  economic mismanagement, there is a lot of corruption, there is price hikes  as well.  There is a lot of things that people are unhappy with.  </p><p>If you look at the situation now that these new sanctions have been put  into place that really isn't the case anymore.  So the President, Hassan  Rouhani, he was under a lot of fire a couple of months ago for putting the  nuclear agreement into play.  He was taking a lot of heat from the  hardliners, that's no longer the case either.  </p><p>It seems that a lot of that anger is now being channeled towards President  Trump, towards the US administration, and many people here feel that what's  going on right now in the Islamic public is being induced from the outside,  it is being induced from Washington, DC, so it doesn't seem as though, if  it is, the intention of the Trump administration to weaken the government,  to weaken the clergy and the military here, so far, it doesn't appear as  though, at least from our perspective that that is currently the case  right, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Fred Pleitgen who is in Tehran, thank you.  Now Swift, which is the  international payment system, is not taking any chances and is cutting its  services from some Iranian banks.  Swift is the international standard for  verifying money transfers, which is a posh way of saying it provides a  secure network between more than 10,000 financial institutions around the  world.  If I want to send you money internationally, or more likely,  hopefully, you're sending me money, and then probably, it will go via Swift  and our institutions will have a Swift code that will go backwards and  forwards.  </p><p>Now, this is long before the days of blockchain technology.  Some Iranian  banks are now unable to talk to Swift after the firm blocked them from its  messaging system.  Swift says the decision is regrettable.  John Defterios  is in Abu Dhabi to put this in perspective.  John, the Swift found itself  in an impossible position.  </p><p>On the one hand, the US is saying, you know, \"You do business with Iran and  we will penalize you.\"  On the other hand, the Europeans and others say,  \"If you give in to external pressure on sanctions, we will penalize you.\"  </p><p>[15:15:10]  </p><p>QUEST:  So now what?  </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR, CNN:  Well, Richard, it was not an  easy call for Swift because it's based in Belgium right at the heart of the  European Union, but it's an international player and it will target up to  50 banks going forward here that are on the target list from the United  States.  </p><p>They said it was regrettable as you suggested, but necessary for stability,  so that's the argument they are using, but I think, we should remind our  viewers, Richard, this was supposed to be the round of sanctions that  targeted oil, not financial institutions.  The first round was strong  against Iran, but the second round really targets the financial  institutions here.  </p><p>We have 900 entities, financial banks, insurance companies, the shipping  companies and also the airlines.  Now, we know Russia, China, Turkey, the  European Union were against the US sanctions, so that how do they work  around the US Federal Reserve and US Treasury is a key question.  </p><p>President Rouhani of Iran said he looks forward to breaking the sanctions.   That's very bold as Fred was suggesting here, but it will be hard times for  the Iranians going forward.  I was looking at a World Bank report, a month  ago, before we saw the full weight of these financial sanctions, and they  were projecting a decline of 4% - a recession of 4% in 2019, inflation of  30%, Richard, and again, this is where it is today.  It could come under  further pressure of the Swift banking sanctions that you were talking  about.  </p><p>QUEST:  If you look at oil, the movements we've seen in oil in the past few  days, there has been quite a sizeable drop in that price on the back of  what?  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, you know, this is very fascinating to me, because  remember, Donald Trump was saying in the summer, we're going to take Iran  down to zero when it comes to exports and this is where the midterm reality  settled in.  This is a chart looking back just a month, Richard, and when  North Sea Brent hit $86.00 a barrel, Donald Trump hit Twitter and was  calling out for more crude.  </p><p>Saudi Arabia responded.  The UAE where I am sitting responded, Kuwait even  Russia.  We saw that price go from $86.00 a barrel down to $73.00.  </p><p>But that's not the only factor, Richard.  Iran's production has been  dropping, but it's not collapsing just yet.  Let's take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>IMAN NASSERI, MIDDLE EAST MANAGING DIRECTOR, FGE:  We drew an expected   part of Iran's exports falling to less than a million barrels per day by  first quarter next year and around 700,000 to 800,000 a day by middle of  next year.  So far, it has come along that path.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  So Richard, we're at 1.5 million barrels a day.  Now, the Facts  Global Energy is suggesting we get to 700,000 to 800,000 barrels.  Let's  bring up, Richard, the eight exemptions that were made here.  I was  surprised over the fact, the Italian and the Greeks got the exemptions as  members of the European Union, which have been fighting against Donald  Trump.  China, Turkey and India never were going to go along.  So it's  almost like legalizing, Richard the ability for them to continue to import  Iranian crude and as Fred said, the big Asian importers are in there as  well.  </p><p>This by the way, Richard is proof to the fact, you can't replace Iranian  crude that easily.  They were exporting 2.8 million barrels a day back in  June.  Donald Trump admitted he didn't want to see the price go higher  right now.  </p><p>QUEST:  John Defterios, thank you.  Now, Britain and the European Union are  rallying against America's hash new sanctions on Tehran.  I'll discuss with  the former British Finance Minister, Lord Norman Lamont after the break.  </p><p>And Amazon's headlines are coming thick and fast today.  Accusations of  anti-trust violations in the White House, a Saudi boycott and new clues  around 8Q2.  </p><p>[15:15:0]  </p><p>QUEST:  The European Union is staunchly opposed to the US sanctions on  Iran, saying it will try to protect European companies doing legitimate  business with Tehran.  Joining me now to discuss this is Lord Lamont,  Chairman of the British Iranian Chamber of Commerce, and of course Prime  Minister's trade envoy to Iran, and Lord Lamont, the situation now is just  about you're damned if your company is doing business - you're damned if  you do and you're damned if you don't.  It's who you want to be sanctioned  by or fall out of favor with the Europeans or the Americans.  </p><p>LORD NORMAN LAMONT, CHAIRMAN, BRITISH IRANIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  Well,  that's got a fair amount of force behind it.  There are companies that  trade both with Iran and the US.  They will have to choose.  Many will  choose to trade with America - that is inevitable, but there are other  companies that trade only with Iran or for whom Iran is the more important  market.  </p><p>And the object of European policy is to protect them from the secondary  sanctions, the banking sanctions, that even when the nuclear deal was in  force, were inhibiting European companies from trading with Iran, because  they feared that the banks, their bank, which might deal with an American  bank, wouldn't finance their trade with Iran.  So this is trying to protect  the European banking system from American banking, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  But the moment a dollar becomes involved ...  </p><p>LAMONT:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  The moment and never mind anything as complicated or as exotic as  dollar clearing, then you're into a different ball game, aren't you?   Because then the Treasury and the whole weight of this could be against  you.  </p><p>LAMONT:  You know, that's right.  Do business with America, have dealings  in dollars, employ American personnel, have any American content in your  product.  You have got to be very, very careful, obviously.  </p><p>QUEST:  Are you disappointed at the way in which Europe and the UK and  other countries, that they've not stood up to the US in this sense.   They've said, \"Okay, you go off with your sanctions, you withdraw from the  agreement,\" but they don't seem to protect it.  </p><p>LAMONT:  Well, it's not an easy problem to solve because of the combined  effect of trade, the effect of globalization, but the special purpose  vehicle that the EU is working on, that will take time to get going and in  the instance, that will essentially be a netting mechanism allowing  companies with debts and obligations to Iran to swap liabilities with each  other.  </p><p>But eventually the SPV is designed or intended to get a banking license and  process transactions themselves.  </p><p>QUEST:  But it is allowing an extra territorial aspect to US legislation.   I mean, even the right to - or as one reads - exemptions for this country  to trade for oil in this country, I mean, the argument is there because who  is the US to tell Japan that it can't buy oil from Iran?  </p><p>LAMON:  Well, I totally agree with you.  I think the American policy is  unreasonable.  I think the United States has an obsessions with Iran that  is not justified by the facts.  I think they're obsessed with still with  the hostage crisis.  They are influenced by Saudi Arabia, and we know when  it comes to which the worst regime, Iran or Saudi Arabia, Western policy is  not even handed.  It's do with selling armaments to Saudi Arabia, it's to  do a bit with Israel, but I don't think we've got a balance policy from  America towards Iran and Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>[15:25:00]  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you think that policy has become even more unbalanced?  I mean,  there's always a degree of an imbalance.  I mean, there is always a degree  of an imbalance on hypocrisy when putting foreign policy to work with some  of these countries.  But it seems to have become more egregious is what you  seem to be saying.  </p><p>LAMONT:  Well, I think what's happened here - I mean, frankly, Mr. Trump is  not telling the facts when he says Iran is breaking the agreement.  Iran is  fully compliant with the agreement and expert opinion from the  International Atomic Energy Agency says so.  I think the main reason in  Trump's mind, for having these sanctions, is because the nuclear deal was  done by Obama.  It was done by Obama, and therefore, he is against it.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's turn very briefly if we may to the issue of Saudi Arabia  because you're obviously extremely involved in business.  But in terms of  government, you will have been party to Cabinets with negotiations with the  Saudis were involved for armaments.  Do you think it is time to get back to  business or something approaching business is normal, or do you think that  the West should hold armament sales up against the Crown Prince and the  Saudi government?  </p><p>LAMONT:  Well, the West including Britain is so deeply involved in armament  sales to Saudi Arabia.  I don't see that being reversed, but I think we  ought to aim for more diversified policy in arm sales, and I think above  all, we need more balanced approach.  </p><p>I mean, we've seen how the Saudis have been very economical with the truth  when it came to Mr. Khashoggi.  Are we going to trust them with everything  to do with the Yemen War that we're told by them.  </p><p>I think we ought to be a little bit more even handed.  I am not saying that  Iran is a desirable regime.  But I think we ought to be more balanced.  </p><p>QUEST:  But is it time to - is it time to start doing more business back  with Saudi Arabia?  Back to normal is what I am suggesting after the  Khashoggi ...  </p><p>LAMONT:  I think the West world to insist on getting a proper explanation  of what has happened and being sure that the people who are held  responsible for that are the people who really were responsible.  </p><p>QUEST:  Very good to have you, sir.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>LAMONT:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  We didn't even get on to the midterms, that's next time.  The US  House of Representatives will stay red or it will turn blue, and that will  cause the US markets to turn red or indeed green - it depends on the  election, one way or another.  It is a good day.  We're off the highs of  the day by some - but that is up 170 on the Dow.  </p><p>[15:30:00]  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00]  RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello, I'm Richard  Quest, there's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment.  When you will  hear from Sir Tim Berners-Lee; the father of the world wide web who wants  to make the internet a better place.</p><p>Amazon is warning potential hosts for its second headquarters.  Don't spoil  a surprise, as you and I continue tonight, this is Cnn, and on this  network, the facts always come first.  President Trump says there is great  electricity in the air on the eve of the high stakes midterm elections. </p><p>He's headlining three rallies -- key rallies in the states today, stumping  for Republican candidates.  Democrats hope a blue wave will help them  regain control of at least one house of Congress. </p><p>Indonesian diving teams have now identified 27 bodies from the Lion Air  flight that crashed last week killing 189 in all.  Officials are working  with Boeing to warn all carries but the risk of air speed indicator  malfunctions on the 727 MAX 8.  The Lion Air jet was found to have that  malfunction during its last four flights. </p><p>The sons of the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi are issuing an  emotional appeal for the return of their father's remains so he may be  buried.  The spoke exclusively to Cnn in their first public remarks since  their father's murder last month.  Khashoggi's eldest son says he has faith  in the Saudi-run investigation into his father's killing. </p><p>SoftBank says it will not sever financial ties to Saudi Arabia after the  killing of the journalist.  Chief Executive Masayoshi Son expressed strong  regret over Khashoggi's death, and says he won't take any new Saudi money  until the truth is known. </p><p>The U.S. political system, Tuesday is a big day.  For investors, it's a  week of big events.  Political shifts in the U.S. know they will certainly  hit the market.  The dollar, FANG stocks and emerging markets all likely to  face disruption as a result of events.  Now, the Fed will reveal its  interest rates decision on Thursday. </p><p>Policymakers have been facing pressure to soften their hawkish views, and  all week corporate earnings galore.  Some market watchers are concerned  profits have peaked.  Ben Phillips is watching it all, the Chief Investment  Officer at EventShares.  Of the events you are watching at the moment, Ben,  what are you most concerned? What are you watching particularly carefully?  </p><p>BEN PHILLIPS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, EVENTSHARES:  Well, so I think  everyone is focused on midterms this week, but we're worried about what's  going on after midterms.  So regardless of the outcome of midterms, we're  looking at Trump's policy towards global trade.</p><p>We think how he responds to China after midterms after some of this  campaigning we've seen really over the past few weeks, that's our biggest  concern is that global trade breaks down and supply chains are disrupted  because of trade policy.  </p><p>QUEST:  But I see where you're coming from, but haven't you neatly jumped  the hurdle of the midterms? Because the result tomorrow will factor in, you  know, becomes a sine qua non of all those other events.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Well, look, I mean, we're positioning our portfolio adventure as  the PLCY portfolio in things that really are going to continue regardless  of the outcome.  So financial deregulation, it's out of Congress' hands,  it's now in the agency, the Fed, the OCC, the CFPB. </p><p>You look at education deregulation, that's in the department of ED's hands.   So if we go down the list and see what's actually occurring, it looks like  regardless of the outcome, we're going to have, you know, some policy  catalyst that continue.  So deregulation, healthcare spending driven by  Obamacare, you know, those sorts of things. </p><p>Defense spending, want to stay elevated, our view.  So those are the types  of things we're watching and those are the type of things we're positioning  our portfolio on.  </p><p>QUEST:  In the event of a gridlock with the house going to the Democrats,  does the situation change? Does it get worse for investors or arguably, it  gets a great deal better because if Washington can't do anything, then  investors are free and the market is free to make its own direction.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes, I actually think that's right.  I think we'll see some more  noise potentially, maybe some more hearings and things like that.  I  haven't heard Democrats mention the impeachment word yet again with a split  Congress not even worth really taking that off the ground -- </p><p>[15:35:00]  QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Unless there's some really incriminating new evidence that comes  out.  But so, yes, I think what happens in a split Congress is less and  less is more for the market.  There's a whole congressional effect study  out there that says when Congress isn't doing anything, markets are happy. </p><p>So it's just as soon as we remove this uncertainty of midterms, then we  have certainty of what the outcome is within a week depending on California  races obviously if there's some delay there.  But so we'll get some clarity  here within the next week and see which direction Congress is going. </p><p>QUEST:  Right, quick-fire questions, Ben.  Volatility, more of it in the  midterm or less?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  More in the midterm because of trade.  </p><p>QUEST:  Turning to the question of interest rates.  Another one in  December, and what after that?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  It's going to be, again, the trade can really disrupt the growth  thesis of the U.S.  So I think if the Fed sees slower growth because of the  trade, they might delay their actions and hiking rates further, '19.   </p><p>QUEST:  Diversification and rotation, we've seen it out of tech into  defensive, does that continue, is it overdone? When does the tech come  back?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I think it continues.  Tech really has had all this momentum  factor built up into it.  Now you're seeing people rotate more  structurally, longer term out of that momentum factor.  So what we're  seeing is more and more investors doing that, it's really just started. </p><p>So if people say, we're at the top of the cycle here, it's going to start - - this rotation continues in our view.  So I would be wary of tech and the  regulation of tech in big data regulation.    </p><p>QUEST:  Finally, tech and tech.  Does tech like Amazon which buys and sells  things on Netflix which delivers movies and has subscription basis, and  then there's tech like Facebook, obviously Twitter and Snap, we can sort of  leave somewhere in the doldrums down at the bottom.  But is there a  difference, as you say, the rotation out of tech?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  There is, but you know, we think the whole ecosystem is  affected.  But where we're most cautious is around those social media  names, the ones who have been data aggregators in our view, collecting  everyone's consumer data and then using it and selling it.  They're the  ones at biggest risk.  But China trade, we think hardware and the semi- conductors and really that whole supply chain is so integrated with China  that they're at risk too.</p><p>So we're broadly avoiding tech other than our 5G telecom exposure in PLCY. </p><p>QUEST:  Ben, do me a favor, make me a promise, you'll come back and help us  understand more in the future.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Absolutely, happy any time, thanks Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Excellent, new member of the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS family.  Help  give us the sort of information that we can all use and understand and put  into the wider context.  As we continue tonight from London, he created the  web in 1989 and now he's trying to keep it on track.  We'll hear from the  computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, and I'm talking tech and question of  the day.</p><p>I got off the word tech, it's technology.  Get your phones ready for a  question on technology -- where's my phone, it's here somewhere after the  break.  And get ready to head to cnn.com-slash-join.       </p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  All right, I assume you have one of these devices, if not, where  have you been? Time for you to take your device and go to cnn.com-slash- join as we -- and join our question of the day.  Sir Tim Berners-Lee; now  he is the father of the internet, says he trusts the world's biggest tech  companies to take care of your data. </p><p>As the man who created the www, he told \"Reuters\" earlier in the week that  some big tech companies could one day have to be broken up.  You'll hear  Sir Tim in just a moment.  And whiles you think about all of that, is it  time for the big tech companies to be broken up? </p><p>Are they now the monopolies of yester-year but tomorrow? And I assume by  that, we'll let you define big tech, whether we're talking about an Amazon  or whichever sort of Facebook, I'm not sure how you break that one up.  Go  to cnn.com-slash-join now.  Voting is open and you'll see the results  update live on the screen. </p><p>I suppose Google is a good example, Alphabet would be another one.  Amazon  shares while you're voting, Amazon shares are taking a beating today  absolutely, down 2.5 percent or $41, there is the price.  It's not off the  lows of the week, but it is certainly down. </p><p>Investors are being scared off by threats from Donald Trump who is claiming  Amazon and other tech giants may have violated anti-trust laws.  And the  president says his administration is looking into the claims, but isn't  taking  action just yet.  Now, if that were alone, that would be bad enough  to push down the price, but it is not. </p><p>It's not the only thing weighing on the Amazon share price.  Remember,  cnn.com-slash-join.  Now, some customers are also looking to boycott.  The  customers in Saudi Arabia are boycotting the company, taking aim at the  Jeff Bezos and CEO who also owns the \"Washington Post\". </p><p>It's all over the outrage over how the post has covered the killing of one  of its journalists Jamal Khashoggi.  The thing has been pointed firmly at  the Saudi leadership.  So boycott Amazon is trending on Saudi social media.   Meanwhile, the company announced a new incentive to draw in new prime  members on the holiday season. </p><p>It's a free-shipping offer.  Now, if you're a prime member, you already get  free shipping.  It's reserved for paid subscribers.  Now all U.S. customers  will get it with no minimum purchase -- oh, and one other thing you do get,  though, they'll increase the number of things they get free same day  delivery. </p><p>So two developments -- if that wasn't enough, an article in the Bezos home  post is writing new clues about which city Amazon is going to or may choose  to HQ2.  Crystal City, Virginia, has become a frontrunner.  The \"Post\" is  claiming citing people close to the process.  By the way, Amazon said those  who know don't speak and those who speak don't know, and they've also  advised any city who is in the running to best keep stump in case this  suddenly find the knot.</p><p>A lot of Amazon news one way or the other.  Clare Sebastian puts it all  together for us.  Clare, taking all of these developments and the fact that  the share price is down some 2.5 percent today.  What is the driving factor  against that share price?  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, I think it's a combination of  factors, but I think the main one is these regulation comments by Donald  Trump.  Clearly, whether or not he intends to act imminently, he is still  obsessed with this company.  We've seen him through the past few months  talking about, you know, the exploitation of the postal service, the Bezos- Amazon \"Washington Post\" as he's called it, and he's had this company in  his sights. </p><p>And this is really the one thing that investors feel could interrupt the  growth of this company is some kind of regulation to break it up.  So I  think that is what is driving this share.  But don't forget, it comes after  a brutal month.  Amazon has lost about 20 percent of its values since its  peak in September.  </p><p>So there's jitters with that already.  This is just playing into it.</p><p>QUEST:  If the view and there was something of a view that Amazon was  overpriced, that may have been settled by a 20 cent correction.  But you  know, at the end of the day, Clare, I don't hear anybody suggesting that  Amazon is going to start losing customers or that in some way its business  from Amazon cloud services, Amazon web services through to the toilet paper  it will deliver to me in New York.</p><p>[15:45:00]  That it's in any way waning, it's getting bigger.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely, this is where we are in retail, the bigger -- are  getting bigger.  And in particular, Amazon, it's interesting to look at the  free shipping offer that they put out today and the context of that,  Richard, because that is one of the reasons why they can do that is because  they have the higher margin part of the business which is AWS, Amazon's web  services, the cloud and also the burgeoning advertising business because of  all the data they've got from their core retail business. </p><p>They can use those to funnel money into the lower margin -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Retail business, and that is why they can pay for these things  -- </p><p>QUEST:  Clare -- </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Like free shipping.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare, forgive me for interrupting.  I just want to ask you very  quickly and briefly, are you surprised the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS viewer,  wise and wary of world, although they are, 71 percent says big tech  companies should be broken up, only 29 percent say no.  I'm surprised on  that, are you?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  I would say a little surprised, you know, these companies are  you know, ubiquitous to society.  I think the same people who voted the 70  percent who want to break them up are probably also Amazon users and are  relishing -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  The lower prices and the free shipping that they're offering.   But I think the drumbeat around these companies, Richard, be it Amazon, be  it Facebook, be it Google has got a lot of people worried and they're  starting to take a second look here.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare Sebastian, thank you.  The founder of the world wide web Tim  Berners-Lee is calling on governments, companies and individuals to back up  contracts for the web.  That contract he says would help protect people's  rights and freedoms on the internet.  Cnn's Laurie Segall asked him if we  can really trust tech companies to build that product in a safe and  trustworthy manner.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TIM BERNERS-LEE, FOUNDER, WORLD WIDE WEB:  I think because of things like  the data transfer project in which these four companies said you have the  right --you would be able to physically get your data from one of one  others and put it into the other or get -- then I think that for me is  saying, yes, actually they get it as a point and they're prepared to put  the work in.</p><p>So yes, I think that they will.  Yes, I think will have enough people who  are building in home devices that talk to me about their excitement.  We  have to solid put it, we should ask people to have their own data pods.   They've said OK, what would be good would be -- we can -- why don't we  actually put all these data in your data pods?</p><p>I think and there's a lot of excitement around that about -- and realizing  -- people realizing that if they give you data -- control over on your data  that they're generating value for you.  And a lot of companies are finding  it so exciting to be able to switch from trying to exploit you, trying to  make you buy something that you didn't want to buy to actually switch back  to the core business model of helping the user, generating data for the  user.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN:  Can they do that and still make a profit? I mean,  could they do that and not sacrifice their billion-dollar business models?  </p><p>BERNERS-LEE:  You know, all these plugs you can find about how much if you  join the big social network and you give them all your data and you get  stuff  for free.  How much actually is the value date to all those  insurance companies themselves.  It turns out for example, one blog I  thought -- well, the value to them or if your data is less than you pay for  internet connectivity, anyway. </p><p>So actually if you subscribed to your social network and your feeds and  your data, you could actually replace that funding stream by turning around  and paying for yourself.  And it wouldn't be much, so it's actually -- it  says maybe it's a myth.  </p><p>SEGALL:  I'm going to give you two ideas of privacy, and you tell me which  one you think is right.  So one idea is that we just have to re-envision  privacy.  Privacy to an extent is dead.  Another one is that privacy is a  fundamental human right and we have the right to it.  So where do you stand  when it comes to the future, this current moment and looking at what it  means for us as users in our privacy?  </p><p>BERNERS-LEE:  You don't have to look for other guests, we aren't going to  be.  I am going to be with the far to see(ph) of human right.  I'd be say,  privacy of human rights as all placed in the United Nations have said  privacy is a -- those human rights and as you said, that is the right. </p><p>Web is a human right -- you know, so for me, it's very important that I  have control of my data.  That doesn't mean I'm going to afford it, that  doesn't mean that I won't share it with a company which will help me buy  the best presents for my family.  It means that I'll -- it also -- it means  that I'll be able to share it with my -- the people that I work with, that  will -- and so will be able to work more efficiently, I'll have a lot of  total control over who I share what with. </p><p>So the idea of control or own your own data is not just about sort of me  being my own silo, walking everything away, essentially having the joy of  being able to share it with whoever.  Like the joy, if you could know or  you take a selfie with somebody, you pass in the streets and they give you  a business card, just you know, they immediately share whatever it is with  them immediately just because they're a person, just because they have an  ID.</p><p>[15:50:00]  That whereas, in fact, you would have to go home and find out  which social networks they belong to.  So it's partly because -- you know,  control over data -- over your own data as a human right -- that's mine. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Bad news for Google and Facebook by a margin of 2-1.  Most of you  say big tech companies should be broken up.  Now, well, it's come off its - - the highs of 60s or whatever is -- that could mean separating Facebook  from Whatsapp and Instagram while splitting Google Search from its other  bets. </p><p>I'd say I'm surprised, I wouldn't have thought together would have -- would  go all the way very -- that's where we have it.  There is nothing high tech  about the Indonesian xylophone that I got to try out earlier today.  The  rest of the World Travel Market is getting a lot more digital.  We'll hear  from the tourism minister next on how a professional plays that.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  WTM London, 5th to the 7th November, one of the world's biggest  expos for one of the world's largest industries.  You need a stout pair of  shoes and a strong constitution if you're attending the World Travel Market  which began today at ExCeL in London. </p><p>Now, while some offerings are analog, like these Indonesian xylophone -- I  don't think it's properly called the xylophone, but you get the idea sort  of how difficult it is.  How to run somebody else's song.  Most of this  year's focus is on digital tourism, that's everything from targeted ads to  digital destinations including a holiday.</p><p>Everything -- look at the pictures.  Everything is geared not just in  taking the picture, but to putting it on mobile and sharing it with  someone.  If it doesn't look good on Instagram, it's not worth doing.   Indonesia's Tourism Minister told me digital tourism can help him get  millions more visitors.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARIEF YAHYA, TOURISM MINISTER, INDONESIA:  We are doing all the promotion  using this digital media.  For example, we are using the Google, et cetera  for looking, booking, dot com, et cetera.  Even in China, we are using  Ctrip, et cetera.  </p><p>Seventy percent of our target allocated for digital media.</p><p>[15:55:00]  QUEST:  Do you -- I see also, you know, the use of the digital,  I see the word innovation.  But everybody in this building -- </p><p>YAHYA:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Is saying the same thing.  </p><p>YAHYA:  Yes.   </p><p>QUEST:  So how are you going to do it better than them?  </p><p>YAHHA:  OK, there are two things actually.  First is, we have digital  destination, it only show you can see it.  We have at least five days here,  we are going to develop 100 digital destinations, and the second, how we  promote it.  We are going to promote our destination using digital media as  I said before. </p><p>QUEST:  Instagram and things like that?  </p><p>YAHYA:  Everything.  Digital -- I mean, this has to be inside a mobile, it  has to be nice in camera.  You see, that's the first criteria for digital  tourism.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Now, I'll have a lot more from the World Travel Market on Friday's  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS where Tourism Ministers from almost every continent.   And we'll take you on a whistle stop tour of the world's tourism as they  make their pitch.  We will have our profitable moment after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, the midterm elections take place  tomorrow in the United States, and we can pass the results anywhere as  you'll try and understand who will vote, you know, white women from middle  class in northern states or young urban professionals in the Midwest, you  can get it so detailed as you're trying to understand what the voting  trends are and it eventually makes no sense. </p><p>But we will know tomorrow exactly who voted and how, and then we'll have  the problem of how the markets react.  If there is an element of gridlock,  further gridlock than we've already got, a greater divide in America if  that were possible, what does that mean for the markets? </p><p>There is that popular view that says when Washington is gridlocked, the  markets do well.  We'll find out in the next 24 hours because as the voting  and the results come in, we will be here to make sense of it all for you.  </p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. </p><p>(BELL RINGING) </p><p>The bell -- Avianca, an airline -- the bell is ringing, the Dow is up, the  day is done.    </p><p>END      </p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Goes up throughout the course of the day, slightly off the best of the day so far, and there is one hour still to trade on Wall Street. I'm Richard Quest. These are the top business - these are the headlines on CNN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran is the first as the new sanctions come into play. The Trump administration's renewed sanctions on Iran's energy. US elections and the questions of the midterm, almost upon us, which will go in different directions? And Amazon, is the Trump administration about to try an anti- trust deal or anti-trust attack on Amazon? Tonight, live from London, this is \"Quest Means Business.\" I'm Richard Quest. Now, let's go.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening. It's the final frantic, dramatic push for votes. Across the United States, candidates and their supporters are making their closing arguments. President Trump is campaigning right now in Cleveland. It's been a bitter campaign season and the most expensive midterm election in US history and this is why. The entire House is up for grabs, along with 35 Senate seats and 36 state governorships.</p><p>The decisions voters make will affect everything from the Supreme Court to regulation. President Trump's agenda even how and where the electoral battle lines are drawn. Bill Clinton's strategist famously said, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" But when it comes to economic developments, there's plenty to campaign on.</p><p>So first of all, you've got surging growth, raging trade wars and growing deficits. To voters, the importance of the economy hasn't changed much since the last midterm elections four years ago. Forty four percent of registered voters polled nationally say the economy is extremely important to their vote. That's down 12 percentage points in the height of the crisis in 2009-2010. Even President Trump doesn't seem too eager to talk about the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They all say, speak about the economy, speak about the economy. Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country, but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy, right?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Since John King is tracking the races and the issues as seen from Washington. If there's one man who is absolutely under the hood of the suffology in this midterm elections, John, it is you. So get out the crystal ball and have a fiddle around try to mix the metaphors beautifully, what are you seeing in the last 24 hours before?</p><p>JOHN KING, CHIEF US CORRESPONDENT, CNN: In the last 24 hours, we're seeing some evidence of a break toward the Democrats. This is very complicated because for the House of Representatives, the terrain does favor the Democrats. They need to pick up 23 seats in the United States House of Representatives. They have a clear path, Richard, to at least 25, some Democrats think even 35.</p><p>So the Democrats actually have no excuses if they don't take back the House and the late polling numbers suggest things are breaking their way. The Senate is much more complicated by the Senate races on the ballot this year, many of them were in states President Trump carried big. Many of them compare - let me put it this way, a lot of these competitive House districts, they're close to the suburbs, they're in suburban areas. That's where the President is incredibly weak.</p><p>The Senate races, bigger states with smaller towns and more rural areas. That's where the President is strong. Democrats look to make gains in the House. They look to make a lot of gains at the state level, races for governor and state legislature. The Senate, the day before the election, more of a toss-up where the Republicans are favored to hold their majority, maybe even add a seat or two, but there is some late hope for the Democrats. They do see some evidence of a possible late break that might let them not only hold their Senate seats, but maybe surprise us. We'll count them tomorrow.</p><p>QUEST: Is it - for everybody I've been talking to, is it possible or likely that the last election repeats itself? And that President Trump, well of course, it's possible, but is it probable I should really say or at what level of possibility that he actually does much better than expected and out of nowhere the red wave or little trickle does become much stronger?</p><p>KING: I rule out nothing. Based on our 2016 experience and based on our recent American political experience, not just the Trump win in 2016. Eight years before that, America elected its first African-American President.</p><p>[15:05:04]</p><p>KING: A lot of people thought that couldn't happen. So, there's no doubt volatility and unpredictability in the climate. I will tell you this though, Richard, as for a total Republican surprise, meaning the Republicans hold the House, even the President himself doesn't seem to believe that.</p><p>Over the weekend, he conceded the Republicans are likely to lose the House. Just today, he said with zero evidence, this is a farce and a fraud, but the President said he sees all this evidence already of illegal immigrants illegally voting in the US midterm election. Remember, that's the same excuse he used for why he said Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016 even though he won the Electoral College.</p><p>So the Republicans will suffer some pain tomorrow, all Republicans agree on that. Though you raise a great question about how big, how much do we trust the polling? Which wasn't perfect in 2016 because the climate is so different when you look at the House and then the Senate.</p><p>And to your point about the economy, if this President - if this is a referendum on Trump at the midterm about his achievements, wow, right? Maybe you don't like the tax cuts, maybe you don't know how the US pays for them in the long run, but the economy is gangbusters, but is it more a referendum on the Trump tone, about tweets not tax cuts. If it's about tweets and tone, the President is going to have a shellacking tomorrow.</p><p>QUEST: Right, so define for me as best one can what would be seen as a disaster for or a verdict of total disaster for the President? And similarly, one would be saying, actually, he did really well. How will we judge tomorrow's results?</p><p>KING: If by any way Republicans hold the House and the Senate, that's a huge victory for the President. No way to sugar coat that for the Democrats. If the Republicans can somehow hold the House, that means limit the Democrats to picking up 22 or fewer seats, you would have a very narrow Republican majority, but if you still have a Republican majority come January, this is a victory for the President and his party, if they can hold the House and the Senate.</p><p>Again, the President is going to try to spin this. If he loses the House and wins the Senate, he's going to say his campaigning in the Senate states in the last days is what saved the Senate. He'll take credit for that.</p><p>I'll give you a longer range perspective though, Richard. We focus a lot on Washington, who controls the House? Who controls the Senate? These races for governor, down ballot races for state legislature are critical across America. That is where Democrats were punished in the Obama years.</p><p>First they lost the House in 2010, then they lost the Senate in 2014. Republicans now have 33 governors, 1,000 state legislative seats in the Obama years switched from Democrat to Republican. Do Democrats tomorrow start the rebuilding effort? If that's the case, then we'll talk a lot about the next two years of the Trump presidency, but the Democrats need to plant the seeds of a revival because they frankly, they've had a terrible decade.</p><p>QUEST: John, we'll let you go in just a second, but after - talk me through tomorrow night and obviously once you get on air. What should I be looking for and when?</p><p>KING: It's a great question, and we will get, just as we did in 2016, some very early clues. We may not know control of the House until we get to the West Coast which takes us into the early morning hours. We may not know control of the Senate then if the Democrats are surprising us, we could come down to Nevada and Arizona in the Western time zones, but polls close early in Kentucky and Ohio. There is a very competitive House district just outside of Louisville, Kentucky, the sixth congressional district. There is a Republican incumbent, Andy Barr in a Republican district that in a normal year, he should win.</p><p>He is running against a retired Democratic fighter pilot, military experience, shot all her ads with a fighter jet just over her shoulder. If Amy McGrath is winning in Kentucky's 6th, that tells you the Democrats not only have a path to get to the House majority, maybe bigger than that.</p><p>So look at Kentucky first, then you come along the East Coast, there are some seats in New England, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. We will know two scenarios. Are the Democrats doing what they need to do to take back the House or a Republican successfully blocking them and then when we start to count the votes in the Florida Senate race, then we'll have a sense. Is there any prayer? Any prayer to what would be the biggest shock the Democrats taking the Senate, we'll start counting the votes. It's going to be a long night. Espresso tomorrow, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: You know, I have no idea how you keep all those facts in your head at once. John, we'll be with you tomorrow night. Thank you so much, sir. We appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>KING: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: John has put it into the big picture of the politics. We need to put it, as we always do, into what's happening in the markets. The day before the midterms and Wall Street has a stake in the election as investors are waiting, the Dow is nearly at session highs. It's bouncing around. It would not surprise me, bearing in mind that when it's 55 minutes of trading left, we could see just that hold - unlikely, unlikely that you're just going to see it evaporate in the next 50 minutes. But, so I wouldn't put too much on that. Holding roughly where I would like to is what seems most reasonable at this point.</p><p>The Dow is near the sessions high as the tech shares are down, and if you look at Apple and Amazon - now, Apple and Amazon are big losers at the moment. They are on the back of economic news.</p><p>[15:10:06]</p><p>QUEST: President Trump has unleashed what he calls the strongest ever sanctions on Iran. A move to re-impose all penalties lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The target in an investment company with links to Iran's supreme leader. Some 70 financial institutions, if you look at here, there are seven investment firms, financial institutions, maritime carriers, oil transport -- these are the main targets, if you like, of the attack on the sanctions.</p><p>The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is warning the companies to continue to trade with Iran will pay a heavy price.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, US SECRETARY OF STATE: It should be noted that if a country evades our sanctions regime and secretly continues sanctionable commerce in the Islamic Republic, the United States will levy severe swift penalties on it, including potential sanctions. I promise you that doing business with Iran and defying some of our sanctions will ultimately be a much more painful business decision than pulling out of Iran.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran, joins me now. So the full weight of sanctions back on, at least from the US and as you're aware, other nations and companies being forced along. When would we expect to see the first effect in Tehran?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, I think some of the effects have already been felt over the past couple of months, Richard. You already had a first round of sanctions where large companies have already pulled out. But this is arguably the much bigger sanctions weight that could fall on Iran very quickly.</p><p>So far, what we're seeing is that you do see a lot of politicians here who are still very defiant in the face of that. Regular folks who are already feeling the pinch of it really fear that things could go very, very badly. It could happen in the not too distant future when a lot of countries stop eyeing Iranian oil. A lot have already stopped doing that.</p><p>The interesting thing from Tehran's perspective is they sort of feel, just a little bit, Richard, that Washington might have blinked just slightly giving some of those sanctions waivers where some of the biggest importers of Iranian oil can actually still do that. Like for instance, China; like for instance, Japan and India as well.</p><p>So the Iranians sort of feeling they might still have a bit of a lifeline with those countries being able to buy that oil, but certainly, if that's something that stops, they think they're going to take a very, very big hit here and all of the talk of defiance, we speak to regular folks, they are saying, they are already feeling the pinch and they do think that it could get a lot worse, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Is there any evidence that a return - excuse me - is there any evidence that a return to false sanctions would strengthen any seedling opposition within Iran against the government?</p><p>PLEITGEN: So far it's a very, very important question. So far I don't think that there's any evidence of that whatsoever. One of the things that you saw earlier this year is that there were some protests here in Iran against the economic situation. We have to keep in mind that it's not only the sanctions that are strangling Iran's economy. There is a lot of economic mismanagement, there is a lot of corruption, there is price hikes as well. There is a lot of things that people are unhappy with.</p><p>If you look at the situation now that these new sanctions have been put into place that really isn't the case anymore. So the President, Hassan Rouhani, he was under a lot of fire a couple of months ago for putting the nuclear agreement into play. He was taking a lot of heat from the hardliners, that's no longer the case either.</p><p>It seems that a lot of that anger is now being channeled towards President Trump, towards the US administration, and many people here feel that what's going on right now in the Islamic public is being induced from the outside, it is being induced from Washington, DC, so it doesn't seem as though, if it is, the intention of the Trump administration to weaken the government, to weaken the clergy and the military here, so far, it doesn't appear as though, at least from our perspective that that is currently the case right, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Fred Pleitgen who is in Tehran, thank you. Now Swift, which is the international payment system, is not taking any chances and is cutting its services from some Iranian banks. Swift is the international standard for verifying money transfers, which is a posh way of saying it provides a secure network between more than 10,000 financial institutions around the world. If I want to send you money internationally, or more likely, hopefully, you're sending me money, and then probably, it will go via Swift and our institutions will have a Swift code that will go backwards and forwards.</p><p>Now, this is long before the days of blockchain technology. Some Iranian banks are now unable to talk to Swift after the firm blocked them from its messaging system. Swift says the decision is regrettable. John Defterios is in Abu Dhabi to put this in perspective. John, the Swift found itself in an impossible position.</p><p>On the one hand, the US is saying, you know, \"You do business with Iran and we will penalize you.\" On the other hand, the Europeans and others say, \"If you give in to external pressure on sanctions, we will penalize you.\"</p><p>[15:15:10]</p><p>QUEST: So now what?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR, CNN: Well, Richard, it was not an easy call for Swift because it's based in Belgium right at the heart of the European Union, but it's an international player and it will target up to 50 banks going forward here that are on the target list from the United States.</p><p>They said it was regrettable as you suggested, but necessary for stability, so that's the argument they are using, but I think, we should remind our viewers, Richard, this was supposed to be the round of sanctions that targeted oil, not financial institutions. The first round was strong against Iran, but the second round really targets the financial institutions here.</p><p>We have 900 entities, financial banks, insurance companies, the shipping companies and also the airlines. Now, we know Russia, China, Turkey, the European Union were against the US sanctions, so that how do they work around the US Federal Reserve and US Treasury is a key question.</p><p>President Rouhani of Iran said he looks forward to breaking the sanctions. That's very bold as Fred was suggesting here, but it will be hard times for the Iranians going forward. I was looking at a World Bank report, a month ago, before we saw the full weight of these financial sanctions, and they were projecting a decline of 4% - a recession of 4% in 2019, inflation of 30%, Richard, and again, this is where it is today. It could come under further pressure of the Swift banking sanctions that you were talking about.</p><p>QUEST: If you look at oil, the movements we've seen in oil in the past few days, there has been quite a sizeable drop in that price on the back of what?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, you know, this is very fascinating to me, because remember, Donald Trump was saying in the summer, we're going to take Iran down to zero when it comes to exports and this is where the midterm reality settled in. This is a chart looking back just a month, Richard, and when North Sea Brent hit $86.00 a barrel, Donald Trump hit Twitter and was calling out for more crude.</p><p>Saudi Arabia responded. The UAE where I am sitting responded, Kuwait even Russia. We saw that price go from $86.00 a barrel down to $73.00.</p><p>But that's not the only factor, Richard. Iran's production has been dropping, but it's not collapsing just yet. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMAN NASSERI, MIDDLE EAST MANAGING DIRECTOR, FGE: We drew an expected part of Iran's exports falling to less than a million barrels per day by first quarter next year and around 700,000 to 800,000 a day by middle of next year. So far, it has come along that path.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: So Richard, we're at 1.5 million barrels a day. Now, the Facts Global Energy is suggesting we get to 700,000 to 800,000 barrels. Let's bring up, Richard, the eight exemptions that were made here. I was surprised over the fact, the Italian and the Greeks got the exemptions as members of the European Union, which have been fighting against Donald Trump. China, Turkey and India never were going to go along. So it's almost like legalizing, Richard the ability for them to continue to import Iranian crude and as Fred said, the big Asian importers are in there as well.</p><p>This by the way, Richard is proof to the fact, you can't replace Iranian crude that easily. They were exporting 2.8 million barrels a day back in June. Donald Trump admitted he didn't want to see the price go higher right now.</p><p>QUEST: John Defterios, thank you. Now, Britain and the European Union are rallying against America's hash new sanctions on Tehran. I'll discuss with the former British Finance Minister, Lord Norman Lamont after the break.</p><p>And Amazon's headlines are coming thick and fast today. Accusations of anti-trust violations in the White House, a Saudi boycott and new clues around 8Q2.</p><p>[15:15:0]</p><p>QUEST: The European Union is staunchly opposed to the US sanctions on Iran, saying it will try to protect European companies doing legitimate business with Tehran. Joining me now to discuss this is Lord Lamont, Chairman of the British Iranian Chamber of Commerce, and of course Prime Minister's trade envoy to Iran, and Lord Lamont, the situation now is just about you're damned if your company is doing business - you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. It's who you want to be sanctioned by or fall out of favor with the Europeans or the Americans.</p><p>LORD NORMAN LAMONT, CHAIRMAN, BRITISH IRANIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: Well, that's got a fair amount of force behind it. There are companies that trade both with Iran and the US. They will have to choose. Many will choose to trade with America - that is inevitable, but there are other companies that trade only with Iran or for whom Iran is the more important market.</p><p>And the object of European policy is to protect them from the secondary sanctions, the banking sanctions, that even when the nuclear deal was in force, were inhibiting European companies from trading with Iran, because they feared that the banks, their bank, which might deal with an American bank, wouldn't finance their trade with Iran. So this is trying to protect the European banking system from American banking, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: But the moment a dollar becomes involved ...</p><p>LAMONT: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: The moment and never mind anything as complicated or as exotic as dollar clearing, then you're into a different ball game, aren't you? Because then the Treasury and the whole weight of this could be against you.</p><p>LAMONT: You know, that's right. Do business with America, have dealings in dollars, employ American personnel, have any American content in your product. You have got to be very, very careful, obviously.</p><p>QUEST: Are you disappointed at the way in which Europe and the UK and other countries, that they've not stood up to the US in this sense. They've said, \"Okay, you go off with your sanctions, you withdraw from the agreement,\" but they don't seem to protect it.</p><p>LAMONT: Well, it's not an easy problem to solve because of the combined effect of trade, the effect of globalization, but the special purpose vehicle that the EU is working on, that will take time to get going and in the instance, that will essentially be a netting mechanism allowing companies with debts and obligations to Iran to swap liabilities with each other.</p><p>But eventually the SPV is designed or intended to get a banking license and process transactions themselves.</p><p>QUEST: But it is allowing an extra territorial aspect to US legislation. I mean, even the right to - or as one reads - exemptions for this country to trade for oil in this country, I mean, the argument is there because who is the US to tell Japan that it can't buy oil from Iran?</p><p>LAMON: Well, I totally agree with you. I think the American policy is unreasonable. I think the United States has an obsessions with Iran that is not justified by the facts. I think they're obsessed with still with the hostage crisis. They are influenced by Saudi Arabia, and we know when it comes to which the worst regime, Iran or Saudi Arabia, Western policy is not even handed. It's do with selling armaments to Saudi Arabia, it's to do a bit with Israel, but I don't think we've got a balance policy from America towards Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>[15:25:00]</p><p>QUEST: Do you think that policy has become even more unbalanced? I mean, there's always a degree of an imbalance. I mean, there is always a degree of an imbalance on hypocrisy when putting foreign policy to work with some of these countries. But it seems to have become more egregious is what you seem to be saying.</p><p>LAMONT: Well, I think what's happened here - I mean, frankly, Mr. Trump is not telling the facts when he says Iran is breaking the agreement. Iran is fully compliant with the agreement and expert opinion from the International Atomic Energy Agency says so. I think the main reason in Trump's mind, for having these sanctions, is because the nuclear deal was done by Obama. It was done by Obama, and therefore, he is against it.</p><p>QUEST: Let's turn very briefly if we may to the issue of Saudi Arabia because you're obviously extremely involved in business. But in terms of government, you will have been party to Cabinets with negotiations with the Saudis were involved for armaments. Do you think it is time to get back to business or something approaching business is normal, or do you think that the West should hold armament sales up against the Crown Prince and the Saudi government?</p><p>LAMONT: Well, the West including Britain is so deeply involved in armament sales to Saudi Arabia. I don't see that being reversed, but I think we ought to aim for more diversified policy in arm sales, and I think above all, we need more balanced approach.</p><p>I mean, we've seen how the Saudis have been very economical with the truth when it came to Mr. Khashoggi. Are we going to trust them with everything to do with the Yemen War that we're told by them.</p><p>I think we ought to be a little bit more even handed. I am not saying that Iran is a desirable regime. But I think we ought to be more balanced.</p><p>QUEST: But is it time to - is it time to start doing more business back with Saudi Arabia? Back to normal is what I am suggesting after the Khashoggi ...</p><p>LAMONT: I think the West world to insist on getting a proper explanation of what has happened and being sure that the people who are held responsible for that are the people who really were responsible.</p><p>QUEST: Very good to have you, sir. Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>LAMONT: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: We didn't even get on to the midterms, that's next time. The US House of Representatives will stay red or it will turn blue, and that will cause the US markets to turn red or indeed green - it depends on the election, one way or another. It is a good day. We're off the highs of the day by some - but that is up 170 on the Dow.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>[15:30:00] RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Hello, I'm Richard Quest, there's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment.

For investors, it's a week of big events. Political shifts in the U.S. know they will certainly hit the market. The dollar, FANG stocks and emerging markets all likely to face disruption as a result of events. Now, the Fed will reveal its interest rates decision on Thursday.</p><p>Policymakers have been facing pressure to soften their hawkish views, and all week corporate earnings galore. Some market watchers are concerned profits have peaked. Ben Phillips is watching it all, the Chief Investment Officer at EventShares. Of the events you are watching at the moment, Ben, what are you most concerned? What are you watching particularly carefully?</p><p>BEN PHILLIPS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, EVENTSHARES: Well, so I think everyone is focused on midterms this week, but we're worried about what's going on after midterms. So regardless of the outcome of midterms, we're looking at Trump's policy towards global trade.</p><p>We think how he responds to China after midterms after some of this campaigning we've seen really over the past few weeks, that's our biggest concern is that global trade breaks down and supply chains are disrupted because of trade policy.</p><p>QUEST: But I see where you're coming from, but haven't you neatly jumped the hurdle of the midterms? Because the result tomorrow will factor in, you know, becomes a sine qua non of all those other events.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, look, I mean, we're positioning our portfolio adventure as the PLCY portfolio in things that really are going to continue regardless of the outcome. So financial deregulation, it's out of Congress' hands, it's now in the agency, the Fed, the OCC, the CFPB.</p><p>You look at education deregulation, that's in the department of ED's hands. So if we go down the list and see what's actually occurring, it looks like regardless of the outcome, we're going to have, you know, some policy catalyst that continue. So deregulation, healthcare spending driven by Obamacare, you know, those sorts of things.</p><p>Defense spending, want to stay elevated, our view. So those are the types of things we're watching and those are the type of things we're positioning our portfolio on.</p><p>QUEST: In the event of a gridlock with the house going to the Democrats, does the situation change? Does it get worse for investors or arguably, it gets a great deal better because if Washington can't do anything, then investors are free and the market is free to make its own direction.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes, I actually think that's right. I think we'll see some more noise potentially, maybe some more hearings and things like that. I haven't heard Democrats mention the impeachment word yet again with a split Congress not even worth really taking that off the ground --</p><p>[15:35:00] QUEST: Right --</p><p>PHILLIPS: Unless there's some really incriminating new evidence that comes out. But so, yes, I think what happens in a split Congress is less and less is more for the market. There's a whole congressional effect study out there that says when Congress isn't doing anything, markets are happy.</p><p>So it's just as soon as we remove this uncertainty of midterms, then we have certainty of what the outcome is within a week depending on California races obviously if there's some delay there. But so we'll get some clarity here within the next week and see which direction Congress is going.</p><p>QUEST: Right, quick-fire questions, Ben. Volatility, more of it in the midterm or less?</p><p>PHILLIPS: More in the midterm because of trade.</p><p>QUEST: Turning to the question of interest rates. Another one in December, and what after that?</p><p>PHILLIPS: It's going to be, again, the trade can really disrupt the growth thesis of the U.S. So I think if the Fed sees slower growth because of the trade, they might delay their actions and hiking rates further, '19.</p><p>QUEST: Diversification and rotation, we've seen it out of tech into defensive, does that continue, is it overdone? When does the tech come back?</p><p>PHILLIPS: I think it continues. Tech really has had all this momentum factor built up into it. Now you're seeing people rotate more structurally, longer term out of that momentum factor. So what we're seeing is more and more investors doing that, it's really just started.</p><p>So if people say, we're at the top of the cycle here, it's going to start - - this rotation continues in our view. So I would be wary of tech and the regulation of tech in big data regulation.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, tech and tech. Does tech like Amazon which buys and sells things on Netflix which delivers movies and has subscription basis, and then there's tech like Facebook, obviously Twitter and Snap, we can sort of leave somewhere in the doldrums down at the bottom. But is there a difference, as you say, the rotation out of tech?</p><p>PHILLIPS: There is, but you know, we think the whole ecosystem is affected. But where we're most cautious is around those social media names, the ones who have been data aggregators in our view, collecting everyone's consumer data and then using it and selling it. They're the ones at biggest risk. But China trade, we think hardware and the semi- conductors and really that whole supply chain is so integrated with China that they're at risk too.</p><p>So we're broadly avoiding tech other than our 5G telecom exposure in PLCY.</p><p>QUEST: Ben, do me a favor, make me a promise, you'll come back and help us understand more in the future.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Absolutely, happy any time, thanks Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Excellent, new member of the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS family.

As we continue tonight from London, he created the web in 1989 and now he's trying to keep it on track.

And the president says his administration is looking into the claims, but isn't taking action just yet.

Now, some customers are also looking to boycott. The customers in Saudi Arabia are boycotting the company, taking aim at the Jeff Bezos and CEO who also owns the \"Washington Post\".</p><p>It's all over the outrage over how the post has covered the killing of one of its journalists Jamal Khashoggi. The thing has been pointed firmly at the Saudi leadership. So boycott Amazon is trending on Saudi social media. Meanwhile, the company announced a new incentive to draw in new prime members on the holiday season.</p><p>It's a free-shipping offer. Now, if you're a prime member, you already get free shipping. It's reserved for paid subscribers. Now all U.S. customers will get it with no minimum purchase -- oh, and one other thing you do get, though, they'll increase the number of things they get free same day delivery.</p><p>So two developments -- if that wasn't enough, an article in the Bezos home post is writing new clues about which city Amazon is going to or may choose to HQ2. Crystal City, Virginia, has become a frontrunner. The \"Post\" is claiming citing people close to the process. By the way, Amazon said those who know don't speak and those who speak don't know, and they've also advised any city who is in the running to best keep stump in case this suddenly find the knot.</p><p>A lot of Amazon news one way or the other. Clare Sebastian puts it all together for us. Clare, taking all of these developments and the fact that the share price is down some 2.5 percent today. What is the driving factor against that share price?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Richard, I think it's a combination of factors, but I think the main one is these regulation comments by Donald Trump. Clearly, whether or not he intends to act imminently, he is still obsessed with this company. We've seen him through the past few months talking about, you know, the exploitation of the postal service, the Bezos- Amazon \"Washington Post\" as he's called it, and he's had this company in his sights.</p><p>And this is really the one thing that investors feel could interrupt the growth of this company is some kind of regulation to break it up. So I think that is what is driving this share. But don't forget, it comes after a brutal month. Amazon has lost about 20 percent of its values since its peak in September.</p><p>So there's jitters with that already. This is just playing into it.</p><p>QUEST: If the view and there was something of a view that Amazon was overpriced, that may have been settled by a 20 cent correction. But you know, at the end of the day, Clare, I don't hear anybody suggesting that Amazon is going to start losing customers or that in some way its business from Amazon cloud services, Amazon web services through to the toilet paper it will deliver to me in New York.</p><p>[15:45:00] That it's in any way waning, it's getting bigger.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Absolutely, this is where we are in retail, the bigger -- are getting bigger. And in particular, Amazon, it's interesting to look at the free shipping offer that they put out today and the context of that, Richard, because that is one of the reasons why they can do that is because they have the higher margin part of the business which is AWS, Amazon's web services, the cloud and also the burgeoning advertising business because of all the data they've got from their core retail business.</p><p>They can use those to funnel money into the lower margin --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Retail business, and that is why they can pay for these things --</p><p>QUEST: Clare --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Like free shipping.</p><p>QUEST: Clare, forgive me for interrupting. I just want to ask you very quickly and briefly, are you surprised the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS viewer, wise and wary of world, although they are, 71 percent says big tech companies should be broken up, only 29 percent say no. I'm surprised on that, are you?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: I would say a little surprised, you know, these companies are you know, ubiquitous to society. I think the same people who voted the 70 percent who want to break them up are probably also Amazon users and are relishing --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The lower prices and the free shipping that they're offering. But I think the drumbeat around these companies, Richard, be it Amazon, be it Facebook, be it Google has got a lot of people worried and they're starting to take a second look here.</p><p>QUEST: Clare Sebastian, thank you. The founder of the world wide web Tim Berners-Lee is calling on governments, companies and individuals to back up contracts for the web. That contract he says would help protect people's rights and freedoms on the internet. Cnn's Laurie Segall asked him if we can really trust tech companies to build that product in a safe and trustworthy manner.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM BERNERS-LEE, FOUNDER, WORLD WIDE WEB: I think because of things like the data transfer project in which these four companies said you have the right --you would be able to physically get your data from one of one others and put it into the other or get -- then I think that for me is saying, yes, actually they get it as a point and they're prepared to put the work in.</p><p>So yes, I think that they will. Yes, I think will have enough people who are building in home devices that talk to me about their excitement. We have to solid put it, we should ask people to have their own data pods. They've said OK, what would be good would be -- we can -- why don't we actually put all these data in your data pods?</p><p>I think and there's a lot of excitement around that about -- and realizing -- people realizing that if they give you data -- control over on your data that they're generating value for you. And a lot of companies are finding it so exciting to be able to switch from trying to exploit you, trying to make you buy something that you didn't want to buy to actually switch back to the core business model of helping the user, generating data for the user.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN: Can they do that and still make a profit? I mean, could they do that and not sacrifice their billion-dollar business models?</p><p>BERNERS-LEE: You know, all these plugs you can find about how much if you join the big social network and you give them all your data and you get stuff for free. How much actually is the value date to all those insurance companies themselves. It turns out for example, one blog I thought -- well, the value to them or if your data is less than you pay for internet connectivity, anyway.</p><p>So actually if you subscribed to your social network and your feeds and your data, you could actually replace that funding stream by turning around and paying for yourself. And it wouldn't be much, so it's actually -- it says maybe it's a myth.</p><p>SEGALL: I'm going to give you two ideas of privacy, and you tell me which one you think is right. So one idea is that we just have to re-envision privacy. Privacy to an extent is dead. Another one is that privacy is a fundamental human right and we have the right to it. So where do you stand when it comes to the future, this current moment and looking at what it means for us as users in our privacy?</p><p>BERNERS-LEE: You don't have to look for other guests, we aren't going to be. I am going to be with the far to see(ph) of human right. I'd be say, privacy of human rights as all placed in the United Nations have said privacy is a -- those human rights and as you said, that is the right.</p><p>Web is a human right -- you know, so for me, it's very important that I have control of my data. That doesn't mean I'm going to afford it, that doesn't mean that I won't share it with a company which will help me buy the best presents for my family. It means that I'll -- it also -- it means that I'll be able to share it with my -- the people that I work with, that will -- and so will be able to work more efficiently, I'll have a lot of total control over who I share what with.</p><p>So the idea of control or own your own data is not just about sort of me being my own silo, walking everything away, essentially having the joy of being able to share it with whoever. Like the joy, if you could know or you take a selfie with somebody, you pass in the streets and they give you a business card, just you know, they immediately share whatever it is with them immediately just because they're a person, just because they have an ID.</p><p>[15:50:00] That whereas, in fact, you would have to go home and find out which social networks they belong to. So it's partly because -- you know, control over data -- over your own data as a human right -- that's mine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Bad news for Google and Facebook by a margin of 2-1. Most of you say big tech companies should be broken up. Now, well, it's come off its - - the highs of 60s or whatever is -- that could mean separating Facebook from Whatsapp and Instagram while splitting Google Search from its other bets.</p><p>I'd say I'm surprised, I wouldn't have thought together would have -- would go all the way very -- that's where we have it. There is nothing high tech about the Indonesian xylophone that I got to try out earlier today. The rest of the World Travel Market is getting a lot more digital. We'll hear from the tourism minister next on how a professional plays that.</p><p>QUEST: WTM London, 5th to the 7th November, one of the world's biggest expos for one of the world's largest industries. You need a stout pair of shoes and a strong constitution if you're attending the World Travel Market which began today at ExCeL in London.</p><p>Now, while some offerings are analog, like these Indonesian xylophone -- I don't think it's properly called the xylophone, but you get the idea sort of how difficult it is. How to run somebody else's song. Most of this year's focus is on digital tourism, that's everything from targeted ads to digital destinations including a holiday.</p><p>Everything -- look at the pictures. Everything is geared not just in taking the picture, but to putting it on mobile and sharing it with someone. If it doesn't look good on Instagram, it's not worth doing. Indonesia's Tourism Minister told me digital tourism can help him get millions more visitors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARIEF YAHYA, TOURISM MINISTER, INDONESIA: We are doing all the promotion using this digital media. For example, we are using the Google, et cetera for looking, booking, dot com, et cetera. Even in China, we are using Ctrip, et cetera.</p><p>Seventy percent of our target allocated for digital media.</p><p>[15:55:00] QUEST: Do you -- I see also, you know, the use of the digital, I see the word innovation. But everybody in this building --</p><p>YAHYA: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Is saying the same thing.</p><p>YAHYA: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: So how are you going to do it better than them?</p><p>YAHHA: OK, there are two things actually. First is, we have digital destination, it only show you can see it. We have at least five days here, we are going to develop 100 digital destinations, and the second, how we promote it. We are going to promote our destination using digital media as I said before.</p><p>QUEST: Instagram and things like that?</p><p>YAHYA: Everything. Digital -- I mean, this has to be inside a mobile, it has to be nice in camera. You see, that's the first criteria for digital tourism.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, I'll have a lot more from the World Travel Market on Friday's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS where Tourism Ministers from almost every continent. And we'll take you on a whistle stop tour of the world's tourism as they make their pitch. We will have our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, the midterm elections take place tomorrow in the United States, and we can pass the results anywhere as you'll try and understand who will vote, you know, white women from middle class in northern states or young urban professionals in the Midwest, you can get it so detailed as you're trying to understand what the voting trends are and it eventually makes no sense.</p><p>But we will know tomorrow exactly who voted and how, and then we'll have the problem of how the markets react. If there is an element of gridlock, further gridlock than we've already got, a greater divide in America if that were possible, what does that mean for the markets?</p><p>There is that popular view that says when Washington is gridlocked, the markets do well. We'll find out in the next 24 hours because as the voting and the results come in, we will be here to make sense of it all for you.</p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>The bell -- Avianca, an airline -- the bell is ringing, the Dow is up, the day is done.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018110501cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNH-M711-JB20-G559-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 5, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Goes up throughout the course of the  day, slightly off the best of the day so far, and there is one hour still  to trade on Wall Street.  I'm Richard Quest.  These are the top business -  these are the headlines on CNN.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran is the first as the new sanctions come into play.  The Trump  administration's renewed sanctions on Iran's energy.  US elections and the  questions of the midterm, almost upon us, which will go in different  directions?  And Amazon, is the Trump administration about to try an anti- trust deal or anti-trust attack on Amazon?  Tonight, live from London, this  is \"Quest Means Business.\"  I'm Richard Quest.  Now, let's go.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good evening.  It's the final frantic, dramatic push for votes.  Across the  United States, candidates and their supporters are making their closing  arguments.  President Trump is campaigning right now in Cleveland.  It's  been a bitter campaign season and the most expensive midterm election in US  history and this is why.  The entire House is up for grabs, along with 35  Senate seats and 36 state governorships.  </p><p> The decisions voters make will affect everything from the Supreme Court to  regulation.  President Trump's agenda even how and where the electoral  battle lines are drawn.  Bill Clinton's strategist famously said, \"It's the  economy, stupid.\"  But when it comes to economic developments, there's  plenty to campaign on.  </p><p> So first of all, you've got surging growth, raging trade wars and growing  deficits.  To voters, the importance of the economy hasn't changed much  since the last midterm elections four years ago.  Forty four percent of  registered voters polled nationally say the economy is extremely important  to their vote.  That's down 12 percentage points in the height of the  crisis in 2009-2010.  Even President Trump doesn't seem too eager to talk  about the economy.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They all say, speak about  the economy, speak about the economy.  Well, we have the greatest economy  in the history of our country, but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk  about the economy, right?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Since John King is tracking the races and the issues as seen from  Washington.  If there's one man who is absolutely under the hood of the  suffology in this midterm elections, John, it is you.  So get out the  crystal ball and have a fiddle around try to mix the metaphors beautifully,  what are you seeing in the last 24 hours before?  </p><p> JOHN KING, CHIEF US CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  In the last 24 hours, we're seeing  some evidence of a break toward the Democrats.  This is very complicated  because for the House of Representatives, the terrain does favor the  Democrats.  They need to pick up 23 seats in the United States House of  Representatives.  They have a clear path, Richard, to at least 25, some  Democrats think even 35.  </p><p> So the Democrats actually have no excuses if they don't take back the House  and the late polling numbers suggest things are breaking their way.  The  Senate is much more complicated by the Senate races on the ballot this  year, many of them were in states President Trump carried big.  Many of  them compare - let me put it this way, a lot of these competitive House  districts, they're close to the suburbs, they're in suburban areas.  That's  where the President is incredibly weak.  </p><p> The Senate races, bigger states with smaller towns and more rural areas.   That's where the President is strong.  Democrats look to make gains in the  House.  They look to make a lot of gains at the state level, races for  governor and state legislature.  The Senate, the day before the election,  more of a toss-up where the Republicans are favored to hold their majority,  maybe even add a seat or two, but there is some late hope for the  Democrats.  They do see some evidence of a possible late break that might  let them not only hold their Senate seats, but maybe surprise us.  We'll  count them tomorrow.  </p><p> QUEST:  Is it - for everybody I've been talking to, is it possible or  likely that the last election repeats itself?  And that President Trump,  well of course, it's possible, but is it probable I should really say or at  what level of possibility that he actually does much better than expected  and out of nowhere the red wave or little trickle does become much  stronger?  </p><p> KING:  I rule out nothing.  Based on our 2016 experience and based on our  recent American political experience, not just the Trump win in 2016.   Eight years before that, America elected its first African-American  President.  </p><p> [15:05:04]  </p><p> KING:  A lot of people thought that couldn't happen.  So, there's no doubt  volatility and unpredictability in the climate.  I will tell you this  though, Richard, as for a total Republican surprise, meaning the  Republicans hold the House, even the President himself doesn't seem to  believe that.  </p><p> Over the weekend, he conceded the Republicans are likely to lose the House.   Just today, he said with zero evidence, this is a farce and a fraud, but  the President said he sees all this evidence already of illegal immigrants  illegally voting in the US midterm election.  Remember, that's the same  excuse he used for why he said Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016  even though he won the Electoral College.  </p><p> So the Republicans will suffer some pain tomorrow, all Republicans agree on  that.  Though you raise a great question about how big, how much do we  trust the polling?  Which wasn't perfect in 2016 because the climate is so  different when you look at the House and then the Senate.  </p><p> And to your point about the economy, if this President - if this is a  referendum on Trump at the midterm about his achievements, wow, right?   Maybe you don't like the tax cuts, maybe you don't know how the US pays for  them in the long run, but the economy is gangbusters, but is it more a  referendum on the Trump tone, about tweets not tax cuts.  If it's about  tweets and tone, the President is going to have a shellacking tomorrow.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, so define for me as best one can what would be seen as a  disaster for or a verdict of total disaster for the President?  And  similarly, one would be saying, actually, he did really well.  How will we  judge tomorrow's results?  </p><p> KING:  If by any way Republicans hold the House and the Senate, that's a  huge victory for the President.  No way to sugar coat that for the  Democrats.  If the Republicans can somehow hold the House, that means limit  the Democrats to picking up 22 or fewer seats, you would have a very narrow  Republican majority, but if you still have a Republican majority come  January, this is a victory for the President and his party, if they can  hold the House and the Senate.  </p><p> Again, the President is going to try to spin this.  If he loses the House  and wins the Senate, he's going to say his campaigning in the Senate states  in the last days is what saved the Senate.  He'll take credit for that.  </p><p> I'll give you a longer range perspective though, Richard.  We focus a lot  on Washington, who controls the House?  Who controls the Senate?  These  races for governor, down ballot races for state legislature are critical  across America.  That is where Democrats were punished in the Obama years.  </p><p> First they lost the House in 2010, then they lost the Senate in 2014.   Republicans now have 33 governors, 1,000 state legislative seats in the  Obama years switched from Democrat to Republican.  Do Democrats tomorrow  start the rebuilding effort?  If that's the case, then we'll talk a lot  about the next two years of the Trump presidency, but the Democrats need to  plant the seeds of a revival because they frankly, they've had a terrible  decade.  </p><p> QUEST:  John, we'll let you go in just a second, but after - talk me  through tomorrow night and obviously once you get on air.  What should I be  looking for and when?  </p><p> KING:  It's a great question, and we will get, just as we did in 2016, some  very early clues.  We may not know control of the House until we get to the  West Coast which takes us into the early morning hours.  We may not know  control of the Senate then if the Democrats are surprising us, we could  come down to Nevada and Arizona in the Western time zones, but polls close  early in Kentucky and Ohio.  There is a very competitive House district  just outside of Louisville, Kentucky, the sixth congressional district.   There is a Republican incumbent, Andy Barr in a Republican district that in  a normal year, he should win.  </p><p> He is running against a retired Democratic fighter pilot, military  experience, shot all her ads with a fighter jet just over her shoulder.  If  Amy McGrath is winning in Kentucky's 6th, that tells you the Democrats not  only have a path to get to the House majority, maybe bigger than that.  </p><p> So look at Kentucky first, then you come along the East Coast, there are  some seats in New England, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  We will  know two scenarios.  Are the Democrats doing what they need to do to take  back the House or a Republican successfully blocking them and then when we  start to count the votes in the Florida Senate race, then we'll have a  sense.  Is there any prayer?  Any prayer to what would be the biggest shock  the Democrats taking the Senate, we'll start counting the votes.  It's  going to be a long night.  Espresso tomorrow, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  You know, I have no idea how you keep all those facts in your head  at once.  John, we'll be with you tomorrow night.  Thank you so much, sir.   We appreciate it.  Thank you.  </p><p> KING:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  John has put it into the big picture of the politics.  We need to  put it, as we always do, into what's happening in the markets.  The day  before the midterms and Wall Street has a stake in the election as  investors are waiting, the Dow is nearly at session highs.  It's bouncing  around.  It would not surprise me, bearing in mind that when it's 55  minutes of trading left, we could see just that hold - unlikely, unlikely  that you're just going to see it evaporate in the next 50 minutes.  But, so  I wouldn't put too much on that.  Holding roughly where I would like to is  what seems most reasonable at this point.  </p><p> The Dow is near the sessions high as the tech shares are down, and if you  look at Apple and Amazon - now, Apple and Amazon are big losers at the  moment.  They are on the back of economic news.  </p><p> [15:10:06]  </p><p> QUEST:  President Trump has unleashed what he calls the strongest ever  sanctions on Iran.  A move to re-impose all penalties lifted under the 2015  nuclear deal.  The target in an investment company with links to Iran's  supreme leader.  Some 70 financial institutions, if you look at here, there  are seven investment firms, financial institutions, maritime carriers, oil  transport -- these are the main targets, if you like, of the attack on the  sanctions.  </p><p> The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is warning the companies to  continue to trade with Iran will pay a heavy price.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MIKE POMPEO, US SECRETARY OF STATE:  It should be noted that if a country  evades our sanctions regime and secretly continues sanctionable commerce in  the Islamic Republic, the United States will levy severe swift penalties on  it, including potential sanctions.  I promise you that doing business with  Iran and defying some of our sanctions will ultimately be a much more  painful business decision than pulling out of Iran.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran, joins me now.  So the full weight of  sanctions back on, at least from the US and as you're aware, other nations  and companies being forced along.  When would we expect to see the first  effect in Tehran?  </p><p> FREDERIK PLEITGEN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, I think  some of the effects have already been felt over the past couple of months,  Richard.  You already had a first round of sanctions where large companies  have already pulled out.  But this is arguably the much bigger sanctions  weight that could fall on Iran very quickly.  </p><p> So far, what we're seeing is that you do see a lot of politicians here who  are still very defiant in the face of that.  Regular folks who are already  feeling the pinch of it really fear that things could go very, very badly.   It could happen in the not too distant future when a lot of countries stop  eyeing Iranian oil.  A lot have already stopped doing that.  </p><p> The interesting thing from Tehran's perspective is they sort of feel, just  a little bit, Richard, that Washington might have blinked just slightly  giving some of those sanctions waivers where some of the biggest importers  of Iranian oil can actually still do that.  Like for instance, China; like  for instance, Japan and India as well.  </p><p> So the Iranians sort of feeling they might still have a bit of a lifeline  with those countries being able to buy that oil, but certainly, if that's  something that stops, they think they're going to take a very, very big hit  here and all of the talk of defiance, we speak to regular folks, they are  saying, they are already feeling the pinch and they do think that it could  get a lot worse, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Is there any evidence that a return - excuse me - is there any  evidence that a return to false sanctions would strengthen any seedling  opposition within Iran against the government?  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  So far it's a very, very important question.  So far I don't  think that there's any evidence of that whatsoever.  One of the things that  you saw earlier this year is that there were some protests here in Iran  against the economic situation.  We have to keep in mind that it's not only  the sanctions that are strangling Iran's economy.  There is a lot of  economic mismanagement, there is a lot of corruption, there is price hikes  as well.  There is a lot of things that people are unhappy with.  </p><p> If you look at the situation now that these new sanctions have been put  into place that really isn't the case anymore.  So the President, Hassan  Rouhani, he was under a lot of fire a couple of months ago for putting the  nuclear agreement into play.  He was taking a lot of heat from the  hardliners, that's no longer the case either.  </p><p> It seems that a lot of that anger is now being channeled towards President  Trump, towards the US administration, and many people here feel that what's  going on right now in the Islamic public is being induced from the outside,  it is being induced from Washington, DC, so it doesn't seem as though, if  it is, the intention of the Trump administration to weaken the government,  to weaken the clergy and the military here, so far, it doesn't appear as  though, at least from our perspective that that is currently the case  right, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Fred Pleitgen who is in Tehran, thank you.  Now Swift, which is the  international payment system, is not taking any chances and is cutting its  services from some Iranian banks.  Swift is the international standard for  verifying money transfers, which is a posh way of saying it provides a  secure network between more than 10,000 financial institutions around the  world.  If I want to send you money internationally, or more likely,  hopefully, you're sending me money, and then probably, it will go via Swift  and our institutions will have a Swift code that will go backwards and  forwards.  </p><p> Now, this is long before the days of blockchain technology.  Some Iranian  banks are now unable to talk to Swift after the firm blocked them from its  messaging system.  Swift says the decision is regrettable.  John Defterios  is in Abu Dhabi to put this in perspective.  John, the Swift found itself  in an impossible position.  </p><p> On the one hand, the US is saying, you know, \"You do business with Iran and  we will penalize you.\"  On the other hand, the Europeans and others say,  \"If you give in to external pressure on sanctions, we will penalize you.\"  </p><p> [15:15:10]  </p><p> QUEST:  So now what?  </p><p> JOHN DEFTERIOS, EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR, CNN:  Well, Richard, it was not an  easy call for Swift because it's based in Belgium right at the heart of the  European Union, but it's an international player and it will target up to  50 banks going forward here that are on the target list from the United  States.  </p><p> They said it was regrettable as you suggested, but necessary for stability,  so that's the argument they are using, but I think, we should remind our  viewers, Richard, this was supposed to be the round of sanctions that  targeted oil, not financial institutions.  The first round was strong  against Iran, but the second round really targets the financial  institutions here.  </p><p> We have 900 entities, financial banks, insurance companies, the shipping  companies and also the airlines.  Now, we know Russia, China, Turkey, the  European Union were against the US sanctions, so that how do they work  around the US Federal Reserve and US Treasury is a key question.  </p><p> President Rouhani of Iran said he looks forward to breaking the sanctions.   That's very bold as Fred was suggesting here, but it will be hard times for  the Iranians going forward.  I was looking at a World Bank report, a month  ago, before we saw the full weight of these financial sanctions, and they  were projecting a decline of 4% - a recession of 4% in 2019, inflation of  30%, Richard, and again, this is where it is today.  It could come under  further pressure of the Swift banking sanctions that you were talking  about.  </p><p> QUEST:  If you look at oil, the movements we've seen in oil in the past few  days, there has been quite a sizeable drop in that price on the back of  what?  </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  Well, you know, this is very fascinating to me, because  remember, Donald Trump was saying in the summer, we're going to take Iran  down to zero when it comes to exports and this is where the midterm reality  settled in.  This is a chart looking back just a month, Richard, and when  North Sea Brent hit $86.00 a barrel, Donald Trump hit Twitter and was  calling out for more crude.  </p><p>Saudi Arabia responded.  The UAE where I am sitting responded, Kuwait even  Russia.  We saw that price go from $86.00 a barrel down to $73.00.  </p><p> But that's not the only factor, Richard.  Iran's production has been  dropping, but it's not collapsing just yet.  Let's take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> IMAN NASSERI, MIDDLE EAST MANAGING DIRECTOR, FGE:  We drew an expected   part of Iran's exports falling to less than a million barrels per day by  first quarter next year and around 700,000 to 800,000 a day by middle of  next year.  So far, it has come along that path.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  So Richard, we're at 1.5 million barrels a day.  Now, the Facts  Global Energy is suggesting we get to 700,000 to 800,000 barrels.  Let's  bring up, Richard, the eight exemptions that were made here.  I was  surprised over the fact, the Italian and the Greeks got the exemptions as  members of the European Union, which have been fighting against Donald  Trump.  China, Turkey and India never were going to go along.  So it's  almost like legalizing, Richard the ability for them to continue to import  Iranian crude and as Fred said, the big Asian importers are in there as  well.  </p><p> This by the way, Richard is proof to the fact, you can't replace Iranian  crude that easily.  They were exporting 2.8 million barrels a day back in  June.  Donald Trump admitted he didn't want to see the price go higher  right now.  </p><p> QUEST:  John Defterios, thank you.  Now, Britain and the European Union are  rallying against America's hash new sanctions on Tehran.  I'll discuss with  the former British Finance Minister, Lord Norman Lamont after the break.  </p><p> And Amazon's headlines are coming thick and fast today.  Accusations of  anti-trust violations in the White House, a Saudi boycott and new clues  around 8Q2.  </p><p> [15:15:0]  </p><p> QUEST:  The European Union is staunchly opposed to the US sanctions on  Iran, saying it will try to protect European companies doing legitimate  business with Tehran.  Joining me now to discuss this is Lord Lamont,  Chairman of the British Iranian Chamber of Commerce, and of course Prime  Minister's trade envoy to Iran, and Lord Lamont, the situation now is just  about you're damned if your company is doing business - you're damned if  you do and you're damned if you don't.  It's who you want to be sanctioned  by or fall out of favor with the Europeans or the Americans.  </p><p> LORD NORMAN LAMONT, CHAIRMAN, BRITISH IRANIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  Well,  that's got a fair amount of force behind it.  There are companies that  trade both with Iran and the US.  They will have to choose.  Many will  choose to trade with America - that is inevitable, but there are other  companies that trade only with Iran or for whom Iran is the more important  market.  </p><p> And the object of European policy is to protect them from the secondary  sanctions, the banking sanctions, that even when the nuclear deal was in  force, were inhibiting European companies from trading with Iran, because  they feared that the banks, their bank, which might deal with an American  bank, wouldn't finance their trade with Iran.  So this is trying to protect  the European banking system from American banking, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  But the moment a dollar becomes involved ...  </p><p> LAMONT:  Yes.  </p><p> QUEST:  The moment and never mind anything as complicated or as exotic as  dollar clearing, then you're into a different ball game, aren't you?   Because then the Treasury and the whole weight of this could be against  you.  </p><p> LAMONT:  You know, that's right.  Do business with America, have dealings  in dollars, employ American personnel, have any American content in your  product.  You have got to be very, very careful, obviously.  </p><p> QUEST:  Are you disappointed at the way in which Europe and the UK and  other countries, that they've not stood up to the US in this sense.   They've said, \"Okay, you go off with your sanctions, you withdraw from the  agreement,\" but they don't seem to protect it.  </p><p> LAMONT:  Well, it's not an easy problem to solve because of the combined  effect of trade, the effect of globalization, but the special purpose  vehicle that the EU is working on, that will take time to get going and in  the instance, that will essentially be a netting mechanism allowing  companies with debts and obligations to Iran to swap liabilities with each  other.  </p><p> But eventually the SPV is designed or intended to get a banking license and  process transactions themselves.  </p><p> QUEST:  But it is allowing an extra territorial aspect to US legislation.   I mean, even the right to - or as one reads - exemptions for this country  to trade for oil in this country, I mean, the argument is there because who  is the US to tell Japan that it can't buy oil from Iran?  </p><p> LAMON:  Well, I totally agree with you.  I think the American policy is  unreasonable.  I think the United States has an obsessions with Iran that  is not justified by the facts.  I think they're obsessed with still with  the hostage crisis.  They are influenced by Saudi Arabia, and we know when  it comes to which the worst regime, Iran or Saudi Arabia, Western policy is  not even handed.  It's do with selling armaments to Saudi Arabia, it's to  do a bit with Israel, but I don't think we've got a balance policy from  America towards Iran and Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> [15:25:00]  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you think that policy has become even more unbalanced?  I mean,  there's always a degree of an imbalance.  I mean, there is always a degree  of an imbalance on hypocrisy when putting foreign policy to work with some  of these countries.  But it seems to have become more egregious is what you  seem to be saying.  </p><p> LAMONT:  Well, I think what's happened here - I mean, frankly, Mr. Trump is  not telling the facts when he says Iran is breaking the agreement.  Iran is  fully compliant with the agreement and expert opinion from the  International Atomic Energy Agency says so.  I think the main reason in  Trump's mind, for having these sanctions, is because the nuclear deal was  done by Obama.  It was done by Obama, and therefore, he is against it.  </p><p> QUEST:  Let's turn very briefly if we may to the issue of Saudi Arabia  because you're obviously extremely involved in business.  But in terms of  government, you will have been party to Cabinets with negotiations with the  Saudis were involved for armaments.  Do you think it is time to get back to  business or something approaching business is normal, or do you think that  the West should hold armament sales up against the Crown Prince and the  Saudi government?  </p><p> LAMONT:  Well, the West including Britain is so deeply involved in armament  sales to Saudi Arabia.  I don't see that being reversed, but I think we  ought to aim for more diversified policy in arm sales, and I think above  all, we need more balanced approach.  </p><p> I mean, we've seen how the Saudis have been very economical with the truth  when it came to Mr. Khashoggi.  Are we going to trust them with everything  to do with the Yemen War that we're told by them.  </p><p> I think we ought to be a little bit more even handed.  I am not saying that  Iran is a desirable regime.  But I think we ought to be more balanced.  </p><p> QUEST:  But is it time to - is it time to start doing more business back  with Saudi Arabia?  Back to normal is what I am suggesting after the  Khashoggi ...  </p><p> LAMONT:  I think the West world to insist on getting a proper explanation  of what has happened and being sure that the people who are held  responsible for that are the people who really were responsible.  </p><p> QUEST:  Very good to have you, sir.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p> LAMONT:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  We didn't even get on to the midterms, that's next time.  The US  House of Representatives will stay red or it will turn blue, and that will  cause the US markets to turn red or indeed green - it depends on the  election, one way or another.  It is a good day.  We're off the highs of  the day by some - but that is up 170 on the Dow.  </p><p> [15:30:00]  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [15:30:00]  RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello, I'm Richard  Quest, there's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment.  When you will  hear from Sir Tim Berners-Lee; the father of the world wide web who wants  to make the internet a better place.</p><p>Amazon is warning potential hosts for its second headquarters.  Don't spoil  a surprise, as you and I continue tonight, this is Cnn, and on this  network, the facts always come first.  President Trump says there is great  electricity in the air on the eve of the high stakes midterm elections. </p><p> He's headlining three rallies -- key rallies in the states today, stumping  for Republican candidates.  Democrats hope a blue wave will help them  regain control of at least one house of Congress. </p><p>Indonesian diving teams have now identified 27 bodies from the Lion Air  flight that crashed last week killing 189 in all.  Officials are working  with Boeing to warn all carries but the risk of air speed indicator  malfunctions on the 727 MAX 8.  The Lion Air jet was found to have that  malfunction during its last four flights. </p><p> The sons of the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi are issuing an  emotional appeal for the return of their father's remains so he may be  buried.  The spoke exclusively to Cnn in their first public remarks since  their father's murder last month.  Khashoggi's eldest son says he has faith  in the Saudi-run investigation into his father's killing. </p><p>SoftBank says it will not sever financial ties to Saudi Arabia after the  killing of the journalist.  Chief Executive Masayoshi Son expressed strong  regret over Khashoggi's death, and says he won't take any new Saudi money  until the truth is known. </p><p> The U.S. political system, Tuesday is a big day.  For investors, it's a  week of big events.  Political shifts in the U.S. know they will certainly  hit the market.  The dollar, FANG stocks and emerging markets all likely to  face disruption as a result of events.  Now, the Fed will reveal its  interest rates decision on Thursday. </p><p> Policymakers have been facing pressure to soften their hawkish views, and  all week corporate earnings galore.  Some market watchers are concerned  profits have peaked.  Ben Phillips is watching it all, the Chief Investment  Officer at EventShares.  Of the events you are watching at the moment, Ben,  what are you most concerned? What are you watching particularly carefully?  </p><p> BEN PHILLIPS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, EVENTSHARES:  Well, so I think  everyone is focused on midterms this week, but we're worried about what's  going on after midterms.  So regardless of the outcome of midterms, we're  looking at Trump's policy towards global trade.</p><p> We think how he responds to China after midterms after some of this  campaigning we've seen really over the past few weeks, that's our biggest  concern is that global trade breaks down and supply chains are disrupted  because of trade policy.  </p><p> QUEST:  But I see where you're coming from, but haven't you neatly jumped  the hurdle of the midterms? Because the result tomorrow will factor in, you  know, becomes a sine qua non of all those other events.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Well, look, I mean, we're positioning our portfolio adventure as  the PLCY portfolio in things that really are going to continue regardless  of the outcome.  So financial deregulation, it's out of Congress' hands,  it's now in the agency, the Fed, the OCC, the CFPB. </p><p> You look at education deregulation, that's in the department of ED's hands.   So if we go down the list and see what's actually occurring, it looks like  regardless of the outcome, we're going to have, you know, some policy  catalyst that continue.  So deregulation, healthcare spending driven by  Obamacare, you know, those sorts of things. </p><p> Defense spending, want to stay elevated, our view.  So those are the types  of things we're watching and those are the type of things we're positioning  our portfolio on.  </p><p> QUEST:  In the event of a gridlock with the house going to the Democrats,  does the situation change? Does it get worse for investors or arguably, it  gets a great deal better because if Washington can't do anything, then  investors are free and the market is free to make its own direction.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes, I actually think that's right.  I think we'll see some more  noise potentially, maybe some more hearings and things like that.  I  haven't heard Democrats mention the impeachment word yet again with a split  Congress not even worth really taking that off the ground -- </p><p> [15:35:00]  QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Unless there's some really incriminating new evidence that comes  out.  But so, yes, I think what happens in a split Congress is less and  less is more for the market.  There's a whole congressional effect study  out there that says when Congress isn't doing anything, markets are happy. </p><p> So it's just as soon as we remove this uncertainty of midterms, then we  have certainty of what the outcome is within a week depending on California  races obviously if there's some delay there.  But so we'll get some clarity  here within the next week and see which direction Congress is going. </p><p> QUEST:  Right, quick-fire questions, Ben.  Volatility, more of it in the  midterm or less?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  More in the midterm because of trade.  </p><p> QUEST:  Turning to the question of interest rates.  Another one in  December, and what after that?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  It's going to be, again, the trade can really disrupt the growth  thesis of the U.S.  So I think if the Fed sees slower growth because of the  trade, they might delay their actions and hiking rates further, '19.   </p><p> QUEST:  Diversification and rotation, we've seen it out of tech into  defensive, does that continue, is it overdone? When does the tech come  back?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  I think it continues.  Tech really has had all this momentum  factor built up into it.  Now you're seeing people rotate more  structurally, longer term out of that momentum factor.  So what we're  seeing is more and more investors doing that, it's really just started. </p><p> So if people say, we're at the top of the cycle here, it's going to start - - this rotation continues in our view.  So I would be wary of tech and the  regulation of tech in big data regulation.    </p><p> QUEST:  Finally, tech and tech.  Does tech like Amazon which buys and sells  things on Netflix which delivers movies and has subscription basis, and  then there's tech like Facebook, obviously Twitter and Snap, we can sort of  leave somewhere in the doldrums down at the bottom.  But is there a  difference, as you say, the rotation out of tech?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  There is, but you know, we think the whole ecosystem is  affected.  But where we're most cautious is around those social media  names, the ones who have been data aggregators in our view, collecting  everyone's consumer data and then using it and selling it.  They're the  ones at biggest risk.  But China trade, we think hardware and the semi- conductors and really that whole supply chain is so integrated with China  that they're at risk too.</p><p> So we're broadly avoiding tech other than our 5G telecom exposure in PLCY. </p><p> QUEST:  Ben, do me a favor, make me a promise, you'll come back and help us  understand more in the future.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Absolutely, happy any time, thanks Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Excellent, new member of the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS family.  Help  give us the sort of information that we can all use and understand and put  into the wider context.  As we continue tonight from London, he created the  web in 1989 and now he's trying to keep it on track.  We'll hear from the  computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, and I'm talking tech and question of  the day.</p><p> I got off the word tech, it's technology.  Get your phones ready for a  question on technology -- where's my phone, it's here somewhere after the  break.  And get ready to head to cnn.com-slash-join.       </p><p> [15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  All right, I assume you have one of these devices, if not, where  have you been? Time for you to take your device and go to cnn.com-slash- join as we -- and join our question of the day.  Sir Tim Berners-Lee; now  he is the father of the internet, says he trusts the world's biggest tech  companies to take care of your data. </p><p> As the man who created the www, he told \"Reuters\" earlier in the week that  some big tech companies could one day have to be broken up.  You'll hear  Sir Tim in just a moment.  And whiles you think about all of that, is it  time for the big tech companies to be broken up? </p><p> Are they now the monopolies of yester-year but tomorrow? And I assume by  that, we'll let you define big tech, whether we're talking about an Amazon  or whichever sort of Facebook, I'm not sure how you break that one up.  Go  to cnn.com-slash-join now.  Voting is open and you'll see the results  update live on the screen. </p><p> I suppose Google is a good example, Alphabet would be another one.  Amazon  shares while you're voting, Amazon shares are taking a beating today  absolutely, down 2.5 percent or $41, there is the price.  It's not off the  lows of the week, but it is certainly down. </p><p> Investors are being scared off by threats from Donald Trump who is claiming  Amazon and other tech giants may have violated anti-trust laws.  And the  president says his administration is looking into the claims, but isn't  taking  action just yet.  Now, if that were alone, that would be bad enough  to push down the price, but it is not. </p><p> It's not the only thing weighing on the Amazon share price.  Remember,  cnn.com-slash-join.  Now, some customers are also looking to boycott.  The  customers in Saudi Arabia are boycotting the company, taking aim at the  Jeff Bezos and CEO who also owns the \"Washington Post\". </p><p> It's all over the outrage over how the post has covered the killing of one  of its journalists Jamal Khashoggi.  The thing has been pointed firmly at  the Saudi leadership.  So boycott Amazon is trending on Saudi social media.   Meanwhile, the company announced a new incentive to draw in new prime  members on the holiday season. </p><p> It's a free-shipping offer.  Now, if you're a prime member, you already get  free shipping.  It's reserved for paid subscribers.  Now all U.S. customers  will get it with no minimum purchase -- oh, and one other thing you do get,  though, they'll increase the number of things they get free same day  delivery. </p><p> So two developments -- if that wasn't enough, an article in the Bezos home  post is writing new clues about which city Amazon is going to or may choose  to HQ2.  Crystal City, Virginia, has become a frontrunner.  The \"Post\" is  claiming citing people close to the process.  By the way, Amazon said those  who know don't speak and those who speak don't know, and they've also  advised any city who is in the running to best keep stump in case this  suddenly find the knot.</p><p> A lot of Amazon news one way or the other.  Clare Sebastian puts it all  together for us.  Clare, taking all of these developments and the fact that  the share price is down some 2.5 percent today.  What is the driving factor  against that share price?  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, I think it's a combination of  factors, but I think the main one is these regulation comments by Donald  Trump.  Clearly, whether or not he intends to act imminently, he is still  obsessed with this company.  We've seen him through the past few months  talking about, you know, the exploitation of the postal service, the Bezos- Amazon \"Washington Post\" as he's called it, and he's had this company in  his sights. </p><p> And this is really the one thing that investors feel could interrupt the  growth of this company is some kind of regulation to break it up.  So I  think that is what is driving this share.  But don't forget, it comes after  a brutal month.  Amazon has lost about 20 percent of its values since its  peak in September.  </p><p> So there's jitters with that already.  This is just playing into it.</p><p> QUEST:  If the view and there was something of a view that Amazon was  overpriced, that may have been settled by a 20 cent correction.  But you  know, at the end of the day, Clare, I don't hear anybody suggesting that  Amazon is going to start losing customers or that in some way its business  from Amazon cloud services, Amazon web services through to the toilet paper  it will deliver to me in New York.</p><p> [15:45:00]  That it's in any way waning, it's getting bigger.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely, this is where we are in retail, the bigger -- are  getting bigger.  And in particular, Amazon, it's interesting to look at the  free shipping offer that they put out today and the context of that,  Richard, because that is one of the reasons why they can do that is because  they have the higher margin part of the business which is AWS, Amazon's web  services, the cloud and also the burgeoning advertising business because of  all the data they've got from their core retail business. </p><p> They can use those to funnel money into the lower margin -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Retail business, and that is why they can pay for these things  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Clare -- </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Like free shipping.  </p><p> QUEST:  Clare, forgive me for interrupting.  I just want to ask you very  quickly and briefly, are you surprised the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS viewer,  wise and wary of world, although they are, 71 percent says big tech  companies should be broken up, only 29 percent say no.  I'm surprised on  that, are you?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  I would say a little surprised, you know, these companies are  you know, ubiquitous to society.  I think the same people who voted the 70  percent who want to break them up are probably also Amazon users and are  relishing -- </p><p> QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  The lower prices and the free shipping that they're offering.   But I think the drumbeat around these companies, Richard, be it Amazon, be  it Facebook, be it Google has got a lot of people worried and they're  starting to take a second look here.  </p><p> QUEST:  Clare Sebastian, thank you.  The founder of the world wide web Tim  Berners-Lee is calling on governments, companies and individuals to back up  contracts for the web.  That contract he says would help protect people's  rights and freedoms on the internet.  Cnn's Laurie Segall asked him if we  can really trust tech companies to build that product in a safe and  trustworthy manner.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TIM BERNERS-LEE, FOUNDER, WORLD WIDE WEB:  I think because of things like  the data transfer project in which these four companies said you have the  right --you would be able to physically get your data from one of one  others and put it into the other or get -- then I think that for me is  saying, yes, actually they get it as a point and they're prepared to put  the work in.</p><p> So yes, I think that they will.  Yes, I think will have enough people who  are building in home devices that talk to me about their excitement.  We  have to solid put it, we should ask people to have their own data pods.   They've said OK, what would be good would be -- we can -- why don't we  actually put all these data in your data pods?</p><p> I think and there's a lot of excitement around that about -- and realizing  -- people realizing that if they give you data -- control over on your data  that they're generating value for you.  And a lot of companies are finding  it so exciting to be able to switch from trying to exploit you, trying to  make you buy something that you didn't want to buy to actually switch back  to the core business model of helping the user, generating data for the  user.</p><p> LAURIE SEGALL, CNN:  Can they do that and still make a profit? I mean,  could they do that and not sacrifice their billion-dollar business models?  </p><p> BERNERS-LEE:  You know, all these plugs you can find about how much if you  join the big social network and you give them all your data and you get  stuff  for free.  How much actually is the value date to all those  insurance companies themselves.  It turns out for example, one blog I  thought -- well, the value to them or if your data is less than you pay for  internet connectivity, anyway. </p><p> So actually if you subscribed to your social network and your feeds and  your data, you could actually replace that funding stream by turning around  and paying for yourself.  And it wouldn't be much, so it's actually -- it  says maybe it's a myth.  </p><p> SEGALL:  I'm going to give you two ideas of privacy, and you tell me which  one you think is right.  So one idea is that we just have to re-envision  privacy.  Privacy to an extent is dead.  Another one is that privacy is a  fundamental human right and we have the right to it.  So where do you stand  when it comes to the future, this current moment and looking at what it  means for us as users in our privacy?  </p><p> BERNERS-LEE:  You don't have to look for other guests, we aren't going to  be.  I am going to be with the far to see(ph) of human right.  I'd be say,  privacy of human rights as all placed in the United Nations have said  privacy is a -- those human rights and as you said, that is the right. </p><p> Web is a human right -- you know, so for me, it's very important that I  have control of my data.  That doesn't mean I'm going to afford it, that  doesn't mean that I won't share it with a company which will help me buy  the best presents for my family.  It means that I'll -- it also -- it means  that I'll be able to share it with my -- the people that I work with, that  will -- and so will be able to work more efficiently, I'll have a lot of  total control over who I share what with. </p><p> So the idea of control or own your own data is not just about sort of me  being my own silo, walking everything away, essentially having the joy of  being able to share it with whoever.  Like the joy, if you could know or  you take a selfie with somebody, you pass in the streets and they give you  a business card, just you know, they immediately share whatever it is with  them immediately just because they're a person, just because they have an  ID.</p><p> [15:50:00]  That whereas, in fact, you would have to go home and find out  which social networks they belong to.  So it's partly because -- you know,  control over data -- over your own data as a human right -- that's mine. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Bad news for Google and Facebook by a margin of 2-1.  Most of you  say big tech companies should be broken up.  Now, well, it's come off its - - the highs of 60s or whatever is -- that could mean separating Facebook  from Whatsapp and Instagram while splitting Google Search from its other  bets. </p><p> I'd say I'm surprised, I wouldn't have thought together would have -- would  go all the way very -- that's where we have it.  There is nothing high tech  about the Indonesian xylophone that I got to try out earlier today.  The  rest of the World Travel Market is getting a lot more digital.  We'll hear  from the tourism minister next on how a professional plays that.   </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  WTM London, 5th to the 7th November, one of the world's biggest  expos for one of the world's largest industries.  You need a stout pair of  shoes and a strong constitution if you're attending the World Travel Market  which began today at ExCeL in London. </p><p> Now, while some offerings are analog, like these Indonesian xylophone -- I  don't think it's properly called the xylophone, but you get the idea sort  of how difficult it is.  How to run somebody else's song.  Most of this  year's focus is on digital tourism, that's everything from targeted ads to  digital destinations including a holiday.</p><p> Everything -- look at the pictures.  Everything is geared not just in  taking the picture, but to putting it on mobile and sharing it with  someone.  If it doesn't look good on Instagram, it's not worth doing.   Indonesia's Tourism Minister told me digital tourism can help him get  millions more visitors.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ARIEF YAHYA, TOURISM MINISTER, INDONESIA:  We are doing all the promotion  using this digital media.  For example, we are using the Google, et cetera  for looking, booking, dot com, et cetera.  Even in China, we are using  Ctrip, et cetera.  </p><p> Seventy percent of our target allocated for digital media.</p><p> [15:55:00]  QUEST:  Do you -- I see also, you know, the use of the digital,  I see the word innovation.  But everybody in this building -- </p><p> YAHYA:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  Is saying the same thing.  </p><p> YAHYA:  Yes.   </p><p> QUEST:  So how are you going to do it better than them?  </p><p> YAHHA:  OK, there are two things actually.  First is, we have digital  destination, it only show you can see it.  We have at least five days here,  we are going to develop 100 digital destinations, and the second, how we  promote it.  We are going to promote our destination using digital media as  I said before. </p><p> QUEST:  Instagram and things like that?  </p><p> YAHYA:  Everything.  Digital -- I mean, this has to be inside a mobile, it  has to be nice in camera.  You see, that's the first criteria for digital  tourism.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Now, I'll have a lot more from the World Travel Market on Friday's  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS where Tourism Ministers from almost every continent.   And we'll take you on a whistle stop tour of the world's tourism as they  make their pitch.  We will have our profitable moment after the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, the midterm elections take place  tomorrow in the United States, and we can pass the results anywhere as  you'll try and understand who will vote, you know, white women from middle  class in northern states or young urban professionals in the Midwest, you  can get it so detailed as you're trying to understand what the voting  trends are and it eventually makes no sense. </p><p> But we will know tomorrow exactly who voted and how, and then we'll have  the problem of how the markets react.  If there is an element of gridlock,  further gridlock than we've already got, a greater divide in America if  that were possible, what does that mean for the markets? </p><p> There is that popular view that says when Washington is gridlocked, the  markets do well.  We'll find out in the next 24 hours because as the voting  and the results come in, we will be here to make sense of it all for you.  </p><p> And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. </p><p> (BELL RINGING) </p><p> The bell -- Avianca, an airline -- the bell is ringing, the Dow is up, the  day is done.    </p><p> END      </p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Goes up throughout the course of the  day, slightly off the best of the day so far, and there is one hour still  to trade on Wall Street.  I'm Richard Quest.  These are the top business -  these are the headlines on CNN.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran is the first as the new sanctions come into play.  The Trump  administration's renewed sanctions on Iran's energy.  US elections and the  questions of the midterm, almost upon us, which will go in different  directions?  And Amazon, is the Trump administration about to try an anti- trust deal or anti-trust attack on Amazon?  Tonight, live from London, this  is \"Quest Means Business.\"  I'm Richard Quest.  Now, let's go.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  It's the final frantic, dramatic push for votes.  Across the  United States, candidates and their supporters are making their closing  arguments.  President Trump is campaigning right now in Cleveland.  It's  been a bitter campaign season and the most expensive midterm election in US  history and this is why.  The entire House is up for grabs, along with 35  Senate seats and 36 state governorships.  </p><p>The decisions voters make will affect everything from the Supreme Court to  regulation.  President Trump's agenda even how and where the electoral  battle lines are drawn.  Bill Clinton's strategist famously said, \"It's the  economy, stupid.\"  But when it comes to economic developments, there's  plenty to campaign on.  </p><p>So first of all, you've got surging growth, raging trade wars and growing  deficits.  To voters, the importance of the economy hasn't changed much  since the last midterm elections four years ago.  Forty four percent of  registered voters polled nationally say the economy is extremely important  to their vote.  That's down 12 percentage points in the height of the  crisis in 2009-2010.  Even President Trump doesn't seem too eager to talk  about the economy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They all say, speak about  the economy, speak about the economy.  Well, we have the greatest economy  in the history of our country, but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk  about the economy, right?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Since John King is tracking the races and the issues as seen from  Washington.  If there's one man who is absolutely under the hood of the  suffology in this midterm elections, John, it is you.  So get out the  crystal ball and have a fiddle around try to mix the metaphors beautifully,  what are you seeing in the last 24 hours before?  </p><p>JOHN KING, CHIEF US CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  In the last 24 hours, we're seeing  some evidence of a break toward the Democrats.  This is very complicated  because for the House of Representatives, the terrain does favor the  Democrats.  They need to pick up 23 seats in the United States House of  Representatives.  They have a clear path, Richard, to at least 25, some  Democrats think even 35.  </p><p>So the Democrats actually have no excuses if they don't take back the House  and the late polling numbers suggest things are breaking their way.  The  Senate is much more complicated by the Senate races on the ballot this  year, many of them were in states President Trump carried big.  Many of  them compare - let me put it this way, a lot of these competitive House  districts, they're close to the suburbs, they're in suburban areas.  That's  where the President is incredibly weak.  </p><p>The Senate races, bigger states with smaller towns and more rural areas.   That's where the President is strong.  Democrats look to make gains in the  House.  They look to make a lot of gains at the state level, races for  governor and state legislature.  The Senate, the day before the election,  more of a toss-up where the Republicans are favored to hold their majority,  maybe even add a seat or two, but there is some late hope for the  Democrats.  They do see some evidence of a possible late break that might  let them not only hold their Senate seats, but maybe surprise us.  We'll  count them tomorrow.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is it - for everybody I've been talking to, is it possible or  likely that the last election repeats itself?  And that President Trump,  well of course, it's possible, but is it probable I should really say or at  what level of possibility that he actually does much better than expected  and out of nowhere the red wave or little trickle does become much  stronger?  </p><p>KING:  I rule out nothing.  Based on our 2016 experience and based on our  recent American political experience, not just the Trump win in 2016.   Eight years before that, America elected its first African-American  President.  </p><p>[15:05:04]  </p><p>KING:  A lot of people thought that couldn't happen.  So, there's no doubt  volatility and unpredictability in the climate.  I will tell you this  though, Richard, as for a total Republican surprise, meaning the  Republicans hold the House, even the President himself doesn't seem to  believe that.  </p><p>Over the weekend, he conceded the Republicans are likely to lose the House.   Just today, he said with zero evidence, this is a farce and a fraud, but  the President said he sees all this evidence already of illegal immigrants  illegally voting in the US midterm election.  Remember, that's the same  excuse he used for why he said Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016  even though he won the Electoral College.  </p><p>So the Republicans will suffer some pain tomorrow, all Republicans agree on  that.  Though you raise a great question about how big, how much do we  trust the polling?  Which wasn't perfect in 2016 because the climate is so  different when you look at the House and then the Senate.  </p><p>And to your point about the economy, if this President - if this is a  referendum on Trump at the midterm about his achievements, wow, right?   Maybe you don't like the tax cuts, maybe you don't know how the US pays for  them in the long run, but the economy is gangbusters, but is it more a  referendum on the Trump tone, about tweets not tax cuts.  If it's about  tweets and tone, the President is going to have a shellacking tomorrow.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, so define for me as best one can what would be seen as a  disaster for or a verdict of total disaster for the President?  And  similarly, one would be saying, actually, he did really well.  How will we  judge tomorrow's results?  </p><p>KING:  If by any way Republicans hold the House and the Senate, that's a  huge victory for the President.  No way to sugar coat that for the  Democrats.  If the Republicans can somehow hold the House, that means limit  the Democrats to picking up 22 or fewer seats, you would have a very narrow  Republican majority, but if you still have a Republican majority come  January, this is a victory for the President and his party, if they can  hold the House and the Senate.  </p><p>Again, the President is going to try to spin this.  If he loses the House  and wins the Senate, he's going to say his campaigning in the Senate states  in the last days is what saved the Senate.  He'll take credit for that.  </p><p>I'll give you a longer range perspective though, Richard.  We focus a lot  on Washington, who controls the House?  Who controls the Senate?  These  races for governor, down ballot races for state legislature are critical  across America.  That is where Democrats were punished in the Obama years.  </p><p>First they lost the House in 2010, then they lost the Senate in 2014.   Republicans now have 33 governors, 1,000 state legislative seats in the  Obama years switched from Democrat to Republican.  Do Democrats tomorrow  start the rebuilding effort?  If that's the case, then we'll talk a lot  about the next two years of the Trump presidency, but the Democrats need to  plant the seeds of a revival because they frankly, they've had a terrible  decade.  </p><p>QUEST:  John, we'll let you go in just a second, but after - talk me  through tomorrow night and obviously once you get on air.  What should I be  looking for and when?  </p><p>KING:  It's a great question, and we will get, just as we did in 2016, some  very early clues.  We may not know control of the House until we get to the  West Coast which takes us into the early morning hours.  We may not know  control of the Senate then if the Democrats are surprising us, we could  come down to Nevada and Arizona in the Western time zones, but polls close  early in Kentucky and Ohio.  There is a very competitive House district  just outside of Louisville, Kentucky, the sixth congressional district.   There is a Republican incumbent, Andy Barr in a Republican district that in  a normal year, he should win.  </p><p>He is running against a retired Democratic fighter pilot, military  experience, shot all her ads with a fighter jet just over her shoulder.  If  Amy McGrath is winning in Kentucky's 6th, that tells you the Democrats not  only have a path to get to the House majority, maybe bigger than that.  </p><p>So look at Kentucky first, then you come along the East Coast, there are  some seats in New England, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  We will  know two scenarios.  Are the Democrats doing what they need to do to take  back the House or a Republican successfully blocking them and then when we  start to count the votes in the Florida Senate race, then we'll have a  sense.  Is there any prayer?  Any prayer to what would be the biggest shock  the Democrats taking the Senate, we'll start counting the votes.  It's  going to be a long night.  Espresso tomorrow, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  You know, I have no idea how you keep all those facts in your head  at once.  John, we'll be with you tomorrow night.  Thank you so much, sir.   We appreciate it.  Thank you.  </p><p>KING:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  John has put it into the big picture of the politics.  We need to  put it, as we always do, into what's happening in the markets.  The day  before the midterms and Wall Street has a stake in the election as  investors are waiting, the Dow is nearly at session highs.  It's bouncing  around.  It would not surprise me, bearing in mind that when it's 55  minutes of trading left, we could see just that hold - unlikely, unlikely  that you're just going to see it evaporate in the next 50 minutes.  But, so  I wouldn't put too much on that.  Holding roughly where I would like to is  what seems most reasonable at this point.  </p><p>The Dow is near the sessions high as the tech shares are down, and if you  look at Apple and Amazon - now, Apple and Amazon are big losers at the  moment.  They are on the back of economic news.  </p><p>[15:10:06]  </p><p>QUEST:  President Trump has unleashed what he calls the strongest ever  sanctions on Iran.  A move to re-impose all penalties lifted under the 2015  nuclear deal.  The target in an investment company with links to Iran's  supreme leader.  Some 70 financial institutions, if you look at here, there  are seven investment firms, financial institutions, maritime carriers, oil  transport -- these are the main targets, if you like, of the attack on the  sanctions.  </p><p>The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is warning the companies to  continue to trade with Iran will pay a heavy price.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, US SECRETARY OF STATE:  It should be noted that if a country  evades our sanctions regime and secretly continues sanctionable commerce in  the Islamic Republic, the United States will levy severe swift penalties on  it, including potential sanctions.  I promise you that doing business with  Iran and defying some of our sanctions will ultimately be a much more  painful business decision than pulling out of Iran.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran, joins me now.  So the full weight of  sanctions back on, at least from the US and as you're aware, other nations  and companies being forced along.  When would we expect to see the first  effect in Tehran?  </p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, I think  some of the effects have already been felt over the past couple of months,  Richard.  You already had a first round of sanctions where large companies  have already pulled out.  But this is arguably the much bigger sanctions  weight that could fall on Iran very quickly.  </p><p>So far, what we're seeing is that you do see a lot of politicians here who  are still very defiant in the face of that.  Regular folks who are already  feeling the pinch of it really fear that things could go very, very badly.   It could happen in the not too distant future when a lot of countries stop  eyeing Iranian oil.  A lot have already stopped doing that.  </p><p>The interesting thing from Tehran's perspective is they sort of feel, just  a little bit, Richard, that Washington might have blinked just slightly  giving some of those sanctions waivers where some of the biggest importers  of Iranian oil can actually still do that.  Like for instance, China; like  for instance, Japan and India as well.  </p><p>So the Iranians sort of feeling they might still have a bit of a lifeline  with those countries being able to buy that oil, but certainly, if that's  something that stops, they think they're going to take a very, very big hit  here and all of the talk of defiance, we speak to regular folks, they are  saying, they are already feeling the pinch and they do think that it could  get a lot worse, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is there any evidence that a return - excuse me - is there any  evidence that a return to false sanctions would strengthen any seedling  opposition within Iran against the government?  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  So far it's a very, very important question.  So far I don't  think that there's any evidence of that whatsoever.  One of the things that  you saw earlier this year is that there were some protests here in Iran  against the economic situation.  We have to keep in mind that it's not only  the sanctions that are strangling Iran's economy.  There is a lot of  economic mismanagement, there is a lot of corruption, there is price hikes  as well.  There is a lot of things that people are unhappy with.  </p><p>If you look at the situation now that these new sanctions have been put  into place that really isn't the case anymore.  So the President, Hassan  Rouhani, he was under a lot of fire a couple of months ago for putting the  nuclear agreement into play.  He was taking a lot of heat from the  hardliners, that's no longer the case either.  </p><p>It seems that a lot of that anger is now being channeled towards President  Trump, towards the US administration, and many people here feel that what's  going on right now in the Islamic public is being induced from the outside,  it is being induced from Washington, DC, so it doesn't seem as though, if  it is, the intention of the Trump administration to weaken the government,  to weaken the clergy and the military here, so far, it doesn't appear as  though, at least from our perspective that that is currently the case  right, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Fred Pleitgen who is in Tehran, thank you.  Now Swift, which is the  international payment system, is not taking any chances and is cutting its  services from some Iranian banks.  Swift is the international standard for  verifying money transfers, which is a posh way of saying it provides a  secure network between more than 10,000 financial institutions around the  world.  If I want to send you money internationally, or more likely,  hopefully, you're sending me money, and then probably, it will go via Swift  and our institutions will have a Swift code that will go backwards and  forwards.  </p><p>Now, this is long before the days of blockchain technology.  Some Iranian  banks are now unable to talk to Swift after the firm blocked them from its  messaging system.  Swift says the decision is regrettable.  John Defterios  is in Abu Dhabi to put this in perspective.  John, the Swift found itself  in an impossible position.  </p><p>On the one hand, the US is saying, you know, \"You do business with Iran and  we will penalize you.\"  On the other hand, the Europeans and others say,  \"If you give in to external pressure on sanctions, we will penalize you.\"  </p><p>[15:15:10]  </p><p>QUEST:  So now what?  </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR, CNN:  Well, Richard, it was not an  easy call for Swift because it's based in Belgium right at the heart of the  European Union, but it's an international player and it will target up to  50 banks going forward here that are on the target list from the United  States.  </p><p>They said it was regrettable as you suggested, but necessary for stability,  so that's the argument they are using, but I think, we should remind our  viewers, Richard, this was supposed to be the round of sanctions that  targeted oil, not financial institutions.  The first round was strong  against Iran, but the second round really targets the financial  institutions here.  </p><p>We have 900 entities, financial banks, insurance companies, the shipping  companies and also the airlines.  Now, we know Russia, China, Turkey, the  European Union were against the US sanctions, so that how do they work  around the US Federal Reserve and US Treasury is a key question.  </p><p>President Rouhani of Iran said he looks forward to breaking the sanctions.   That's very bold as Fred was suggesting here, but it will be hard times for  the Iranians going forward.  I was looking at a World Bank report, a month  ago, before we saw the full weight of these financial sanctions, and they  were projecting a decline of 4% - a recession of 4% in 2019, inflation of  30%, Richard, and again, this is where it is today.  It could come under  further pressure of the Swift banking sanctions that you were talking  about.  </p><p>QUEST:  If you look at oil, the movements we've seen in oil in the past few  days, there has been quite a sizeable drop in that price on the back of  what?  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, you know, this is very fascinating to me, because  remember, Donald Trump was saying in the summer, we're going to take Iran  down to zero when it comes to exports and this is where the midterm reality  settled in.  This is a chart looking back just a month, Richard, and when  North Sea Brent hit $86.00 a barrel, Donald Trump hit Twitter and was  calling out for more crude.  </p><p>Saudi Arabia responded.  The UAE where I am sitting responded, Kuwait even  Russia.  We saw that price go from $86.00 a barrel down to $73.00.  </p><p>But that's not the only factor, Richard.  Iran's production has been  dropping, but it's not collapsing just yet.  Let's take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>IMAN NASSERI, MIDDLE EAST MANAGING DIRECTOR, FGE:  We drew an expected   part of Iran's exports falling to less than a million barrels per day by  first quarter next year and around 700,000 to 800,000 a day by middle of  next year.  So far, it has come along that path.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  So Richard, we're at 1.5 million barrels a day.  Now, the Facts  Global Energy is suggesting we get to 700,000 to 800,000 barrels.  Let's  bring up, Richard, the eight exemptions that were made here.  I was  surprised over the fact, the Italian and the Greeks got the exemptions as  members of the European Union, which have been fighting against Donald  Trump.  China, Turkey and India never were going to go along.  So it's  almost like legalizing, Richard the ability for them to continue to import  Iranian crude and as Fred said, the big Asian importers are in there as  well.  </p><p>This by the way, Richard is proof to the fact, you can't replace Iranian  crude that easily.  They were exporting 2.8 million barrels a day back in  June.  Donald Trump admitted he didn't want to see the price go higher  right now.  </p><p>QUEST:  John Defterios, thank you.  Now, Britain and the European Union are  rallying against America's hash new sanctions on Tehran.  I'll discuss with  the former British Finance Minister, Lord Norman Lamont after the break.  </p><p>And Amazon's headlines are coming thick and fast today.  Accusations of  anti-trust violations in the White House, a Saudi boycott and new clues  around 8Q2.  </p><p>[15:15:0]  </p><p>QUEST:  The European Union is staunchly opposed to the US sanctions on  Iran, saying it will try to protect European companies doing legitimate  business with Tehran.  Joining me now to discuss this is Lord Lamont,  Chairman of the British Iranian Chamber of Commerce, and of course Prime  Minister's trade envoy to Iran, and Lord Lamont, the situation now is just  about you're damned if your company is doing business - you're damned if  you do and you're damned if you don't.  It's who you want to be sanctioned  by or fall out of favor with the Europeans or the Americans.  </p><p>LORD NORMAN LAMONT, CHAIRMAN, BRITISH IRANIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  Well,  that's got a fair amount of force behind it.  There are companies that  trade both with Iran and the US.  They will have to choose.  Many will  choose to trade with America - that is inevitable, but there are other  companies that trade only with Iran or for whom Iran is the more important  market.  </p><p>And the object of European policy is to protect them from the secondary  sanctions, the banking sanctions, that even when the nuclear deal was in  force, were inhibiting European companies from trading with Iran, because  they feared that the banks, their bank, which might deal with an American  bank, wouldn't finance their trade with Iran.  So this is trying to protect  the European banking system from American banking, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  But the moment a dollar becomes involved ...  </p><p>LAMONT:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  The moment and never mind anything as complicated or as exotic as  dollar clearing, then you're into a different ball game, aren't you?   Because then the Treasury and the whole weight of this could be against  you.  </p><p>LAMONT:  You know, that's right.  Do business with America, have dealings  in dollars, employ American personnel, have any American content in your  product.  You have got to be very, very careful, obviously.  </p><p>QUEST:  Are you disappointed at the way in which Europe and the UK and  other countries, that they've not stood up to the US in this sense.   They've said, \"Okay, you go off with your sanctions, you withdraw from the  agreement,\" but they don't seem to protect it.  </p><p>LAMONT:  Well, it's not an easy problem to solve because of the combined  effect of trade, the effect of globalization, but the special purpose  vehicle that the EU is working on, that will take time to get going and in  the instance, that will essentially be a netting mechanism allowing  companies with debts and obligations to Iran to swap liabilities with each  other.  </p><p>But eventually the SPV is designed or intended to get a banking license and  process transactions themselves.  </p><p>QUEST:  But it is allowing an extra territorial aspect to US legislation.   I mean, even the right to - or as one reads - exemptions for this country  to trade for oil in this country, I mean, the argument is there because who  is the US to tell Japan that it can't buy oil from Iran?  </p><p>LAMON:  Well, I totally agree with you.  I think the American policy is  unreasonable.  I think the United States has an obsessions with Iran that  is not justified by the facts.  I think they're obsessed with still with  the hostage crisis.  They are influenced by Saudi Arabia, and we know when  it comes to which the worst regime, Iran or Saudi Arabia, Western policy is  not even handed.  It's do with selling armaments to Saudi Arabia, it's to  do a bit with Israel, but I don't think we've got a balance policy from  America towards Iran and Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>[15:25:00]  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you think that policy has become even more unbalanced?  I mean,  there's always a degree of an imbalance.  I mean, there is always a degree  of an imbalance on hypocrisy when putting foreign policy to work with some  of these countries.  But it seems to have become more egregious is what you  seem to be saying.  </p><p>LAMONT:  Well, I think what's happened here - I mean, frankly, Mr. Trump is  not telling the facts when he says Iran is breaking the agreement.  Iran is  fully compliant with the agreement and expert opinion from the  International Atomic Energy Agency says so.  I think the main reason in  Trump's mind, for having these sanctions, is because the nuclear deal was  done by Obama.  It was done by Obama, and therefore, he is against it.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's turn very briefly if we may to the issue of Saudi Arabia  because you're obviously extremely involved in business.  But in terms of  government, you will have been party to Cabinets with negotiations with the  Saudis were involved for armaments.  Do you think it is time to get back to  business or something approaching business is normal, or do you think that  the West should hold armament sales up against the Crown Prince and the  Saudi government?  </p><p>LAMONT:  Well, the West including Britain is so deeply involved in armament  sales to Saudi Arabia.  I don't see that being reversed, but I think we  ought to aim for more diversified policy in arm sales, and I think above  all, we need more balanced approach.  </p><p>I mean, we've seen how the Saudis have been very economical with the truth  when it came to Mr. Khashoggi.  Are we going to trust them with everything  to do with the Yemen War that we're told by them.  </p><p>I think we ought to be a little bit more even handed.  I am not saying that  Iran is a desirable regime.  But I think we ought to be more balanced.  </p><p>QUEST:  But is it time to - is it time to start doing more business back  with Saudi Arabia?  Back to normal is what I am suggesting after the  Khashoggi ...  </p><p>LAMONT:  I think the West world to insist on getting a proper explanation  of what has happened and being sure that the people who are held  responsible for that are the people who really were responsible.  </p><p>QUEST:  Very good to have you, sir.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>LAMONT:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  We didn't even get on to the midterms, that's next time.  The US  House of Representatives will stay red or it will turn blue, and that will  cause the US markets to turn red or indeed green - it depends on the  election, one way or another.  It is a good day.  We're off the highs of  the day by some - but that is up 170 on the Dow.  </p><p>[15:30:00]  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00]  RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello, I'm Richard  Quest, there's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment.  When you will  hear from Sir Tim Berners-Lee; the father of the world wide web who wants  to make the internet a better place.</p><p>Amazon is warning potential hosts for its second headquarters.  Don't spoil  a surprise, as you and I continue tonight, this is Cnn, and on this  network, the facts always come first.  President Trump says there is great  electricity in the air on the eve of the high stakes midterm elections. </p><p>He's headlining three rallies -- key rallies in the states today, stumping  for Republican candidates.  Democrats hope a blue wave will help them  regain control of at least one house of Congress. </p><p>Indonesian diving teams have now identified 27 bodies from the Lion Air  flight that crashed last week killing 189 in all.  Officials are working  with Boeing to warn all carries but the risk of air speed indicator  malfunctions on the 727 MAX 8.  The Lion Air jet was found to have that  malfunction during its last four flights. </p><p>The sons of the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi are issuing an  emotional appeal for the return of their father's remains so he may be  buried.  The spoke exclusively to Cnn in their first public remarks since  their father's murder last month.  Khashoggi's eldest son says he has faith  in the Saudi-run investigation into his father's killing. </p><p>SoftBank says it will not sever financial ties to Saudi Arabia after the  killing of the journalist.  Chief Executive Masayoshi Son expressed strong  regret over Khashoggi's death, and says he won't take any new Saudi money  until the truth is known. </p><p>The U.S. political system, Tuesday is a big day.  For investors, it's a  week of big events.  Political shifts in the U.S. know they will certainly  hit the market.  The dollar, FANG stocks and emerging markets all likely to  face disruption as a result of events.  Now, the Fed will reveal its  interest rates decision on Thursday. </p><p>Policymakers have been facing pressure to soften their hawkish views, and  all week corporate earnings galore.  Some market watchers are concerned  profits have peaked.  Ben Phillips is watching it all, the Chief Investment  Officer at EventShares.  Of the events you are watching at the moment, Ben,  what are you most concerned? What are you watching particularly carefully?  </p><p>BEN PHILLIPS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, EVENTSHARES:  Well, so I think  everyone is focused on midterms this week, but we're worried about what's  going on after midterms.  So regardless of the outcome of midterms, we're  looking at Trump's policy towards global trade.</p><p>We think how he responds to China after midterms after some of this  campaigning we've seen really over the past few weeks, that's our biggest  concern is that global trade breaks down and supply chains are disrupted  because of trade policy.  </p><p>QUEST:  But I see where you're coming from, but haven't you neatly jumped  the hurdle of the midterms? Because the result tomorrow will factor in, you  know, becomes a sine qua non of all those other events.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Well, look, I mean, we're positioning our portfolio adventure as  the PLCY portfolio in things that really are going to continue regardless  of the outcome.  So financial deregulation, it's out of Congress' hands,  it's now in the agency, the Fed, the OCC, the CFPB. </p><p>You look at education deregulation, that's in the department of ED's hands.   So if we go down the list and see what's actually occurring, it looks like  regardless of the outcome, we're going to have, you know, some policy  catalyst that continue.  So deregulation, healthcare spending driven by  Obamacare, you know, those sorts of things. </p><p>Defense spending, want to stay elevated, our view.  So those are the types  of things we're watching and those are the type of things we're positioning  our portfolio on.  </p><p>QUEST:  In the event of a gridlock with the house going to the Democrats,  does the situation change? Does it get worse for investors or arguably, it  gets a great deal better because if Washington can't do anything, then  investors are free and the market is free to make its own direction.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes, I actually think that's right.  I think we'll see some more  noise potentially, maybe some more hearings and things like that.  I  haven't heard Democrats mention the impeachment word yet again with a split  Congress not even worth really taking that off the ground -- </p><p>[15:35:00]  QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Unless there's some really incriminating new evidence that comes  out.  But so, yes, I think what happens in a split Congress is less and  less is more for the market.  There's a whole congressional effect study  out there that says when Congress isn't doing anything, markets are happy. </p><p>So it's just as soon as we remove this uncertainty of midterms, then we  have certainty of what the outcome is within a week depending on California  races obviously if there's some delay there.  But so we'll get some clarity  here within the next week and see which direction Congress is going. </p><p>QUEST:  Right, quick-fire questions, Ben.  Volatility, more of it in the  midterm or less?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  More in the midterm because of trade.  </p><p>QUEST:  Turning to the question of interest rates.  Another one in  December, and what after that?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  It's going to be, again, the trade can really disrupt the growth  thesis of the U.S.  So I think if the Fed sees slower growth because of the  trade, they might delay their actions and hiking rates further, '19.   </p><p>QUEST:  Diversification and rotation, we've seen it out of tech into  defensive, does that continue, is it overdone? When does the tech come  back?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I think it continues.  Tech really has had all this momentum  factor built up into it.  Now you're seeing people rotate more  structurally, longer term out of that momentum factor.  So what we're  seeing is more and more investors doing that, it's really just started. </p><p>So if people say, we're at the top of the cycle here, it's going to start - - this rotation continues in our view.  So I would be wary of tech and the  regulation of tech in big data regulation.    </p><p>QUEST:  Finally, tech and tech.  Does tech like Amazon which buys and sells  things on Netflix which delivers movies and has subscription basis, and  then there's tech like Facebook, obviously Twitter and Snap, we can sort of  leave somewhere in the doldrums down at the bottom.  But is there a  difference, as you say, the rotation out of tech?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  There is, but you know, we think the whole ecosystem is  affected.  But where we're most cautious is around those social media  names, the ones who have been data aggregators in our view, collecting  everyone's consumer data and then using it and selling it.  They're the  ones at biggest risk.  But China trade, we think hardware and the semi- conductors and really that whole supply chain is so integrated with China  that they're at risk too.</p><p>So we're broadly avoiding tech other than our 5G telecom exposure in PLCY. </p><p>QUEST:  Ben, do me a favor, make me a promise, you'll come back and help us  understand more in the future.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Absolutely, happy any time, thanks Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Excellent, new member of the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS family.  Help  give us the sort of information that we can all use and understand and put  into the wider context.  As we continue tonight from London, he created the  web in 1989 and now he's trying to keep it on track.  We'll hear from the  computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, and I'm talking tech and question of  the day.</p><p>I got off the word tech, it's technology.  Get your phones ready for a  question on technology -- where's my phone, it's here somewhere after the  break.  And get ready to head to cnn.com-slash-join.       </p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  All right, I assume you have one of these devices, if not, where  have you been? Time for you to take your device and go to cnn.com-slash- join as we -- and join our question of the day.  Sir Tim Berners-Lee; now  he is the father of the internet, says he trusts the world's biggest tech  companies to take care of your data. </p><p>As the man who created the www, he told \"Reuters\" earlier in the week that  some big tech companies could one day have to be broken up.  You'll hear  Sir Tim in just a moment.  And whiles you think about all of that, is it  time for the big tech companies to be broken up? </p><p>Are they now the monopolies of yester-year but tomorrow? And I assume by  that, we'll let you define big tech, whether we're talking about an Amazon  or whichever sort of Facebook, I'm not sure how you break that one up.  Go  to cnn.com-slash-join now.  Voting is open and you'll see the results  update live on the screen. </p><p>I suppose Google is a good example, Alphabet would be another one.  Amazon  shares while you're voting, Amazon shares are taking a beating today  absolutely, down 2.5 percent or $41, there is the price.  It's not off the  lows of the week, but it is certainly down. </p><p>Investors are being scared off by threats from Donald Trump who is claiming  Amazon and other tech giants may have violated anti-trust laws.  And the  president says his administration is looking into the claims, but isn't  taking  action just yet.  Now, if that were alone, that would be bad enough  to push down the price, but it is not. </p><p>It's not the only thing weighing on the Amazon share price.  Remember,  cnn.com-slash-join.  Now, some customers are also looking to boycott.  The  customers in Saudi Arabia are boycotting the company, taking aim at the  Jeff Bezos and CEO who also owns the \"Washington Post\". </p><p>It's all over the outrage over how the post has covered the killing of one  of its journalists Jamal Khashoggi.  The thing has been pointed firmly at  the Saudi leadership.  So boycott Amazon is trending on Saudi social media.   Meanwhile, the company announced a new incentive to draw in new prime  members on the holiday season. </p><p>It's a free-shipping offer.  Now, if you're a prime member, you already get  free shipping.  It's reserved for paid subscribers.  Now all U.S. customers  will get it with no minimum purchase -- oh, and one other thing you do get,  though, they'll increase the number of things they get free same day  delivery. </p><p>So two developments -- if that wasn't enough, an article in the Bezos home  post is writing new clues about which city Amazon is going to or may choose  to HQ2.  Crystal City, Virginia, has become a frontrunner.  The \"Post\" is  claiming citing people close to the process.  By the way, Amazon said those  who know don't speak and those who speak don't know, and they've also  advised any city who is in the running to best keep stump in case this  suddenly find the knot.</p><p>A lot of Amazon news one way or the other.  Clare Sebastian puts it all  together for us.  Clare, taking all of these developments and the fact that  the share price is down some 2.5 percent today.  What is the driving factor  against that share price?  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, I think it's a combination of  factors, but I think the main one is these regulation comments by Donald  Trump.  Clearly, whether or not he intends to act imminently, he is still  obsessed with this company.  We've seen him through the past few months  talking about, you know, the exploitation of the postal service, the Bezos- Amazon \"Washington Post\" as he's called it, and he's had this company in  his sights. </p><p>And this is really the one thing that investors feel could interrupt the  growth of this company is some kind of regulation to break it up.  So I  think that is what is driving this share.  But don't forget, it comes after  a brutal month.  Amazon has lost about 20 percent of its values since its  peak in September.  </p><p>So there's jitters with that already.  This is just playing into it.</p><p>QUEST:  If the view and there was something of a view that Amazon was  overpriced, that may have been settled by a 20 cent correction.  But you  know, at the end of the day, Clare, I don't hear anybody suggesting that  Amazon is going to start losing customers or that in some way its business  from Amazon cloud services, Amazon web services through to the toilet paper  it will deliver to me in New York.</p><p>[15:45:00]  That it's in any way waning, it's getting bigger.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely, this is where we are in retail, the bigger -- are  getting bigger.  And in particular, Amazon, it's interesting to look at the  free shipping offer that they put out today and the context of that,  Richard, because that is one of the reasons why they can do that is because  they have the higher margin part of the business which is AWS, Amazon's web  services, the cloud and also the burgeoning advertising business because of  all the data they've got from their core retail business. </p><p>They can use those to funnel money into the lower margin -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Retail business, and that is why they can pay for these things  -- </p><p>QUEST:  Clare -- </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Like free shipping.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare, forgive me for interrupting.  I just want to ask you very  quickly and briefly, are you surprised the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS viewer,  wise and wary of world, although they are, 71 percent says big tech  companies should be broken up, only 29 percent say no.  I'm surprised on  that, are you?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  I would say a little surprised, you know, these companies are  you know, ubiquitous to society.  I think the same people who voted the 70  percent who want to break them up are probably also Amazon users and are  relishing -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  The lower prices and the free shipping that they're offering.   But I think the drumbeat around these companies, Richard, be it Amazon, be  it Facebook, be it Google has got a lot of people worried and they're  starting to take a second look here.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare Sebastian, thank you.  The founder of the world wide web Tim  Berners-Lee is calling on governments, companies and individuals to back up  contracts for the web.  That contract he says would help protect people's  rights and freedoms on the internet.  Cnn's Laurie Segall asked him if we  can really trust tech companies to build that product in a safe and  trustworthy manner.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TIM BERNERS-LEE, FOUNDER, WORLD WIDE WEB:  I think because of things like  the data transfer project in which these four companies said you have the  right --you would be able to physically get your data from one of one  others and put it into the other or get -- then I think that for me is  saying, yes, actually they get it as a point and they're prepared to put  the work in.</p><p>So yes, I think that they will.  Yes, I think will have enough people who  are building in home devices that talk to me about their excitement.  We  have to solid put it, we should ask people to have their own data pods.   They've said OK, what would be good would be -- we can -- why don't we  actually put all these data in your data pods?</p><p>I think and there's a lot of excitement around that about -- and realizing  -- people realizing that if they give you data -- control over on your data  that they're generating value for you.  And a lot of companies are finding  it so exciting to be able to switch from trying to exploit you, trying to  make you buy something that you didn't want to buy to actually switch back  to the core business model of helping the user, generating data for the  user.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN:  Can they do that and still make a profit? I mean,  could they do that and not sacrifice their billion-dollar business models?  </p><p>BERNERS-LEE:  You know, all these plugs you can find about how much if you  join the big social network and you give them all your data and you get  stuff  for free.  How much actually is the value date to all those  insurance companies themselves.  It turns out for example, one blog I  thought -- well, the value to them or if your data is less than you pay for  internet connectivity, anyway. </p><p>So actually if you subscribed to your social network and your feeds and  your data, you could actually replace that funding stream by turning around  and paying for yourself.  And it wouldn't be much, so it's actually -- it  says maybe it's a myth.  </p><p>SEGALL:  I'm going to give you two ideas of privacy, and you tell me which  one you think is right.  So one idea is that we just have to re-envision  privacy.  Privacy to an extent is dead.  Another one is that privacy is a  fundamental human right and we have the right to it.  So where do you stand  when it comes to the future, this current moment and looking at what it  means for us as users in our privacy?  </p><p>BERNERS-LEE:  You don't have to look for other guests, we aren't going to  be.  I am going to be with the far to see(ph) of human right.  I'd be say,  privacy of human rights as all placed in the United Nations have said  privacy is a -- those human rights and as you said, that is the right. </p><p>Web is a human right -- you know, so for me, it's very important that I  have control of my data.  That doesn't mean I'm going to afford it, that  doesn't mean that I won't share it with a company which will help me buy  the best presents for my family.  It means that I'll -- it also -- it means  that I'll be able to share it with my -- the people that I work with, that  will -- and so will be able to work more efficiently, I'll have a lot of  total control over who I share what with. </p><p>So the idea of control or own your own data is not just about sort of me  being my own silo, walking everything away, essentially having the joy of  being able to share it with whoever.  Like the joy, if you could know or  you take a selfie with somebody, you pass in the streets and they give you  a business card, just you know, they immediately share whatever it is with  them immediately just because they're a person, just because they have an  ID.</p><p>[15:50:00]  That whereas, in fact, you would have to go home and find out  which social networks they belong to.  So it's partly because -- you know,  control over data -- over your own data as a human right -- that's mine. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Bad news for Google and Facebook by a margin of 2-1.  Most of you  say big tech companies should be broken up.  Now, well, it's come off its - - the highs of 60s or whatever is -- that could mean separating Facebook  from Whatsapp and Instagram while splitting Google Search from its other  bets. </p><p>I'd say I'm surprised, I wouldn't have thought together would have -- would  go all the way very -- that's where we have it.  There is nothing high tech  about the Indonesian xylophone that I got to try out earlier today.  The  rest of the World Travel Market is getting a lot more digital.  We'll hear  from the tourism minister next on how a professional plays that.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  WTM London, 5th to the 7th November, one of the world's biggest  expos for one of the world's largest industries.  You need a stout pair of  shoes and a strong constitution if you're attending the World Travel Market  which began today at ExCeL in London. </p><p>Now, while some offerings are analog, like these Indonesian xylophone -- I  don't think it's properly called the xylophone, but you get the idea sort  of how difficult it is.  How to run somebody else's song.  Most of this  year's focus is on digital tourism, that's everything from targeted ads to  digital destinations including a holiday.</p><p>Everything -- look at the pictures.  Everything is geared not just in  taking the picture, but to putting it on mobile and sharing it with  someone.  If it doesn't look good on Instagram, it's not worth doing.   Indonesia's Tourism Minister told me digital tourism can help him get  millions more visitors.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARIEF YAHYA, TOURISM MINISTER, INDONESIA:  We are doing all the promotion  using this digital media.  For example, we are using the Google, et cetera  for looking, booking, dot com, et cetera.  Even in China, we are using  Ctrip, et cetera.  </p><p>Seventy percent of our target allocated for digital media.</p><p>[15:55:00]  QUEST:  Do you -- I see also, you know, the use of the digital,  I see the word innovation.  But everybody in this building -- </p><p>YAHYA:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Is saying the same thing.  </p><p>YAHYA:  Yes.   </p><p>QUEST:  So how are you going to do it better than them?  </p><p>YAHHA:  OK, there are two things actually.  First is, we have digital  destination, it only show you can see it.  We have at least five days here,  we are going to develop 100 digital destinations, and the second, how we  promote it.  We are going to promote our destination using digital media as  I said before. </p><p>QUEST:  Instagram and things like that?  </p><p>YAHYA:  Everything.  Digital -- I mean, this has to be inside a mobile, it  has to be nice in camera.  You see, that's the first criteria for digital  tourism.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Now, I'll have a lot more from the World Travel Market on Friday's  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS where Tourism Ministers from almost every continent.   And we'll take you on a whistle stop tour of the world's tourism as they  make their pitch.  We will have our profitable moment after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, the midterm elections take place  tomorrow in the United States, and we can pass the results anywhere as  you'll try and understand who will vote, you know, white women from middle  class in northern states or young urban professionals in the Midwest, you  can get it so detailed as you're trying to understand what the voting  trends are and it eventually makes no sense. </p><p>But we will know tomorrow exactly who voted and how, and then we'll have  the problem of how the markets react.  If there is an element of gridlock,  further gridlock than we've already got, a greater divide in America if  that were possible, what does that mean for the markets? </p><p>There is that popular view that says when Washington is gridlocked, the  markets do well.  We'll find out in the next 24 hours because as the voting  and the results come in, we will be here to make sense of it all for you.  </p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. </p><p>(BELL RINGING) </p><p>The bell -- Avianca, an airline -- the bell is ringing, the Dow is up, the  day is done.    </p><p>END      </p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Goes up throughout the course of the  day, slightly off the best of the day so far, and there is one hour still  to trade on Wall Street.  I'm Richard Quest.  These are the top business -  these are the headlines on CNN.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran is the first as the new sanctions come into play.  The Trump  administration's renewed sanctions on Iran's energy.  US elections and the  questions of the midterm, almost upon us, which will go in different  directions?  And Amazon, is the Trump administration about to try an anti- trust deal or anti-trust attack on Amazon?  Tonight, live from London, this  is \"Quest Means Business.\"  I'm Richard Quest.  Now, let's go.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  It's the final frantic, dramatic push for votes.  Across the  United States, candidates and their supporters are making their closing  arguments.  President Trump is campaigning right now in Cleveland.  It's  been a bitter campaign season and the most expensive midterm election in US  history and this is why.  The entire House is up for grabs, along with 35  Senate seats and 36 state governorships.  </p><p>The decisions voters make will affect everything from the Supreme Court to  regulation.  President Trump's agenda even how and where the electoral  battle lines are drawn.  Bill Clinton's strategist famously said, \"It's the  economy, stupid.\"  But when it comes to economic developments, there's  plenty to campaign on.  </p><p>So first of all, you've got surging growth, raging trade wars and growing  deficits.  To voters, the importance of the economy hasn't changed much  since the last midterm elections four years ago.  Forty four percent of  registered voters polled nationally say the economy is extremely important  to their vote.  That's down 12 percentage points in the height of the  crisis in 2009-2010.  Even President Trump doesn't seem too eager to talk  about the economy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They all say, speak about  the economy, speak about the economy.  Well, we have the greatest economy  in the history of our country, but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk  about the economy, right?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Since John King is tracking the races and the issues as seen from  Washington.  If there's one man who is absolutely under the hood of the  suffology in this midterm elections, John, it is you.  So get out the  crystal ball and have a fiddle around try to mix the metaphors beautifully,  what are you seeing in the last 24 hours before?  </p><p>JOHN KING, CHIEF US CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  In the last 24 hours, we're seeing  some evidence of a break toward the Democrats.  This is very complicated  because for the House of Representatives, the terrain does favor the  Democrats.  They need to pick up 23 seats in the United States House of  Representatives.  They have a clear path, Richard, to at least 25, some  Democrats think even 35.  </p><p>So the Democrats actually have no excuses if they don't take back the House  and the late polling numbers suggest things are breaking their way.  The  Senate is much more complicated by the Senate races on the ballot this  year, many of them were in states President Trump carried big.  Many of  them compare - let me put it this way, a lot of these competitive House  districts, they're close to the suburbs, they're in suburban areas.  That's  where the President is incredibly weak.  </p><p>The Senate races, bigger states with smaller towns and more rural areas.   That's where the President is strong.  Democrats look to make gains in the  House.  They look to make a lot of gains at the state level, races for  governor and state legislature.  The Senate, the day before the election,  more of a toss-up where the Republicans are favored to hold their majority,  maybe even add a seat or two, but there is some late hope for the  Democrats.  They do see some evidence of a possible late break that might  let them not only hold their Senate seats, but maybe surprise us.  We'll  count them tomorrow.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is it - for everybody I've been talking to, is it possible or  likely that the last election repeats itself?  And that President Trump,  well of course, it's possible, but is it probable I should really say or at  what level of possibility that he actually does much better than expected  and out of nowhere the red wave or little trickle does become much  stronger?  </p><p>KING:  I rule out nothing.  Based on our 2016 experience and based on our  recent American political experience, not just the Trump win in 2016.   Eight years before that, America elected its first African-American  President.  </p><p>[15:05:04]  </p><p>KING:  A lot of people thought that couldn't happen.  So, there's no doubt  volatility and unpredictability in the climate.  I will tell you this  though, Richard, as for a total Republican surprise, meaning the  Republicans hold the House, even the President himself doesn't seem to  believe that.  </p><p>Over the weekend, he conceded the Republicans are likely to lose the House.   Just today, he said with zero evidence, this is a farce and a fraud, but  the President said he sees all this evidence already of illegal immigrants  illegally voting in the US midterm election.  Remember, that's the same  excuse he used for why he said Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016  even though he won the Electoral College.  </p><p>So the Republicans will suffer some pain tomorrow, all Republicans agree on  that.  Though you raise a great question about how big, how much do we  trust the polling?  Which wasn't perfect in 2016 because the climate is so  different when you look at the House and then the Senate.  </p><p>And to your point about the economy, if this President - if this is a  referendum on Trump at the midterm about his achievements, wow, right?   Maybe you don't like the tax cuts, maybe you don't know how the US pays for  them in the long run, but the economy is gangbusters, but is it more a  referendum on the Trump tone, about tweets not tax cuts.  If it's about  tweets and tone, the President is going to have a shellacking tomorrow.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, so define for me as best one can what would be seen as a  disaster for or a verdict of total disaster for the President?  And  similarly, one would be saying, actually, he did really well.  How will we  judge tomorrow's results?  </p><p>KING:  If by any way Republicans hold the House and the Senate, that's a  huge victory for the President.  No way to sugar coat that for the  Democrats.  If the Republicans can somehow hold the House, that means limit  the Democrats to picking up 22 or fewer seats, you would have a very narrow  Republican majority, but if you still have a Republican majority come  January, this is a victory for the President and his party, if they can  hold the House and the Senate.  </p><p>Again, the President is going to try to spin this.  If he loses the House  and wins the Senate, he's going to say his campaigning in the Senate states  in the last days is what saved the Senate.  He'll take credit for that.  </p><p>I'll give you a longer range perspective though, Richard.  We focus a lot  on Washington, who controls the House?  Who controls the Senate?  These  races for governor, down ballot races for state legislature are critical  across America.  That is where Democrats were punished in the Obama years.  </p><p>First they lost the House in 2010, then they lost the Senate in 2014.   Republicans now have 33 governors, 1,000 state legislative seats in the  Obama years switched from Democrat to Republican.  Do Democrats tomorrow  start the rebuilding effort?  If that's the case, then we'll talk a lot  about the next two years of the Trump presidency, but the Democrats need to  plant the seeds of a revival because they frankly, they've had a terrible  decade.  </p><p>QUEST:  John, we'll let you go in just a second, but after - talk me  through tomorrow night and obviously once you get on air.  What should I be  looking for and when?  </p><p>KING:  It's a great question, and we will get, just as we did in 2016, some  very early clues.  We may not know control of the House until we get to the  West Coast which takes us into the early morning hours.  We may not know  control of the Senate then if the Democrats are surprising us, we could  come down to Nevada and Arizona in the Western time zones, but polls close  early in Kentucky and Ohio.  There is a very competitive House district  just outside of Louisville, Kentucky, the sixth congressional district.   There is a Republican incumbent, Andy Barr in a Republican district that in  a normal year, he should win.  </p><p>He is running against a retired Democratic fighter pilot, military  experience, shot all her ads with a fighter jet just over her shoulder.  If  Amy McGrath is winning in Kentucky's 6th, that tells you the Democrats not  only have a path to get to the House majority, maybe bigger than that.  </p><p>So look at Kentucky first, then you come along the East Coast, there are  some seats in New England, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  We will  know two scenarios.  Are the Democrats doing what they need to do to take  back the House or a Republican successfully blocking them and then when we  start to count the votes in the Florida Senate race, then we'll have a  sense.  Is there any prayer?  Any prayer to what would be the biggest shock  the Democrats taking the Senate, we'll start counting the votes.  It's  going to be a long night.  Espresso tomorrow, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  You know, I have no idea how you keep all those facts in your head  at once.  John, we'll be with you tomorrow night.  Thank you so much, sir.   We appreciate it.  Thank you.  </p><p>KING:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  John has put it into the big picture of the politics.  We need to  put it, as we always do, into what's happening in the markets.  The day  before the midterms and Wall Street has a stake in the election as  investors are waiting, the Dow is nearly at session highs.  It's bouncing  around.  It would not surprise me, bearing in mind that when it's 55  minutes of trading left, we could see just that hold - unlikely, unlikely  that you're just going to see it evaporate in the next 50 minutes.  But, so  I wouldn't put too much on that.  Holding roughly where I would like to is  what seems most reasonable at this point.  </p><p>The Dow is near the sessions high as the tech shares are down, and if you  look at Apple and Amazon - now, Apple and Amazon are big losers at the  moment.  They are on the back of economic news.  </p><p>[15:10:06]  </p><p>QUEST:  President Trump has unleashed what he calls the strongest ever  sanctions on Iran.  A move to re-impose all penalties lifted under the 2015  nuclear deal.  The target in an investment company with links to Iran's  supreme leader.  Some 70 financial institutions, if you look at here, there  are seven investment firms, financial institutions, maritime carriers, oil  transport -- these are the main targets, if you like, of the attack on the  sanctions.  </p><p>The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is warning the companies to  continue to trade with Iran will pay a heavy price.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, US SECRETARY OF STATE:  It should be noted that if a country  evades our sanctions regime and secretly continues sanctionable commerce in  the Islamic Republic, the United States will levy severe swift penalties on  it, including potential sanctions.  I promise you that doing business with  Iran and defying some of our sanctions will ultimately be a much more  painful business decision than pulling out of Iran.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran, joins me now.  So the full weight of  sanctions back on, at least from the US and as you're aware, other nations  and companies being forced along.  When would we expect to see the first  effect in Tehran?  </p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, I think  some of the effects have already been felt over the past couple of months,  Richard.  You already had a first round of sanctions where large companies  have already pulled out.  But this is arguably the much bigger sanctions  weight that could fall on Iran very quickly.  </p><p>So far, what we're seeing is that you do see a lot of politicians here who  are still very defiant in the face of that.  Regular folks who are already  feeling the pinch of it really fear that things could go very, very badly.   It could happen in the not too distant future when a lot of countries stop  eyeing Iranian oil.  A lot have already stopped doing that.  </p><p>The interesting thing from Tehran's perspective is they sort of feel, just  a little bit, Richard, that Washington might have blinked just slightly  giving some of those sanctions waivers where some of the biggest importers  of Iranian oil can actually still do that.  Like for instance, China; like  for instance, Japan and India as well.  </p><p>So the Iranians sort of feeling they might still have a bit of a lifeline  with those countries being able to buy that oil, but certainly, if that's  something that stops, they think they're going to take a very, very big hit  here and all of the talk of defiance, we speak to regular folks, they are  saying, they are already feeling the pinch and they do think that it could  get a lot worse, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is there any evidence that a return - excuse me - is there any  evidence that a return to false sanctions would strengthen any seedling  opposition within Iran against the government?  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  So far it's a very, very important question.  So far I don't  think that there's any evidence of that whatsoever.  One of the things that  you saw earlier this year is that there were some protests here in Iran  against the economic situation.  We have to keep in mind that it's not only  the sanctions that are strangling Iran's economy.  There is a lot of  economic mismanagement, there is a lot of corruption, there is price hikes  as well.  There is a lot of things that people are unhappy with.  </p><p>If you look at the situation now that these new sanctions have been put  into place that really isn't the case anymore.  So the President, Hassan  Rouhani, he was under a lot of fire a couple of months ago for putting the  nuclear agreement into play.  He was taking a lot of heat from the  hardliners, that's no longer the case either.  </p><p>It seems that a lot of that anger is now being channeled towards President  Trump, towards the US administration, and many people here feel that what's  going on right now in the Islamic public is being induced from the outside,  it is being induced from Washington, DC, so it doesn't seem as though, if  it is, the intention of the Trump administration to weaken the government,  to weaken the clergy and the military here, so far, it doesn't appear as  though, at least from our perspective that that is currently the case  right, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Fred Pleitgen who is in Tehran, thank you.  Now Swift, which is the  international payment system, is not taking any chances and is cutting its  services from some Iranian banks.  Swift is the international standard for  verifying money transfers, which is a posh way of saying it provides a  secure network between more than 10,000 financial institutions around the  world.  If I want to send you money internationally, or more likely,  hopefully, you're sending me money, and then probably, it will go via Swift  and our institutions will have a Swift code that will go backwards and  forwards.  </p><p>Now, this is long before the days of blockchain technology.  Some Iranian  banks are now unable to talk to Swift after the firm blocked them from its  messaging system.  Swift says the decision is regrettable.  John Defterios  is in Abu Dhabi to put this in perspective.  John, the Swift found itself  in an impossible position.  </p><p>On the one hand, the US is saying, you know, \"You do business with Iran and  we will penalize you.\"  On the other hand, the Europeans and others say,  \"If you give in to external pressure on sanctions, we will penalize you.\"  </p><p>[15:15:10]  </p><p>QUEST:  So now what?  </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR, CNN:  Well, Richard, it was not an  easy call for Swift because it's based in Belgium right at the heart of the  European Union, but it's an international player and it will target up to  50 banks going forward here that are on the target list from the United  States.  </p><p>They said it was regrettable as you suggested, but necessary for stability,  so that's the argument they are using, but I think, we should remind our  viewers, Richard, this was supposed to be the round of sanctions that  targeted oil, not financial institutions.  The first round was strong  against Iran, but the second round really targets the financial  institutions here.  </p><p>We have 900 entities, financial banks, insurance companies, the shipping  companies and also the airlines.  Now, we know Russia, China, Turkey, the  European Union were against the US sanctions, so that how do they work  around the US Federal Reserve and US Treasury is a key question.  </p><p>President Rouhani of Iran said he looks forward to breaking the sanctions.   That's very bold as Fred was suggesting here, but it will be hard times for  the Iranians going forward.  I was looking at a World Bank report, a month  ago, before we saw the full weight of these financial sanctions, and they  were projecting a decline of 4% - a recession of 4% in 2019, inflation of  30%, Richard, and again, this is where it is today.  It could come under  further pressure of the Swift banking sanctions that you were talking  about.  </p><p>QUEST:  If you look at oil, the movements we've seen in oil in the past few  days, there has been quite a sizeable drop in that price on the back of  what?  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, you know, this is very fascinating to me, because  remember, Donald Trump was saying in the summer, we're going to take Iran  down to zero when it comes to exports and this is where the midterm reality  settled in.  This is a chart looking back just a month, Richard, and when  North Sea Brent hit $86.00 a barrel, Donald Trump hit Twitter and was  calling out for more crude.  </p><p>Saudi Arabia responded.  The UAE where I am sitting responded, Kuwait even  Russia.  We saw that price go from $86.00 a barrel down to $73.00.  </p><p>But that's not the only factor, Richard.  Iran's production has been  dropping, but it's not collapsing just yet.  Let's take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>IMAN NASSERI, MIDDLE EAST MANAGING DIRECTOR, FGE:  We drew an expected   part of Iran's exports falling to less than a million barrels per day by  first quarter next year and around 700,000 to 800,000 a day by middle of  next year.  So far, it has come along that path.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  So Richard, we're at 1.5 million barrels a day.  Now, the Facts  Global Energy is suggesting we get to 700,000 to 800,000 barrels.  Let's  bring up, Richard, the eight exemptions that were made here.  I was  surprised over the fact, the Italian and the Greeks got the exemptions as  members of the European Union, which have been fighting against Donald  Trump.  China, Turkey and India never were going to go along.  So it's  almost like legalizing, Richard the ability for them to continue to import  Iranian crude and as Fred said, the big Asian importers are in there as  well.  </p><p>This by the way, Richard is proof to the fact, you can't replace Iranian  crude that easily.  They were exporting 2.8 million barrels a day back in  June.  Donald Trump admitted he didn't want to see the price go higher  right now.  </p><p>QUEST:  John Defterios, thank you.  Now, Britain and the European Union are  rallying against America's hash new sanctions on Tehran.  I'll discuss with  the former British Finance Minister, Lord Norman Lamont after the break.  </p><p>And Amazon's headlines are coming thick and fast today.  Accusations of  anti-trust violations in the White House, a Saudi boycott and new clues  around 8Q2.  </p><p>[15:15:0]  </p><p>QUEST:  The European Union is staunchly opposed to the US sanctions on  Iran, saying it will try to protect European companies doing legitimate  business with Tehran.  Joining me now to discuss this is Lord Lamont,  Chairman of the British Iranian Chamber of Commerce, and of course Prime  Minister's trade envoy to Iran, and Lord Lamont, the situation now is just  about you're damned if your company is doing business - you're damned if  you do and you're damned if you don't.  It's who you want to be sanctioned  by or fall out of favor with the Europeans or the Americans.  </p><p>LORD NORMAN LAMONT, CHAIRMAN, BRITISH IRANIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  Well,  that's got a fair amount of force behind it.  There are companies that  trade both with Iran and the US.  They will have to choose.  Many will  choose to trade with America - that is inevitable, but there are other  companies that trade only with Iran or for whom Iran is the more important  market.  </p><p>And the object of European policy is to protect them from the secondary  sanctions, the banking sanctions, that even when the nuclear deal was in  force, were inhibiting European companies from trading with Iran, because  they feared that the banks, their bank, which might deal with an American  bank, wouldn't finance their trade with Iran.  So this is trying to protect  the European banking system from American banking, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  But the moment a dollar becomes involved ...  </p><p>LAMONT:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  The moment and never mind anything as complicated or as exotic as  dollar clearing, then you're into a different ball game, aren't you?   Because then the Treasury and the whole weight of this could be against  you.  </p><p>LAMONT:  You know, that's right.  Do business with America, have dealings  in dollars, employ American personnel, have any American content in your  product.  You have got to be very, very careful, obviously.  </p><p>QUEST:  Are you disappointed at the way in which Europe and the UK and  other countries, that they've not stood up to the US in this sense.   They've said, \"Okay, you go off with your sanctions, you withdraw from the  agreement,\" but they don't seem to protect it.  </p><p>LAMONT:  Well, it's not an easy problem to solve because of the combined  effect of trade, the effect of globalization, but the special purpose  vehicle that the EU is working on, that will take time to get going and in  the instance, that will essentially be a netting mechanism allowing  companies with debts and obligations to Iran to swap liabilities with each  other.  </p><p>But eventually the SPV is designed or intended to get a banking license and  process transactions themselves.  </p><p>QUEST:  But it is allowing an extra territorial aspect to US legislation.   I mean, even the right to - or as one reads - exemptions for this country  to trade for oil in this country, I mean, the argument is there because who  is the US to tell Japan that it can't buy oil from Iran?  </p><p>LAMON:  Well, I totally agree with you.  I think the American policy is  unreasonable.  I think the United States has an obsessions with Iran that  is not justified by the facts.  I think they're obsessed with still with  the hostage crisis.  They are influenced by Saudi Arabia, and we know when  it comes to which the worst regime, Iran or Saudi Arabia, Western policy is  not even handed.  It's do with selling armaments to Saudi Arabia, it's to  do a bit with Israel, but I don't think we've got a balance policy from  America towards Iran and Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>[15:25:00]  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you think that policy has become even more unbalanced?  I mean,  there's always a degree of an imbalance.  I mean, there is always a degree  of an imbalance on hypocrisy when putting foreign policy to work with some  of these countries.  But it seems to have become more egregious is what you  seem to be saying.  </p><p>LAMONT:  Well, I think what's happened here - I mean, frankly, Mr. Trump is  not telling the facts when he says Iran is breaking the agreement.  Iran is  fully compliant with the agreement and expert opinion from the  International Atomic Energy Agency says so.  I think the main reason in  Trump's mind, for having these sanctions, is because the nuclear deal was  done by Obama.  It was done by Obama, and therefore, he is against it.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's turn very briefly if we may to the issue of Saudi Arabia  because you're obviously extremely involved in business.  But in terms of  government, you will have been party to Cabinets with negotiations with the  Saudis were involved for armaments.  Do you think it is time to get back to  business or something approaching business is normal, or do you think that  the West should hold armament sales up against the Crown Prince and the  Saudi government?  </p><p>LAMONT:  Well, the West including Britain is so deeply involved in armament  sales to Saudi Arabia.  I don't see that being reversed, but I think we  ought to aim for more diversified policy in arm sales, and I think above  all, we need more balanced approach.  </p><p>I mean, we've seen how the Saudis have been very economical with the truth  when it came to Mr. Khashoggi.  Are we going to trust them with everything  to do with the Yemen War that we're told by them.  </p><p>I think we ought to be a little bit more even handed.  I am not saying that  Iran is a desirable regime.  But I think we ought to be more balanced.  </p><p>QUEST:  But is it time to - is it time to start doing more business back  with Saudi Arabia?  Back to normal is what I am suggesting after the  Khashoggi ...  </p><p>LAMONT:  I think the West world to insist on getting a proper explanation  of what has happened and being sure that the people who are held  responsible for that are the people who really were responsible.  </p><p>QUEST:  Very good to have you, sir.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>LAMONT:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  We didn't even get on to the midterms, that's next time.  The US  House of Representatives will stay red or it will turn blue, and that will  cause the US markets to turn red or indeed green - it depends on the  election, one way or another.  It is a good day.  We're off the highs of  the day by some - but that is up 170 on the Dow.  </p><p>[15:30:00]  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00]  RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello, I'm Richard  Quest, there's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment.  When you will  hear from Sir Tim Berners-Lee; the father of the world wide web who wants  to make the internet a better place.</p><p>Amazon is warning potential hosts for its second headquarters.  Don't spoil  a surprise, as you and I continue tonight, this is Cnn, and on this  network, the facts always come first.  President Trump says there is great  electricity in the air on the eve of the high stakes midterm elections. </p><p>He's headlining three rallies -- key rallies in the states today, stumping  for Republican candidates.

Chief Executive Masayoshi Son expressed strong  regret over Khashoggi's death, and says he won't take any new Saudi money  until the truth is known. </p><p>The U.S. political system, Tuesday is a big day.  For investors, it's a  week of big events.  Political shifts in the U.S. know they will certainly  hit the market.  The dollar, FANG stocks and emerging markets all likely to  face disruption as a result of events.  Now, the Fed will reveal its  interest rates decision on Thursday. </p><p>Policymakers have been facing pressure to soften their hawkish views, and  all week corporate earnings galore.  Some market watchers are concerned  profits have peaked.  Ben Phillips is watching it all, the Chief Investment  Officer at EventShares.  Of the events you are watching at the moment, Ben,  what are you most concerned? What are you watching particularly carefully?  </p><p>BEN PHILLIPS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, EVENTSHARES:  Well, so I think  everyone is focused on midterms this week, but we're worried about what's  going on after midterms.  So regardless of the outcome of midterms, we're  looking at Trump's policy towards global trade.</p><p>We think how he responds to China after midterms after some of this  campaigning we've seen really over the past few weeks, that's our biggest  concern is that global trade breaks down and supply chains are disrupted  because of trade policy.  </p><p>QUEST:  But I see where you're coming from, but haven't you neatly jumped  the hurdle of the midterms? Because the result tomorrow will factor in, you  know, becomes a sine qua non of all those other events.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Well, look, I mean, we're positioning our portfolio adventure as  the PLCY portfolio in things that really are going to continue regardless  of the outcome.  So financial deregulation, it's out of Congress' hands,  it's now in the agency, the Fed, the OCC, the CFPB. </p><p>You look at education deregulation, that's in the department of ED's hands.   So if we go down the list and see what's actually occurring, it looks like  regardless of the outcome, we're going to have, you know, some policy  catalyst that continue.  So deregulation, healthcare spending driven by  Obamacare, you know, those sorts of things. </p><p>Defense spending, want to stay elevated, our view.  So those are the types  of things we're watching and those are the type of things we're positioning  our portfolio on.  </p><p>QUEST:  In the event of a gridlock with the house going to the Democrats,  does the situation change? Does it get worse for investors or arguably, it  gets a great deal better because if Washington can't do anything, then  investors are free and the market is free to make its own direction.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes, I actually think that's right.  I think we'll see some more  noise potentially, maybe some more hearings and things like that.  I  haven't heard Democrats mention the impeachment word yet again with a split  Congress not even worth really taking that off the ground -- </p><p>[15:35:00]  QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Unless there's some really incriminating new evidence that comes  out.  But so, yes, I think what happens in a split Congress is less and  less is more for the market.  There's a whole congressional effect study  out there that says when Congress isn't doing anything, markets are happy. </p><p>So it's just as soon as we remove this uncertainty of midterms, then we  have certainty of what the outcome is within a week depending on California  races obviously if there's some delay there.  But so we'll get some clarity  here within the next week and see which direction Congress is going. </p><p>QUEST:  Right, quick-fire questions, Ben.  Volatility, more of it in the  midterm or less?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  More in the midterm because of trade.  </p><p>QUEST:  Turning to the question of interest rates.  Another one in  December, and what after that?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  It's going to be, again, the trade can really disrupt the growth  thesis of the U.S.  So I think if the Fed sees slower growth because of the  trade, they might delay their actions and hiking rates further, '19.   </p><p>QUEST:  Diversification and rotation, we've seen it out of tech into  defensive, does that continue, is it overdone? When does the tech come  back?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I think it continues.  Tech really has had all this momentum  factor built up into it.  Now you're seeing people rotate more  structurally, longer term out of that momentum factor.  So what we're  seeing is more and more investors doing that, it's really just started. </p><p>So if people say, we're at the top of the cycle here, it's going to start - - this rotation continues in our view.  So I would be wary of tech and the  regulation of tech in big data regulation.    </p><p>QUEST:  Finally, tech and tech.  Does tech like Amazon which buys and sells  things on Netflix which delivers movies and has subscription basis, and  then there's tech like Facebook, obviously Twitter and Snap, we can sort of  leave somewhere in the doldrums down at the bottom.  But is there a  difference, as you say, the rotation out of tech?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  There is, but you know, we think the whole ecosystem is  affected.  But where we're most cautious is around those social media  names, the ones who have been data aggregators in our view, collecting  everyone's consumer data and then using it and selling it.  They're the  ones at biggest risk.  But China trade, we think hardware and the semi- conductors and really that whole supply chain is so integrated with China  that they're at risk too.</p><p>So we're broadly avoiding tech other than our 5G telecom exposure in PLCY. </p><p>QUEST:  Ben, do me a favor, make me a promise, you'll come back and help us  understand more in the future.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Absolutely, happy any time, thanks Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Excellent, new member of the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS family.  Help  give us the sort of information that we can all use and understand and put  into the wider context.  As we continue tonight from London, he created the  web in 1989 and now he's trying to keep it on track.  We'll hear from the  computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, and I'm talking tech and question of  the day.</p><p>I got off the word tech, it's technology.  Get your phones ready for a  question on technology -- where's my phone, it's here somewhere after the  break.  And get ready to head to cnn.com-slash-join.       </p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  All right, I assume you have one of these devices, if not, where  have you been? Time for you to take your device and go to cnn.com-slash- join as we -- and join our question of the day.  Sir Tim Berners-Lee; now  he is the father of the internet, says he trusts the world's biggest tech  companies to take care of your data. </p><p>As the man who created the www, he told \"Reuters\" earlier in the week that  some big tech companies could one day have to be broken up.  You'll hear  Sir Tim in just a moment.  And whiles you think about all of that, is it  time for the big tech companies to be broken up? </p><p>Are they now the monopolies of yester-year but tomorrow? And I assume by  that, we'll let you define big tech, whether we're talking about an Amazon  or whichever sort of Facebook, I'm not sure how you break that one up.  Go  to cnn.com-slash-join now.  Voting is open and you'll see the results  update live on the screen. </p><p>I suppose Google is a good example, Alphabet would be another one.  Amazon  shares while you're voting, Amazon shares are taking a beating today  absolutely, down 2.5 percent or $41, there is the price.  It's not off the  lows of the week, but it is certainly down. </p><p>Investors are being scared off by threats from Donald Trump who is claiming  Amazon and other tech giants may have violated anti-trust laws.  And the  president says his administration is looking into the claims, but isn't  taking  action just yet.  Now, if that were alone, that would be bad enough  to push down the price, but it is not. </p><p>It's not the only thing weighing on the Amazon share price.  Remember,  cnn.com-slash-join.  Now, some customers are also looking to boycott.  The  customers in Saudi Arabia are boycotting the company, taking aim at the  Jeff Bezos and CEO who also owns the \"Washington Post\". </p><p>It's all over the outrage over how the post has covered the killing of one  of its journalists Jamal Khashoggi.  The thing has been pointed firmly at  the Saudi leadership.  So boycott Amazon is trending on Saudi social media.   Meanwhile, the company announced a new incentive to draw in new prime  members on the holiday season. </p><p>It's a free-shipping offer.  Now, if you're a prime member, you already get  free shipping.  It's reserved for paid subscribers.  Now all U.S. customers  will get it with no minimum purchase -- oh, and one other thing you do get,  though, they'll increase the number of things they get free same day  delivery. </p><p>So two developments -- if that wasn't enough, an article in the Bezos home  post is writing new clues about which city Amazon is going to or may choose  to HQ2.  Crystal City, Virginia, has become a frontrunner.  The \"Post\" is  claiming citing people close to the process.  By the way, Amazon said those  who know don't speak and those who speak don't know, and they've also  advised any city who is in the running to best keep stump in case this  suddenly find the knot.</p><p>A lot of Amazon news one way or the other.  Clare Sebastian puts it all  together for us.  Clare, taking all of these developments and the fact that  the share price is down some 2.5 percent today.  What is the driving factor  against that share price?  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, I think it's a combination of  factors, but I think the main one is these regulation comments by Donald  Trump.  Clearly, whether or not he intends to act imminently, he is still  obsessed with this company.  We've seen him through the past few months  talking about, you know, the exploitation of the postal service, the Bezos- Amazon \"Washington Post\" as he's called it, and he's had this company in  his sights. </p><p>And this is really the one thing that investors feel could interrupt the  growth of this company is some kind of regulation to break it up.  So I  think that is what is driving this share.  But don't forget, it comes after  a brutal month.  Amazon has lost about 20 percent of its values since its  peak in September.  </p><p>So there's jitters with that already.  This is just playing into it.</p><p>QUEST:  If the view and there was something of a view that Amazon was  overpriced, that may have been settled by a 20 cent correction.  But you  know, at the end of the day, Clare, I don't hear anybody suggesting that  Amazon is going to start losing customers or that in some way its business  from Amazon cloud services, Amazon web services through to the toilet paper  it will deliver to me in New York.</p><p>[15:45:00]  That it's in any way waning, it's getting bigger.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely, this is where we are in retail, the bigger -- are  getting bigger.  And in particular, Amazon, it's interesting to look at the  free shipping offer that they put out today and the context of that,  Richard, because that is one of the reasons why they can do that is because  they have the higher margin part of the business which is AWS, Amazon's web  services, the cloud and also the burgeoning advertising business because of  all the data they've got from their core retail business. </p><p>They can use those to funnel money into the lower margin -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Retail business, and that is why they can pay for these things  -- </p><p>QUEST:  Clare -- </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Like free shipping.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare, forgive me for interrupting.  I just want to ask you very  quickly and briefly, are you surprised the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS viewer,  wise and wary of world, although they are, 71 percent says big tech  companies should be broken up, only 29 percent say no.  I'm surprised on  that, are you?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  I would say a little surprised, you know, these companies are  you know, ubiquitous to society.  I think the same people who voted the 70  percent who want to break them up are probably also Amazon users and are  relishing -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  The lower prices and the free shipping that they're offering.   But I think the drumbeat around these companies, Richard, be it Amazon, be  it Facebook, be it Google has got a lot of people worried and they're  starting to take a second look here.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare Sebastian, thank you.  The founder of the world wide web Tim  Berners-Lee is calling on governments, companies and individuals to back up  contracts for the web.  That contract he says would help protect people's  rights and freedoms on the internet.  Cnn's Laurie Segall asked him if we  can really trust tech companies to build that product in a safe and  trustworthy manner.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TIM BERNERS-LEE, FOUNDER, WORLD WIDE WEB:  I think because of things like  the data transfer project in which these four companies said you have the  right --you would be able to physically get your data from one of one  others and put it into the other or get -- then I think that for me is  saying, yes, actually they get it as a point and they're prepared to put  the work in.</p><p>So yes, I think that they will.  Yes, I think will have enough people who  are building in home devices that talk to me about their excitement.  We  have to solid put it, we should ask people to have their own data pods.   They've said OK, what would be good would be -- we can -- why don't we  actually put all these data in your data pods?</p><p>I think and there's a lot of excitement around that about -- and realizing  -- people realizing that if they give you data -- control over on your data  that they're generating value for you.  And a lot of companies are finding  it so exciting to be able to switch from trying to exploit you, trying to  make you buy something that you didn't want to buy to actually switch back  to the core business model of helping the user, generating data for the  user.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN:  Can they do that and still make a profit? I mean,  could they do that and not sacrifice their billion-dollar business models?  </p><p>BERNERS-LEE:  You know, all these plugs you can find about how much if you  join the big social network and you give them all your data and you get  stuff  for free.  How much actually is the value date to all those  insurance companies themselves.  It turns out for example, one blog I  thought -- well, the value to them or if your data is less than you pay for  internet connectivity, anyway. </p><p>So actually if you subscribed to your social network and your feeds and  your data, you could actually replace that funding stream by turning around  and paying for yourself.  And it wouldn't be much, so it's actually -- it  says maybe it's a myth.  </p><p>SEGALL:  I'm going to give you two ideas of privacy, and you tell me which  one you think is right.  So one idea is that we just have to re-envision  privacy.  Privacy to an extent is dead.  Another one is that privacy is a  fundamental human right and we have the right to it.  So where do you stand  when it comes to the future, this current moment and looking at what it  means for us as users in our privacy?  </p><p>BERNERS-LEE:  You don't have to look for other guests, we aren't going to  be.  I am going to be with the far to see(ph) of human right.  I'd be say,  privacy of human rights as all placed in the United Nations have said  privacy is a -- those human rights and as you said, that is the right. </p><p>Web is a human right -- you know, so for me, it's very important that I  have control of my data.  That doesn't mean I'm going to afford it, that  doesn't mean that I won't share it with a company which will help me buy  the best presents for my family.  It means that I'll -- it also -- it means  that I'll be able to share it with my -- the people that I work with, that  will -- and so will be able to work more efficiently, I'll have a lot of  total control over who I share what with. </p><p>So the idea of control or own your own data is not just about sort of me  being my own silo, walking everything away, essentially having the joy of  being able to share it with whoever.  Like the joy, if you could know or  you take a selfie with somebody, you pass in the streets and they give you  a business card, just you know, they immediately share whatever it is with  them immediately just because they're a person, just because they have an  ID.</p><p>[15:50:00]  That whereas, in fact, you would have to go home and find out  which social networks they belong to.  So it's partly because -- you know,  control over data -- over your own data as a human right -- that's mine. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Bad news for Google and Facebook by a margin of 2-1.  Most of you  say big tech companies should be broken up.  Now, well, it's come off its - - the highs of 60s or whatever is -- that could mean separating Facebook  from Whatsapp and Instagram while splitting Google Search from its other  bets. </p><p>I'd say I'm surprised, I wouldn't have thought together would have -- would  go all the way very -- that's where we have it.  There is nothing high tech  about the Indonesian xylophone that I got to try out earlier today.  The  rest of the World Travel Market is getting a lot more digital.  We'll hear  from the tourism minister next on how a professional plays that.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  WTM London, 5th to the 7th November, one of the world's biggest  expos for one of the world's largest industries.  You need a stout pair of  shoes and a strong constitution if you're attending the World Travel Market  which began today at ExCeL in London. </p><p>Now, while some offerings are analog, like these Indonesian xylophone -- I  don't think it's properly called the xylophone, but you get the idea sort  of how difficult it is.  How to run somebody else's song.  Most of this  year's focus is on digital tourism, that's everything from targeted ads to  digital destinations including a holiday.</p><p>Everything -- look at the pictures.  Everything is geared not just in  taking the picture, but to putting it on mobile and sharing it with  someone.  If it doesn't look good on Instagram, it's not worth doing.   Indonesia's Tourism Minister told me digital tourism can help him get  millions more visitors.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARIEF YAHYA, TOURISM MINISTER, INDONESIA:  We are doing all the promotion  using this digital media.  For example, we are using the Google, et cetera  for looking, booking, dot com, et cetera.  Even in China, we are using  Ctrip, et cetera.  </p><p>Seventy percent of our target allocated for digital media.</p><p>[15:55:00]  QUEST:  Do you -- I see also, you know, the use of the digital,  I see the word innovation.  But everybody in this building -- </p><p>YAHYA:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Is saying the same thing.  </p><p>YAHYA:  Yes.   </p><p>QUEST:  So how are you going to do it better than them?  </p><p>YAHHA:  OK, there are two things actually.  First is, we have digital  destination, it only show you can see it.  We have at least five days here,  we are going to develop 100 digital destinations, and the second, how we  promote it.  We are going to promote our destination using digital media as  I said before. </p><p>QUEST:  Instagram and things like that?  </p><p>YAHYA:  Everything.  Digital -- I mean, this has to be inside a mobile, it  has to be nice in camera.  You see, that's the first criteria for digital  tourism.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Now, I'll have a lot more from the World Travel Market on Friday's  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS where Tourism Ministers from almost every continent.   And we'll take you on a whistle stop tour of the world's tourism as they  make their pitch.  We will have our profitable moment after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, the midterm elections take place  tomorrow in the United States, and we can pass the results anywhere as  you'll try and understand who will vote, you know, white women from middle  class in northern states or young urban professionals in the Midwest, you  can get it so detailed as you're trying to understand what the voting  trends are and it eventually makes no sense. </p><p>But we will know tomorrow exactly who voted and how, and then we'll have  the problem of how the markets react.  If there is an element of gridlock,  further gridlock than we've already got, a greater divide in America if  that were possible, what does that mean for the markets? </p><p>There is that popular view that says when Washington is gridlocked, the  markets do well.  We'll find out in the next 24 hours because as the voting  and the results come in, we will be here to make sense of it all for you.  </p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. </p><p>(BELL RINGING) </p><p>The bell -- Avianca, an airline -- the bell is ringing, the Dow is up, the  day is done.    </p><p>END      </p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Downed and denied. President Trump says the U.S. downed an Iranian drone; Iran says it wasn't ours. The age of Azure. Microsoft on Cloud 9 after some stellar Q2 earnings. And it was a summer of '69 -- no singing -- it's 50 years since Apollo 11 landed on the moon. It's Friday, we made it. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE this Friday where we are celebrating man's first move to the moon, of course, 50 years. We're going to be talking about space later on in the show. But for now, no moon shoots as far as U.S. stocks are concerned, though it does look like we're going to make solid gains at the open today after a pretty choppy week on Wall Street.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Asia did well of course, too. The Nikkei rallying some two percent. The overriding theme here is this hope, I think for more global stimulus helped along by some confusion, let's call it from the Federal Reserve yesterday.</p><p>Let me just explain what happened to you. The head at the New York Fed, John Williams made some comments that fueled speculation that perhaps we could see a half a percentage point rate cut in July, and the bond market got excited. It started to price a far higher chance of that. In fact a 70 percent chance. Then, the New York Fed walked back on those comments saying that he was simply speaking theoretically.</p><p>Remember yesterday, we spoke to voting member Jim Bullard, he said that half a percentage point at this stage looks over done. And I think we stand by that at this stage. I think that still holds. We'll talk it through later on in the show.</p><p>But first there's earnings to get to, so let me mention some of those. Microsoft, as I said, having a very strong quarter. We've also had a few big names like Honeywell, United Health raising guidance hereto, fine. Expectations for this earnings season were really low.</p><p>But I think the bias so far has been to punish the misses, far more than you reward those that beats -- think the banks this week versus Netflix. Perhaps that's natural though when stocks are near record highs, investors are already shooting for the stars here and discounting plenty of risks; and Iran, and the tensions there are just one of those risks.</p><p>Let's get to the drivers because that's where we start. Iran denying a drone has been downed over the Strait of Hormuz. This of course after the President said so in Thursday's session. Fred Pleitgen joins us now on this story. Fred, it's a case of he-said-he-said. Iran saying in fact that, no, all of our drones are accounted for here. In fact, it may have been the United States downing one of their own drones. Talk us through what we know here.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's certainly, Julia, is another incident that happened there and that key obviously, waterway for the world's economy, for the world's oil shipping, the Strait of Hormuz.</p><p>When the U.S. was bringing a pretty large aircraft/helicopter carrier through, called the USS Boxer. Now, the U.S. says that the Iranians came very close to that ship with a drone and then a Marine unit that was on board their ship used electronic countermeasures to jam the drone and down it.</p><p>Now, the Iranians for their part, as you said, are saying that simply isn't true. But now for the first time, they are acknowledging that perhaps they did fly a drone close to that ship, however, also ripping into U.S. President Trump. I want to read you a quote from one of Iran's top spokespeople for the military. He says quote, \"Contrary to Trump's delusional and groundless claim, all drones belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, including the one mentioned by the U.S. President have returned to their bases safe and sound after carrying out their scheduled surveillance and control operations.\"</p><p>And of course, Julia, you and I have been talking so much about the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf and all the tension that's been rising there, and this is just another incident that seems to be fanning those flames, fanning those tensions.</p><p>Of course, we had those attacks on the tankers that the U.S. blames on Iran. The Iranians are saying it wasn't them. The shooting down of a U.S. drone by the Iranians that they say infringed into their airspace.</p><p>So, really, it looks as though the U.S. and Iran really in a deadlock there. And you know, I've been through the Strait of Hormuz on a U.S. aircraft carrier once and I can tell you, it is an extremely tight waterway where those two forces are in very, very close proximity -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely, and pivotal to the global oil industry, as you've pointed out, too, so everyone watching this very, very closely and a sequence of events and Iran denying involvement in all of them at this stage.</p><p>There has been so many mixed messages, I think whether it's from the US government, from Iran here, what hopes at this stage of seeing Iran coming back to the table, a fresh agreement over nuclear development here in exchange for a relaxation of sanctions? Because ultimately, that's what both sides would like, it's how you bring them together.</p><p>[09:05:22] PLEITGEN: Yes, I mean, absolutely, the Iranians would certainly want the relaxation of sanctions, and the U.S. obviously says that it wants guarantees that Iran is not going to build a nuclear weapon.</p><p>The Iranians, of course, for their side are saying, look, in general, they don't want to build a nuclear weapon. And of course, they have a nuclear agreement that the Iranians are still a part of.</p><p>I think right now, at this point in time, it's going to be very, very difficult for these sides to get back to the negotiating table, especially with incidents like the one that we saw yesterday with the USS Boxer taking place.</p><p>But at the same time, you do have both sides saying they want to return to the negotiating table. Of course, you have President Trump saying he is for negotiations without preconditions. The Iranians are saying as long as those sanctions are on Iran, that is a precondition.</p><p>And yesterday, you had Iran's Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif come out and say, look, the Iranians would be interested in having an agreement with the United States where they would actually allow more visits to their nuclear sites, also sites that so far have been undeclared.</p><p>But what they want then, is permanent sanctions relief from the United States and that certainly seems like a pretty difficult proposition there for the U.S. -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, step too far for the White House, at least at this stage. Fred, fantastic to have you with us. Thank you for that.</p><p>All right. Let's move on now to our second driver, and as I mentioned Microsoft on Cloud 9, a blowout quarter for these guys, based on the Cloud division performance here. Matt Egan joins us now.</p><p>Matt, in fact, the Cloud Azure division creating more revenue than any other segment for these guys, and this is the fastest growing segment, so they must be very pleased.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: Absolutely, Julia. Microsoft -- a company that many investors feared was dead money earlier this decade continues to be one of the brightest stars in Big Tech.</p><p>Now, we know that companies love to guide low and then just narrowly beat expectations, but Microsoft really had a monster beat here. Its revenue exceeded expectations by nearly a billion dollars. Obviously, that is very impressive. It speaks to not just the momentum here, but really the scale of Microsoft and Satya Nadella's decision to bet big on the Cloud continues to really pay off.</p><p>Now, Microsoft's Cloud -- Commercial Cloud Division -- increased revenue during the quarter by 39 percent, as you mentioned, to $11 billion. The Azure Cloud Unit by itself grew revenue by a very impressive 64 percent, which believe it or not, is actually a deceleration from the prior quarter.</p><p>Now, Microsoft also guided really, really strongly as well. They're predicting double digit increases in both revenue and operating income for the fiscal year that just began July 1.</p><p>Wedbush Securities put out a research report saying that this is, you know, an absolute blowout quarter across the board without any blemishes, and they actually predicted that the Cloud party in Redmond may just be getting started.</p><p>Now, if you want to find a negative here, and it's not easy to do that, it would be gaming. The Video Game Unit revenue was down by 10 percent. The Xbox hardware revenue fell by 48 percent due to some tough comparisons from the year before.</p><p>But Julia, all in all, clearly, Wall Street is still very bullish on Microsoft because, one, of the Cloud and two, unlike some of these other Big Tech companies, Microsoft's antitrust headaches are of course in the rearview mirror.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, they've been there, done that and bought the t-shirt, really taking the fight here to Amazon, the Cloud, which is interesting. On this point, I want to talk jedi, not to be mistaken for anything to do with \"Star Wars.\"</p><p>We're talking Department of Defense, government contracts here because President Trump has been asked about this a couple of times already this week. Who is going to award or who is going to get these contracts and whether or not the President himself will intervene? And it feels like an Amazon versus Microsoft face off here. What do we know about this?</p><p>EGAN: That's right. So, all of these big tech companies would love to get a piece of this $10 billion Pentagon Cloud contract, but really, it is just down to Amazon against Microsoft, because IBM and Oracle have already been ruled out.</p><p>Now, Amazon is the Cloud leader. So, you would think that it maybe it would go to them, but we should not rule out Microsoft here.</p><p>President Trump was asked about this yesterday and he told reporters he is going to look very closely at the bidding contract. He said some very impressive companies have been complaining about the bidding contracts. He named Microsoft and IBM and Oracle. He did not name Amazon is one of the companies that had been complaining though.</p><p>So, Julia, you sort of wonder if Microsoft has a really big advantage here, as far as this jedi contract and the fact that it's not led by Jeff Bezos, who of course is an adversary, a rival of President Trump.</p><p>[09:10:10] CHATTERLEY: Yes, expect lots of questions if they do get awarded this contract, of course, exactly for that reason. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, on to our next driver now, Boeing saying, it would take a $5 billion hit charges related to the 737 MAX jet crisis. The shares are up in their premarket trading. Clare Sebastian joins me now.</p><p>I mean, it's a whopping great sum, Clare, here. But for me, the assumptions being made by Boeing are almost a bigger issue here in that they're expecting these jets to be back in the sky in the fourth quarter of this year. Bold assumption at this stage.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, bold, Julia, especially given how fluid this situation still is, but you're right, these are big numbers and the costs do seem to be mounting for Boeing when it comes to the 737 MAX crisis.</p><p>Let's take a look at the bill that they've talked about so far. That $4.9 billion charge, they say mostly related to customer compensation and concessions; add to that, also announced yesterday $1.7 billion in costs related to production delays, also another -- on top of another billion they announced in the first quarter.</p><p>And they didn't even mention yesterday, Julia, the $100 million fund that they've set up to compensate customers. So, the numbers really are growing.</p><p>But as I said, this is extremely fluid. I think it's telling that the company hasn't updated its 2019 guidance yet. They said again, yesterday, they're not ready to do that. We've got a lot of wildcards. They haven't presented the software fix to the F.A.A. yet, the Boeing official has told CNN to expect that around September, and after that, there are even more uncertainties. What will the global regulators do? Will they follow in the footsteps of the F.A.A.? So, there's a lot of uncertainty around these forecasts.</p><p>But I think, the reason why we see this stuck up today is that Boeing is trying to get out in front of this to kind of ring fence the risk around this problem and to reassure investors that it's doing that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you make a great point. I mean, it was down a couple of percentage points yesterday. I guess, that's the only joinder here. But to your point, I think as well, the estimates here from analysts are so wild at this stage, no one can really predict when they're going to get these jets back up into the sky.</p><p>So, the fact that they're actually making provisions, taking charges and saying, look, even if we're going to -- you know, pay out this money over numerous years, but how you're going to try and get in front of it and take a big hit now?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, I think that's a reflection of also how they expect to compensate customers. I don't think it'll just be cash payouts, it'll also be in the form of potentially reduced price tags for the planes they haven't delivered yet, reduced costs of parts and perhaps even services.</p><p>So, there's a lot of different ways that they can do that. But look, the airlines are struggling, the timelines have been slipping as to when the flight cancellations are going to end, the U.S. airlines have pushed out their cancellations now to the beginning of November.</p><p>We've also had recently from Ryanair in Europe that said it might even have to close some bases because of the delays in these deliveries. The airlines, of course, don't forget are also facing pressure from the pilots, many of whom are flying these 737 MAX planes and hadn't really been working since the planes were grounded in March. They've also launched some class action lawsuit.</p><p>So, there's a lot of kind of trickle down pressure here, and I think that's why that there is uncertainty around these forecasts -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, absolutely. Clare Sebastian, thank you for that. All right, it's been 50 years since the first man walked on the moon and there are celebrations planned at NASA's Mission Control in Houston. Rachel Crane is there for us.</p><p>Rachel, what a time to be there, to be part of the celebrations. Talk to me what's planned, and what it feels like?</p><p>RACHEL CRANE, CNN BUSINESS INNOVATION AND SPACE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Julia, first I want to just stop and pause and revel in the beauty of this incredible rocket behind me.</p><p>Now, this is a Saturn 5. It's the same kind of rocket that flew all the Apollo missions, and of course, put Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon nearly 50 years ago. And while it's on its side, right now, when standing upright, it's as tall as a 35-story building. So, just to give you a little bit of perspective.</p><p>And when it was fully fueled up, it weighed over six million pounds, had over seven million pounds of thrust. But of course, most of the rocket was comprised of fuel. The bit that was really important when they were in space was this end bit right here, the brown portion being the command module where the astronauts were housed.</p><p>And of course, this week, is a time that people all over the world are taking stock of this incredible achievement. Because, of course, this was a huge win for NASA and America. It really was an achievement for humanity.</p><p>So, people from all over the globe, in fact, 45 different countries are coming here to Johnson Space Center to take part in the celebrations and the galas, all of the events surrounding this historic achievements -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. And of course, what we've seen in just the last few weeks is the United States once again, saying look, we're going to put a woman on the moon, we're going to get to Mars. The United States, I think back here wanting to lead the charge to get us back up into space and not take anywhere near 50 years to at least have the conversation and get doing it.</p><p>[09:15:02] CRANE: That's right. You know, NASA recently announced the Artemis program was going to be moved up from 2028 to 2024. So, if all goes to plan, a man and a woman will be on the moon in just a couple of years.</p><p>So, a lot of excitement surrounding you know, the new commercial space race, but also NASA's own plans to once again return to the moon and use that as a stepping stone to get to Mars. That's always been NASA's ultimate objective to get to the Red Planet.</p><p>So, once again, you know, an incredible, exciting week for people to relive the historic achievement of going to the moon, originally, in 1969, nearly 50 years ago, but a lot to look forward to in the near future -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. And what an incredible backdrop, too, but Rachel Crane, I'm very jealous of you today. Have fun. Now, speaking of rockets and moon shots, I could be heading to space as a journalist, at least the administrator of NASA didn't say no when I practically begged him and didn't really give him a choice actually. That fun interview coming up in around 30 minutes' time.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we're following around the world. The German Chancellor say she stands in solidarity with the United States Congresswomen targeted by Donald Trump's racist tweets. Angela Merkel say she's distancing herself from the attacks and said America strength lies exactly in the fact that people from different backgrounds come together as one nation.</p><p>CNN has learned the game plan U.S. House Democrats plan to use for Robert Mueller's upcoming testimony. My apologies, they've got the game plan House Democrats plan to use for Robert Mueller's upcoming testimony. The focus will be on several instances of potential obstruction of justice by the U.S. President, as laid out in a Special Counsel's sweeping report. Democrats will also press Mueller on contacts the Trump campaign had with Russia.</p><p>Police in Japan have identified the man suspected of starting a devastating fire that killed 33 people. They say he suffers from an unspecified mental illness. He is now sedated in a hospital, but is not under arrest. The deadly fire at Kyoto's Animation is the country's worst mass killing in almost 20 years.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but up next -- ban or a bargaining tactic, our exclusive interview with Huawei's Chief Security Officer.</p><p>And AB inBev canning its IPO for now, but getting a cash injection by selling its Australian business for billions of dollars. Stay with us here on FIRST MOVE.</p><p>[09:20:40] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the floor at the New York Stock Exchange where we are looking at a solidly higher open for U.S. stock markets this morning.</p><p>Blue chips and tech names like Microsoft, of course looking set to outperform the debate. Of course, continuing over what kind of rate cut we get from the Federal Reserve at the back end of this month.</p><p>The debate will continue. I'm sure, we'll talk it through in a second. But remember, the ECB is also meeting the European Central Bank next week. Do they give more guidance on stimulus?</p><p>South Korea, South Africa, Indonesia -- all cutting rates this week. Global stimulus is the phrase. Microsoft shares, as I just mentioned, set to be higher up almost three percent premarket, so we'll keep an eye on those two. Lots of discuss.</p><p>Fortunately, Julian Emanuel joins us now. Chief Equity and Derivatives Strategist at BTIG. Julian, great to have you with us.</p><p>JULIAN EMANUEL, CHIEF EQUITY AND DERIVATIVES STRATEGIST, BTIG: Always great to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, you said months and months and months ago, way before anybody else that you thought the Federal Reserve would cut rates twice this year, and now everybody agrees with you, I think. Some perhaps thinking a bit more here.</p><p>EMANUEL: Yes, no, I mean, it's amazing that three months later, we find ourselves almost seeming hawkish, when people thought we were kind of crazy back in March and April.</p><p>We think actually that sentiment is a bit overdone, 50 basis points on July 31st would be a very difficult message for the markets to understand.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Well, I mean, they are starting to price it and obviously we had the confusion yesterday over some rhetoric from the Federal Reserve. We spoke to Jim Bullard at the St. Louis Fed yesterday, and even he as a dove said, look, 50 basis points, half a percentage point in July is overdone at this stage. What's the market thinking here?</p><p>EMANUEL: The market is sort of addicted to this notion of easy money. And the reality is, is that a rate cut here is not a vaccination against the global pandemic. It's a flu shot. Okay. It's basically something to keep the economy on track to help buoy sentiment. And, you know, sort of spite off the psychology that a flat yield curve is putting in people's minds with regard to a recession.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Recession, right. We talked about that, too. But actually, one of the other things that stood out for me was just how bearish, how concerned he was about trade, and the idea that even if we get a U.S.-China trade deal this year, it doesn't mean the trade tensions go away, either between the United States and China or other countries. As far as they're concerned, trade tensions are here to stay.</p><p>EMANUEL: Well, you have to go back to last year to fully understand that the fact is, the Fed made an incorrect calculation that a trade war would be inflationary. It has never been inflationary, it is not inflationary. What tends to happen is that the volume of activity slows down.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>EMANUEL: In this case, what you're seeing is global supply chains being disrupted, and those things don't fix themselves in weeks or months, they take quarters.</p><p>So, the residual effect, even if you do get a deal goes on into 2020. There's a lot of adjustments.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, talk to me about your S&amp;P 500 target, the 3,000 target this year, because I mentioned just coming into this interview, it's not just about the Federal Reserve supporting the economy and the markets inadvertently. Other countries are now using the opportunity to cut rates, emerging markets, Europe, lots of Central Banks here are stimulating.</p><p>EMANUEL: Well, we think about our 3,000 price target a lot in the way we thought about our Fed call. When we stuck to our guns in January at the depth of the market ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You were right.</p><p>EMANUEL: ... people thought we were a bit crazy. Now, we're here, from our point of view, you've priced in Fed easing, perhaps too much, the nice thing is that earnings are actually coming in better than we expected, which is a positive and bodes well for the rest of the year.</p><p>But look, we've got a lot of geopolitical risk on the table, whether it's in Washington talking about the budget and the debt or Brexit or what have you; and so for us, it's a time for the market to pause and figure out where those risks are headed.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, are you saying that your 3,000 target assumes everything goes smoothly on that front? I mean, Brexit is one you just threw in there, but we don't know at this stage and you could be increasingly alarmed again at the risk of perhaps some kind of messy no deal scenario later on this year.</p><p>Are you assuming that all those risks don't materialize, and then the market can get to 3,000?</p><p>[09:25:06] EMANUEL: Well, what we're assuming is that you sort of have what you've had for weeks and months and almost years, if you're talking about Brexit, a kick the can situation, but to realistically think that all of these issues will go unresolved one way or the other into the end of the year is probably naive.</p><p>So, what we said is, you know, if things break the right way on these issues, you could overshoot that target to as high as 3,400. But we really want to see how things develop, and investors sort of a lack of activity in recent weeks, they're sending that same message.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, you also said, look, a pause at this stage just to sort of consolidate, consider where we are at this stage and what we know and what we ultimately don't know here. You also said in terms of an investor mindset, you say to clients, look, if we see a 10 percent or 15 percent pullback you are a buyer, you're going to buy on dips as we call it. Explain to me how we could see a 10 percent or a 15 percent correction to even have to be in a position where you're looking at then loading up the gain.</p><p>EMANUEL: Sure, well, if we've learned anything over the last two years is that volatility swings and ebbs and flows, and in fact, if you look at the fourth quarter of last year, there wasn't really that much of a fundamental rationale for the market to go down almost 20 percent.</p><p>And so from that point of view, what we tell people is try and take emotion out of it. If at 3,000 in the S&amp;P 500 you feel like your stocks are -- you've got a little bit too much exposure, trim back to the sleeping point and find yourself because it's worked for 10 solid years, down 10, down 15 percent. You shouldn't be defensive, you should find a way to play offense.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And that's the key. Julian Emanuel, thank you so much. Always great to have you on the show and Happy Friday.</p><p>EMANUEL: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The market open is next.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Lots of happy faces and shouting and clapping here this morning at the New York Stock Exchange. We have liftoff for the final session of this week.</p><p>U.S. stocks making gains as we expected. The first week of earnings, 10 percent of the S&amp;P 500 reporting of course this week. Earnings right now beating by almost seven percent. So far, a higher rate than over the past three years, but remember, as we keep reiterating, expectations had been materially lowered coming into this earnings season.</p><p>One stock we are watching though, AB InBev shares are surging as the company announced it is selling its Australian business for some $11 billion just days of course after abandoning its massive Asian IPO. Hadas Gold is on the story for us. Hadas, talk about the sale of the Australian business, a lower growth business, so good news for the company, but also some hints perhaps that we are establishing that Asian IPOs. Talk us through it?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, Julia, if you're a fan of Fosters or Victoria Beers in Australia, then they're about to get a new owner, Asahi, the Japanese beer maker who is buying that part of AB InBev for about $11.3 billion.</p><p>Now, this comes on the heels of that failed IPO for AB InBev of a stake of its Asian business. They pulled that after some investors -- after investors clearly didn't embrace the pricing of the valuation of that stake and it would have been probably the biggest IPO of 2019.</p><p>So, it's big news that it was pulled, but now we suddenly see the sale. Now, AB InBev said that Asahi had tried to buy this part of AB InBev before, but had failed to do so. But this sale, Julia, is all about trying to get down that more than $100 billion debt that AB InBev had after a decades' long acquisition spree. So for them, that's where this money is going to go through, just helping to pay down the debt.</p><p>Now for Asahi, this deal actually makes them a very big brewery. Now AB InBev is still the world's biggest brewery. But for Asahi, this is good for them. It makes them one of the biggest brewers. Now, \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that AB InBev is still exploring plans to actually sell off more parts of its Asia business. So, that is one thing to keep in mind.</p><p>And although the IPO was pulled last week, AB InBev is signaling that it could possibly return to the idea of course, provided that it can be completed as they said at the right valuation -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, as you point out there, the key here, getting that big balance sheets under control. Hadas Gold, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, we are going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE once again. But up next is the U.S. Congress moves to strengthen its power over Chinese tech giant, Huawei. We bring you an exclusive interview with the Chinese tech company's Chief Security Officer. Up next. Don't make a move.</p><p>[09:36:06] CHATTERLEY: The U.S. Congress is moving to block President Trump from unilaterally relaxing restrictions on Huawei. It's introduced a bill to require a vote in both the House and Senate before curves on the tech Chinese tech giant are eased. The timing here is key.</p><p>\"The Wall Street Journal\" reported Wednesday, the trade talks between the two countries at a standstill over Huawei despite the denials of this by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Congress fears the ban could be used as a bargaining chip with Beijing.</p><p>Joining me now is Andy Purdy, Huawei's Chief Security Officer. He has also worked at the heart of U.S. government. He was a member of the White House staff that drafted the U.S. Cybersecurity Strategy back in 2003. Then he went to the Department of Homeland Security, where he led the National Cybersecurity Division. Andy, fantastic to have you with us.</p><p>You've seen both sides, you now work for Huawei. You've worked at the heart of D.C. and obviously the government operations there as far as cybersecurity is concerned. What do you make of the moves by Congress not only to restrict the President, but also to restrict patent sales as well for your company?</p><p>ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: Well, I think President Trump is struggling with his administration trying to protect America from voices inside the U.S. and outside, and I think given the United States' vulnerability in cyberspace, I think the government is bending over backwards to make America safe. But they're going too far.</p><p>We're going to have a direct impact on American customers of Huawei, and we spent $11 billion last year buying from American companies. And if we are forced to go our way, we'll be okay. But in the long term, I don't know that Huawei will be looking back, and I think America will be hurt.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, you said it could cost $30 billion for Huawei if we ultimately see this ban enforced, is that right?</p><p>PURDY: Well, we are projecting up to a $30 billion reduction in our projected revenue growth if we're not allowed to buy from American companies, which, as I said, we're not sure if the impact is going to be that great, but we know the impact on American jobs is going to be very significant, and it's going to affect the whole global ecosystem.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, you said $11 billion there is what you bought in 2018, so, we can quantify the impact. There are companies -- obviously Intel, Qualcomm, Google -- that have felt the impact as a result of this restrictions, but \"The Washington Post\" today is reporting that the White House is pulling those Big Tech giants together to talk to them, arguably, because they're saying to the government, look, this is going to impact our business. It is impacting our business. Do you know anything about that meeting, if that meeting is taking place?</p><p>PURDY: Well, we just learned about it in the press accounts today. It's not surprising. We would have expected and expect that our suppliers would be reaching out to government because if we're going to be allowed to buy from American companies, it's because American companies want to sell to us not because we want to buy from them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What conversations are you having with suppliers? Are they saying that to you, look, we trust your technology?</p><p>PURDY: Well, we're talking about two different things. They are our suppliers. So, they certainly have no question that what they want to sell us is not going to put America at risk.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, they're not taking a view.</p><p>PURDY: That's right, and so the real controversy is about our customers in the United States and around the world. And we believe there are mechanisms like Nokia and Ericsson use to address the risk that provides assurance and transparency.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Nokia is an interesting one, because they have a joint venture with Shanghai Bell that's wholly owned by the Chinese government. I mean, we could argue that Nokia isn't a Chinese company and therefore the treatment here is different, but you're saying the treatment here of Nokia and Huawei is unfair, is that what you're saying?</p><p>PURDY: Well, what we're saying is that blocking Huawei is not going to make America safer, and there are mechanisms that need to be put in place to look to make America safer.</p><p>The bad guys can hack into Nokia's networks, Ericsson's networks and so forth, so we need to make sure there are mechanisms so that whatever products that are used in the United States have gone through independent government moderate evaluation to make sure we're safe.</p><p>[09:40:10] PURDY: And remember, the telecom operators are the ones who operate the networks, and there's close oversight with them as well. They manage the risk effectively.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, the bad guys here in the United States is China. And I guess their argument would be, China is far more likely to tap into Huawei's networks or use Huawei's equipment than it is to go to Nokia because you guys won't put your hands up and say, \"Hey, China has asked us to hand over this information,\" or \"It is allow us to create back doors,\" because if you did, you haven't got a business.</p><p>PURDY: Well, there's some who think that the one of the reasons is that the United States government wants to easily be able to hack into equipment around the world and perhaps they fear, we can do it. But in terms of making America safer, there are mechanisms we can use to show that America is safe.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Are the Chinese government talking to you about those risk mitigation techniques? And what are they specifically? Because we're talking about two things. We're talking about hardware that Huawei produces -- phones, laptops, for example, or 5G networks. Because what we're seeing in Congress is them saying actually, if we allow Huawei to be involved in the United States development of 5G networks, they could ultimately be paralyzed by a bad actor, China acting through your company.</p><p>PURDY: Well, the people speaking out either don't know or refuse to understand the way that telecommunication networks work. They look at the U.K., before U.K. operators have said that despite submissions with our software that we're going to improve, they feel very comfortable using Huawei products because the telecom operators help make the various countries safe.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But the U.K. is separated into core and noncore and they're still pushing their next Prime Minister to make a decision on this.</p><p>The United States is saying there is no difference between core and noncore as far as Huawei is concerned. You are vulnerable to demand orders of passing over information spying from the Chinese government. Can you resist that? As a Chinese company, can you resist that?</p><p>PURDY: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How?</p><p>PURDY: Because we use the example, if we don't have data, we can be forced to turn it over. And the fact is there are mechanisms you can put in place that can guarantee that whatever data we touch will be perfectly auditable and visible. So, we're not able to access the data without it being known.</p><p>And secondly, and this is a potential risk with all the equipment of all the vendors, there are mechanisms to test the products to look for back doors, and that's what the principal deputy -- the Director of National Intelligence Agency said, he said, I can test for that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is it critical, though, to assume that there will be no back doors introduced that when the testing takes place, that you as a company, under the orders of China -- Chinese government -- don't provide samples that have no back doors? Is it possible to work around these?</p><p>PURDY: I don't assume anything. I believe we have to not trust anybody and that we have to make sure they are mechanisms that are proven effective to make sure America is safe.</p><p>And particularly with the role of the operators, the AT&amp;Ts and Verizons of the world, we can be sure that we're going to be safe.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is the U.S. government trying to verify this? Or are you just in a situation where you feel like you're caught in the middle of a far bigger battle over a trade war, and actually, the people that could verify could look at what you're offering here to mitigate the risks on doing it because they don't want to get involved at this moment given the geopolitical concerns?</p><p>PURDY: Well, I think the experts know the mechanisms that can be successful, and part of our point is, block Huawei if you must. But let's do what's necessary to test all the other products because the bad guys can hack through those. Let's make sure we're safe.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you have government workers or those that have connections working at Huawei? Because this is an accusation from Professor Balding who works at Fulbright University in Vietnam. He said he has got -- and found connections between your workers and Chinese government entities.</p><p>PURDY: Well, look at American corporations and the connections between former and current military people in terms of American companies. So my point is, it doesn't matter who the employees are, we need real mechanisms that can prove we are not subject to the undue influence of the Chinese government.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is that a yes? Is that a yes though? Do you have government workers working at Huawei?</p><p>PURDY: No.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No. Categorically no.</p><p>PURDY: Every company in China, whether foreign or domestic has to have a Committee of the Communist Party because they have no operational control over us, just as they don't have any operational control over Nokia operating in China.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, so you can separate the Chinese government from your operations. Who owns Huawei?</p><p>PURDY: It is privately owned.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Its workers? It's a union of workers.</p><p>PURDY: The workers. We have 97,000 workers. Each May, we get our distribution and we're just like a privately owned company in the United States in the same respect.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're not influenced by the Chinese government in any sense?</p><p>PURDY: We are not controlled or influenced by the Chinese government in any sense. We are proud to be a privately owned company and we operate that way. We maintain our distance from the United States government and other governments.</p><p>[09:45:04] CHATTERLEY: How do we overcome this suspicions right now, the concerns? How do you do that? Because there will be people watching here, we have an international audience that are looking at Huawei at this moment, whether it's looking to buy a mobile phone or a laptop and saying, \"What operating system is this going to be able to use going forward?\"</p><p>What's your message about the efforts that Huawei is trying to take here, to say, \"Look, we aren't influenced by the government, we won't be a problem for U.S. technology going forward.\" How do you convince people?</p><p>PURDY: Well, it's three things. First of all, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. We should be allowed to buy all -- most, if not all of the $11 billion in products. So, let's protect American companies.</p><p>Secondly, we're not allowed to sell our mobile devices through the carriers. No one has ever indicated what the security risk. We're on the Android platform. If there's a problem with our phones, we need to raise the security of the entire Android platform.</p><p>And regarding our customers, look at the success of our company. Does it matter to us how much money we make in the United States? Not really. Though we have 40 rural customers, serving rural America who depend on us for high quality service and we want to help protect those customers.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Does your company survive if America cuts you off? Can it survive?</p><p>PURDY: What?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Can Huawei survive if America cuts you off?</p><p>PURDY: Absolutely. The worst projection is it might cause a decrease of our increase in revenue of $30 billion this year. We'll be fine. We're not publicly traded. The leadership is not going to get kicked out. We're going to be fine. But is America going to be fine?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Andy, fantastic to chat with you. We'll get you back, no doubt. Andy Purdy here. Thank you so much.</p><p>All right, on the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, we will speak to the man who is making sure we are moon bound again, and really soon. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back FIRST MOVE. Saturday will mark 50 years to the day that a man from Ohio took a step that would change the way humanity views its place in the universe. Even now, the idea of a person walking on the moon is spellbinding. So, why is it taking us so long to seriously discuss returning? Well, that's what I asked NASA's administrator, Jim Bridenstine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM BRIDENSTINE, ADMINISTRATOR, NASA: In the 1990s, NASA had an effort to go back to the moon and onto Mars. It was called the Space Exploration Initiative. But it took too long and it costs too much and administrations changed, priorities changed and the program got canceled.</p><p>Then in the early 2000s, we had the vision for space exploration. Again, it took too long. It went over budget, and ultimately, the administration changed and it got canceled.</p><p>This is why President Trump and Vice President Pence -- President Trump created the National Space Council and he put Vice President Pence as the Chairman of that Council, and they have said, we want to accelerate the path. Why? Because if instead of a 10-year program, if it's a five-year program, it reduces the political risk.</p><p>So, that's what we're trying to do here. We're trying to go to the moon sustainably. In other words, we're going to stay with international partners with commercial partners, utilize the resources of the moon.</p><p>[09:50:07] BRIDENSTINE: We discovered in 2009 that there's hundreds of millions of tons of water ice on the south pole of the moon. Well, water ice represents water to drink, air to breathe. And in fact, rocket fuel. H20, if you crack it into hydrogen and oxygen, that's the same rocket fuel that power the space shuttles. It's the same rocket fuel that will power the Space Launch System, which is going to take our astronauts back to the moon within five years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And you're saying not only that, but on the moon and then use that effectively as a launch pad for our progress to Mars.</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: To Mars. That's right. The President has been clear, he wants the agenda to be Mars. And so what we're using the moon for is a proving ground. The glory of the moon is number one, we can learn how to live and work on another world for long periods of time, and it's a three day journey home.</p><p>Apollo 13 taught us that if something goes wrong on the way to the moon, you can make at home. If something like that happened on the way to Mars, it would be over. The challenge with Mars is that Earth and Mars are only on the same side of the sun once every 26 months.</p><p>So, when you go to Mars, you have to be willing to stay for long periods of time. The moon is where we can learn how to do that, so that ultimately we can make that journey to Mars.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: They say in space that no one can hear you scream, and while the risks we face there are clearly not as terrifying as the one Sigourney Weaver dealt with and things like \"Alien,\" that doesn't mean they are not serious. Whether its space debris, or potential threats of satellite communication, I asked Jim to explain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: Because space is so existential to our existence. We talk about banking, every banking transaction in the United States requires a timing signal from GPS. And by the way, that's not just the United States, it is quite frankly, globally in the industrialized world.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: The timing signal from GPS. But the power -- electricity on the power bread requires the regulation of the flows, requires a timing signal from GPS. The flows of data on terrestrial wireless networks for your cell phone requires a timing signal from GPS. So, here's the challenge.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Satellites.</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: That's right. So, some of the enemies of the United States, I should say, some of the competitors are developing capabilities that could destroy those satellites, and its anti-satellite missiles, its co- orbital anti-satellite capabilities, and if they were to do that, it would be an existential threat to the United States of America.</p><p>Imagine, no banking in America, no milk in the grocery store. Within days, there would be chaos. That's the threat here that has to be mitigated, which is why the President of United States, President Trump is so focused on the Space Force. And I will tell you, I'm a big advocate of that. I have been for a long time, even when I was in the House of Representatives. He is doing the right thing with the Space Force, because we have to make sure the enemies of the United States know they will get an advantage by destroying space.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, there are people that would look at this and say --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The moon might have not have changed that much over the last 50 years, but Planet Earth has, and that's something NASA is keen to take advantage of -- putting international cooperation at the heart of its vision, even if the U.S. still leads the pack.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: We've had great astronauts from around the world on the International Space Station, and it's also true that we've had experiments on the International Space Station from 103 different countries. It is an amazing tool of diplomacy.</p><p>And ultimately, we want to take what we've developed, what we've designed from an international diplomacy perspective, take it all the way to the moon. We now have a new program called Artemis, named after the twin sister of Apollo. And now when we go to the moon, unlike the 1960s, we have a very diverse, highly qualified astronaut corps that includes women.</p><p>So, we want to build what we call the gateway and orbit around the moon, think of a small space station and orbit around the moon, with our international partners, and then have reusable landers that go back and forth to the gateway for a sustainable lunar presence, proving the technologies, proving the capabilities for an eventual mission to Mars.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is the first woman on the moon going to be an American there?</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: Without question. I will tell you -- I can tell you who I work for, and the answer is yes. And the President and the Vice President are very clear, we're going to we're going to land on the moon within five years and according to the Vice President, he gave a big speech not too long ago by the direction of the President, and he said the next man and the first woman on the South Pole of the moon will be Americans.</p><p>It's also true though that in the President's Space Policy Directive 1, he wants to go with international partners. The reality is, we're kind of the gorilla in the room, because our budget is large. But we want to make sure that all of our partners are with us. And in fact, we want to grow the partnership.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'm not an astronaut, but if you need any volunteers, I am putting my hand up right now. I love space.</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: I think we can arrange that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Great.</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: Remember, we now have commercial crew and commercial crew enables all kinds of opportunities for people that would not be your traditional astronauts at NASA. So, there very well could be a seat for a journalist.</p><p>[09:55:17] CHATTERLEY: Where do I sign? Love. Thank you.</p><p>BRIDENSTINE: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: He didn't say no. Now, if you want to see a moon shot, take a look at the Dow from the day men landed on the moon until today. The Dow was trading at just over 800 points in mid-July of '69. Since then, the Dow has risen more than 3,000 percent.</p><p>Well-known companies like IBM, Coca-Cola and Procter&amp;Gamble were already in the Dow, but the blue chip average also contained long forgotten stocks like Anaconda Copper and Swift &amp; Company. Who?</p><p>The late 60s was also the height of the nifty 50 Investment Strategy. It was a basket of stocks that analysts urge investors to buy and hold forever. Something like McDonald's and Pepsi have done well over the years, but if you bought and held some Nifty 50 companies like Eastman Kodak, you would not be feeling so nifty today. They went bankrupt in 2012. Ouch.</p><p>That's it for the show.

The president is meeting with the governors of Nebraska and Oklahoma and some minority and small business owners just in order to get a sense of where things are going in the great reopening in this economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But we are also watching the fallout right now from that John Bolton book that has reverberated throughout the nation's capital and the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The administration doing its best to make sure it never sees the light of day, but key allegations in that book have already seen the light of day.</p><p>And then, of course, there's that dreamers ruling that goes essentially against the president, and, of course, this book that just rips the president.</p><p>So much happening at the same time. It's a good thing we have got an hour to dig into it.</p><p>Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"</p><p>John Roberts right now at the White House on how they're taking all of this incoming support and I guess fire as well -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: You have got an hour of airtime, but we're here 12 hours a day at least following all of this, Neil.</p><p>The president spent much of today ripping his former National Security Adviser John Bolton who wrote that new memoir, \"The Room Where It Happened.\" The president taking Bolton to task on Twitter and in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, saying -- quote -- \"The only thing I liked about Bolton was that everybody thought he was crazy.\"</p><p>The president adding: \"When you walk into the room with him, you're in a good negotiating position because they figure you're going to war if John Bolton was there.\"</p><p>Democrats, meantime, are furious that John Bolton did not come forward with information as he has in the book during the impeachment inquiry.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi earlier today, listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Didn't seem to matter to John Bolton. He chose royalty over patriotism, and so is going to make money off of his book, I guess.</p><p>I don't want to pay any money for a book that was a substitute for testifying before Congress about the well-being of the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: In his book, John Bolton says that the president's foreign policy was all geared toward his reelection, saying that, in one meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he -- quote -- \"pleaded with Xi\" to buy U.S. agricultural products, so he could curry favor with the Farm Belt vote here in the United States.</p><p>But the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who is in that same meeting, has a different recollection of that. Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: Absolutely untrue. Never happened. I was there. I have no recollection of that ever happening. I don't believe it's true. I don't believe it ever happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: In an interview with ABC, President -- John Bolton says that President Trump is unfit for office, that he doesn't have the competence to do the job, all of which brought this scathing reaction from the trade adviser, Peter Navarro. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: It's the deep swamp political equivalent of revenge porn, that the guy got fired because he didn't obey the chain of command, because he was out of touch with what President Donald J. Trump stands for in terms of foreign policy.</p><p>He created his own autonomous zone here at the White House. He disrespected everybody. He had nothing to do with the China policy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, a lot of people here at the White House are worried about the political fallout.</p><p>The Department of Justice and national security officials are worried about the intelligence impact of this. They say that there is still a lot of classified information in this book, that the scrub for classified information was never completed.</p><p>Federal District Judge Royce Lamberth has set a hearing for tomorrow afternoon at 1:00 to consider a temporary restraining order, Neil, blocking the release of John Bolton's book.</p><p>But Simon &amp; Schuster, the publisher, saying, too late, it's gone out around the world and it's ready to hit the bookstores on Tuesday.</p><p>How about that description from Peter Navarro, the swamp political equivalent of revenge porn?</p><p>CAVUTO: You know what's so wild about it though, John? The genie is out of the bottle. Let's say you even succeed in, all right, we're slapping this down.</p><p>ROBERTS: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: You can't get your hands on it, but everyone has their hands on it now. So it is what it is. It's not as if all the allegations and quotes and statements and references just go away.</p><p>It's out in the public domain.</p><p>ROBERTS: Yes, and all of the bad stuff about President Trump is known. There's -- I read the book last night. There's nothing left in the book that could be politically damaging against President Trump, other than what Democrats make out of it.</p><p>But, still, national security officials say the -- what they call classified information still in the book could be damaging. But anybody who cares about that has probably already got the text of the book, if not a copy of it. And so I think the damage has already been done, Neil.</p><p>It's just a matter of assessing how much potential damage it might have done.</p><p>CAVUTO: This may be a legal question for my next guest, John, but the president was not making secret of the fact that he wanted the Chinese throughout the trade back and forth to buy more agricultural goods, that that was pivotal to the deals's conclusion and ultimate success.</p><p>So I guess it would be a difference to say that and then to take the next leap to say, it would help me out in the next election. But that seems so overt that we already knew his goal was to get the Chinese to -- and demand the Chinese to buy more products.</p><p>So where is the wrinkle here?</p><p>ROBERTS: It's unclear where the wrinkle is, because, if you get China to buy $200 billion worth of agricultural products, and at least a four-fold increase over where they are now, that would play well among voters in the Farm Belt.</p><p>So, I don't think it's too much of a stretch to think that there's a political aspect to that. It's just the way that John Bolton frames it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>ROBERTS: And then he frames other things dealing with Ukraine, other things dealing with Turkey to say, look, that's -- this was a pattern of behavior on the part of the president.</p><p>And it was one that John Bolton says he and other people at the White House could not tolerate, which is why he says he brought it to the attention of the attorney general, who has denied that he brought it to his attention.</p><p>So, there is definitely a lot of he said, he said, she said, he said going on here, and like many of these books, Neil, it's difficult to straighten it all out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, they do back up like planes at La Guardia, though.</p><p>All right, thank you very, very much on that, John Roberts, at the White House.</p><p>Here is the issue in the context of the book that is raising some hackles, where the president, supposedly -- again, this is from Bolton -- asked President Xi Jinping of China to help him win the 2020 U.S. election, and in which he told him at a summit dinner last year that increased agricultural purchases by Beijing from American farmers would aid his electoral prospects.</p><p>So, in other words, he said that, offered that, didn't think that, didn't imply that.</p><p>So what are we to make of that? And, again, almost anyone and everyone around the president right now denying that this was so blunt, even though the goal of more purchases of agricultural goods was the goal all along of everybody at the White House.</p><p>So are we sorting hairs here?</p><p>Andy McCarthy, the former assistant U.S. attorney, FOX News contributor, joining us on the phone.</p><p>Andy, it's one thing. Sometimes, politicians, in crafting trade deals, they can be helped or hurt politically, but they don't make it that overt. Let's take this to the extreme case here, where the president was overt: This could really help me in these agricultural states, helping the farmers. See if you can make this happen.</p><p>How is that different than simply stating what the administration's position was all along, we want you to purchase more farm goods?</p><p>ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Neil, I feel like we're having the same Ukraine conversation all over again...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: ... in the sense that what came up, I think, again and again in that situation was the reality that most of the checks on presidential behavior are not legal, they're political.</p><p>And I try never to get too caught up with whether somebody is being too blunt or not or too -- or not oblique enough. I, frankly, prefer if somebody tells me what they're thinking than tries to play poker face with me.</p><p>But in terms of like the propriety of it, presidents historically meld their own political interests with the national interests.</p><p>And whether we think they're prioritizing the wrong one, like, whether we think that, you know, the president thinks first of, here's what's in my electoral interest, and let me make my policy accordingly, or whether they go the other way, and say, what is -- what is the national interest here, and let me line up my political fortunes with that, because what is good for the country should be what's good for me, to me, that's a political determination.</p><p>It's not a legal one. If Congress thinks that there's a pattern of that, and Bolton seems to suggest this in his book, that there's enough instances where that happened, that, if the House had more broadly charged the president across the board with prioritizing his political interest over the national interest, rather than narrowly targeting Ukraine, they would have had a better case.</p><p>I don't know. But it's a political calculation. It's not really a legal one.</p><p>CAVUTO: Andy, one of the things that Bolton brings up is this idea that what the president did with Xi Jinping in China is far worse and far more direct and far clearer, black and white, if you will, than whatever was hinted at the Ukraine pressure.</p><p>The administration denying that aid to that country was held up because of the government's unwillingness to help out with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and that relationship. I get all that.</p><p>But, here, Bolton is arguing it was far more egregious and this is far bigger an issue. On the legal front, is it? It just seems like different shades of the same, you can kind of look at it as being maybe not the best thing to do, but strong-arm business tactics, and that's it?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes.</p><p>I think, Neil, again, the check on the president is impeachment, right? And, ultimately, impeachment is political, not legal. It's got a legal process to it, but it's still a political calculation, as we saw.</p><p>And I can understand Bolton's case. Let's assume, for argument's sake, that the things in his book happened and they're true. I know there's a counterargument. But Bolton is saying not only the trade issue, but he says that the president encouraged or endorsed Xi's idea of building what essentially were concentrates camps for the Uyghurs.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: So, he's saying if you look at everything he did in connection with China, this is much worse than Ukraine.</p><p>Well, maybe it is. You could say Ukraine was bad, and this is awful. And -- but the question is, is it enough, in terms of the ultimate force of it, that you would make a political calculation that the president needs to be removed from office, that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor, such that two-thirds of the Senate would be moved to remove the president from office?</p><p>And I just think that, given the fact that we have this history in our system of presidents kind of conflating their political interests with the national interests, and the fact that we have an election in four months, and people will be able to weigh what they think of the fairly transactional nature of what the president, how he conducts business, it's a political track.</p><p>We will see what happens on Election Day. I don't think it's a legal thing.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will watch it very closely. Andy McCarthy, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Meantime, the book isn't the only thing getting some currency in Washington right now and slapping down the president, so too a Supreme Court decision that surprised a lot of folks, because, well, the conservatives on the court tipped it to the liberals.</p><p>So, dreamers in this country are very, very happy. And, by the way, so is the president of Microsoft.</p><p>He's next.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, dreamers in this country, better than 660,000 of them, relieved to hear that the Supreme Court essentially said, you can stay here right now, even though the administration was leading an effort to sort of get rid of their protections granted them.</p><p>They are, of course, the children of illegals who came here as babies, or not much older, and, through no fault of their own, are kind of in this legal limbo.</p><p>The Supreme Court effectively said that this is something that's going to have to be sorted out, and it's not necessarily the high court that's going to do that.</p><p>But Brad Smith welcomes this development, Brad Smith, of course, the president of Microsoft, for what it could mean in this country beyond just these individuals affected.</p><p>Brad, very good to have you.</p><p>BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why do you welcome this decision today?</p><p>SMITH: Well, Microsoft was one of the companies that brought this case to the Supreme Court, in part because we have 62 employees ourselves who are registered DACA individuals.</p><p>But, more than that, it really is based on what you said. These are people who came to this country as kids. They're law-abiding. They came forward and registered with the government. And more than that, they are really talented. They're important to our company. They're important to small and large businesses across the country.</p><p>They're especially important. Right now, there are 30,000 of them working as nurses, as respiratory therapists. They are treating people across the country if they come down with COVID-19. We need them.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, when you hear that -- the way this all started, as you know better than anyone, Brad, that this president criticized his predecessor for being arbitrary and capricious in setting up this DACA by essentially executive fiat, executive order.</p><p>The odd thing about the majority 5-4 ruling out of the Supreme Court was, the judges used the almost identical words to describe his actions to end it.</p><p>What did you make of that?</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote the opinion for the court today, crafted a narrow and balanced path.</p><p>They didn't try to issue a sweeping decision that would tie the hands of this administration or another in the future. They did say that this needs to be done carefully and thoughtfully if DACA is going to be changed.</p><p>I think that's the right thing for us to remember. We need a thoughtful conversation as a country about the right path forward. I think it's even worth remembering that, when President Trump rescinded DACA in the fall of 2017, he did it with a six-month delay because he wanted Congress to act.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>SMITH: And that is again where we are. We need the Congress, and not the White House alone, to work on this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. And I think the Supreme Court decision seemed to telegraph that as the only logical solution.</p><p>Having said that, though, this comes at a time, maybe with the cover of the virus or what have you, that a lot of people say the administration is moving to cut back on those who even want legal entry into the U.S. or back into the U.S., those who have green cards and the like.</p><p>I know that's a big base of potential workers for you and other technology companies, scores of companies, period. Is that still a worry for you? The administration is arguing, we want to make sure we know exactly who's coming in here and when and what they're up to.</p><p>But your thoughts?</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think as a company, we aim to do three things.</p><p>First of all, most of the people we hire in the United States are, as they should be, American citizens. Second, we're at a particular moment in time when I think we need to invest in more skilling for the American population. We're seeing digital technologies accelerate.</p><p>As a company, as a country, we need to help people acquire more digital skills. And then there is a role for immigrants who come in lawfully or who have registered properly, say, under DACA.</p><p>In many cases, they're bringing the skills that the country needs. And we need to put all these three things together, because we need to create a future for people who are born here and, in appropriate cases, for people who come here.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, I'd be remiss if I didn't focus on a development that doesn't so much concern Microsoft, Brad, but obviously going after Google, YouTube and all of this about what is conservative speech.</p><p>And many have grappled with that and said that they -- this is part of an effort right now to shut down conservative thought, but all of this coming at the same time regulators here and abroad are going after a number of U.S. technology concerns.</p><p>Do you ever look around at these developments and see fires growing here?</p><p>SMITH: Well, every day, I get up and I see a world that's on fire in so many ways.</p><p>And I do think that many of these fires, these hot issues of the day, do affect technology, and they do raise important issues for the tech sector. And you're right to point out, these concerns about technology are not confined to the United States.</p><p>I do think we're at a moment in time when we in the tech sector need to step up. And, of course, part of the way we need to step up is to ensure that a variety of voices across the political spectrum always have the opportunity to be heard.</p><p>I think that's really the definition of what we expect in the United States. But, in addition, other countries have been calling on the tech sector to do more to fight terrorism online, to protect children online.</p><p>So, there are a number of issues that we need to work through. And, in part, that involves the tech sector doing more itself. In part, it requires a new generation of laws. And it's right that the Congress began to focus on these questions.</p><p>CAVUTO: Brad Smith, I want to thank you very much. I know you have got a crazy day. We appreciate your taking some time.</p><p>Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft.</p><p>In the meantime, no doubt Senator Tom Cotton might have picked up some of Mr. Smith's remarks. There is a focus right now in Washington as to whether big tech is a little bit too big-time biased -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Many conservatives in Congress say there ought to be a law.</p><p>What they're talking about is the big tech companies that have a big tech bias against conservative thought and Republican thinking in general. They're leading an effort right now to target companies like Google and others who practice political censorship that usually goes after conservative thinking and views, not so much liberal thinking and views.</p><p>Senator Tom Cotton is working on a big crackdown. He joins us right now, the Arkansas senator with us right now.</p><p>Senator, good to have you.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: What are we looking at doing here? What do you want to see done?</p><p>COTTON: Well, Neil, too often, big tech companies, especially social media companies, engage in unfair and biased moderation of comments or posts. Sometimes, they delete them. Sometimes, they lock down accounts entirely.</p><p>I revealed this week on the FOX News Web site my own story of that kind of censorship. Just a little over a couple weeks ago, Twitter contacted me about posts I made about the writing and the looting and the way to respond to them and said...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>COTTON: ... these were in violation of our policies, and you have 30 minutes to delete them. They gave us shifting explanations.</p><p>Sometimes, they were conflicting explanations. We called their bluff. We sent them my arguments for why those posts should remain up. We didn't hear back from them for almost two hours. And they said, you can keep your account.</p><p>Now, I'm a United States senator. I have other ways to make my voice heard on the Senate floor, for instance. But just imagine all the conservatives out there on social media or who run conservative Web sites who are at the whims of big tech.</p><p>You saw that this week, when NBC News and Google almost deplatformed The Federalist, a popular conservative news site, for the comments, not articles posted on The Federalist, but for the comments.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>COTTON: So, what we propose to do, Senators Hawley, Rubio, Braun and I, is to limit the immunity that these social media companies have from legal liability if they're engaged in that kind of censorship, that kind of curation of content.</p><p>They can either be neutral platforms, where everyone can speak, or they can be regulated platforms, and have to face the consequences for those actions. But they can't be both.</p><p>CAVUTO: Or you can have no fact-checkers, no one policing, and like the Wild West, right? I mean, there is a separate concern.</p><p>I think Facebook is trying to walk this line: We don't believe in fact- checkers. It can come back to bite us if we fact-check the president or if you fact-check a prominent liberal.</p><p>So, what do you think of that? Is that the solution? Because what's at stake, as you know, Senator, is a very successful, thriving technology industry. And these behemoths, say what you will of them, make Americans a lot of money. Obviously, they make a lot of money, and they are the standard for the world.</p><p>What do you do? How do you balance that?</p><p>COTTON: Well, Neil, at a minimum, these companies need to provide more transparency and consistency.</p><p>Again, take my example from a couple of weeks ago. We got an ultimatum that gave us less than 30 minutes to either censor my own posts or to allow Twitter to permanently lock down my account. They wouldn't put anything in writing. They very carefully avoided putting anything in writing.</p><p>And when we pointed out some of the policy inconsistencies that they cited to us, then they just came up with new explanations. And, again, if they will do that to a sitting United States senator, what will they do to a regular Web site or to conservative citizens who just want to make their voices heard?</p><p>That's why, at a minimum, they need to be more transparent and consistent. And if they're not going to offer that kind of transparency and consistency, if they are going to engage in carefully moderating the content they provide, and censoring opinions that they don't like, even when those opinions garner majority support repeatedly at the polls or in surveys, then they ought not to enjoy the extraordinary immunity from liability that the laws have given them.</p><p>CAVUTO: If I can switch gears a little here, because you're right, there's a back-and-forth here. A lot of liberals have typically gone after these guys who have gotten too big for their britches, so there's an effort to rein them in that way, the same abroad, Senator.</p><p>But I did want to get your quick thoughts on this Bolton book that is out on the president, more or less saying that he got a little too cozy with China and, through Xi Jinping, was even trying to all but plead that the Chinese buy agricultural goods, that it would help him out in the 2020 election.</p><p>A, do you believe that? And, B, if he did something like that, Bolton seemed to be intimating that's an impeachable offense. What do you think?</p><p>COTTON: Well, so, first, Neil, let me say, I haven't read the book. I have seen some of the media excerpts on it. But, no, I thought many of the claims to be simply implausible.</p><p>Let's take one about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Bolton claims that Mike Pompeo passed him a note during a summit with President Trump and Kim Jong-un, and that that handwritten note by Secretary Pompeo insulted the president.</p><p>I find that to be completely implausible, based on my personal relationship and years of history with Mike Pompeo. If it is the case, then Mr. Bolton could presumably produce that note in Mike Pompeo's handwriting, since he is, as everyone knows, a very careful and methodical notetaker and collector of information.</p><p>And I think that one episode reflects on many of the claims. To cite the one you gave, I'm sure that President Trump repeatedly, in his conversations with Xi Jinping, emphasized that America's farmers have not been getting a fair shake from the Chinese Communist Party for years, and that, in fact, that was one of the main objectives of the president in trying to get better trade terms with China, is to get their markets opened up to our farmers.</p><p>That's a completely appropriate posture for the president to take.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will see.</p><p>The passing note thing, you're not buying. I think, at one of the summit events, they were sitting next to each other, Bolton and Pompeo, but it -- you don't think any nasty notes were exchanged. We will see, like you said.</p><p>Senator, Senator Cotton, very good having you, my friend.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>We have a lot more coming up, including in Atlanta right now, where protesters are gathering. Of course, this thing is not going away. In fact, some of the issues that are involved in multiple police incidents, they're not going away either -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, a different type of event in Atlanta, Georgia, today, police in a sick-out because, right now, they're bummed, and they think that everyone is targeting them.</p><p>The story you're not hearing -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, forget about shouting it out, in the case of law enforcement in Atlanta, today, just to a sick-out.</p><p>The fallout from that and what they say is an unfair targeting of all policemen.</p><p>Steve Harrigan in Atlanta with more on that.</p><p>Hey, Steve.</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, the very latest is the two officers involved in that Friday shooting of Rayshard Brooks have now turned themselves in.</p><p>The officer who did not fire a shot, Devin Brosnan, turned himself in earlier this morning. He faces the charge of aggravated assault. He was released on bond after about an hour, but no bond for Garrett Rolfe. He, of course, faces 11 charges, including the most serious charge of felony murder. He could be facing life in prison or even the death penalty. No bond for him.</p><p>And, of course, as this goes on, there has been a reaction from the police in Atlanta. An unspecified number of police did not show up for their shift on Wednesday night. The mayor of Atlanta saying, despite that, the city was still covered. She wasn't sure how many police did not show up.</p><p>Also, the Atlanta Police Department sending out an unusual tweet, saying they were still effectively responding to 911 calls. The police sick-out, which began Wednesday evening, it's not clear if that protest will continue into tonight -- Neil, back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Steve, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Republican Senator John Cornyn on all these developments, by the way, is, I think, among the first establishment Republicans to say Juneteenth should become a federal holiday, and that we should be paying more attention to these -- to these issues.</p><p>Gianno Caldwell, I want to get his take on that, helps out with a lot of these issues, the runaway bestseller \"Taken For Granted,\" in which he sort of chronicles how African-Americans have kind of been following Democrats, and sometimes getting nothing for it.</p><p>Gianno...</p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: ... first of all, on this push to make Juneteenth a national holiday, Democrats are pushing it, now a prominent Republican.</p><p>What do you think of that?</p><p>CALDWELL: Well, I support it.</p><p>And, honestly, what people don't know, Juneteenth was established by Republicans. As we all know, Lincoln freed the slaves. So, I absolutely support that.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, this move to be more conscious of these issues, and then what you have, this sick-out in Atlanta, Gianno, I'm just wondering whether we're treating all sides fairly here.</p><p>CALDWELL: You know, I think what we have seen, especially when it comes to the police, we have seen people rightfully call for reform.</p><p>If you see a recent poll, 59 percent of Americans say that police departments across this country should be reformed. I'm one of those individuals who says that.</p><p>In addition, you see people who are really targeting the police. I'm reminded of an incident in a restaurant where somebody put bleach in some drinks that officers were drinking.</p><p>And it's very, very disappointing, because that's not where we really get true reform. I'm proud to see Senator Tim Scott and what he's doing. I wrote a piece on FOXNews.com that came out today and one the other day where I talked about the Justice Act, and how it is so necessitous to reform the system of police.</p><p>So, there's some good things in here. We talk about body cameras, funding for body cameras, making lynching a hate crime, training for police. Those are all good things.</p><p>But there's something that I did point out which I believe should be on the table. And that's the fear of life standard that a lot of officers have invoked in some of these high-profile cases where, objectively, when we look at the video, we can't understand how an officer would fear for his life and use deadly force.</p><p>People don't understand this, but this came out of the Supreme Court decision Graham v. Connor in 1988, which allowed for officers who believe that it was objectively reasonable to use deadly force to do so, thereby creating an environment where so many officers get off, when they shouldn't get off.</p><p>Now, when we talk about the Atlanta situation, I think that's a different set of circumstances. It's certainly not George Floyd. I think, with that officer, he was in his rights to use force. I don't think that he handled the situation correctly to begin with. He should have been fired.</p><p>He should have de-escalated the situation. But there was an individual running away from him who was looking to aim his Taser at him. So I think that's a different set of circumstances.</p><p>However, in these many other cases, where officers have used this fear of life standard, we have to put that on the table and see what can happen there that we can appropriately use such a standard.</p><p>CAVUTO: What I always enjoy about you, Gianno, is, you don't carry anyone's water. You look at a balanced way of addressing this. You step back, and not speaking simply as an African-American or just someone who might be more of a conservative thinker, just a way to move forward.</p><p>CALDWELL: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's a rare gem, my friend. Thank you very much, Gianno Caldwell.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Makes you think here. There's enough on both sides to at least step back and calmly find a solution to all of this.</p><p>In the meantime, this rush right now to sort of get rid of you have heard about Civil War monuments and even renaming Army bases that might have been named originally after Confederate soldiers.</p><p>Chad Pergram following a new development here, where it extends to portraits of former speakers of the House -- Chad.</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Neil, in just the past few minutes, they have removed some of these portraits of former speakers at the House who had ties to the Confederacy.</p><p>Now, this is not the first time that they have removed a portrait of a former House speaker. Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert had his portrait removed a few years ago, after it was found that he had molested teenagers when he was a high school wrestling coach.</p><p>As you know, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to remove some of the Confederate statues around the Capitol. She could not do that unilaterally. So she has started with these portraits. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): There's no room in the hallowed halls of this democracy, this temple of democracy, to memorialize people who embody violent bigotry and grotesque racism of the Confederacy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: Now, here's the list of the former speakers, Robert Hunter of Virginia, Howell Cobb of Georgia, James Orr of South Carolina, and Charles Crisp of Georgia.</p><p>Those portraits hung until just a few minutes ago by the Speaker's Lobby just off the House floor.</p><p>Now, Pelosi notes that Orr once declared on the House floor that he wanted to -- quote -- \"perpetuate slavery to enjoy our property in peace, quiet and security.\"</p><p>There was an effort in the Senate today to remove Confederate statues at the Capitol, but that was blocked. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell worries about a slippery slope.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Clearly a bridge too far is this nonsense that we need to airbrush the Capitol and scrub out everybody from years ago who had any connection to slavery.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: Now, the next thing to look for is the annual appropriations process. Will there be language in those spending bills, Neil, that deal with trying to remove some of these Confederate statues here at the Capitol, or maybe try to rename some of the military installations?</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Chad, where was this rage, though, to remove these portraits of these former speakers, some of whom's paintings have been hanging out for the better part of a century or more? When did that ever come up?</p><p>PERGRAM: Well, you know, what's funny is that nobody even knew much about these.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated, when they were researching the question of the Confederate statues at the Capitol, it came up about these four figures. I knew a little bit about Cobb, frankly. I know this place fairly well, but I didn't even know much about these speakers. They were pretty obscure speakers, in the vast design of speakers here at the Capitol.</p><p>And Roy Blunt, the chair of the Senate Rules Committee, when he was asked by Cory Booker today, he noted -- he said, maybe this should have been looked at some time ago. There was no outrage from Democrats before.</p><p>But this is going to be an issue that's going to continue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can't just pull out these statues on her own. That's something that they have to have an agreement with the Senate. And what Congress can do, it's up to the states to send these statues. They decide who the statues are.</p><p>But Congress can decide where you put them, and some of them, they can stash in the basement, if they really want to, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Chad, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Be careful what you wish for, I guess to Chad's point here, because what could be next, the White House removing portraits of who owned slaves, and George Washington, Thomas Jefferson? Be careful.</p><p>More after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we had a Republican Arkansas senator, Tom Cotton, on with us earlier who wants to go after Google and companies like that, Twitter, that have what he says is a double standard when it comes to policing content that's conservative vs. more liberal content.</p><p>Steve Moore is as conservative as you get at, but he says, be careful what you wish for, Senator. The FreedomWorks economist, the Trump Economic Recovery Task Force maestro, joins us right now.</p><p>Steve, one of the things that struck me about your position is, it flies in the face of this growing movement to rein in these guys. You're no fan, a biased opinion, of course, but you do see the value a lot of these companies bring in terms of jobs, the money they make, and the influence they have worldwide.</p><p>And they're all American.</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, FORMER DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Well, Neil, you're right. I am a conservative. I do not like the liberal bias of a lot of these big tech companies, whether it's Google or whether it's Amazon or Facebook or Twitter.</p><p>But, you know, what I really do like is how amazing these companies are at doing what they do, which is creating this incredible technological revolution.</p><p>And it's a good time to talk about this, Neil, because we -- I would submit -- and I made this point in my article on FOX News -- that, without the brilliance of our high-technology industries, we would not have been able to get through this pandemic. We would have seen millions of potential deaths.</p><p>People would have -- we wouldn't have been able to have the millions of people working at home. You wouldn't have had -- hospitals wouldn't have been able to function, probably Zoom and all these kinds of technologies that are so new.</p><p>So, my point is like, it's not broke. These are companies that are -- what, five of them are near trillion-dollar companies. Those are owned by Americans, for the most part. And I think it's a good thing that these are American companies, that Google and Apple and Amazon and Facebook are American companies, at a time when we're concerned about China trying to take over the technology industries.</p><p>CAVUTO: Does the president know you're saying this and writing all this stuff? Because that could be troublesome for you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MOORE: Well, you know...</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm kidding.</p><p>MOORE: Yes, I know.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, Steve, let me ask you a little bit about where this goes, because they want to rein them in, whether it's the Europeans, who want to chop them up, some in Washington want to do that, or at least police how they police their content.</p><p>What do you think of that?</p><p>MOORE: Well, look, I'm not an expert on this content issue, so let me be very clear on that.</p><p>I don't like censorship. And I will just say, if the Congress wants to impose rules...</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, they're saying -- they're saying, conservatives bad, liberals good. That's what it comes down to.</p><p>MOORE: Right. And, look, I think. ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: And Republicans don't like that.</p><p>MOORE: And you know what?</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: I have told some of these executives in Silicon Valley, you guys are being very foolish here.</p><p>I mean, why would you want to alienate half of your consumers by being so liberal, by giving 90 percent of your money to Democratic liberal causes? And I think that's going to hopefully change over time.</p><p>My point is that these are great companies that have created great technology.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>MOORE: By the way, while you have got some people on the Republican side attacking these companies, let's not forget you have got Elizabeth Warren, who is about as liberal as you can get, who wants to break up these tech companies through antitrust violations.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's right. That's right.</p><p>MOORE: I don't like that idea at all.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>By the way, this is as close as you're ever going to get to the White House right now with what you're just saying.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: But, Steve Moore, thank you very, very much.</p><p>That was a very bad joke, and I will just move on.</p><p>We have much more after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, the president's Tulsa rally is still on, his first big campaign event after the whole coronavirus situation.</p><p>Casey Stegall in Tulsa with virus concerns that are still out there, some even being espoused by prominent Republicans who love the president -- Casey.</p><p>CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Neil, there's a lot of mixed reactions on the ground here in Oklahoma.</p><p>The mayor of this city says that they're very honored that the president chose this location to restart his campaign rallies. But you also have health officials that say they're worried because of the timing of this event and because it is at an indoor location, especially after a recent uptick in new coronavirus cases across the state of Oklahoma, especially in Tulsa, where the just this week the county has recorded its largest single- day increases of new cases since this pandemic began.</p><p>But it appears plans are moving forward. So they have issued this morning:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. BRUCE DART, DIRECTOR, TULSA HEALTH DEPARTMENT: I know so many people are over COVID. But COVID is not over.</p><p>COVID is here. It's transmitting very efficiently in our community. If you're in public, wear a mask, social distance, pay close attention to handwashing and hygiene, and keep yourself safe and healthy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEGALL: President Trump, anxious to get back on the campaign trail, quoted in The Wall Street Journal saying, \"It's going to be a hell of a night.\"</p><p>The president and his administration largely downplaying the latest COVID numbers, attributing these spikes to increased testing and media hype.</p><p>But the scientific data does show that overall COVID hospitalizations in a state like Texas, for example, have increased 84 percent since Memorial Day. Leaders in Austin and in San Antonio have issued orders requiring face masks now to be worn inside of businesses, Houston and Dallas considering similar ordinances.</p><p>And just this afternoon, the California governor also requiring basically all Californians to wear a face mask or covering anywhere essentially outside the home, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you very, very much, Casey Stegall in Tulsa, where the rally is still on Saturday night, one way or the other.</p><p>It will be vastly oversubscribed.

We welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. Merry Christmas everybody. We know what the president wants for Christmas, credit from all the media for all of his achievements. He tweeted; sadly the fake mainstream media will never talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews. We're compiling a long and beautiful list.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, Mr. President stick around, I'm about to talk about your impact. Plus, with 750 million packages delivered by UPS this holiday season, a growing number are being stolen by so-called porch pirates. I'm about to talk to a man who has figured out how to fight back with a bang. Plus, did you ever talk about something on your phone and suddenly start seeing ads for it? Is it a coincidence or our smart phones spying on us? And, a look back at some memorable moments on both sides from 2017 including everybody's favorite blooper, by your truly.</p><p>George Papadopoulos, Papadopoulos, Papadopoulos, Papadopoulos, I know, I'm a dope, I'm a dope. But first, we're almost one year into the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>and the end of any year is a time of assessing. Especially this one. Mike Allen had an interesting observation this week in his \"Axios\" news letter. He pointed out how little <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and perceptions of him have changed in the last year.</p><p>Think about it. Roughly the same number of people support him today as did at the beginning of his administration. The Russian probe has remained constant. The elected Republicans remain skeptical of leadership, but largely compliant, the elected Democrats, they still don't like him. The war with the media has never subsided and neither have his Twitter fingers.</p><p>All true, but there's a temptations in those observations to conclude that him administration, the passage of the tax bill not withstanding is static, gridlock, that nothings getting done in a polarized climate. That would be a mistake. In fact, if the pace of change continues for the duration <person><nameText>Trump's presidency, </nameText></person>however long that might be, I think he could become the most consequential president in the modern era. Consequential meaning, most important and significant, having the biggest overall impact.</p><p>As with the criteria that \"Time Magazine\" uses when determining its person of the year, this is not necessarily a good think. Think about it. A Supreme Court position, that was by rights a Democratic pick, instead went to Trump. And his influence on shaping the federal (ph) is far greater than just <person><nameText>Neil Gorsuch </nameText></person>on the nation's highest court.</p><p>He broke a Senate record this year by confirming a dozen new U.S. circuit court judges, the most during a President's first year in office in more than a century. At the rate that he's going, by next year, more than 12 percent of federal cases heard will be by Trump appointed judges. Those picks will be his longest lasting legacy. The tax bill that he's just signed is the first major overhaul of policy since the Regan era, whatever the effect, that won't be undone anytime soon. And by ending the individual mandate, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has fell a major domino that will upset the economic viability of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>After all, how can you provide coverage with those with preexisting conditions if you don't have everybody in the insurance pool? Trump has made cutting federal regulations a priority. He's revoked 67, he's delayed or derailed more than 1,500 others. He's pulled out of the Paris climate accord, okayed the keystone pipeline, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and refused to recertify the Iranian nuclear deal.</p><p>On his watch, the Iraq Prime Minister just declared victory over ISIS; the \"New York Times\" Ross Douthat called it a war Trump won. In immigration enforcement, ICE has arrested more than 100,000 people who entered the U.S. illegally, 70 percent of whom were already convicted criminals. His State Department has undergone massive restructuring and shrinking, again, for better or for worse.</p><p>And don't forget about the influence that ideologically driven members of his Cabinet are having out of the spot light. Betsy Devos in education, Scott Pruitt at the EPA, Ben Carson at HUD, Rick Perry in Energy, Jeff Sessions at Justice. No, \"Time Magazine\" got it wrong. When not naming the President, it's person of the year in 2017.</p><p>[09:05:00]</p><p>By their own definition, the person who most affected the news and our lives for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year was absolutely, Donald J. Trump. Joining me now to discuss, Douglas Brinkley, he's a presidential historian and history professor at Rice University and Larry Sabato the Director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.</p><p>Larry, he's getting lots done but without popular support. Can that continue?</p><p>LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR POLITICS UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: I doubt it. Look how difficult it was to get that tax bill passed, and he never could get Obama Care repealed. I know about the individual mandate being abolished but that's not the same thing as abolishing Obama Care. And this was with a new presidency usually coming with some kind of honeymoon.</p><p>Republican majorities in both houses, I grant you, thin majority in the Senate but still most new presidents with the majority in both houses get a great deal done. I would say that while certainly Trump has accomplished some things, and I agree with you on the (ph), he could have accomplished a great deal more if he were a different kind of president. I don't know bout being the most consequential, but I'll tell you this, he's the most different president in the modern era.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I think everybody could agree on that including the president. Douglas Brinkley, there's a lot to be said for that which takes place through inaction. Differentiate between action and inaction and what it means for this presidency?</p><p>DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, HISTORIAN: Well, just take a look at what you said pulling out of the Paris Accord. Yes, he did that. What does that mean in the end? And it means that <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>turned his back completely on climate change. What history may show is the overridingly important issue of our time. I mean, we've having unusual wildfires, hurricanes, glaziers melting, the planet is really alarmed right now and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>decides it doesn't exist; I don't want to believe and listen to the scientist. So by that very inaction this year, we're losing momentum.</p><p>We're not educating the society on what to do to make some changes with climate change. I just picked that one. You can go all over and see, you know, he's gutting the Environmental Protection Agency by 33 percent. Okay, you can save some money right now and you'll also make a little money with being a mining and leasing of the public lands. What does that mean long term?</p><p>What does mean 100 years from now? When we start just willey nilley, you know, desecrating public lands for gauging quick gain profits. Conservation is always about our children's children. So there's a lot that went on this year that I don't think is going to shine well on history. They'll be remembered for Charlottesville, Pocahontas, NFL issues, issues that divide the nation on race and identity.</p><p>SMERCONISH: You know what occurs to me, Larry Sabito, is that everything that Douglas Brinkley the historian says might be true and yet it will be seen differently in different ends of the county. For example, the laundry list that he just rattled off of the negatives will be embraced by the 46 percent that put him office.</p><p>SABITO: Well, you're probably right about that. At least most of the 46 percent. Remember, he has dropped somewhat. He's in the mid thirties, maybe you could exaggerate it up to 40 based on the fact that the polls often underestimate his support, but he has lost support. Why is that? Because, as Doug was suggesting, he is terribly divisive.</p><p>Instead of trying to bring people together and this is not an era when you can bring people together, but he could of won a few percent more. He could of won a few percent more. He could of won over some people who are kind of in middle about him to begin with. Instead, because of what he has done and because of the way he does it, Michael, he has divided people. I think more than in any time since perhaps the last year of Richard Nixon's presidency. That is not a good thing. It is not a good thing that we are now truly the dived states of America. Red states over here, blue states over there. And oddly enough, those purple competitive states, they're also choosing up sides.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Gentleman is it possible to put this in some historical perspective. I want to show you what the president said yesterday. And then Douglas, I'll ask you to respond first. Roll the tape.</p><p>(START VIDEO)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Legislative approvals, for which I'm given no credit in the mainstream media, Harry Truman had more legislative approvals than any other president. We beat him on legislative approvals, for which I get no credit.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: Historian, Douglas Brinkley, he references Harry Truman, who comes to your mind if anyone?</p><p>BRINKLEY: Well, just Harry Truman created the CIA, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Council, the Pentagon, the Department of Air force, the Secretary of Defense Ship, I can go on and on. What did <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>create this year? What is going to be remembered for? I mean, John F. Kennedy in his first year in office, Michael, did some bold things.</p><p>[09:10:13]</p><p>He said we're going to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade and he started getting money put in the states, like places like, Alabama, Houston Texas, infrastructure money on technology that worked with the space program. Kennedy created his first year of the Peace Core, Alliance for Progress. What's Trump known for? All over the world he's seen as a bully.</p><p>That's the net take away at the end of the year. And perhaps a bigot. And so it's very hard to see why history's going to be shinning a great flashlight on a president with 35 percent approval rating. The lowest since poles have been taken. Whose big home run was a tax bill that doesn't really excite people. It is a success at the end of year and he did get Gorsuch in but it's been a very rocky first year.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Doctor Sabato, I think what he's achieved is that which he said he was going to do. Which was largely, for better or worse. To reverse Obama iropolocies(ph).</p><p>SABATO: Well, you're correct on that too Michael. Let's talk about what that means though. When you base your presidency around your base, your party base, and you are unable or incapable of bringing some people from the other party in, in the long run that means the same thing is going to happen to <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>What karma that's happening to Barak Obama, Obama's presidency is being deconstructed piece by piece. Trump and his appointees are pulling out by the roots Obama Cares policies and regulations and programs. Look, at some point, I don't know when is it, 2020 is it 2024, can't tell you. But at some point, you will have a democratic president a democratic Senate and a democratic House again. And I can almost guarantee you, I can almost guarantee you that the democratic base will insist that the democratic president and Congress do the very same thing to whatever is left of Trump's legacy.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Can I just say as a final word to both, Douglas Brinkley and Larry Sabato, I worry most about a crisis. Knock on wood; we really not had one in the first year of his watch. And I worry about what happens in a very polarized setting. In one of those moments when in another time we would most certainly rally around the flag. Happy Holidays to both of you. I really appreciate your expertise. Perfect guest for today. Thank you, sir.</p><p>SABATO: Thank you.</p><p>BRINKLEY: Thank you, Michael.</p><p>SMERCONISH: What are your thoughts? Tweet me @smerconish, go to my Facebook page. I will read some responses throughout the course of the program. What do we got Katherine. Can you give the Trump bashing a break? Why not point out the positive facts versus the negative opinions, Smerconish? Trisha, are you blanking me? That was the most; I wrote every word of it myself, that was the most even presentation of what this year has been that you will find anywhere.</p><p>That's not an MSNBC view, that's not a FOX view that is a straight down the middle assessment of for better or worse here is what has just transpired. And it gets frustrating for me for people who hear what they want to hear, hear what they think they hear and just don't listen clearly. One more if we've got time for it. You're paying of Trump was disgusting, see what I mean?</p><p>This shows your true preferences. I mean, Rajiv, can you please get together with the last Tweeter and maybe the two of you can work it out. It's remarkable how people hear the same thing and just take away from it different conclusions. Up next, it's peak package delivery season, which means porch pirates are in full thievery mode, but one man hopes to tort them in an explosive new style. Is it wrong that I laugh every time I see that?</p><p>[09:15:00]</p><p>SMERCONISH: Hey, this holiday season with all those packages being shipped around the country, what can be done about the growing problem of porch pirates? UPS estimates it will deliver 750 million packages this Christmas. That's a 50 percent increase from just five years ago. And when residents aren't home and no signatures required, thieves can get to the packages before the consumer. A recent report says that at least 23 million Americans have had packages stolen from their porches, their mailbox, and their stoops. The \"New York Times\" reported the case of a Tucson woman robbed of a package sent from an Oklahoma funeral home. It contained her father's ashes.</p><p>My next guest tried to foil robbers by capturing them on surveillance video but there were never any arrests so he decided to fight back. Joining me now, Jaireme Barrow. Jaireme, I understand that what like 20 people stole packages from your stoop before you were able to figure out a response.</p><p>JAIREME BARROW, INVENTOR OF THE BLANK BOX: Good morning Michael, yes yes, 20 at least.</p><p>SMERCONISH: And, and one guy who stole from you dropped his cell phone and he lived, what, three blocks away?</p><p>BARROW: Yes, he was really close. He, it was funny watching him run off of my front porch. I didn't notice it until after watching surveillance camera. I saw something fall out of his pocket in my yard and I noticed it was his cell phone.</p><p>SMERCONISH: All right, you have developed, you are the inventor of the Blank Box. We're going to pull the camera back, explain what it is, and do a demo.</p><p>BARROW: OK, so this is the Blank Box that comes with this frame, made in America of course, it goes inside this box right here. And then this is the Blank triggering mechanism. It's pretty simplistic; only one moving piece unless you count the guy running off your front porch that is. So what you do is you take it and you slide it over top and it is fully moveable.</p><p>[09:20:00]</p><p>You can move it around anywhere you want. And then once you lift it vertically is when it goes off. And just hope this shell isn't the one out of a thousand that happens to be a dud. So you wrap it up, put it on your porch and when you lift it, there you go. See, completely harmless. You know, there's nothing that penetrates the box, the blank shell, just a loud noise.</p><p>SMERCONISH: So I understand that the local police say we have no investigations pending but you're not allowed to assemble explosives and you would run afoul of the law if that were the case.</p><p>BARROW: Well I don't know who you've talked to, but it's a blank shotgun shell is not considered an explosive.</p><p>SMERCONISH: So you have no worries about tangling-by the way, here comes the guy with the hood. Hopefully you can see this. And he lifts it up and, boom, it goes off. And then he stumbles out the back, falls down, gets over the fence. What do you know about that?</p><p>BARROW: Great. I mean I think it's, it's, basically the thing is a viral video in a box. I mean it's awesome to be able to see karma served instantly. You know these people are coming here trespassing to commit a crime and it's just nice to see them leave empty handed.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Do you have any litigation worries? I mean I am trial lawyer. I am not one into bashing the trial bar, but some minds say that if somebody should get injured, that there would be an issue. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>BARROW: Well, like I said, I have a fence, no trespassing signs, I also have a label that says do not touch anything on my porch. I reference this just like any other alarm system. It's a loud noise just for effect. Just like a car alarm when someone's breaking into your car and they get scared and run off and hurt themselves. I don't see them suing you for your alarm system being on your car. So I kind of relate that to (INAUDIBLE) package.</p><p>SMERCONISH: All right, so now, now, here's a guy in shorts, kind of a husky fellow there. It's just happening. All these all legit images of what has happened at your place?</p><p>BARROW: Yes, 100 percent. I don't have to, I don't have to fake viral video, take videos to have it, you know, go viral. It's just the neighborhood I live in. I don't think it's just a (South Koma) issue, it think it's a worldwide issue now with everybody moving to ordering things. Go ahead.</p><p>SMERCONISH: OK, I, I, I saw the guy with the hoodie. I saw the woman. I see the heavy-set guy. I mean the people who are these porch pirates; they seem to cut across all demos. It's pretty scary stuff.</p><p>BARROW: Yes, it runs, it doesn't matter-race, religion, age, they are everyone. You know, it seems like that make it a 9 to 5 job just driving up and down the street to steal whatever they can get their hands on. I live on a busy street so it's a little bit more predominant in my neighborhood than in some, but you know I've tried to build a fence. That didn't stop them. I mean this is the only thing that I have found that works.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Do you have a favorite story, a favorite anecdote of how the Blank Box has succeeded thus far and if so, tell it.</p><p>BARROW: So far, the last video the guy looked like he was doing the invisible box challenge on my front porch. He was trying to run so fast that he forgot there was a step there and was trying to run on air. It's just, it's just a great feeling to know that someone didn't get away with something that I have worked hard to buy.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Is it wrong that I'm laughing every time I watch this? I guess you're the wrong person for me to ask.</p><p>BARROW: No, I think you're in good company. I mean I've got nothing but positive reaction online. It's fun.</p><p>SMERCONISH: All right. Good luck with your business. People can go to the website. I know you're hawking the tee shirts there as well. Show everybody your tee shirt before you leave me. Don't touch my package, I get it.</p><p>BARROW: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMERCONISH: Yes. I'm not sure we should say what that one says. But OK. Jaireme, thank.</p><p>BARROW: Go ahead.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Thank you Jaireme. I appreciate it.</p><p>BARROW: Michael, Merry Christmas.</p><p>SMERCONISH: And to you. Merry Christmas to you as well. Made in America he said. The President will love that. All right, Katheryn, what's the reaction to the Blank Box?</p><p>I may have to get this. I loved this. No Michael, it's not wrong to laugh, thank good. It's darn funny watching that mischievous would-be thief skedaddle the hell away. Saxon, so well said. Coming up, when you see an ad, this is going to be great, when you see an ad on social media for something you were just talking about, is that a funny coincidence or is your cell phone eaves dropping on you?</p><p>[09:25:00]</p><p>SMERCONISH: Is you phone spying on you for advertisers? I keep hearing stories of ads that seem to pop up coincidentally for products you were just talking about. Consider this experience of my neice. She was merely talking about shopping for a bra of all things. And then, low and behold, in her social media, this ad popped up. I asked my Sirius XM radio audience if anything like that had ever happened to them. Here are just two of many examples.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My husband and I went to a buffet-style restaurant. I chose a piece of lemon pie and we sat at the table and talked about it. Since then I've been bombarded with lemon pie ads and recipes. I asked my son who is in IT and he thinks I am crazy. I don't know, it's the craziest thing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I had my iPhone next to me and I was talking about how I needed to get an oil change. Maybe four hours later, three hours later, I got on some of my apps and there were ads for oil changes in my Facebook feed.</p><p>(END AUDIO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: So is it all a coincidence or an Orwellian plot to track out thoughts. Joining me now, CNN Money's Business and Technology Correspondent, Samuel Burke. Samuel, I have come to expect that when I am looking at something online, I am leaving a marker, or a cookie, but is there some level of microphone or camera surveillance from my phone as well?</p><p>[09:30:00] SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENCE: Michael, there have been cases of hackers accessing the cameras and microphones on our smart phones. The smart phone makers have quickly patched that. But there's really no real evidence to suggest that any of the big tech or social media companies are somehow surreptitiously using the camera mic to listen to what we're saying and then target ads. But if any of those tech companies told you that it was a complete coincidence that somebody talked about something and then it showed up on their Facebook page or other social media type pages, that would be complete bologna. Nothing is a coincidence in the world of targeted marketing.</p><p>They're pulling data from us with all different types of methods. Facebook doesn't talk about this very often, but when you buy something at the pharmacy, they know what you're buying maybe at the corner store because of the loyalty card. So I could go and buy some M&amp;Ms at CVS and it could pop up on my Facebook page because they have all that data connected. That's why it's happening. They're not listening but it's no coincidence.</p><p>SMERCONISH: You know what makes me suspicious? You reference Facebook. This brings to my mind that picture that went viral of Mark Zuckerberg that when you zoomed in, you saw that there was a piece of tape over the camera, yes, there it is, there was a piece of tape over the camera, on, on his laptop.</p><p>BURKE: Well, that's because he's smart and he knows that hacking is a real threat. I mean he's seen it especially this year. But the message that they use, they're usually pretty clear about and unfortunately we've tolerated them for too long. Let's just take Gmail for instance. That's the email that so many of us use. For years, they were skimming through everything that you wrote and they were showing you ads based on that. I started out as an intern at Anderson Cooper's show, so it said Anderson Cooper in my email. What did I get? And ad for Anderson Cooper's book. That message was seen as so ugly by so many businesses that used Gmail that Google at the end of this year is turning it off. I tell you this example, they say, \"We don't have to put up with all this.\" Business said, \"No thank you.\" Google is turning it off completely now for everybody- business and personal. So a lot of these messages that people don't realize, we can stand up and say no thank you and eventually the tech companies could, and maybe in some cases, should cave.</p><p>SMERCONISH: OK, but how do you explain the radio listener. She sounded very earnest. I'm inclined to believe her, with the lemon pie. She's sitting there talking about lemon pie, now she gets ads for lemon pie. I mean is there some algorithm that's figured out, \"Hey this is a lady who would probably like lemon pie.\"</p><p>BURKE: Oh it's absolutely an algorithm and I don't doubt anything that she said. But odds are if she ate that lemon pie at that buffet, she's maybe gone to her grocery store and purchased a lot of lemon pies. And like I said, they connected that data and figured it out. Another example I have that shows you don't even have to be so blatant. I've never put that I'm Jewish on Facebook, and Facebook wished me a happy Jewish New Year. So how does it know? I call it Jewish by association. They looked at my Facebook page, figured out mom, dad, brother are Jewish, and they've said, this is how we do this type of thing. Even your political leanings. You can go onto Facebook, you and I will tweet this link as soon as this segment is over, you can go on and look and see and Facebook will tell people all the time, we think you're liberal, very liberal, conservative, not just based on how you list yourself what you can do, but based on the people you know. So it's very straight forward, some of the methods. And, some of the other ones like Jewish by association, liberal, conservative by association that these algorithms are figuring out.</p><p>SMERCONISH: All right, one more. My eldest son came home from college sporting a growth like the old man. And he tells me he's now getting beard product ads in his social media.</p><p>BURKE: So if I had to guess maybe he went on Google and typed on beard trimmer and that's why he's getting that. That's the most obvious ones, but I think it's the -</p><p>SMERCONISH: He says no.</p><p>BURKE: He says no, but chances are if he's sporting a beard like that, someplace he said it. But we do have to think about the fact that we're putting microphones in our homes with products like Amazon's Echo. The Google Assistant, which you can use your voice with. When you do a search with that using your voice, that data is used, and so it's no stretch to know that one day the companies could be using this. But again, I think we got stop, stand up, talk about this a lot, and make sure they stop before we get to that Orwellian society that it feels like we are on the verge of if we're not already there.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Samuel, great stuff. Happy Holidays. Thanks for being here. Thank you. Let's check in on your tweets and your Facebook comments, what do we have?</p><p>This from Facebook. I think these people are crazy and just don't realize they Googled it. Jeffrey, they may have, they may have but they may not have. I mean I-I-I see the example of leaving cookies everywhere. It's not a leap of faith for me to assume that somehow they're much more knowledgeable about me than just the websites I Google. Hey, still to come, it has been a crazy year but difficult to keep up.</p><p>[09:35:00]</p><p>2017's memorable moments as well a few things I simply could not remember. George Papadopoulous, Papadopoulous, Papadopoulous, Papadopoulous, Papadopoulous, Papadopoulous. Kathryn, did I say Papadopoulous incorr-I did didn't I? Just never put that in the prompter. I can't handle the word.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Hey it has really been quite a year and sometimes it feels like we just lived several years. So in this, our last live show of 2017, I want to thank you for watching and revisit some moments that typified our time together. Every week I strive to present</p><p>[09:40:00]</p><p>different viewpoints from Patricia Arquette to Pat Buchanan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>PATRICIA ARQUETTE, ACTRESS: People, I think, were really depressed when you won and needed to come out and say we're afraid for our country. We're afraid for democracy. We're afraid for civil rights.</p><p>PAT BUCHANAN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR: But you know all this talk of bipartisanship. Look the American people didn't vote in November of last year for bipartisanship.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: Often times we've been ahead of the curve like when months ago I asked Green Party Candidate, Jill Stein, about that now notorious photo of her, Michael Flynn, and Vladimir Putin at a gala for Russian TV station RT. That's a subject now being investigated.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>JILL STEIN, 2016 GREEN PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That's funny Michael, you have to ask, why is that picture kicking up a storm right now, that the Democrats are looking for someone to blame. They're looking at <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders. </nameText></person>They're looking at James Comey. They're looking at me. I think the Democrats really have to look internally. People have had it with being thrown under the bus.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: I'm also not afraid to admit when I've been wrong. More than a decade ago I criticized Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters for defending the rights of Gitmo prisoners at a New York City concert very close to Ground Zero. Now, with some still held without a trial, I had to acknowledge he had a point and that sometime listening to great music means listening to someone who's message makes you uncomfortable. Here's some of what he told me in our sit down.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>ROGER WATERS, CO-FOUNDER OF PINK FLOYD: The problem is that entertainment has gotten mixed up with news and in consequence, he's actually, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is great for the mainstream media because he's such a buffoon.</p><p>SMERCONISH: What would you say to someone who is looking for escapism? They're not coming to -</p><p>WATERS: Katy, Katy Perry, you know, watch the Kardashians. I don't care what, you know whatever you want to do, go and escape.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: After tweeting at me to compliment something that I'd said here on CNN, Arnold Schwarzenegger invited me to his home in Los Angeles to talk political polarization and gerrymandering. Instead, what made news was a final throwaway question about a tweet from <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>attacking Arnold after \"The Apprentice\" was cancelled.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: Why do you think the President is fixated on you? Why does he keep talking about you through his twitter feed?</p><p>SCHWARZENEGGER: I think he's in love with me.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Is that what it is?</p><p>SCHWARZENEGGER: Yes, I think so.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: That response was all anybody talked about. I worried that nobody had paid attention to the topic at hand. Then Arnold sent a note and he said this, \"If we can get people to pay attention to seven minutes of gerrymandering, to hear me say that the President might be in love with me, I'll take it.\" And he was right.</p><p>I also conducted what was Bill Cosby's only pretrial interview before being tried for sexual assault. He was guarded, of course, but I found the conversation was a roadmap of Cosby's defense in the upcoming preceding that ultimately ended in a hung jury. Most memorably, he quoted a philosophy that I've seen attributed to a feminist icon, Gloria Steinem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>BILL COSBY, ACTOR: The truth shall set you free, but first it might piss you off.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: After a terrific wide-ranging interview with sports casting legend Bob Costas, I kept him around for viewer tweets which included an interesting proposal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: I always and still believe Bob Costas should moderate presidential debates.</p><p>BOB COSTAS, SPORTS COMMENTATOR: I do not expect to be.</p><p>SMERCONISH: If asked, would you serve?</p><p>COSTAS: No, no, no.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Well why?</p><p>COSTAS: Despite what some people who don't want to make valid distinctions think, I talk about certain political issues when they have obviously intersected with sports. And I think in that respect I stay in my lane.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: Four days after the mass shooting in Los Vegas, I was in Vegas to give a speech. I had a pre-existing commitment to have a drink with former Mayor Oscar Goodman, whose wife is the current mayor. He was angry. He was wounded on behalf of his city but I admired his carpe diem mentality.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>OSCAR GOODMAN, FORMER LAS VEGAS MAYOR: I'm having a drink you bet I am because this guy isn't going to change the way I spend my life because I know he's rotting in hell in eternal damnation and I hope that Mangle(pf) is his roommate. How do you like that?</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>SMERCONISH: We've really had a good year and that's due to lots of hard work and preparation from many people whose faces you never get to see-Kathryn and Korina, David, Dick, Adam, Chloe, T.C., and the gang here at VideoLink in Philadelphia, our director David, and Troy and their crew in Atlanta, and still, some of the most memorable moments have been unscripted, the joys of live TV like my inexplicable inability to enunciate a name in the news.</p><p>George Papadopoulous, Papadopoulous, Papadopoulous, Papadopoulous. I know I'm a dope. I am a dope. Listen, put that camera back on me. Look at this.</p><p>[09:45:00]</p><p>SMERCONISH: Inability annunciate a name in the news. George Papadopoulos, Papadopoulos, Papadopoulos, Papadopoulos. I know, I'm a dope, I'm a dope. Listen, put that camera back on me. Look at this. I can't say it, I'm never going to live it down. I'm never going to live it down. Papadopoulos, Papadopoulos, I love responding spontaneously to Tweets like those that come in from the TV audience. Here is a classic. Smerconish, you are an asshole. I am, you are correct. You only respond to Tweets that align with you.</p><p>Trump is right, and you are stupid to realize it, RSVP. Hey Lynn, I think I just did. And by the way Lynn, have you noticed on balanced? That the Tweets that get put on the screen are not the ones that kiss my, well, the word you just used. I also occasionally feel compelled to reply to recent public Tweets by our Tweeter in chief. The President up early and Tweeting again, this time about his desire for equal time on TV.</p><p>Come on Mr. President, you have your own channel. And you're welcome here on any Saturday of your choosing. And I will treat you with dignity and respect. That offer still stands in 2018. And finally, this year my family holiday Christmas card was easy to select, it's a picture from an event that caused me, one of my only absence from my, absences, what's wrong with me, absences, absences, see it's live TV. The only the day I took off this year, all right? Was for our daughter's wedding.</p><p>There were several who worried, or maybe hoped, that I'd been fired, to whom I say, not yet. Mine was an excused absent, our daughter was being married. And for once, I didn't sit in the middle. I sat on the bride's side. Boogying to Scarlotte Bingonous. Hey Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everybody and I will of course see you I hope in 2018. Still to come, your final Tweets and Facebook comments of the year. Like this one, Smerconish, your Papadopoulos moments are some of my favorites. Hey Diane, wait until you see what mistakes I will make next year.</p><p>[09:50:00]</p><p>SMERCONISH: Hey please remember to follow me on Facebook and Twitter. Here some of what's coming during the course of this program. Smerconish, lay off the eggnog. Trump is the most damaging president USA morals and standards in modern history. #dumptrump Debbie, I knew when I wrote that opening commentary, where I argued that he is the most consequential president to the modern era, that some would interperate the word consequential in the a favorable light.</p><p>I went to get tides to say, I'm using the same definition that \"Time Magazine\" uses when they determine who should be the person of the year. It's a for better or worse thing, but respectfully I say, you're kidding yourself if you think that this is not a very impactful presidency that is unfolding. And I laid out all the reason why I believe that to be the case. But I think you're misinterpreting the way in which I delivered it. Hit me with another one Katherine.</p><p>What do you got? Smerconish, by your assessment Osama bin Laden should at one point have been \"Times\" person of the year? Von, absolutely. Absolutely. And and the year was 2001 and Rudy was the \"Time\" person of the year. And I certainly understood that and had tremendous respect for Rudy Giuliani impact in New York City in the aftermath of September 11. But, would you really argue that in 2001 Osama bin Laden wasn't the person who had the greatest impact on world events?</p><p>Of course he was and in that instance, \"Time\" took the easy way out because I'm sure there would have been enormous blow back if they pinned that on bin Laden. Many people regard it as an honor, when it isn't. What's next? Smerconish, my neighborhood has at least 20 packages stolen everyday. One person has been packing up cat poop in hers. I like it. I like the cat poop, now listen, if you combine the cat poop with the blank box that that gentleman was here selling, then you would really have something that, come on, let's watch it again.</p><p>A little cat poop in there and then the explosion would be terrific. Give me another one. Smerconish, here's the issue. Who eats lemon pie in the first place? Very suspicious. Come on Brian, that was on of my radio listeners. I thought she told a very compelling story and then there's the guy who needs an oil change and he say so and the next thing that happens is adds pop up for an oil change. My son just home from school sporting a growth. Now being hit with beard ads. I said, did you Google any beard products? He said, no dad, I didn't.</p><p>What's next? Smerconish, Peter piper picked a peck of pickled Papadopoulos. Merry Christmas. Thank you, Dawn. Yes, on radio I never struggle with it. It's on television. Something about seeing it in the prompter. Time for one more. Better be a good one. This is the final Tweet of the year.</p><p>[09:55:00]</p><p>Smerconish, now that Mr. Trump has given me permission, may I wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Wait a minute. Did Mr. Trump give me permission to wish a Happy New Year? Greg, I don't know if he did or he didn't.</p><p>So I'm wishing, I'm wishing everybody Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Kwanza, Happy New Year, whatever you're celebrating, I hope you're safe, you're happy, you're with friends and family, and that you'll come back to us in 2018. Thanks everybody.</p><p>[09:55:33]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

As part of its unrelenting vendetta against President Trump, the Times published a column by someone who they do not identify.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are trying to make the story a media malfeasance story and I find that kind of outrageous, when the content of this op-ed is totally directly echoing the Woodward book is about completely an unstable president, who can't be trusted.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anyone who would betray the man they work for, the President of the United States, is a delusional, egomaniacal, self- aggrandizing, jackass.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The New York Times -- if someone wants to write an op- ed like this, resign and put your name on it because this is just gossip.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Should the paper have published this anti-Trump scream. And what about the president saying that the Justice Department should investigate the unnamed aide? This as Bob Woodward's book, Bombshell, portrays the White House as crazy town. And President Trump hits back hard at the country's most famous investigative reporting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The book is a work of fiction. If you look at Woodward's past, he had the same problem with other presidents. He likes to get publicity and sell some books.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The criticism would be you talk to people who had an axe to grind against the president.</p><p>BOB WOODWORD, WASHINGTON POST: That is just not true. Look, I talked to dozens and dozens of people and have notes and documentation on lots of things.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bob Woodward's new book on the Trump administration is like nothing we have ever heard. Oh, actually, it's like everything we have heard except worse and scarier.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here's the problem. The president didn't get on the phone and say these things to Bob Woodward. There are a bunch of people who say that the president said these things.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's time for the Republicans come to say the Trump presidency is a national emergency.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A brand new book, Bob Woodward, filled with speculation, rumors, hearsay, apparently of hundreds of anonymous -- anonymous painting the Trump presidency in a very negative light.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Are the attacks drawing blood given Woodward's records since Watergate? And do the denials by John Kelly and Jim Mattis undermine the book's credibility.</p><p>Plus, Serena Williams melts down, as penalties cost her the U.S. Open. And many women, media, sports charge the umpire was sexist or is it just sour grapes? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is MediaBuzz.</p><p>What began as a media furor took a more serious turn when the president said the Justice Department should investigate the person I call deep-state throat. The unnamed official who said in that New York Times op-ed that Trump is immoral, and unstable, and anti-democratic, and that this person and other officials are part of a resistance movement, quote, like-minded colleagues are about throw thwart parts of his agenda and his inclinations. His impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed, and occasional reckless decisions that have to be walked back. The president responded on a Washington event, and with Fox &amp; Friends.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: So if the New York Times has an anonymous editorial -- can you believe it? Anonymous meaning gutless, a gutless editorial, we are doing a great job. Because really what they have done is virtually, it's treason.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: The president also suggesting that this official if the person exists, he says, committed treason. And the Times must release the name for national security purposes. Joining us now and analyze the coverage, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor, Sara Fischer, media reporter for Axios, and Philippe Reines, former State Department official under Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Mollie, the President Trump says Jeff Sessions he should be investigated the unnamed author of this op-ed piece, exactly what law will this person be violating?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, I'm not sure that this something that rises to the level of the Department of Justice investigation. But it's certainly an interesting story that we have someone who is claiming to have a power unto themselves, this is a person who is not elected, this is a person -- we don't know who it is, so there is no way we can hold him accountable. We don't even know which agency he's in, and yet he's claiming to be involved in policy make and law making that the people have no right to know who they are.</p><p>KURTZ: You said -- you said this week, that this piece was a threat to our democracy, an op-ed piece?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Because what it signifies. And I actually think it's fine for the New York Times to publish it. And I think it's helpful for the New York Times to publish. There have been all these allegations usually by Trump people saying that there is this deep-state or a hidden bureaucracy that's actually unaccountable to the people and it's engaged in nefarious activity.</p><p>For this person who went to the New York Times and said that's absolutely true, this is against our constitution. Because in our constitution, we have government of the people, by the people, and for the people. And we have accountability for them. When they're secret and they're in a bureaucracy, we have no way to hold them accountable.</p><p>KURTZ: Sara, we don't know how senior the senior administration official is, but if Times editorial page editors who obviously know who it is, I think this is a high level and credible this person is making serious charges against the president from within the palace, it's news worthy, but should it be published.</p><p>SARA FISCHER, AXIOS REPORTER: Well, it really depends on how senior that official is. And we're not going to know. I mean...</p><p>KURTZ: We'll find out eventually.</p><p>FISCHER: We'll find out eventually. And that's the thing, right. If the New York Times was to publish this, knowing that eventually something is going to come out about who it is, then they are risking their credibility by not actually having a senior person be the person who offered this, if that's the way they're marketing it. But we're starting to see some things might be pushing back on. We heard Michael Barbaro, the New York Times daily Podcast reporting saying yesterday that the way that they way that they call the senior officials is the same way that they use in editorial standards. We see how the New York Times reports about senior White House officials in editorial standards. It's not always someone who is directly linked to the president.</p><p>KURTZ: That's entirely possible. Now, Philippe, Times editors say they are proud they published the piece. Of course, they are proud. The editorial page detest President Trump. And you tweeted that this all plays into Trump's hands.</p><p>PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL UNDER HILLARY CLINTON: Well, first of all, it is a good get. So I think any paper probably would have done it. It does like Mollie say, play into the here is a great example of the deep state. The problem is...</p><p>KURTZ: Conspiring some would say...</p><p>REINES: It's not the problem.</p><p>KURTZ: The newspaper that comes...</p><p>REINES: Yeah, but whether it is five minutes from now or five days ago, we're going to know who this person is. This person works for Donald Trump. So if you want to call him gutless, he's employing gutless people. I should also say, Mollie kept saying he. We don't know if it is a man or woman, but there are a lot of problems to this that we won't know until we find out who it is. I think there are a couple. One is be careful who you hunt for because you may find them. This is someone who might be 10 feet away from his office. It could be someone who is two agencies away. It's not me. It's not some guy off the street. It's someone he knows.</p><p>KURTZ: Well, the president called the source gutless. We heard that clip. And he has a point. And along you said the source is cowardly. Even if you buy into his -- I shouldn't the person's self-righteous, self-aggrandizing view that we are saving America from an erratic and crazy president. Didn't he undermine their own cause by bragging about it in a national newspaper, infuriating Trump, and limiting the ability of aides to restrain the president?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I wasn't a very smart by this person. But also, if you actually read the editorial, he says -- and I'm only saying he because New York Times referred to him as a he.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: He says the economy is doing really well, national security is great, foreign policy is doing well. But it turns out Donald Trump acts like Donald Trump in meetings. I think the American people actually knew that when they elected Donald Trump as president. So it seems petty and small compared to the claims everything was going very well. So why he would think to do this when nothing new was shared in this op-ed is bizarre.</p><p>KURTZ: I also think I believe that by immediately attacking the Times and attacking the unnamed source, the president has given rocket fuel to this story. It might fade after a couple of days. But when you work in the Obama administration, you were involved in hunting down a White House official with a rogue Twitter account. So you know what it's like to have somebody within snipping at the president or the administration for whom he works.</p><p>REINES: Yeah, there was someone who weren't going to handle him for a couple of years. He sent about 2,000 tweets hitting pretty much everyone in town, not just Democrats or Obama, but Republicans. It got under a lot of people's skin, and kind of a side project, a bipartisan team got together and kind of did an Osama bin Laden search. It took us six months.</p><p>KURTZ: With guns blazing?</p><p>REINES: WE set a trap and we found him. It turned out he worked on the NSC. And had a very sensitive job and he was called in and fired. And that's what I'm saying. You don't know who you are going to find. You know, the president has been complaining about leaks for a year and a half and he is now wrong. But what happens when you find leaks in the course of this? You know, someone e-mailing personally the course of this.</p><p>KURTZ: But when the president says this could be treason. He demands the Times turn over the source, which of course it is not going to do because of promise of confidentiality and anonymity, whether that is right or wrong. What's he talking about? There is no classified information here. It's an op-ed attack on the president. Is it political betrayal, yes. Is it a firing offense, yes. But where is the national security component.</p><p>FISCHER: There is no national security component and it is not a crime. This is why the DOJ is not necessarily suited to be investigating this right now. But this is just the type of rhetoric that Donald Trump uses when he wants to create a wedge between the mainstream media and his face. He will call it treason, he will call it whatever he has to call it to undermine the credibility of what the New York Times published.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I wouldn't go overboard with that, though. When you have a rogue and unaccountable person who is thwarting by his own claims the will of the people, that's a very serious domestic threat. There will be a threat no matter who is president, whether it is Barack Obama or Donald Trump. The people have a say. They voted for this person and that means that he's the person held accountable.</p><p>REINES: They shouldn't need DOJ, this is not that tough. Also don't forget, a year and a half ago, someone was leaking these transcripts of his phone calls.</p><p>KURTZ: Which I criticized at that time. No president should have to put up with that. And by the way, the media's guessing who it is...</p><p>REINES: There are all these people.</p><p>KURTZ: The media is always guessing who it is, I think is really unfair to a lot of names. We absolutely nothing to do with this, and I won't repeat all the names. All right. Let me turn to the Bob Woodward book because many of the same themes about aides documented by Woodward, he says who were trying to restrain the president. So some of them were recorded to saying, of course, the president is an idiot, he's a liar, he's off the rails, he's operating at a 5th or 6th grade level. The president hits back and said, the book is fiction, lies, boring. I guess those are words you can say about the author.</p><p>So I can tell you, Mollie, from my firsthand knowledge that Bob Woodward is a meticulous reporter. And while some Trump officials are denying the comments to them, he says, I've got hundreds of hours of tapes and transcripts and documents. So it's hard to fully discredit his book.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I think it claims against Bob Woodward aren't that he makes up quotes, it's that he has a way of reporting where he just talks to just a certain type of people and doesn't get the full story. The type of person who is going to talk to Bob Woodward is the type of person who is going to trash a principle or what not. And then, because this is anonymous and non- accountable, it is hard to know how seriously the take is.</p><p>KURTZ: Sara, let me read you a tweet from the president about this book. He's talking about some of the senior officials around him. Their quotes were made up, frauds, and the president does say that, Mollie. A con on the public, we've put that up, likewise other stories and quotes. Woodward is a damn operative? Notice timing?</p><p>Now, you can say a lot of the things about Bob Woodward and his techniques can be controversial. And there are often denials about some of the things he reports. But he has written books on both Democratic and Republican president. A Dem operative? I mean, you can't dismiss this guy like Omarosa.</p><p>FISCHER: No, you can't. And I think that definitely pushing it a little bit too far. I was reading the Obama administration talking about how they handled it when Woodward came to them, and he said look, I have information, I have some stuff on tape and I have all these quotes. And he was saying that the administration took that seriously. They thought a look into it. They thought this was a credible report. It's fascinating to see the difference in this administration. It's just complete -- this is false, this can't be true. There is no really dealing or working with them. And when apparently, Bob Woodward tried to get Donald Trump to talk to him, to be on record with the book, Kellyanne Conway said I will put in a request.</p><p>KURTZ: We're going to play a little bit of that in the next segment. So, Philippe, you know, Woodward's style has always been controversial because you know he has this style that leaves room for people to deny. We've had hard denials from people like Madison Kelly. And he's accused as we saw in the clip earlier of giving more sympathetic treatment to sources who cooperate. Does that undercut the book to some degree?</p><p>REINES: Well, first of all I think to what Sara is saying about the Obama administration, the scariest five words in D.C. are Bob Woodward called for you. And there is a reason for that. Yes, there might be elements that when you read and you were a participant, might seem that they are torqued up maybe a couple of degrees, that they happened. I mean, he captured the essence of things. So I don't think you can attack and sell the book the way the president has, although the president has a knack and frankly it pays off for him to just shellac people and make stuff up.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I think precisely what you hear about critiques of Bob Woodward, if are he doesn't get a picture of what's happening. And the best critiques of Bob Woodward are about how he treat John Belushi, when he wrote the book about John Belushi. And Belushi's friends and families say he totally missed the story, he totally got rocked.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. Let's go back here.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: They're not saying -- they're not saying he made anything up, but then he missed the story.</p><p>REINES: John Rumsfeld (ph) said I don't know what you're talking about, I never talked to him. And Bob Woodward, he went to the tapes.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. I got to wrap this up. You know, the president is denying. In fairness of that, he called Jeff Sessions a dumb Southerner and other things. So we have some real factual disputes. By the way, Woodward on CBS this morning said he wouldn't have used the anonymous op-ed writer's charges without a lot more specific details. All right. More on the Woodward book in just a moment, as we look at the White House kind of attacking.</p><p>And later, Serena Williams getting hammered for her blowup at the U.S. Open, what some female sportswriters insist she was robbed.</p><p>KURTZ: While President Trump has been denouncing Bob Woodward, he offered a more positive assessment last month in a call taped with the veteran journalist with the president's permission and released by the Washington Post.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Who did you ask about speaking to me?</p><p>BOB WOODWARD, WASHINGTON POST: Well, about six people, you know.</p><p>TRUMP: They didn't tell me. Nobody told me about it. And I would have loved to have spoken to you. You know, I'm pretty open to you. I think you have always been fair. So we're going to have a very inaccurate book, but that's too bad. But I don't blame you entirely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Well, I do believe President Trump didn't know Bob Woodward had put in all these requests?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I don't mean to disrespect the president, but I wouldn't say he's always telling the truth in these types of phone calls.</p><p>KURTZ: OK. You know, it's not like we haven't read stories like this before. I mean, Kelly wasn't the one who denied it, but in the end, Rex Tillerson once called him a moron. There is a lot of stuff in my book, Media Madness, about the staff trying to restrain him or slow walk things or end run him. Some of this happens in every administration. But what the mainstream media love about this book, I want your take, is that they can say, aha. All the bad stuff we've been telling about the president is true. His own people say it, same thing with the anonymous column.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, I mean, it's a story that we've heard frequently before. I've talked to some of these people who have fights with the president. And they characterize it very differently. So they say they do have battles, they do fight. At the end of the day, the president gets to say which way the direction is going to be, and then, they have to follow it. I think how you interpret these comments from people say a lot about what type of journalism you're doing. If you see it as some sort of nefarious proof that Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency or adults who have debates, and then they make a decision.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. Well, Woodward's former partner, Carl Bernstein, says on CNN that the Trump presidency is a national emergency. So, Philippe, as a former government bureaucrat, even in more traditional administration. White House aides who were split into factions, try to end run, or slow walk policies they don't like, or sometimes leak against each other or even against the boss.</p><p>REINES: But that's a challenge that reporters have to face every single day, whether it's an author or whether it's the New York Times, or the Fox News.</p><p>KURTZ: What challenge?</p><p>REINES: The challenge is whether you're talking to someone who says something negative about a third person because they have an axe to grind.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>REINES: Because they want to sell, advertise themselves.</p><p>KURTZ: Do you think reporters take that to account or do you think they basically just love the infighting and happy to do it all in?</p><p>REINES: You know, books are very different animals.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>REINES: I have to fend up. But on the one hand, when a book is done right, which you've written, when you spend a lot of time on a topic, you are actually more likely to be more accurate. Because you are not doing the 24/7, you know.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. And people are more likely to confide in you, because on a background basis, because they know you are taking the time.</p><p>REINES: We have to entertain the possibility that Bob Woodward is right in what he is describing.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. So you raised that possibility. But here is something in the Woodward book. It has gotten far less attention. And we're tuning this up for you, Sara. So according to the Woodward book, the chief-of-staff said this in a meeting, I am the only thing protecting the president from the press. The press is out to get him. They want to destroy him. And I'm determined to stand in the way taking the bullets and taking the arrows, spoken as a true general. Gee, that didn't really get much coverage.</p><p>FISCHER: No, but it should have gotten a lot of coverage. I mean, any time you have someone backless to the president, who is saying that he has to be the wall between the president and the media. And we know that this is the role of aides. But this is a fiery thing for him to be saying. And it's something that we've heard in the past from all these other people. But John Kelly is a pretty reserved guy. He's not the type of person that comes out against the press often. So you know he has to mean it if he's going to say it.</p><p>KURTZ: Whether some of these aides at the level of the anonymous column who are trying to let's say restrain the president, whether they're doing the right thing or the wrong thing, I think it's fair to say at this point that President Trump maybe is in a position where he has to wonder who he can trust because of all these leaks that are going on since the day he was sworn in.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And that is -- and that's something he has talked about a lot about the lack of people on his team within the administration. That's why I think this was a silly move by the anonymous author and the media. They thought this was a way to present Trump as yet again the narrative that you've heard over and over again about being unstable. What it really did was confirm just how much D.C. is a swamp, how much they oppose what the people chose in the last election, and how unable they are to deal with the reality of what the American people chose.</p><p>KURTZ: But according to Woodward, the people who are trying to restrain include the chief-of-staff, included the defense secretary, so it's not just you know trolls in the administration. So is it a good thing we have that even though the contents are in dispute.</p><p>REINES: I think it is a good thing. I think it is going to depend on who it is.</p><p>KURTZ: It runs on the Woodward book now.</p><p>REINES: The Woodward book is good. We might not know who these are, but we might end up -- often times, we do learn who they are. But, you know, if Donald Trump woke up last Wednesday morning feeling comfortable with people around him, that doesn't make a lot of sense. His lawyer was taping conversations with him. His closest aides are turning on him legally. I don't think the op-ed is the tipping point.</p><p>KURTZ: And not to mention Omarosa.</p><p>REINES: And not to mention Omarosa.</p><p>FISCHER: Yeah, I was just going to say, if there's one thing to take away from this is that, it's not totally a new story. What bob Woodward is writing, we have been hearing from people within the Trump administration...</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>FISCHER: ... and from people outside it. So even if there are facts or small parts that are disputed, the overall narrative there, we have heard it.</p><p>KURTZ: It's a lot more detailed with some highlights.</p><p>REINES: It's nobody wants to hear, but Woodward might have gotten it right.</p><p>KURTZ: Look how happy he looks. Philippe Reines, Sara Fischer, and Mollie Hemingway, thanks so much.</p><p>Ahead, Mike Huckabee on an intense week obviously of media criticism of the president, anonymous, and otherwise.</p><p>But up next, the Serena controversy. The Washington Post says it is a sexist, power play ruined the U.S. Open Finals. We'll take a whack at that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERENA WILLIAMS, TENNIS PLAYER: You owe me an apology. I have never cheated in life. I have daughter and I stand what's right for her. And I have never cheated. You owe me an apology.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: I was watching in amazement as Serena Williams lost her cool in yesterday's U.S. Open Finals accusing Umpire Carlos Ramos of branding her a cheater. She said he stole the game from her. Many pundits are slamming Serena, but what he did was slapping her with these three penalties did more than cause her one game. It more than robbed of any chance of coming back against her young challenger Naomi Osaka. He took the match away from both women and left them in tears. And Serena said it was sexist.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Because I'm a woman, you are going to take it away from me?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Joining us now, Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent for the Washington Examiner. Susan, Serena's meltdown was painful to watch. And she was close to losing the match anyway, but the commentators are whacking her, really should take a look in my view at the oh-so-sensitive umpire who allowed the situation to keep escalating.</p><p>SUSAN FERRECHIO, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Right. I think you said something that echoed what Sally Jenkins wrote on the Washington Post today, which is he let it get out of control. He could have sat there, taken the insults the way he has from other male players. This is well documented on YouTube, same refs, same male players who attacked him, but he has not docked him points or games. So there is a case to be made that this was a different standard for Serena Williams. And I think as Sally Jenkins said that the issue for her was she felt the umpire was not going to let a woman talk to him that way.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p>FERRECHIO: That's the real heart of the issue here. Did he feel like hey, I am not going to let a woman wave a finger at me without a very serious penalty that I wouldn't have given to a male player?</p><p>KURTZ: Let me read from that because Sally Jenkins, a veteran sports writer, front page of Washington Post, the headline sexist, power play ruins powerful finale. And she said he abused his authority, she said, over a tone of voice. Male players have sworn and cursed at the top their lungs and never been penalized the way Serena was, making your point.</p><p>FERRECHIO: And on the other hand though, if you watched it as I did, as the thing escalated, you know, she played a role in this. She smashed her racket. She waved a finger at the umpire, a big no-no. And it could have appeared -- some people, especially if you read it in social media, it is very divided as you day. People say look, she appeared threatening. She is a hot player, she has a habit over the years of throwing tantrums and threatening line people in the past.</p><p>KURTZ: And on that point, a tweet from Billy Jean King, the great tennis player. When a woman is emotional, she is hysterical. She is penalized. But when a man does the same, he's outspoken. And there are no repercussions.</p><p>FERRECHIO: That's not true.</p><p>KURTZ: OK. Sometimes look, John McEnroe.</p><p>FERRECHIO: A whole page worth of penalties and fines, he was ejected from games.</p><p>KURTZ: Sure. But just explain to people. There are two warnings and then the penalty that caused her one game as she was in the process of perhaps the second and final set. The coach gave a signal from the stands that it's illegal. A lot of people didn't realize that.</p><p>FERRECHIO: He admitted it, too.</p><p>KURTZ: He admitted it, but Serena said she didn't see it. Then, breaking the racket, he could have let that go. And then, when she'd called him a thief, I mean, she didn't curse as some players have.</p><p>FERRECHIO: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: But that's when he took away a game and really made this I think more about him than the players on the court.</p><p>FERRECHIO: Well, that's what the game became. Yeah, for both players, it was ruined. You know, the whole ending was just so emotional. It was deprived of the joy you would experience from beating your role model. The whole thing was just a disappointment for everybody. So everybody can point fingers at the ref. But the players ultimately are responsible for their own behavior. They have to decide good sportsmanship on the court, talk about the problem later, when you get off the court. That's something every player grapples with.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>FERRECHIO: Not just men versus women.</p><p>KURTZ: Sure. But you know, calling such things is subjective. It is a matter of discretion. And just to be clear, this was unfair to Naomi Osaka, who has you know first Japanese, she is also an Asian player to win the U.S. Open. She was in tears. He ruined her moment, and he ruined Serena's attempted comeback. And she of course a year ago almost died of complications from childbirth. So you know it should be about the players. In an NBA Final, you wouldn't call foul on the last play unless somebody got decked.</p><p>FERRECHIO: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: So do we agree on that point?</p><p>FERRECHIO: We do agree on that point. It also follows on the female player penalized for changing her shirt in the middle of the match. There's a pattern here. And then, Serena Williams being told she couldn't wear certain outfit.</p><p>KURTZ: The cat suit.</p><p>FERRECHIO: Yes. So you know, this is following a pattern. A lot of people, not just Chris Everett and Billy Jean, her contemporaries are saying that this needs to be looked at how men and women are treated differently by the umpires.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah. I'm not letting Serena off the hook for her conduct, but this does show I think that this treatment has a lot of people up in arms, including the press. Susan Ferrechio, thanks for playing with us on this.</p><p>Ahead, the New Yorker who wanted to put Steve Bannon on the stage until some big named Hollywood types threatened to boycott event.</p><p>But first, Mike Huckabee on the press versus the president, the former governor will be here.</p><p>KURTZ: President Trump and the press unleashing some of their harshest language yet against each other. Joining us now is the second most famous person in his family, Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate, and a Fox News contributor, welcome. So the thrust of the media coverage over the New York Times senior official trashing the president is that this person is a coward and should just resign. And then, even many liberals are saying that. Given that this person is talking about administration officials, actively undermining the president, why shouldn't the Times publish this?</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think they shouldn't have because to do so gives some type of credibility to a person who hasn't have the guts to stand up and say here I am. Howie, if you run for office, you put your name on the ballot. If you are going to undermine the people who do have the guts to run for office, then have the guts to tell us who you are, so we can evaluate and hold you accountable for your views.</p><p>If you really think the country is in trouble, stand up and say so. This guy is, I think, a gutless coward, or girl, we don't know.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p>HUCKABEE: And I thought it was sleazy for him to say the things he did because we don't know what level of government. He could be a fourth-tier person in Montana federal office.</p><p>KURTZ: It took 33 years to find out who deep throat was.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Exactly.</p><p>KURTZ: I don't think it will take that long for this one. So the president comes out and says that Jeff Sessions of the Justice Department should investigate this secret source. On what grounds? What's the criminal offense? May have been political betrayal, as I said earlier? Maybe stupidity? Certainly, a fiery offense.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yeah.</p><p>KURTZ: Criminal investigation?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, it depends. Is this person also telling things that he or she knows of national security to the New York Times? We don't know. The point is that we do know...</p><p>KURTZ: That's not what was published.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But I think what the president is saying is it's serious. Let's just believe in that general way. It is serious. And it is serious for someone who gets a paycheck from the President Trump administration to betray the trust of that. So give up our paycheck, go out on the streets.</p><p>KURTZ: And say whatever you want.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Say whatever you want. You have free speech, but you don't have freedom to do it with somebody else paying your salary.</p><p>KURTZ: So that account and the Bob Woodward book and other stories have painted a portrait of top aides, some say they believe in the president, but they're working to restrain him from what they see as some of his worst impulses. At some point, shouldn't the public conclude that there is something here, that there is some truth to these journalistic accounts?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Not necessarily. Look at these accounts, what are they saying, Donald Trump can be vulgar, OK, we know that. Donald Trump can be vain, I think we know that. That Donald Trump can be volatile, what a shock, we knew all those things anyway. We knew it during the campaign.</p><p>KURTZ: That's why he won the election.</p><p>HUCKABEE: He wasn't elected to be the nicest guy in Washington, D.C. He was elected to drain the swamp and change the economy. He's done both. I personally think that a lot of people are extremely happy with the results they're getting from Donald Trump. Let's look at it this way. Howard, he's like a doctor that comes into the room. He's rude to the family perhaps. He's not got the best bedside manner, but by golly, he's going to save the patient's life. Had you rather have him or a guy that comes in and who is the nicest guy in the world, but all his patients die?</p><p>KURTZ: You know, Governor, I covered both of your presidential campaigns. I've known you for a long time. You are not an enemy of the American people guy and your daughter Sarah Huckabee-Sanders isn't the enemy of the American people. Do you wish the president wouldn't use that level to the media?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, he's qualified on many occasions.</p><p>KURTZ: It's 80 percent of the media is fake news.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I think the point is, from his perspective, when 90 percent of all the coverage about him is negative, how else should he feel? I really can't blame him.</p><p>KURTZ: Because he can feel it's unfair.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes, it is.</p><p>KURTZ: That he doesn't get a fair shake. It depends on the presidents. But again, I want to make sure I get to President Obama.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Right, right.</p><p>KURTZ: Because he broke a sort of self-imposed silence, came out and gave a speech harshly critical of his successor and had this to say about Fox.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I complained plenty about Fox News. But you never heard me to threaten to shut them down or called them enemies of the people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Your thoughts.</p><p>HUCKABEE: That's not true. He went after James Rosen and James Rosen's parents. He went after the AP and wiretapped them for heaven's sake.</p><p>KURTZ: That was harshly critical of that.</p><p>HUCKABEE: That was just patently false what he just said. In addition, his administration went after conservative pro-life and pro-Israel groups routinely through the IRS and the DOJ. So for him to say the sanctimonious we never did anything like that. And Howard, I'm sure you remember there was a time when he was going to make sure Fox News didn't get the same level of access. And to their credit...</p><p>KURTZ: And the other White House correspondents.</p><p>HUCKABEE: The other White House correspondents came around and supported him.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. But I assume you don't have an objection to the former president speaking out?</p><p>HUCKABEE: No. I think he has every right to do that.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. That's what politicians do. But let's close on this. Is it hard for officials in the Trump administration, including your daughter, to work in an environment where so many people are leaking, leaking against each other, leaking against the president. I mean, that can't be denied. This is the leakiest I have ever seen.</p><p>HUCKABEE: It's pretty rough. And I hope they can get to the bottom of it because it's not helpful. I think what's amazing, you know, President Obama talked about the miracles. I will tell you, the miracle is that President Trump is getting done a lot of things, in spite of he has so many knives coming after him, some of them in the back. You expect them from the front, you don't expect them from the back. And I think you have to give him some credit for that.</p><p>KURTZ: A colorful metaphor on which to close this segment. Mike Huckabee, thanks very much.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Always a pleasure, Howie.</p><p>KURTZ: Good to see you here in Washington.</p><p>Coming up, Twitter bans Alex Jones as some members of Congress accuse the tech company are biased against conservatives. That's next.</p><p>KURTZ: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook's #2 Sheryl Sandberg got hammered on Capitol Hill this week with Republican lawmakers accusing them of blatant biased against conservatives and Democrats saying they were just scoring political points. Joining us now from New York is Steve Hilton, host of the Next Revolution, Sundays night on FNC and author of the book, Positive Populism, revolutionary ideas to rebuild economic security, family and community in America.</p><p>Steve, as you know, Twitter was the only big social media platform not to ban Alex Jones, the internet personality and conspiracy theorist. But now, it has banned him and Infowars permanently over tweets and videos, after he confronted a CNN reporter and told him he looked like a rat. Something that has nothing to do with Twitter. Does that underscore that these bans have become rather subjective?</p><p>STEVE HILTON, NEXT REVOLUTION, HOST: It is all subjective. And that's one of the issues here. And I think the answer to it all frankly is not regulation, but more competition. The reason that all of these matters is because these platforms have become so dominant in each of their particular areas. And by the way, it's important to disclose to our viewers that my wife is a senior executive at Facebook. So I've got my own view. And I'm going to tell you what it is.</p><p>I think the problem is no one should be over-mighty, not big government, not big unions, not big business, and certainly, not big tech. So I think we need a two-staged process for kind of a pro-market breakup of these platforms. First of all, we got to reverse the power graphs that they already made. So for example, Facebook needs to be forced to sell WhatsApp and the other platforms that it is for.</p><p>KURTZ: Hold on, hold on. Let me jump in.</p><p>HILTON: And android and Amazon, we got to break that up, too. These platforms are too powerful.</p><p>KURTZ: Let me jump in here. First of all, I agree with you. The platforms are very powerful. I was going to ask you about the Justice Department is going to meet with state attorneys general on this question of whether these tech companies are intentionally stifling, free exchange of ideas, and possibly choking up competition. But you're a conservative who is saying the government needs to step in and break up these companies like they did with Standard Oil a century ago?</p><p>HILTON: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: It doesn't sound like a conservative philosophy.</p><p>HILTON: Because conservatives should be believers in markets and in competition. And this is a pro-market argument. So it's not just forcing them to reverse the acquisitions they've already made. For example, with Google getting rid of YouTube and Android, and separates them out, Amazon the cloud services, Amazon web services. And also, increasingly, Amazon making their own products and selling them on Amazon, whether that's clothes or batteries. All that needs to be broken up. But even then, these companies would be too dominant and too powerful. So there is a further step.</p><p>This is one of the specific ideas in my book. We need to have a pro-market regulatory framework, where if a company gets too big of a market share in any sector, let's say it's over 50 percent, it should be treated like part of the public sector, higher taxes, much tougher regulation, and so on. And only companies that are truly competitive should be free of that regulation and pay lower taxes. That's a pro-market way to ensure real competition. And that way, you get a better deal for consumers. And you get something done about this dominance that these companies have.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. By the way, my favorite part of your book is when you worked at 10 Downing Street, you were often described as somebody who walked around in his socks.</p><p>HILTON: That's right.</p><p>KURTZ: But let me just finish on this because you know at that house hearing in particular, Jack Dorsey of Twitter got criticized for the platform discriminated against conservatives. Do you think that's a significant problem and do you think it's a fixable problem, and given what you're saying, do you think it's a problem that government can fix?</p><p>HILTON: Well, they're private companies, they're not the government. And therefore, they are not subject to the requirement to give everyone a voice. But again, it comes back to the fact they are so dominant. The whole conversation goes on -- the national conversation on Twitter or Facebook, whatever. That's the problem.</p><p>Now, in the media, in our business, there are tons of outlets, hundreds and hundreds of outlets. And so, it doesn't matter if one of them have a particular view. And these companies are subjective. They talk about algorithms. Algorithms are written by people. And in the end, these individual people are making these decisions, so we will know that the people inside those companies are overwhelmingly liberal. So, of course, that's a concern. The answer is more competion.</p><p>KURTZ: It' a fascinating. Got to go. Fascinating debate. And it is going to continue because they're so powerful and because of the role of government, whether it steps in or not. Steve Hilton, great to see you. I look forward to reading more of your book.</p><p>Still to come...</p><p>HILTON: Thank you.</p><p>KURTZ: How is the press covering the disruptions and partisan warfare, the Brett Kavanaugh, his confirmation hearings?</p><p>KURTZ: The Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing immediately turned into a circus as Democrats and screaming protesters launched a strategy of disruption.</p><p>On tape. All right. So maybe we can get that back. Let me know. There were these partisan clashes over releasing what had been confidential documents. Let's roll.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's an exciting day for all of you here, and you are rightly proud of the judge.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Chairman, if we cannot be recognized, I move to adjourn.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The American people...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Chairman, I move to adjourn.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I urge you to shut the hearing down now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Joining us now, David Wartosko, U.S. politics editor for DailyMail.com. So between the protestors and the Democrats demanding adjournment over the dispute of the documents, did the press cover this as more of a spectacle?</p><p>DAVID WARTOSKO, U.S. POLITICS EDITOR FOR DAILYMAIL.COM: Well, I think so. And it's hard to fault the press for covering this as a spectacle. In fact, it was a circus.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p>WARTOSKO: The Democrats planned it this way. There was a big conference call the weekend before the hearing, over the Labor Day weekend when Chuck Schumer said this is what we are going to do. We're going to threaten to walk out. So of course, it was a spectacle. And the protestors, too.</p><p>KURTZ: There was questioning.</p><p>WARTOSKO: Well, there was. And frankly, as long as most of the news coverage is about the seriousness of it, and it was, covering the protestors is a sideline. It is fine. I mean, Dailymail.com is a photo- driven web site. When one of these people shows up with a shirt and a sign, we will let our cameras go. And that's great for everybody.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. Democratic Senator Cory Booker eyeing a 2020 run, made a big splash. I want to read you the New York Times account of this.</p><p>WARTOSKO: Sure.</p><p>KURTZ: Cory Booker threatened to release secret emails even if it meant being expelled from the senate, and he had the I-am-Sparticus speech. It was made for television moment, albeit later mocked by Republicans as grandstanding. And for Mr. Booker, it might come in handy in 2020. It kind of buried the fact that the documents were actually authorized the night before to be released, so it wasn't a secret thing where he is risking expulsion.</p><p>WARTOSKO: Well, it wasn't even that. But when the documents did come out, the one he actually showed was that after 9/11 in an internal White House discussion whether there would be racial profiling of people from Arab country coming to the U.S., even in that panic, Brett Kavanaugh was the voice of reason. He was saying we need to end up race policy. So this is not I-am-Sparticus. This is I-am-Mr. Magoo. You know, not only am I dead clueless on what's going the happen, I can't read the papers in front of my face.</p><p>KURTZ: It seems to me that when a senator makes you know leaving a sign whether you thought would the document themselves be newsworthy makes a great spectacle. I'm willing to be expelled over this. And it turns out he wasn't releasing secret documents. Would the coverage have been different if it was a Republican senator who will pull that? It just seems to me a lot of the accounts kind of went easy on this.</p><p>WARTOSKO: That's true. Go back to Kagan and Sotomayor. Back then, Patrick Leahy was running the committee. Jeff Sessions was the minority -- senior minority. Can you imagine Jeff Sessions getting up and going the southern draw, this is what she did as solicitor general. And if he was wrong, oh man, you know, that would be practically calling for it to be a firing offense in the senate to expel. So, yes.</p><p>KURTZ: Just briefly, the New York Times also obtained an email from an unknown person, it says...</p><p>WARTOSKO: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: The confidentiality documents have to do with the 2003 Brett Kavanaugh draft opinion piece for the Bush White House, having to do with them and whether all these scholars. So to some extent, were Hill staffers presuming on the Democratic side using leaks to get around that confidentiality?</p><p>WARTOSKO: Well, of course, they were. It's very clear Democratic senate staffers were leaking to the New York Times. That's what they do. And by the way, if you're listening and you want to leak something, I'm open for business.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>WARTOSKO: We all love leaks.</p><p>KURTZ: They're not that average.</p><p>WARTOSKO: We all love leaks. But ultimately, what it showed was that Kavanaugh was citing correct Supreme Court precedent. And in the middle of an emotional debate, he was being pretty sober and clear-headed. And I think that's why the Republicans like him.</p><p>KURTZ: Thank you for your sober assessment, David Wartosko. Good to see you.</p><p>New Yorker editor David Remnick, a fierce critic of President Trump, thought it would be fun to interview Steve Bannon at the magazine's annual festival until he disinvited him. Remnick caved under pressure from the magazine's readers and with some staffers, from actor Jim Carrey and producer Judd Apatow who said they would bail on the festival. Remnick said he didn't want critics to think he would ignore their concerns, wound up validating the liberal line, Trump associates must be treated as radio active.</p><p>This weekend marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of MediaBuzz.

As part of its unrelenting vendetta  against President Trump, the Times published a column by someone who they  do not identify. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are trying to make the story a media malfeasance  story and I find that kind of outrageous, when the content of this op-ed is  totally directly echoing the Woodward book is about completely an unstable  president, who can't be trusted.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anyone who would betray the man they work for, the  President of the United States, is a delusional, egomaniacal, self- aggrandizing, jackass. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The New York Times -- if someone wants to write an op- ed like this, resign and put your name on it because this is just gossip. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KURTZ: Should the paper have published this anti-Trump scream. And what  about the president saying that the Justice Department should investigate  the unnamed aide? This as Bob Woodward's book, Bombshell, portrays the  White House as crazy town. And President Trump hits back hard at the  country's most famous investigative reporting. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The book is a work of  fiction. If you look at Woodward's past, he had the same problem with other  presidents. He likes to get publicity and sell some books. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The criticism would be you talk to people who had an axe  to grind against the president. </p><p> BOB WOODWORD, WASHINGTON POST: That is just not true. Look, I talked to  dozens and dozens of people and have notes and documentation on lots of  things. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bob Woodward's new book on the Trump administration is  like nothing we have ever heard. Oh, actually, it's like everything we have  heard except worse and scarier. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here's the problem. The president didn't get on the  phone and say these things to Bob Woodward. There are a bunch of people who  say that the president said these things. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's time for the Republicans come to say the Trump  presidency is a national emergency. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A brand new book, Bob Woodward, filled with speculation,  rumors, hearsay, apparently of hundreds of anonymous -- anonymous painting  the Trump presidency in a very negative light. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KURTZ: Are the attacks drawing blood given Woodward's records since  Watergate? And do the denials by John Kelly and Jim Mattis undermine the  book's credibility. </p><p> Plus, Serena Williams melts down, as penalties cost her the U.S. Open. And  many women, media, sports charge the umpire was sexist or is it just sour  grapes? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is MediaBuzz. </p><p> What began as a media furor took a more serious turn when the president  said the Justice Department should investigate the person I call deep-state  throat. The unnamed official who said in that New York Times op-ed that  Trump is immoral, and unstable, and anti-democratic, and that this person  and other officials are part of a resistance movement, quote, like-minded  colleagues are about throw thwart parts of his agenda and his inclinations.  His impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed, and occasional  reckless decisions that have to be walked back. The president responded on  a Washington event, and with Fox &amp; Friends. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP: So if the New York Times has an anonymous editorial -- can you  believe it? Anonymous meaning gutless, a gutless editorial, we are doing a  great job. Because really what they have done is virtually, it's treason. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KURTZ: The president also suggesting that this official if the person  exists, he says, committed treason. And the Times must release the name for  national security purposes. Joining us now and analyze the coverage, Mollie  Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor, Sara  Fischer, media reporter for Axios, and Philippe Reines, former State  Department official under Hillary Clinton. </p><p> Mollie, the President Trump says Jeff Sessions he should be investigated  the unnamed author of this op-ed piece, exactly what law will this person  be violating?</p><p> MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, I'm not sure that this  something that rises to the level of the Department of Justice  investigation. But it's certainly an interesting story that we have someone  who is claiming to have a power unto themselves, this is a person who is  not elected, this is a person -- we don't know who it is, so there is no  way we can hold him accountable. We don't even know which agency he's in,  and yet he's claiming to be involved in policy make and law making that the  people have no right to know who they are. </p><p> KURTZ: You said -- you said this week, that this piece was a threat to our  democracy, an op-ed piece?</p><p> HEMINGWAY: Because what it signifies. And I actually think it's fine for  the New York Times to publish it. And I think it's helpful for the New York  Times to publish. There have been all these allegations usually by Trump  people saying that there is this deep-state or a hidden bureaucracy that's  actually unaccountable to the people and it's engaged in nefarious  activity.</p><p> For this person who went to the New York Times and said that's absolutely  true, this is against our constitution. Because in our constitution, we  have government of the people, by the people, and for the people. And we  have accountability for them. When they're secret and they're in a  bureaucracy, we have no way to hold them accountable. </p><p> KURTZ: Sara, we don't know how senior the senior administration official  is, but if Times editorial page editors who obviously know who it is, I  think this is a high level and credible this person is making serious  charges against the president from within the palace, it's news worthy, but  should it be published.</p><p> SARA FISCHER, AXIOS REPORTER: Well, it really depends on how senior that  official is. And we're not going to know. I mean...</p><p> KURTZ: We'll find out eventually. </p><p> FISCHER: We'll find out eventually. And that's the thing, right. If the New  York Times was to publish this, knowing that eventually something is going  to come out about who it is, then they are risking their credibility by not  actually having a senior person be the person who offered this, if that's  the way they're marketing it. But we're starting to see some things might  be pushing back on. We heard Michael Barbaro, the New York Times daily  Podcast reporting saying yesterday that the way that they way that they  call the senior officials is the same way that they use in editorial  standards. We see how the New York Times reports about senior White House  officials in editorial standards. It's not always someone who is directly  linked to the president. </p><p> KURTZ: That's entirely possible. Now, Philippe, Times editors say they are  proud they published the piece. Of course, they are proud. The editorial  page detest President Trump. And you tweeted that this all plays into  Trump's hands.</p><p> PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL UNDER HILLARY CLINTON:  Well, first of all, it is a good get. So I think any paper probably would  have done it. It does like Mollie say, play into the here is a great  example of the deep state. The problem is...</p><p> KURTZ: Conspiring some would say...</p><p> REINES: It's not the problem.</p><p> KURTZ: The newspaper that comes...</p><p> REINES: Yeah, but whether it is five minutes from now or five days ago,  we're going to know who this person is. This person works for Donald Trump.  So if you want to call him gutless, he's employing gutless people. I should  also say, Mollie kept saying he. We don't know if it is a man or woman, but  there are a lot of problems to this that we won't know until we find out  who it is. I think there are a couple. One is be careful who you hunt for  because you may find them. This is someone who might be 10 feet away from  his office. It could be someone who is two agencies away. It's not me. It's  not some guy off the street. It's someone he knows. </p><p> KURTZ: Well, the president called the source gutless. We heard that clip.  And he has a point. And along you said the source is cowardly. Even if you  buy into his -- I shouldn't the person's self-righteous, self-aggrandizing  view that we are saving America from an erratic and crazy president. Didn't  he undermine their own cause by bragging about it in a national newspaper,  infuriating Trump, and limiting the ability of aides to restrain the  president?</p><p> HEMINGWAY: I wasn't a very smart by this person. But also, if you actually  read the editorial, he says -- and I'm only saying he because New York  Times referred to him as a he.</p><p> KURTZ: Yes.</p><p> HEMINGWAY: He says the economy is doing really well, national security is  great, foreign policy is doing well. But it turns out Donald Trump acts  like Donald Trump in meetings. I think the American people actually knew  that when they elected Donald Trump as president. So it seems petty and  small compared to the claims everything was going very well. So why he  would think to do this when nothing new was shared in this op-ed is  bizarre. </p><p> KURTZ: I also think I believe that by immediately attacking the Times and  attacking the unnamed source, the president has given rocket fuel to this  story. It might fade after a couple of days. But when you work in the Obama  administration, you were involved in hunting down a White House official  with a rogue Twitter account. So you know what it's like to have somebody  within snipping at the president or the administration for whom he works.</p><p> REINES: Yeah, there was someone who weren't going to handle him for a  couple of years. He sent about 2,000 tweets hitting pretty much everyone in  town, not just Democrats or Obama, but Republicans. It got under a lot of  people's skin, and kind of a side project, a bipartisan team got together  and kind of did an Osama bin Laden search. It took us six months.</p><p> KURTZ: With guns blazing?</p><p> REINES: WE set a trap and we found him. It turned out he worked on the NSC.  And had a very sensitive job and he was called in and fired. And that's  what I'm saying. You don't know who you are going to find. You know, the  president has been complaining about leaks for a year and a half and he is  now wrong. But what happens when you find leaks in the course of this? You  know, someone e-mailing personally the course of this.</p><p> KURTZ: But when the president says this could be treason. He demands the  Times turn over the source, which of course it is not going to do because  of promise of confidentiality and anonymity, whether that is right or  wrong. What's he talking about? There is no classified information here.  It's an op-ed attack on the president. Is it political betrayal, yes. Is it  a firing offense, yes. But where is the national security component.</p><p> FISCHER: There is no national security component and it is not a crime.  This is why the DOJ is not necessarily suited to be investigating this  right now. But this is just the type of rhetoric that Donald Trump uses  when he wants to create a wedge between the mainstream media and his face.  He will call it treason, he will call it whatever he has to call it to  undermine the credibility of what the New York Times published. </p><p> HEMINGWAY: I wouldn't go overboard with that, though. When you have a rogue  and unaccountable person who is thwarting by his own claims the will of the  people, that's a very serious domestic threat. There will be a threat no  matter who is president, whether it is Barack Obama or Donald Trump.  The  people have a say. They voted for this person and that means that he's the  person held accountable. </p><p> REINES: They shouldn't need DOJ, this is not that tough. Also don't forget,  a year and a half ago, someone was leaking these transcripts of his phone  calls. </p><p> KURTZ: Which I criticized at that time. No president should have to put up  with that. And by the way, the media's guessing who it is...</p><p> REINES: There are all these people.</p><p> KURTZ: The media is always guessing who it is, I think is really unfair to  a lot of names. We absolutely nothing to do with this, and I won't repeat  all the names. All right. Let me turn to the Bob Woodward book because many  of the same themes about aides documented by Woodward, he says who were  trying to restrain the president. So some of them were recorded to saying,  of course, the president is an idiot, he's a liar, he's off the rails, he's  operating at a 5th or 6th grade level. The president hits back and said,  the book is fiction, lies, boring. I guess those are words you can say  about the author. </p><p> So I can tell you, Mollie, from my firsthand knowledge that Bob Woodward is  a meticulous reporter. And while some Trump officials are denying the  comments to them, he says, I've got hundreds of hours of tapes and  transcripts and documents. So it's hard to fully discredit his book.</p><p> HEMINGWAY: I think it claims against Bob Woodward aren't that he makes up  quotes, it's that he has a way of reporting where he just talks to just a  certain type of people and doesn't get the full story. The type of person  who is going to talk to Bob Woodward is the type of person who is going to  trash a principle or what not. And then, because this is anonymous and non- accountable, it is hard to know how seriously the take is.</p><p> KURTZ: Sara, let me read you a tweet from the president about this book.  He's talking about some of the senior officials around him. Their quotes  were made up, frauds, and the president does say that, Mollie. A con on the  public, we've put that up, likewise other stories and quotes. Woodward is a  damn operative? Notice timing? </p><p> Now, you can say a lot of the things about Bob Woodward and his techniques  can be controversial. And there are often denials about some of the things  he reports. But he has written books on both Democratic and Republican  president. A Dem operative? I mean, you can't dismiss this guy like  Omarosa.</p><p> FISCHER: No, you can't. And I think that definitely pushing it a little bit  too far. I was reading the Obama administration talking about how they  handled it when Woodward came to them, and he said look, I have  information, I have some stuff on tape and I have all these quotes. And he  was saying that the administration took that seriously. They thought a look  into it. They thought this was a credible report. It's fascinating to see  the difference in this administration. It's just complete -- this is false,  this can't be true. There is no really dealing or working with them. And  when apparently, Bob Woodward tried to get Donald Trump to talk to him, to  be on record with the book, Kellyanne Conway said I will put in a request. </p><p> KURTZ: We're going to play a little bit of that in the next segment. So,  Philippe, you know, Woodward's style has always been controversial because  you know he has this style that leaves room for people to deny. We've had  hard denials from people like Madison Kelly. And he's accused as we saw in  the clip earlier of giving more sympathetic treatment to sources who  cooperate. Does that undercut the book to some degree? </p><p> REINES: Well, first of all I think to what Sara is saying about the Obama  administration, the scariest five words in D.C. are Bob Woodward called for  you. And there is a reason for that. Yes, there might be elements that when  you read and you were a participant, might seem that they are torqued up  maybe a couple of degrees, that they happened. I mean, he captured the  essence of things. So I don't think you can attack and sell the book the  way the president has, although the president has a knack and frankly it  pays off for him to just shellac people and make stuff up. </p><p> HEMINGWAY: I think precisely what you hear about critiques of Bob Woodward,  if are he doesn't get a picture of what's happening. And the best critiques  of Bob Woodward are about how he treat John Belushi, when he wrote the book  about John Belushi. And Belushi's friends and families say he totally  missed the story, he totally got rocked.</p><p> KURTZ: All right. Let's go back here.</p><p> HEMINGWAY: They're not saying -- they're not saying he made anything up,  but then he missed the story. </p><p> REINES: John Rumsfeld (ph) said I don't know what you're talking about, I  never talked to him. And Bob Woodward, he went to the tapes. </p><p> KURTZ: All right. I got to wrap this up. You know, the president is  denying. In fairness of that, he called Jeff Sessions a dumb Southerner and  other things. So we have some real factual disputes. By the way, Woodward  on CBS this morning said he wouldn't have used the anonymous op-ed writer's  charges without a lot more specific details. All right. More on the  Woodward book in just a moment, as we look at the White House kind of  attacking. </p><p> And later, Serena Williams getting hammered for her blowup at the U.S.  Open, what some female sportswriters insist she was robbed.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> KURTZ: While President Trump has been denouncing Bob Woodward, he offered a  more positive assessment last month in a call taped with the veteran  journalist with the president's permission and released by the Washington  Post. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP: Who did you ask about speaking to me?</p><p> BOB WOODWARD, WASHINGTON POST: Well, about six people, you know. </p><p> TRUMP: They didn't tell me. Nobody told me about it. And I would have loved  to have spoken to you. You know, I'm pretty open to you. I think you have  always been fair. So we're going to have a very inaccurate book, but that's  too bad. But I don't blame you entirely. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KURTZ: Well, I do believe President Trump didn't know Bob Woodward had put  in all these requests?</p><p> HEMINGWAY: I don't mean to disrespect the president, but I wouldn't say  he's always telling the truth in these types of phone calls. </p><p> KURTZ: OK. You know, it's not like we haven't read stories like this  before. I mean, Kelly wasn't the one who denied it, but in the end, Rex  Tillerson once called him a moron. There is a lot of stuff in my book,  Media Madness, about the staff trying to restrain him or slow walk things  or end run him. Some of this happens in every administration. But what the  mainstream media love about this book, I want your take, is that they can  say, aha. All the bad stuff we've been telling about the president is true.  His own people say it, same thing with the anonymous column.</p><p> HEMINGWAY: Well, I mean, it's a story that we've heard frequently before.  I've talked to some of these people who have fights with the president. And  they characterize it very differently. So they say they do have battles,  they do fight. At the end of the day, the president gets to say which way  the direction is going to be, and then, they have to follow it. I think how  you interpret these comments from people say a lot about what type of  journalism you're doing. If you see it as some sort of nefarious proof that  Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency or adults who have debates, and  then they make a decision. </p><p> KURTZ: Right. Well, Woodward's former partner, Carl Bernstein, says on CNN  that the Trump presidency is a national emergency. So, Philippe, as a  former government bureaucrat, even in more traditional administration.  White House aides who were split into factions, try to end run, or slow  walk policies they don't like, or sometimes leak against each other or even  against the boss. </p><p> REINES: But that's a challenge that reporters have to face every single  day, whether it's an author or whether it's the New York Times, or the Fox  News. </p><p> KURTZ: What challenge?</p><p> REINES: The challenge is whether you're talking to someone who says  something negative about a third person because they have an axe to grind. </p><p> KURTZ: Right.</p><p> REINES: Because they want to sell, advertise themselves.</p><p> KURTZ: Do you think reporters take that to account or do you think they  basically just love the infighting and happy to do it all in?</p><p> REINES: You know, books are very different animals. </p><p> KURTZ: Yes.</p><p> REINES: I have to fend up. But on the one hand, when a book is done right,  which you've written, when you spend a lot of time on a topic, you are  actually more likely to be more accurate. Because you are not doing the  24/7, you know.</p><p> KURTZ: Right. And people are more likely to confide in you, because on a  background basis, because they know you are taking the time. </p><p> REINES: We have to entertain the possibility that Bob Woodward is right in  what he is describing.</p><p> KURTZ: All right. So you raised that possibility. But here is something in  the Woodward book. It has gotten far less attention. And we're tuning this  up for you, Sara. So according to the Woodward book, the chief-of-staff  said this in a meeting, I am the only thing protecting the president from  the press. The press is out to get him. They want to destroy him. And I'm  determined to stand in the way taking the bullets and taking the arrows,  spoken as a true general. Gee, that didn't really get much coverage.</p><p> FISCHER: No, but it should have gotten a lot of coverage. I mean, any time  you have someone backless to the president, who is saying that he has to be  the wall between the president and the media. And we know that this is the  role of aides. But this is a fiery thing for him to be saying. And it's  something that we've heard in the past from all these other people. But  John Kelly is a pretty reserved guy. He's not the type of person that comes  out against the press often. So you know he has to mean it if he's going to  say it. </p><p> KURTZ: Whether some of these aides at the level of the anonymous column who  are trying to let's say restrain the president, whether they're doing the  right thing or the wrong thing, I think it's fair to say at this point that  President Trump maybe is in a position where he has to wonder who he can  trust because of all these leaks that are going on since the day he was  sworn in. </p><p> HEMINGWAY: And that is -- and that's something he has talked about a lot  about the lack of people on his team within the administration. That's why  I think this was a silly move by the anonymous author and the media. They  thought this was a way to present Trump as yet again the narrative that  you've heard over and over again about being unstable. What it really did  was confirm just how much D.C. is a swamp, how much they oppose what the  people chose in the last election, and how unable they are to deal with the  reality of what the American people chose. </p><p> KURTZ: But according to Woodward, the people who are trying to restrain  include the chief-of-staff, included the defense secretary, so it's not  just you know trolls in the administration. So is it a good thing we have  that even though the contents are in dispute. </p><p> REINES: I think it is a good thing. I think it is going to depend on who it  is. </p><p> KURTZ: It runs on the Woodward book now.</p><p> REINES: The Woodward book is good. We might not know who these are, but we  might end up -- often times, we do learn who they are. But, you know, if  Donald Trump woke up last Wednesday morning feeling comfortable with people  around him, that doesn't make a lot of sense. His lawyer was taping  conversations with him. His closest aides are turning on him legally. I  don't think the op-ed is the tipping point. </p><p> KURTZ: And not to mention Omarosa. </p><p> REINES: And not to mention Omarosa.</p><p> FISCHER: Yeah, I was just going to say, if there's one thing to take away  from this is that, it's not totally a new story. What bob Woodward is  writing, we have been hearing from people within the Trump  administration...</p><p> KURTZ: Right.</p><p> FISCHER: ... and from people outside it. So even if there are facts or  small parts that are disputed, the overall narrative there, we have heard  it. </p><p> KURTZ: It's a lot more detailed with some highlights.</p><p> REINES: It's nobody wants to hear, but Woodward might have gotten it right. </p><p> KURTZ: Look how happy he looks. Philippe Reines, Sara Fischer, and Mollie  Hemingway, thanks so much.</p><p> Ahead, Mike Huckabee on an intense week obviously of media criticism of the  president, anonymous, and otherwise. </p><p> But up next, the Serena controversy. The Washington Post says it is a  sexist, power play ruined the U.S. Open Finals. We'll take a whack at that.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SERENA WILLIAMS, TENNIS PLAYER: You owe me an apology. I have never cheated  in life. I have daughter and I stand what's right for her. And I have never  cheated. You owe me an apology. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KURTZ: I was watching in amazement as Serena Williams lost her cool in  yesterday's U.S. Open Finals accusing Umpire Carlos Ramos of branding her a  cheater. She said he stole the game from her. Many pundits are slamming  Serena, but what he did was slapping her with these three penalties did  more than cause her one game. It more than robbed of any chance of coming  back against her young challenger Naomi Osaka. He took the match away from  both women and left them in tears. And Serena said it was sexist. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILLIAMS: Because I'm a woman, you are going to take it away from me? </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KURTZ: Joining us now, Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent  for the Washington Examiner. Susan, Serena's meltdown was painful to watch.  And she was close to losing the match anyway, but the commentators are  whacking her, really should take a look in my view at the oh-so-sensitive  umpire who allowed the situation to keep escalating. </p><p> SUSAN FERRECHIO, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Right. I think you said something  that echoed what Sally Jenkins wrote on the Washington Post today, which is  he let it get out of control. He could have sat there, taken the insults  the way he has from other male players. This is well documented on YouTube,  same refs, same male players who attacked him, but he has not docked him  points or games. So there is a case to be made that this was a different  standard for Serena Williams. And I think as Sally Jenkins said that the  issue for her was she felt the umpire was not going to let a woman talk to  him that way. </p><p> KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p> FERRECHIO: That's the real heart of the issue here. Did he feel like hey, I  am not going to let a woman wave a finger at me without a very serious  penalty that I wouldn't have given to a male player?</p><p> KURTZ: Let me read from that because Sally Jenkins, a veteran sports  writer, front page of Washington Post, the headline sexist, power play  ruins powerful finale. And she said he abused his authority, she said, over  a tone of voice. Male players have sworn and cursed at the top their lungs  and never been penalized the way Serena was, making your point. </p><p> FERRECHIO: And on the other hand though, if you watched it as I did, as the  thing escalated, you know, she played a role in this. She smashed her  racket. She waved a finger at the umpire, a big no-no. And it could have  appeared -- some people, especially if you read it in social media, it is  very divided as you day. People say look, she appeared threatening. She is  a hot player, she has a habit over the years of throwing tantrums and  threatening line people in the past. </p><p> KURTZ: And on that point, a tweet from Billy Jean King, the great tennis  player. When a woman is emotional, she is hysterical. She is penalized. But  when a man does the same, he's outspoken. And there are no repercussions. </p><p> FERRECHIO: That's not true. </p><p> KURTZ: OK. Sometimes look, John McEnroe.</p><p> FERRECHIO: A whole page worth of penalties and fines, he was ejected from  games. </p><p> KURTZ: Sure. But just explain to people. There are two warnings and then  the penalty that caused her one game as she was in the process of perhaps  the second and final set. The coach gave a signal from the stands that it's  illegal. A lot of people didn't realize that.</p><p> FERRECHIO: He admitted it, too.</p><p> KURTZ: He admitted it, but Serena said she didn't see it. Then, breaking  the racket, he could have let that go. And then, when she'd called him a  thief, I mean, she didn't curse as some players have. </p><p> FERRECHIO: Right.</p><p> KURTZ: But that's when he took away a game and really made this I think  more about him than the players on the court. </p><p> FERRECHIO: Well, that's what the game became. Yeah, for both players, it  was ruined. You know, the whole ending was just so emotional. It was  deprived of the joy you would experience from beating your role model. The  whole thing was just a disappointment for everybody. So everybody can point  fingers at the ref. But the players ultimately are responsible for their  own behavior. They have to decide good sportsmanship on the court, talk  about the problem later, when you get off the court. That's something every  player grapples with. </p><p> KURTZ: Right.</p><p> FERRECHIO: Not just men versus women. </p><p> KURTZ: Sure. But you know, calling such things is subjective. It is a  matter of discretion. And just to be clear, this was unfair to Naomi Osaka,  who has you know first Japanese, she is also an Asian player to win the  U.S. Open. She was in tears. He ruined her moment, and he ruined Serena's  attempted comeback. And she of course a year ago almost died of  complications from childbirth. So you know it should be about the players.  In an NBA Final, you wouldn't call foul on the last play unless somebody  got decked.</p><p> FERRECHIO: Right.</p><p> KURTZ: So do we agree on that point? </p><p> FERRECHIO: We do agree on that point. It also follows on the female player  penalized for changing her shirt in the middle of the match. There's a  pattern here. And then, Serena Williams being told she couldn't wear  certain outfit. </p><p> KURTZ: The cat suit.</p><p> FERRECHIO: Yes. So you know, this is following a pattern. A lot of people,  not just Chris Everett and Billy Jean, her contemporaries are saying that  this needs to be looked at how men and women are treated differently by the  umpires. </p><p> KURTZ: Yeah. I'm not letting Serena off the hook for her conduct, but this  does show I think that this treatment has a lot of people up in arms,  including the press. Susan Ferrechio, thanks for playing with us on this.</p><p> Ahead, the New Yorker who wanted to put Steve Bannon on the stage until  some big named Hollywood types threatened to boycott event. </p><p> But first, Mike Huckabee on the press versus the president, the former  governor will be here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> KURTZ: President Trump and the press unleashing some of their harshest  language yet against each other. Joining us now is the second most famous  person in his family, Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and  presidential candidate, and a Fox News contributor, welcome. So the thrust  of the media coverage over the New York Times senior official trashing the  president is that this person is a coward and should just resign. And then,  even many liberals are saying that. Given that this person is talking about  administration officials, actively undermining the president, why shouldn't  the Times publish this? </p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think they shouldn't have  because to do so gives some type of credibility to a person who hasn't have  the guts to stand up and say here I am. Howie, if you run for office, you  put your name on the ballot. If you are going to undermine the people who  do have the guts to run for office, then have the guts to tell us who you  are, so we can evaluate and hold you accountable for your views. </p><p> If you really think the country is in trouble, stand up and say so. This  guy is, I think, a gutless coward, or girl, we don't know. </p><p> KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p> HUCKABEE: And I thought it was sleazy for him to say the things he did  because we don't know what level of government. He could be a fourth-tier  person in Montana federal office. </p><p> KURTZ: It took 33 years to find out who deep throat was.</p><p> HUCKABEE: Exactly.</p><p> KURTZ: I don't think it will take that long for this one. So the president  comes out and says that Jeff Sessions of the Justice Department should  investigate this secret source. On what grounds? What's the criminal  offense? May have been political betrayal, as I said earlier? Maybe  stupidity? Certainly, a fiery offense. </p><p> HUCKABEE: Yeah.</p><p> KURTZ: Criminal investigation? </p><p> HUCKABEE: Well, it depends. Is this person also telling things that he or  she knows of national security to the New York Times? We don't know. The  point is that we do know...</p><p> KURTZ: That's not what was published. </p><p> HUCKABEE: But I think what the president is saying is it's serious. Let's  just believe in that general way. It is serious. And it is serious for  someone who gets a paycheck from the President Trump administration to  betray the trust of that. So give up our paycheck, go out on the streets. </p><p> KURTZ: And say whatever you want.</p><p> HUCKABEE: Say whatever you want. You have free speech, but you don't have  freedom to do it with somebody else paying your salary.</p><p> KURTZ: So that account and the Bob Woodward book and other stories have  painted a portrait of top aides, some say they believe in the president,  but they're working to restrain him from what they see as some of his worst  impulses. At some point, shouldn't the public conclude that there is  something here, that there is some truth to these journalistic accounts? </p><p> HUCKABEE: Not necessarily. Look at these accounts, what are they saying,  Donald Trump can be vulgar, OK, we know that. Donald Trump can be vain, I  think we know that. That Donald Trump can be volatile, what a shock, we  knew all those things anyway. We knew it during the campaign. </p><p> KURTZ: That's why he won the election.</p><p> HUCKABEE: He wasn't elected to be the nicest guy in Washington, D.C. He was  elected to drain the swamp and change the economy. He's done both. I  personally think that a lot of people are extremely happy with the results  they're getting from Donald Trump. Let's look at it this way. Howard, he's  like a doctor that comes into the room. He's rude to the family perhaps.  He's not got the best bedside manner, but by golly, he's going to save the  patient's life. Had you rather have him or a guy that comes in and who is  the nicest guy in the world, but all his patients die?</p><p> KURTZ: You know, Governor, I covered both of your presidential campaigns.  I've known you for a long time. You are not an enemy of the American people  guy and your daughter Sarah Huckabee-Sanders isn't the enemy of the  American people. Do you wish the president wouldn't use that level to the  media?</p><p> HUCKABEE: Well, he's qualified on many occasions. </p><p> KURTZ: It's 80 percent of the media is fake news.</p><p> HUCKABEE: I think the point is, from his perspective, when 90 percent of  all the coverage about him is negative, how else should he feel? I really  can't blame him. </p><p> KURTZ: Because he can feel it's unfair. </p><p> HUCKABEE: Yes, it is.</p><p> KURTZ: That he doesn't get a fair shake. It depends on the presidents. But  again, I want to make sure I get to President Obama. </p><p> HUCKABEE: Right, right.</p><p> KURTZ: Because he broke a sort of self-imposed silence, came out and gave a  speech harshly critical of his successor and had this to say about Fox. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I complained plenty  about Fox News. But you never heard me to threaten to shut them down or  called them enemies of the people. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KURTZ: Your thoughts.</p><p> HUCKABEE: That's not true. He went after James Rosen and James Rosen's  parents. He went after the AP and wiretapped them for heaven's sake.</p><p> KURTZ: That was harshly critical of that.</p><p> HUCKABEE: That was just patently false what he just said. In addition, his  administration went after conservative pro-life and pro-Israel groups  routinely through the IRS and the DOJ. So for him to say the sanctimonious  we never did anything like that. And Howard, I'm sure you remember there  was a time when he was going to make sure Fox News didn't get the same  level of access. And to their credit...</p><p> KURTZ: And the other White House correspondents.</p><p> HUCKABEE: The other White House correspondents came around and supported  him. </p><p> KURTZ: Right. But I assume you don't have an objection to the former  president speaking out? </p><p> HUCKABEE: No. I think he has every right to do that. </p><p> KURTZ: All right. That's what politicians do. But let's close on this. Is  it hard for officials in the Trump administration, including your daughter,  to work in an environment where so many people are leaking, leaking against  each other, leaking against the president. I mean, that can't be denied.  This is the leakiest I have ever seen.</p><p> HUCKABEE: It's pretty rough. And I hope they can get to the bottom of it  because it's not helpful. I think what's amazing, you know, President Obama  talked about the miracles. I will tell you, the miracle is that President  Trump is getting done a lot of things, in spite of he has so many knives  coming after him, some of them in the back. You expect them from the front,  you don't expect them from the back. And I think you have to give him some  credit for that.</p><p> KURTZ: A colorful metaphor on which to close this segment. Mike Huckabee,  thanks very much.</p><p> HUCKABEE: Always a pleasure, Howie.</p><p> KURTZ: Good to see you here in Washington. </p><p> Coming up, Twitter bans Alex Jones as some members of Congress accuse the  tech company are biased against conservatives. That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> KURTZ: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook's #2 Sheryl Sandberg got  hammered on Capitol Hill this week with Republican lawmakers accusing them  of blatant biased against conservatives and Democrats saying they were just  scoring political points. Joining us now from New York is Steve Hilton,  host of the Next Revolution, Sundays night on FNC and author of the book,  Positive Populism, revolutionary ideas to rebuild economic security, family  and community in America. </p><p> Steve, as you know, Twitter was the only big social media platform not to  ban Alex Jones, the internet personality and conspiracy theorist. But now,  it has banned him and Infowars permanently over tweets and videos, after he  confronted a CNN reporter and told him he looked like a rat. Something that  has nothing to do with Twitter. Does that underscore that these bans have  become rather subjective?</p><p> STEVE HILTON, NEXT REVOLUTION, HOST: It is all subjective. And that's one  of the issues here. And I think the answer to it all frankly is not  regulation, but more competition. The reason that all of these matters is  because these platforms have become so dominant in each of their particular  areas. And by the way, it's important to disclose to our viewers that my  wife is a senior executive at Facebook. So I've got my own view. And I'm  going to tell you what it is.</p><p> I think the problem is no one should be over-mighty, not big government,  not big unions, not big business, and certainly, not big tech. So I think  we need a two-staged process for kind of a pro-market breakup of these  platforms. First of all, we got to reverse the power graphs that they  already made. So for example, Facebook needs to be forced to sell WhatsApp  and the other platforms that it is for. </p><p> KURTZ: Hold on, hold on. Let me jump in. </p><p>HILTON: And android and Amazon, we got to break that up, too. These  platforms are too powerful. </p><p> KURTZ: Let me jump in here. First of all, I agree with you. The platforms  are very powerful. I was going to ask you about the Justice Department is  going to meet with state attorneys general on this question of whether  these tech companies are intentionally stifling, free exchange of ideas,  and possibly choking up competition. But you're a conservative who is  saying the government needs to step in and break up these companies like  they did with Standard Oil a century ago? </p><p>HILTON: Yes. </p><p> KURTZ: It doesn't sound like a conservative philosophy. </p><p>HILTON: Because conservatives should be believers in markets and in  competition. And this is a pro-market argument. So it's not just forcing  them to reverse the acquisitions they've already made. For example, with  Google getting rid of YouTube and Android, and separates them out, Amazon  the cloud services, Amazon web services. And also, increasingly, Amazon  making their own products and selling them on Amazon, whether that's  clothes or batteries. All that needs to be broken up. But even then, these  companies would be too dominant and too powerful. So there is a further  step. </p><p> This is one of the specific ideas in my book. We need to have a pro-market  regulatory framework, where if a company gets too big of a market share in  any sector, let's say it's over 50 percent, it should be treated like part  of the public sector, higher taxes, much tougher regulation, and so on. And  only companies that are truly competitive should be free of that regulation  and pay lower taxes. That's a pro-market way to ensure real competition.  And that way, you get a better deal for consumers. And you get something  done about this dominance that these companies have.</p><p> KURTZ: All right. By the way, my favorite part of your book is when you  worked at 10 Downing Street, you were often described as somebody who  walked around in his socks. </p><p>HILTON: That's right.</p><p> KURTZ: But let me just finish on this because you know at that house  hearing in particular, Jack Dorsey of Twitter got criticized for the  platform discriminated against conservatives. Do you think that's a  significant problem and do you think it's a fixable problem, and given what  you're saying, do you think it's a problem that government can fix? </p><p>HILTON: Well, they're private companies, they're not the government. And  therefore, they are not subject to the requirement to give everyone a  voice. But again, it comes back to the fact they are so dominant. The whole  conversation goes on -- the national conversation on Twitter or Facebook,  whatever. That's the problem. </p><p> Now, in the media, in our business, there are tons of outlets, hundreds and  hundreds of outlets. And so, it doesn't matter if one of them have a  particular view. And these companies are subjective. They talk about  algorithms. Algorithms are written by people. And in the end, these  individual people are making these decisions, so we will know that the  people inside those companies are overwhelmingly liberal. So, of course,  that's a concern. The answer is more competion. </p><p> KURTZ: It' a fascinating. Got to go. Fascinating debate. And it is going to  continue because they're so powerful and because of the role of government,  whether it steps in or not. Steve Hilton, great to see you. I look forward  to reading more of your book. </p><p> Still to come...</p><p>HILTON: Thank you.</p><p> KURTZ: How is the press covering the disruptions and partisan warfare, the  Brett Kavanaugh, his confirmation hearings?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> KURTZ: The Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing immediately turned into a  circus as Democrats and screaming protesters launched a strategy of  disruption. </p><p> On tape. All right. So maybe we can get that back. Let me know. There were  these partisan clashes over releasing what had been confidential documents.  Let's roll. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's an exciting day for all of you here, and you are  rightly proud of the judge. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Chairman, if we cannot be recognized, I move to  adjourn. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The American people...</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Chairman, I move to adjourn.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I urge you to shut the hearing down now. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KURTZ: Joining us now, David Wartosko, U.S. politics editor for  DailyMail.com. So between the protestors and the Democrats demanding  adjournment over the dispute of the documents, did the press cover this as  more of a spectacle? </p><p> DAVID WARTOSKO, U.S. POLITICS EDITOR FOR DAILYMAIL.COM: Well, I think so.  And it's hard to fault the press for covering this as a spectacle. In fact,  it was a circus. </p><p> KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p> WARTOSKO: The Democrats planned it this way. There was a big conference  call the weekend before the hearing, over the Labor Day weekend when Chuck  Schumer said this is what we are going to do. We're going to threaten to  walk out. So of course, it was a spectacle. And the protestors, too. </p><p> KURTZ: There was questioning.</p><p> WARTOSKO: Well, there was. And frankly, as long as most of the news  coverage is about the seriousness of it, and it was, covering the  protestors is a sideline. It is fine. I mean, Dailymail.com is a photo- driven web site. When one of these people shows up with a shirt and a sign,  we will let our cameras go. And that's great for everybody. </p><p> KURTZ: All right. Democratic Senator Cory Booker eyeing a 2020 run, made a  big splash. I want to read you the New York Times account of this.</p><p> WARTOSKO: Sure.</p><p> KURTZ: Cory Booker threatened to release secret emails even if it meant  being expelled from the senate, and he had the I-am-Sparticus speech. It  was made for television moment, albeit later mocked by Republicans as  grandstanding. And for Mr. Booker, it might come in handy in 2020. It kind  of buried the fact that the documents were actually authorized the night  before to be released, so it wasn't a secret thing where he is risking  expulsion.</p><p> WARTOSKO: Well, it wasn't even that. But when the documents did come out,  the one he actually showed was that after 9/11 in an internal White House  discussion whether there would be racial profiling of people from Arab  country coming to the U.S., even in that panic, Brett Kavanaugh was the  voice of reason. He was saying we need to end up race policy. So this is  not I-am-Sparticus. This is I-am-Mr. Magoo. You know, not only am I dead  clueless on what's going the happen, I can't read the papers in front of my  face.</p><p> KURTZ: It seems to me that when a senator makes you know leaving a sign  whether you thought would the document themselves be newsworthy makes a  great spectacle. I'm willing to be expelled over this. And it turns out he  wasn't releasing secret documents. Would the coverage have been different  if it was a Republican senator who will pull that? It just seems to me a  lot of the accounts kind of went easy on this. </p><p> WARTOSKO: That's true. Go back to Kagan and Sotomayor. Back then, Patrick  Leahy was running the committee. Jeff Sessions was the minority -- senior  minority. Can you imagine Jeff Sessions getting up and going the southern  draw, this is what she did as solicitor general. And if he was wrong, oh  man, you know, that would be practically calling for it to be a firing  offense in the senate to expel. So, yes.</p><p> KURTZ: Just briefly, the New York Times also obtained an email from an  unknown person, it says...</p><p> WARTOSKO: Right.</p><p> KURTZ: The confidentiality documents have to do with the 2003 Brett  Kavanaugh draft opinion piece for the Bush White House, having to do with  them and whether all these scholars. So to some extent, were Hill staffers  presuming on the Democratic side using leaks to get around that  confidentiality? </p><p> WARTOSKO: Well, of course, they were. It's very clear Democratic senate  staffers were leaking to the New York Times. That's what they do. And by  the way, if you're listening and you want to leak something, I'm open for  business. </p><p> KURTZ: Right.</p><p> WARTOSKO: We all love leaks. </p><p> KURTZ: They're not that average.</p><p> WARTOSKO: We all love leaks. But ultimately, what it showed was that  Kavanaugh was citing correct Supreme Court precedent. And in the middle of  an emotional debate, he was being pretty sober and clear-headed. And I  think that's why the Republicans like him. </p><p> KURTZ: Thank you for your sober assessment, David Wartosko. Good to see  you.</p><p> New Yorker editor David Remnick, a fierce critic of President Trump,  thought it would be fun to interview Steve Bannon at the magazine's annual  festival until he disinvited him. Remnick caved under pressure from the  magazine's readers and with some staffers, from actor Jim Carrey and  producer Judd Apatow who said they would bail on the festival. Remnick said  he didn't want critics to think he would ignore their concerns, wound up  validating the liberal line, Trump associates must be treated as radio  active.</p><p> This weekend marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of MediaBuzz.

The body of a transgender woman was found in Dallas over the weekend in what police say is the fourth slaying of a transgender woman in the city -- murders that have gone unsolved. James Holzhauer's historic \"Jeopardy!\" winning streak came to an end Monday night as he was so close to breaking the all-time \"Jeopardy!\" earnings record.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[07:30:00] JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: -- well for the president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BERMAN: Today, it's way more complicated, to put it bluntly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president meeting with Theresa May, talking about very prickly issues of trade and international diplomacy. And then, there are the protests going on all over the place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How do you see it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AMANPOUR: Well, look, I think you're absolutely right. The royal day was the first day and it went really well. I mean, there was a lot of goodwill all around.</p><p>I mean, the fact of the matter is that the president didn't do the whole carriage thing that a lot of royal -- or rather, a lot of royal guests do. That was apparently, according to his people, for security. But others think maybe it was because there were protests.</p><p>He didn't get to see a lot of people around as his motorcade traveled around. He's getting to see a little bit more of that today.</p><p>And also, there are these protests planned for Trafalgar Square. They are, in fact, very contained. It's not like they're going to be all over London, so they're quite contained in Trafalgar Square.</p><p>But, yes, it is the business meetings and the political meetings today.</p><p>Having said that, they haven't come with an agenda to sign major bilateral agreements. Sometimes, foreign leaders come, American president comes, and there are actual communiques and agreements that are signed and taken away. That's apparently not on the table right now.</p><p>Instead, there are all sorts of important issues that presumably will be discussed.</p><p>First and foremost, because it made such an impact in the European elections, the British prime minister is being urged by a consortium of very senior British scientists to raise immediately and very vocally the issue of climate change and how Britain does not agree with the United States pulling out of Paris, and does not agree with all the actions the Trump administration has taken on rolling back regulations, on clean air, clean water, on emissions from power plants and the like.</p><p>And, on not being forward-leaning on the whole issue of mitigating this climate change. So that will be a big thing.</p><p>Then, as you mentioned, Huawei. That is the whole issue of whether Britain will, in fact, decide because apparently, it hasn't decided yet to go against the United States and actually invite Huawei to be part of its whole 5G and I.T. technological developments for the future.</p><p>The United States does not like that. It believes that Huawei could, in fact, be a secret sleeper spying device for the Chinese government. And, obviously, all the other issues surrounding trade and intellectual property that the United States has with China.</p><p>And then, of course, the Iran nuclear deal. The U.K. and the rest of Europe do not agree with President Trump's withdrawal from that agreement -- John.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Look, I'm not a ministerial adviser yet, but I would not recommend that she lead with climate change. I mean, I just don't think that that's where -- if they're going to hammer out anything, Christiane -- and this is going to be beyond just a ceremonial meeting -- that is not one where they have agreements.</p><p>A trade deal, as we've been told, is one where they both have a vested interest and it sounds like President Trump thinks that something might be able to get done in the waning days of the May administration.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, and neither am I a presidential adviser nor am I a trade expert. However, what I can tell you is despite the somewhat poo-pooing of the climate issue, it is the issue around the world. And it is climbing as the issue in the United States, especially with the majority of voters who now will be millennials and who have that issue on their agenda.</p><p>And as you know, it is part of every Democratic candidate's platform. It is a major issue.</p><p>And in terms of economic benefits, that's one way the prime minister is expected to talk to him about it.</p><p>However, on the trade issue, the president says all sorts of things and it is not at all clear what he can deliver.</p><p>And also, Prime Minister May is not going to be prime minister for much longer. So the truth of the matter is that these two leaders probably will not be able to hammer out or sign, seal and deliver anything, much less a trade deal.</p><p>I've had umpteen experts and trade negotiators and ambassadors on who've all said that a trade deal takes years to hammer out, no matter what the leaders may want to do. And in the case of the United States, a trade deal with the U.K. will mean congressional approvement (sic) and -- approval, rather.</p><p>And if this trade deal is a Brexit hardline, fall-off-the-cliff no- deal disaster, then the Congress is going to have a hard time passing it because as I've been told, they don't want to see any kind of Brexit deal that threatens U.S. interests, including the survival of the Northern Island peace deal.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Really good context, Christiane. Thank you very much for spelling all of that out for us.</p><p>BERMAN: All right.</p><p>House lawmakers taking aim at Silicon Valley's biggest players -- Google, Facebook, Amazon, and more -- launching an antitrust investigation. This is a pivot point.</p><p>Our chief business correspondent and star of \"EARLY START,\" Christine Romans joins us now with much more on this.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, \"EARLY START\": Yes, and this is a top-to-bottom review here -- an antitrust probe of big tech launched by House lawmakers with Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon as some of the targets here.</p><p>[07:35:07] Rhode Island Democratic Congressman David Cicilline leading this investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): This is a broad investigation of the whole marketplace, so it involves a whole range of companies. But it's really to look at competition in the digital marketplace, to look at anticompetitive behavior of some of the large dominant platforms. And then, determine whether our existing antitrust statutes are working -- whether they need to be modernized and updated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: You know, there's been scandal after scandal for the tech industry. Critics have called for tough new regulations. Some critics have demanded these companies be broken up.</p><p>This investigation comes as the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission recently agreed to divide oversight of the tech industry.</p><p>Congressman Cicilline says this is the first time Congress has launched a significant antitrust investigation in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CICILLINE: Frankly, I don't have a lot of confidence that this administration has been particularly aggressive in their antitrust enforcement. In fact, they very often have come out on the side of monopolists and big mergers. So I think, again, they have a responsibility, in particular, in enforcement actions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Officials have notified Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook of the coming investigation. Amazon and Google declined to comment. Apple and Facebook didn't respond immediately to our request for comment, guys.</p><p>News that the big tech companies face this scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators has pushed the Nasdaq into a correction. The Nasdaq down 1.6 percent yesterday. It's down 11 percent from the highs.</p><p>And look at those big major tech stocks on the news, hit hard. Google down six percent, Facebook down 7 1/2 percent. Amazon and Apple down as well.</p><p>You know, they faced scrutiny for election interference -- for being asleep at the switch there. But also, for privacy concerns as well, Alisyn. So this will be top-to-bottom, wide-ranging we expect.</p><p>CAMEROTA: That will be fascinating to watch. Thank you very much for the preview of all of that, Christine.</p><p>OK, good news. It's 1984 all over again. That was a great year.</p><p>BERMAN: I had feathered hair.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh, wait a second -- not the real 1984. It's Orwell's 1984.</p><p>What do this image, and the classic novel, and President Trump all have in common? The eye-opening answer ahead in our reality check.</p><p>[07:41:30] CAMEROTA: Three transgender women have been murdered in the city of Dallas in a year. The FBI is now assisting local police in this string of unsolved murders.</p><p>And, CNN's Rosa Flores joins us now with more. What do we know, Rosa?</p><p>ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, Alisyn, Dallas police is taking these cases very seriously. There are four transgender African-American women who have been killed in Dallas and their homicides have gone unsolved -- two of those just in the past few days and weeks.</p><p>Most recently, this past Saturday, 26-year-old Chynal Lindsey. Her body was found in a lake.</p><p>Just a few weeks prior to that, 22-year-old Muhlaysia Brooks (sic). She was found shot to death. And there are no suspects in that killing, but in her case, she was brutally beaten a few weeks before her killing and there is video of that beating. And reportedly, those assailants were using homophobic slurs during the beating.</p><p>Now, Dallas police is not saying that these cases are all related. They're not saying that there is a serial killer in Dallas. But they are looking at possible hate crime charges in these cases.</p><p>Now, Texas doesn't have a hate crime statute but the federal government does and they've invited the FBI to help. And as a federal partner, the FBI is investigating.</p><p>But again, there are four transgender African-American women who have been killed in Dallas in the past few days, weeks, and years, and those four cases have gone unsolved -- John, Alisyn.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, Rosa Flores for us following this important story. Rosa, thank you very much.</p><p>So, what do George Orwell's \"1984,\" President Trump, and the continuing crackdown on human rights in China have in common? The answer is way too much.</p><p>John Avlon runs it down in our reality check -- John.</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hey, guys.</p><p>For a guy who has been dead for nearly 70 years, George Orwell has never been hotter. Sales of his dystopian novel \"1984\" surged to the top of the charts after President Trump's inauguration.</p><p>And with every administration appeal to alternative facts or attempts to call uncomfortable truths fake news, Orwell raises his head again, as in this quote from \"1984.\"</p><p>\"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\"</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AVLON: Yes, Orwell seems to be a man for all seasons right now as we confront a rise in nationalism at home and abroad.</p><p>He reminds us that, \"Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism.\" Pointing to the overlap between extremes, Orwell observed that \"A communist and a fascist are somewhat nearer to one another than either is to a Democrat.\"</p><p>And, journalists' insistence on a fact-based debate is entirely consistent with Orwell's admonition that \"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four\" -- even when leaders insist the opposite. But for all the war on facts and demonization of dissent we see in the West right now, we should recognize that our concerns are comparatively quaint because today is June fourth, the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre when hundreds, maybe thousands, of students were murdered in a pro-democracy rally by the Chinese government.</p><p>CNN cameras and reporters were there, sending an important message about the power of the press to stop countries from murdering their citizens with impunity.</p><p>Now, this footage of the person known only to history as \"tank man\" became an instant international symbol of the power of the powerless. His photo hangs here in the halls of CNN and in my own office as well.</p><p>But in the intervening 30 years, the Chinese government has effectively disappeared \"tank man\" and the Tiananmen Square massacre from their national memory. The government censors the Internet, allowing them to remove any videos of the massacre, and mentioning it on social media is deemed subversive.</p><p>[07:45:10] When a BBC crew recently went to China and showed folks video of the \"tank man,\" by their estimation, some 80 percent of folks said they'd never seen it.</p><p>There is no better example of Orwell's warning that \"Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.\"</p><p>And this is happening in our time, often excused by companies who see profit in the promise of wealth without liberty.</p><p>Now, there are brave activists who try to keep the memory of their murdered sons and daughters alive, particularly the 127 Tiananmen mothers speaking out at great personal risk.</p><p>Or consider the social credit scores that use surveillance technology to monitor every aspect of Chinese lives.</p><p>And with the eyes of history upon us, we should not ignore what one Pentagon official has described as \"concentration camps\" full of as many as two million Muslim minority Uyghurs, which \"New York Times\" columnist Nic Kristof called \"part of China's Orwellian war on religion.\"</p><p>Orwell's greatest enemy was totalitarianism and its handmaidens of ignorance and intolerance illustrated by the three slogans of his fictitious ministry of truth. \"War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\"</p><p>It's up to all of us who count ourselves as free to keep George Orwell fiction in the 21st century.</p><p>And that's your reality check.</p><p>BERMAN: So important John because it is not over yet. It is seeping through.</p><p>And thank you for bringing up the Uyghurs -- you know, millions of people in concentration camps largely forgotten.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh my gosh, what a remarkable history lesson, John. Thank you very much.</p><p>BERMAN: All right.</p><p>What is it's over? James Holzhauer's record-shattering \"JEOPARDY!\" winning streak is done.</p><p>What about the players he defeated? What are they thinking this morning? We'll speak to one of them, next.</p><p>[07:50:27] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX TREBEK, HOST, \"JEOPARDY!\": So, Emma, it's up to you. If you came up with the correct response, you're going to be the new \"JEOPARDY!\" champion.</p><p>Did you? You did. What did you wager? Oh gosh, $20,000.</p><p>What a payday -- $46,801. What a game.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN: Down goes James Holzhauer. The \"JEOPARDY!\" contestant who couldn't be beat saw his 32-game, $2.4 million winning streak come to an end.</p><p>Joining us now is Adam Levin. He was a \"JEOPARDY!\" contestant. Until last night, he was the guy who came the closest to beating James. He lost by just $18.00.</p><p>Adam, great to have you back with us. I want to play you some sound that we just heard for the first time of James Holzhauer talking about his defeat because I think you'll find it particularly interesting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES HOLZHAUER, 32 STRAIGHT WINS ON \"JEOPARDY!\": Something that makes me really happy is that I didn't beat myself. I lost to an elite player playing a near-perfect game. It was exactly how I wanted to lose if I had to lose, knowing that I can hang my head up high.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN: So, what's your reaction to the defeat?</p><p>ADAM LEVIN, FORMER \"JEOPARDY!\" CONTESTANT, LOST TO JAMES HOLZHAUER BY $18.00: Well, I mean, first of all, that's exactly how I felt when I -- when I played against James was if you -- if you play the best game that you can play there's nothing to be ashamed about. And I think that's exactly what happened.</p><p>I mean, Emma played a fantastic game and so did James -- and so did Jay, for that matter. It was just -- it was as an exciting half-hour of television as you're going to see and the better player won last night.</p><p>BERMAN: You told me -- you had told me a few weeks ago it would take a perfect storm to beat James Holzhauer.</p><p>LEVIN: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Is that what happened?</p><p>LEVIN: I think so. He wasn't able to take a huge lead early in the first round -- the first \"JEOPARDY!\" round because he got the daily double on the very first clue. So he couldn't double his winnings there.</p><p>And then, Emma went on to -- went on to get both daily doubles in the second round and again, keep James from really building up that lead to the huge margins that we've seen.</p><p>BERMAN: Let's play -- let's play --</p><p>LEVIN: She went --</p><p>BERMAN: -- that moment from the double \"JEOPARDY!\" round here because I think this is so important. I don't think people realize what Emma Boettcher did, which is to an extent, beat James Holzhauer at his own game. So this is her laying it all on the line --</p><p>LEVIN: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: -- in double \"JEOPARDY!\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TREBEK: Here's an opportunity for you. You have enough money to catch and pass James.</p><p>EMMA BOETTCHER, BEAT JAMES HOLZHAUER ON \"JEOPARDY!\": You know, I think I've got to make it a true daily double.</p><p>TREBEK: All right, $15,200. Here is the clue. It's home to the annual United States Sailboat Show.</p><p>BOETTCHER: What is Annapolis?</p><p>TREBEK: That's right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN: And with that, she doubled her money, she took the lead, and then she never slipped behind again. And that's what you have to do. You just have to go big and she was lucky enough to get that daily double. LEVIN: Yes, exactly right, and was able to keep control of the board, too. We've seen other games where James didn't necessarily get the daily doubles but was still able to control a lot of the other questions. But she was just as fast on the buzzer as he was and just was able to keep the pressure up on him.</p><p>BERMAN: One of the most striking things about the game last night was that James Holzhauer didn't get a single question wrong. He actually got -- I guess, 22 was the number I saw.</p><p>LEVIN: Right.</p><p>BERMAN: Twenty-two questions right and he still lost.</p><p>Explain to our viewers why that's so extraordinary.</p><p>LEVIN: Well, I mean, I think, one, it just shows the importance of the daily doubles. And any one of the games he was in could have gone -- that he won could have gone the other way if maybe the other -- the other contestants had gotten those daily doubles and doubled up.</p><p>But, again, I think it just goes to show how talented all three of those players were. Nobody got a question wrong until I think there were three questions left in the game.</p><p>So, you know, again, it's -- he was matched question-for-question by one player and another one who was able to keep it close and maybe deny him some of the points that he might have gotten otherwise. In the need, she just was able to come out on top.</p><p>BERMAN: So now that it's over -- now that his 32-game-winning streak is over, what's the significance of it? How would you reflect on it?</p><p>LEVIN: Yes. I mean, I think -- you know, I don't think we'll see any really significant changes for the rest of this season.</p><p>But I think people have learned now how important those daily doubles are and I think searching them out is going to be a pretty key strategy going on. I know other people have done it before but nobody to quite the extent and that got quite the coverage that James has gotten.</p><p>[07:55:13] So I think when \"JEOPARDY!\" returns next season people will be playing it a little bit differently.</p><p>But, I hope that all the -- all the viewers that tuned in to see James stick with it because, like I said, last night's half-hour of T.V. was as exciting as you can get and I think -- I think we're going to see a lot more of those games that come down to the wire and are exciting.</p><p>BERMAN: I'm on team Emma Boettcher because she played a ridiculously good game.</p><p>Just finally, in closing here, as you were watching that, did you ever have any pangs saying oh man, I got so close -- that could've been me?</p><p>LEVIN: Yes, sure. I wish I had gotten two daily doubles in the second round instead, but that's not the way it worked out.</p><p>And I'm really happy for Emma. I'm glad that somebody was able to do what everybody thought couldn't be done. It just shows that no matter where you are, there's something that people don't think you can do that you'll be able to do.</p><p>BERMAN: She was fierce, to be sure. And you played a terrific game as well.</p><p>Adam Levin, thanks so much for being with us. I really appreciate it.</p><p>LEVIN: Thanks for having me, John.</p><p>BERMAN: All right -- Alisyn.</p><p>CAMEROTA: All right.</p><p>President Trump's state visit to the U.K. -- it is the stuff of \"Late- Night Laughs.\" Here you go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, CBS \"THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT\": Trump also met with the Queen and greeted her with the ceremonial fist bump. Come on, man.</p><p>He got the classic royal tour, complete with a review of the famous Royal Guardsmen. How do you get your hair that much height? What do you do?</p><p>I cannot imagine how much Aqua Net you've got up there. Nobody smoke -- nobody smoke around this guy.</p><p>TRUMP: I don't think much of him. I think that he's a -- he's the twin of de Blasio, except shorter.</p><p>TREVOR NOAH, HOST, COMEDY CENTRAL \"THE DAILY SHOW\": Wait, what? That's a really weird dis.</p><p>This guy's shorter than Bill de Blasio. Yes, everyone is shorter than Bill de Blasio. The guy is like seven feet tall.</p><p>It's like someone being like ha, ha, this guy's has less money than Jeff Bezos. Yes, that's all of us.</p><p>COLBERT: It's not exactly etiquette to call a member of the royal family nasty, especially right before you visit the U.K. That's like RSVP-ing to a wedding, \"The bride sucks! I'll have the fish.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: That's horrible.</p><p>BERMAN: It's the only way I get to see it because we have to go to sleep so early.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I know that. This is one of the highlights of our morning. We hope it is yours as well.</p><p>We also have breaking news because the British media is reporting that President Trump spoke with Theresa May's political rival, Boris Johnson.</p><p>NEW DAY continues right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump meeting with Prime Minister May.</p><p>TRUMP: Stick around and let's do this deal.</p><p>ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The president is downplaying the sense that he has snubbed Theresa May.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have a man who knows nothing about the European Union giving kind of trade advice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not as controversial as you might think. The general feeling is a lot of people actually share his view about the way Brexit is being handled.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is NEW DAY with Alisyn Camerota and John Berman.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, good morning and welcome to your NEW DAY. It's Tuesday, June fourth, 8:00 in the East.</p><p>It is day two of the president's state visit to the United Kingdom and pomp and pageantry have turned into policy and protest.</p><p>And the president is getting down to business. He's meeting behind closed doors as we speak with the outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May. They're talking about trade.</p><p>In the meantime, anti-Trump protesters are on the streets of London. Once again, they were flying that Trump baby balloon over Parliament Square.</p><p>CAMEROTA: CNN just spoke with one of President Trump's biggest critics in London, Mayor Sadiq Khan, who discussed their ongoing feud. We'll bring you a clip from that interview.</p><p>Meanwhile, British broadcaster ITV is now reporting that President Trump and Theresa May's political rival, Boris Johnson, did speak. They spoke on the phone today for 20 minutes. Johnson reportedly turned down a face-to-face meeting that President Trump was offering.</p><p>So we are standing by waiting for President Trump and Theresa May to wrap up their meeting at 10 Downing Street. They will then hold a joint news conference within the next few minutes, we're told, to tell us what, if anything, they agreed to during their meeting. We will carry that event live for you, of course. So, here to discuss, we have Dana Bash, CNN chief political correspondent. We will be joined at some point by Clarissa Ward, who is on the ground over there. She's the one who conducted the interview with the London mayor. And we also have John Avlon here in the studio, CNN senior political analyst.</p><p>OK. So, Dana, just last hour --</p><p>DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: -- you were saying what the political sort of shock waves would be if President Trump and Boris Johnson sat down --</p><p>BASH: Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: -- to meet. They had a phone call.</p><p>So what does that mean?</p><p>BASH: Well, we're -- obviously, this is just breaking and we're talking to our sources to try to get our own reporting on it. But, if ITN's reporting is right on the context of why a phone call, not a meeting, I think it's quite telling.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Let me read it to you again.</p><p>BASH: Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Here is the source. \"Trump called Boris Johnson and offered a one-to-one meeting. The call was friendly and.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Facebook and Twitter have been under fire before. Now, lawmakers are firing back at the tech giants with massive lawsuits. Devin Nunes (R-CA) said Monday that he had filed a lawsuit against Twitter, claiming the social media site has 'shadow banned' conservatives. (RELATED: Elizabeth Warren Calls for Abolishing Electoral College[1]) Speaking to the Daily Caller's Saagar Enjeti, President Trump weighed in on the discrimination of conservatives on a social media call. 'I see the discrimination every day[2]-people not getting through,' Trump confirmed. 'This is definitely something we have been looking into,' Trump added.Rep.

Enjeti then asked would the big tech companies be held accountable for the content they allow on their platforms. 'Absolutely,' Trump answered. Many conservatives have witnessed this for themselves. Twitter shadow bans anyone[9] that they disagree with. Their views on 'hate speech ' are very broad. (RELATED: President Trump is All Set for His 2020 Re-Election Campaign [10]) Additionally, Nunes accused Twitterof publishing defamatory content \u2014 including from a handle that purported to be Nunes's mother and another his cow, according to the complaint, which he said, according to Fox News, had been filed in Virginia state court. 'Twitter knowingly hosting and monetizing content that is clearly abusive, hateful and defamatory which thereby facilitating defamation on its platform,' Nunes said on a Fox News interview. Nunes claimed Twitter 'shadow banned' his account, purposefully blocking the content he posted and limiting his reach on the site.Nunes Files MASSIVE Lawsuit Against Twitter for 'Shadow Banning' Conservatives       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/MTVg5gIbdK\">https://t.co/MTVg5gIbdK</url>[11] \u2014 Dan Bongino (@dbongino) March 19, 2019[12]  Twitter had been warned by many people on the right and the left that they could not go on behaving this way. Yet, the warnings apparently went unheeded. On a Joe Rogan podcast, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was interviewed by a Youtuber[13] that asked him about their obvious bias. The Youtuber warned Dorsey that the government was about to regulate Twitter if they didn't stop the bias.

Facebook and Twitter have been under fire before. Now, lawmakers are firing back at the tech giants with massive lawsuits. Devin Nunes (R-CA) said Monday that he had filed a lawsuit against Twitter, claiming the social media site has 'shadow banned' conservatives. (RELATED: Elizabeth Warren Calls for Abolishing Electoral College[1]) Speaking to the Daily Caller's Saagar Enjeti, President Trump weighed in on the discrimination of conservatives on a social media call. 'I see the discrimination every day[2]-people not getting through,' Trump confirmed. 'This is definitely something we have been looking into,' Trump added.Rep.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 19, 2019[8]  When asked about the lawsuit earlier this week by the Daily Caller, President Trump showed his support for Nunes and the massive lawsuit. Enjeti then asked would the big tech companies be held accountable for the content they allow on their platforms. 'Absolutely,' Trump answered. Many conservatives have witnessed this for themselves. Twitter shadow bans anyone[9] that they disagree with. Their views on 'hate speech ' are very broad. (RELATED: President Trump is All Set for His 2020 Re-Election Campaign [10]) Additionally, Nunes accused Twitterof publishing defamatory content   including from a handle that purported to be Nunes's mother and another his cow, according to the complaint, which he said, according to Fox News, had been filed in Virginia state court. 'Twitter knowingly hosting and monetizing content that is clearly abusive, hateful and defamatory which thereby facilitating defamation on its platform,' Nunes said on a Fox News interview. Nunes claimed Twitter 'shadow banned' his account, purposefully blocking the content he posted and limiting his reach on the site.Nunes Files MASSIVE Lawsuit Against Twitter for 'Shadow Banning' Conservatives       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/MTVg5gIbdK\">https://t.co/MTVg5gIbdK</url>[11]   Dan Bongino (@dbongino) March 19, 2019[12]  Twitter had been warned by many people on the right and the left that they could not go on behaving this way. Yet, the warnings apparently went unheeded. On a Joe Rogan podcast, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was interviewed by a Youtuber[13] that asked him about their obvious bias. The Youtuber warned Dorsey that the government was about to regulate Twitter if they didn't stop the bias.

The letters, first reported on by The New York Times, were delivered last month to the leaders of Germany, Belgium, Norway, and Canada, among others, and demanded they increase their defense spending. The White House is in full-blown Supreme Court mode as it prepares for the announcement of President Trump's Supreme Court pick next week. Trump said he's already interviewed four candidates and reports are that he's intrigued by the prospect of picking the first truly conservative female justice. A wave of relief swept around the world after word got out that the 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a cave in Thailand had been found alive, but that rush of excitement has now turned to trepidation. It will not be easy getting them out. The group has been trapped in a flooded cave in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system in northern Thailand for more than a week. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to North Korea this week to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his team. It will be his third known trip to North Korea as the U.S. continues to push for a deal that will dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program, potentially reducing tensions on the peninsula and recasting the geopolitical landscape of East Asia following the June 12 Singapore summit between Kim and President Donald Trump.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[05:31:28] DAVE BRIGGS, CNN ANCHOR: The latest sign decades-long alliances are crumbling.

NATO members did increase overall defense spending for a second straight year in 2017 but the U.S. still paid about 70 percent.</p><p>The president travels to Belgium next week for the NATO summit.</p><p>ROMANS: Chancellor Merkel also facing a domestic problem with global consequences.

Merkel had been a standard-bearer for welcoming migrants and she stakes her global reputation on it.</p><p>We get more from Atika Shubert live in Berlin.</p><p>Atika, any reaction this morning to this report that we've been telling you about, about the president's demands of Angela Merkel and NATO allies -- the president's scolding letter, frankly, that they pay more?</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, nothing official from the chancellor's office yet. She's obviously been tied up in that political crisis you mentioned earlier. But there's already been a lot of anxiety in Germany, and certainly in the government, about the upcoming NATO summit.</p><p>There is no doubt Germany currently spends 1.2 percent of its budget for defense. That is far less than the two percent target that NATO needs -- or is actually, voluntary in NATO -- and it's set to pay only 1.2 percent for the next four years.</p><p>So this is a major point of contention between the U.S. and Germany. We're waiting to see what the chancellor will say.</p><p>We do know the defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, is expected to hold some sort of a briefing later this evening, so if we get any reaction from that we'll let you know.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Atika Shubert for us live in Berlin this morning. Thank you so much.</p><p>[05:35:01] And, Angela Merkel, with her domestic issues going on about the migrant crisis --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- and also sort of this external pressure from the President of the United States -- the scolding letter saying you guys need to pay up.</p><p>BRIGGS: It should make for a fascinating NATO summit --</p><p>ROMANS: Oh, yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- won't it?</p><p>Joining us this morning from Washington, Daniel Lippman, reporter and co-author of the Politico \"Playbook.\" Welcome back, sir.</p><p>ROMANS: Good morning, Dan.</p><p>DANIEL LIPPMAN, REPORTER, POLITICO, CO-AUTHOR OF POLITICO \"PLAYBOOK\": Thank you, good morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: If you are Vladimir Putin, what do you make of the president's breaking down of these alliances -- in particular, NATO?</p><p>LIPPMAN: So, Putin would not be happy if European countries actually spent all that more money -- all that additional money that Trump wants them to spend. But it's almost like he could have suggested to Trump just keep scolding those European leaders -- let's try to put them down more.</p><p>Because it just hurts the European-U.S. alliance when you have open antagonism between us and Europe because you really want a united front against a Russia that seems to be trying to test its capabilities to expand and project its power.</p><p>They have meddled in our elections, they have meddled in a number of European country's elections. And, Trump doesn't seem to want to talk about this but he wants to continue hitting them over this defense spending issue.</p><p>ROMANS: It's a remarkable conflict of the G7. The president says he'd like Russia to come back in and make it the G8 again.</p><p>You've got the president talking about ways that he can skirt rules of the World Trade Organization.</p><p>And then, this NATO summit coming up where there could be conflict. And you have veteran diplomats, Dan, who are really concerned about conflicts among friends that position Trump to be very friendly with an adversary when he meets one-on-one with Putin.</p><p>LIPPMAN: And a lot of those veteran diplomats that you speak of, Christine -- all of them are retired. There are not that many people still left at the State Department with a ton of experience.</p><p>I wrote a story last year about how the number of applicants to join the U.S. Foreign Service, part of the State Department or diplomatic core, have plummeted.</p><p>ROMANS: Wow.</p><p>LIPPMAN: And so, that's a real concern about is Trump getting enough advice or is he going to leave -- is he even listening to the State Department and Foggy Bottom when they advise him on what to do with Europe and the rest of the world?</p><p>BRIGGS: All right.</p><p>Meanwhile, domestically, it's that Supreme Court opening that is front and center for President Trump. All attention will be focused on that. We got our first glimpse at the first four the president interviewed and four that are clearly on the short list.</p><p>And here's what the president had to say yesterday about this opening and who he might pick.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I interviewed and met with four potential justices of our great Supreme Court. They are outstanding people. They are really incredible people in so many different ways -- academically and every other way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Now, the fact, Daniel, that it's already been farmed out -- that list of The Federalist Society -- these are already --</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- very conservative candidates, what's left on the president's list of qualities he wants to see in this opening?</p><p>LIPPMAN: So, he wants to have good personal chemistry with the nominee and the White House counsel's office is also very interested in what their views are on the regulatory administrative state. Remember, Steve Bannon -- his big hobby horse was deconstructing the administrative state and you're already seeing that down in Texas where they just did not do the proper processes in terms of making sure that they would reunite the kids if they were -- if they reversed that policy, which they did.</p><p>One striking detail that you probably saw but maybe not all of our viewers did, was that Trump is interested in making sure that his justice nominee is very academically well-qualified, but he's not going to actually read any of the papers --</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>LIPPMAN: -- that he's written or any of the opinions.</p><p>He said a couple of days ago that he -- you know, that the opinions were brilliant, but I guarantee you --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>LIPPMAN: -- that he has not read a single Supreme Court opinion. Those are even -- those are hard for even Supreme Court reporters to get through.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: This president is -- he -- television banners and short amounts of material is what everyone around him has said that really motivates him.</p><p>BRIGGS: Central casting will be key here.</p><p>ROMANS: Let me ask you, quickly -- tariffs, that's my beat. The president taking on the world on tariffs. You guys are leading on Politico this morning with a story about how in his own party there are -- there are those who'd like to kill the president's ambitions with tariffs.</p><p>Bring us up to speed there.</p><p>LIPPMAN: Yes, they want to limit his ability to enact tariffs and they also see him abusing his authority on the so-called national security provision. It's hard for the administration to argue that Canada and Europe is a threat to our national security when we're importing products from them.</p><p>[05:40:08] And so they're trying -- Republicans, traditionally the party of free trade, they want to limit Trump's ability to actually carry out these economy-damaging tariffs.</p><p>ROMANS: It's been so fascinating, too, just to listen to some of these companies complain that they're trying to get exemptions from the president's steel and aluminum tariffs and what a bureaucratic mess it is. And then, the lobbying from the American steel producers -- aluminum producers against other American companies from getting exemptions. This is a White House that -- it sort of -- he came into power by saying he was going to get rid of bureaucracy. It's going to take a huge bureaucracy, frankly, to be able to implement his --</p><p>LIPPMAN: And thousands of applications for extensions or withdrawals from --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>LIPPMAN: -- exemptions from those tariffs.</p><p>ROMANS: Fascinating.</p><p>BRIGGS: Daniel Lippman, from Politico. Thanks, my friend.</p><p>ROMANS: Nice to see you.</p><p>LIPPMAN: Thanks, guys.</p><p>ROMANS: All right.</p><p>The Trump administration has one week -- one week to meet a court- ordered deadline for reuniting children under five and their parents who were separated under that Trump policy at the border.</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services is refusing to discuss how many families have already been reunited or even how the process is going. Now, the total number of children in the agency's care unchanged since Friday.</p><p>BRIGGS: On Monday, 11 Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, sent a letter to HHS and the Department of Homeland Security demanding weekly updates and briefings.</p><p>Not long after that request, the official White House Twitter account took a partisan turn targeting Warren and Sen. Kamala Harris for their recent comments about abolishing or reforming ICE. Those posts were actually then retweeted by the president's official account.</p><p>Coming up, they are alive but their ordeal is far from over. Rescuers working on a plan to get that youth soccer team out of a cave in Thailand. We are live there, next on EARLY START.</p><p>[05:46:09] BRIGGS: All hope was about lost. Now, enormous relief in Thailand as rescue teams found a youth soccer team alive in a cave nearly 10 days after the group went missing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RESCUER: How many of you?</p><p>CHILDREN: Thirteen.</p><p>RESCUER: Thirteen? CHILDREN: Yes, 13.</p><p>RESCUER: Brilliant.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The rescue mission, though, far from over. They still must find a way to get the kids and their coach out from underground.</p><p>CNN's Anna Coren live for us in Thailand near the opening to that cave. What a scene it must be and a sense of relief. Anna, good morning.</p><p>ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Dave. Look, it was the outcome everybody was hoping for but few actually thought would happen, and when we got news that those boys were alive -- well, everybody was cheering and crying. There is just a sense of elation and relief.</p><p>Now, I want to take you over to the entrance of the mouth of the cave. We can't access it. It's been cordoned off to the media now but this is where the divers, the cavers -- where everybody is accessing the cave.</p><p>A few hundred meters in that direction, that is where they head every single day. There's another diver coming.</p><p>Over here where the blue tents are there's scuba gear. There's lots and lots of oxygen tanks and they are going to need them over the coming days, weeks, and who knows, possibly months, Dave.</p><p>There is a real possibility that they're going to have to train these 12 boys and their coach how to scuba dive, which in these conditions is extremely, extremely difficult.</p><p>You're talking about flooded caves, you're talking about narrow passageways. The water is muddy, it's thick. Professional divers can't even see in front of their eyes.</p><p>Some of these young boys -- some of these kids, they can't even swim so they are going to have real challenges insofar as teaching them to scuba dive, encouraging them to swim up against torrents of water.</p><p>I mean, people would like to think that they're going to come out in the next couple of days or weeks but it could very well be much longer, Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: Still, at least to have some hope. A tremendous turnabout.</p><p>Anna Coren live for us in Thailand, thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: All right.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo heading back to North Korea this week to meet face-to-face with Kim Jong Un. The Trump administration pushing for a deal to dismantle the region's nuclear program as, frankly, doubts swirl in the U.S. Intelligence Community about Kim's commitment to giving up his nukes.</p><p>CNN's Will Ripley tracking the latest developments. He is live for us this morning -- evening there in Beijing. Hi, Will.</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Christine.</p><p>Yes, the pressure is really on Sec. Pompeo and his delegation when they arrive in Pyongyang on Thursday and they'll be there for two days. And they are expected to present a plan to the North Koreans for full denuclearization in 12 months, but what they're expecting is a full inventory of North Korea's nuclear program.</p><p>How many warheads they have. There have been some estimates that there's upwards of 60.</p><p>What about the nuclear facilities? What about the missiles facilities?</p><p>The United States expects full transparency and a time line. They want the denuclearization process to happen as quickly as possible and frankly, that could be very different -- it's likely very different from what the North Koreans are prepared to give.</p><p>They have long looked at the denuclearization process as a long, step- by-step process with the United States giving up some of its nuclear assets in exchange for North Korea doing the same, and that could really be a non-starter kind of putting to end all of the warm feelings that happened after the Singapore summit.</p><p>President Trump saying that he trusts North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but trust can only get you so far when you're talking about a country that has its nuclear arsenal written into its constitution.</p><p>The Defense Intelligence Agency telling CNN they do not believe that Kim is ready to give up his nuclear weapons anytime soon. That intelligence report being shared around the United States Intelligence Community. If they all concur, that would be a complete intelligence assessment formally passed up to President Trump.</p><p>[05:50:04] But with his skepticism about things like the Russia investigation and other U.S. intelligence work, will he believe the intelligence or will he push forward with possible plans for a summit in the United States in September with Kim Jong Un, as Axios is reporting?</p><p>After Sec. Pompeo leaves Pyongyang he'll travel to Tokyo to meet with his Chinese and South Korean counterparts, and then he will brief the president at the NATO summit in Brussels. And certainly, they'll be lots to talk about, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: Oh, absolutely, no question.</p><p>All right. Will Ripley for us in Beijing. Thank you so much.</p><p>Let's get a check on \"CNN Money\" this morning. Stocks around the world are mostly higher right now. It will be a short day for Wall Street. U.S. markets close at 1:00 p.m. today to get a jump on the Fourth of July.</p><p>A positive day yesterday. A big tech rally countered trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners.</p><p>Dell is ready to return to Wall Street, going public after five years. The computer company went private back in 2013 to look at overhaul its business free from the scrutiny of investors. Dell first went public in 1988.</p><p>Lyft is moving beyond cars. It is buying Motivate, the largest bike- share operator in the U.S. It runs Citi Bike in New York and Capital Bikeshare in Washington.</p><p>Lyft has been moving into other forms of transportation, integrating public transit into its app and allowing users to carpool, but this also lets Lyft compete with rival Uber. Uber bought a bike-share company back in April.</p><p>Summer blockbusters minting a record at the box office, raking in $3.3 billion in the second quarter, the most ever. Two big movies led the way -- \"INCREDIBLES 2\" and \"JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM.\" Both are sequels to well-known properties and together earned about $1.3 billion in June, a big rebound for Hollywood.</p><p>Last summer was the worst box office haul in a decade but this year up, so far, 15 percent. It could go even higher. There are a number of blockbusters still set to be released, starting with Marvel's \"ANT- MAN AND THE WASP\" this weekend.</p><p>A lot of good movies out there to see and --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- it's hot, so a reason to go.</p><p>BRIGGS: I was just going to say the heat is a good reason to get inside the theater.</p><p>Speaking of that heat, it's become very dangerous. It could make you feel as hot as 110 degrees today in the east. The heat wave even turning deadly.</p><p>The full forecast, next.</p><p>[05:56:35] BRIGGS: A Cleveland man facing terror charges. Officials say Demetrius Nathaniel Pitts made plans to bomb the city's downtown Fourth of July parade.</p><p>The FBI put Pitts under surveillance last year after he said on social media he wanted to join al-Qaeda. Pitts told an undercover agent last month he would case downtown Cleveland for potential targets. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUSTIN HERDMAN, U.S. ATTORNEY: He looked for locations to park a van that would be packed with explosives. He talked about taking targets like St. John's Cathedral off the map.</p><p>And just yesterday, he discussed giving remote control cars packed with explosives and shrapnel to the children of our military uniformed members.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Wow. No comment yet from Pitts' attorney.</p><p>ROMANS: Hot, dry, windy conditions fueling the wildfires in the west.</p><p>In California, more than 2,000 personnel battling the County fire in Napa and Yolo counties. In Colorado, more than 100 homes destroyed in the Spring Creek fire. Both those fires have burned more than 60,000 acres.</p><p>And a wildfire burning in north-central Utah exploded Monday into a 30,000-acre blaze forcing the evacuation of between 200 and 300 homes. Officials describe the Dollar Ridge fire as so extreme they can't get aircraft or personnel anywhere near that one.</p><p>BRIGGS: The heat wave blanketing the east coast has turned deadly. Pennsylvania officials say a woman died after going into cardiac arrest Saturday while working in her garden. Nearly 60 million Americans remain under a heat alert.</p><p>Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera in the weather center for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IVAN CABRERA, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Hey, guys. Again, another hot day today. I think though if we get through today we'll be in much better shape heading into Independence Day, Thursday and Friday. We'll get temperatures back to where they should be for this time of year.</p><p>But look at all the heat warnings. Millions upon millions of us still under a either heat advisory, right, or a heat warning across Philly and into New York as well.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, we're sharing the love or pain with the midsection and in Cincinnati as well. We have a heat watch, just a tick down from the heat advisory or warning.</p><p>But still, no matter how you slice it, it's just going to be hot. We're talking temperatures into the 90s and 100s. I'll show you those in a second.</p><p>But while we're here take a look at, once again, large hail and damaging wind potential. Some strong thunderstorms from Rapid City to Lincoln and down towards Yuma as well. Here are the numbers. Highs in the 90s. You factor in the humidity because that's what's been the killer, really, the last few days, right, and it makes it feel like about 100 to 110 for later this afternoon.</p><p>But by tomorrow, temperatures will come down. Look at this. Highs -- oh, this is going to feel like winter now. Temperatures in the mid- 80s from Wednesday heading into Friday and into next weekend -- guys.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Ivan, thank you for that.</p><p>Thanks for joining us.

But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing a strong warning.</p><p> Claiming tech giants \"silence conservative voices,\" Trump tweeted, \"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\"</p><p> And he repeated his claim \u2014 which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley \u2014 that expanding mail-in voting \"would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.\"</p><p> Trump and his campaign angrily lashed out Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots \"fraudulent\" and predicted that \"mail boxes will be robbed,\" among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading \"Get the facts about mail-in ballots\" that guides users to a Twitter \"moments\" page with fact checks and news stories about Trump's unsubstantiated claims.</p><p> Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of \"interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\" and insisting that \"as president, I will not allow this to happen.\" His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter's \"clear political bias\" had led the campaign to pull \"all our advertising from Twitter months ago.\" Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.</p><p> Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.</p><p> But some Trump allies, who have alleged bias on the part of tech companies, have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as \"platforms\" under federal law \u2014 or be treated more like publishers, which could face lawsuits over content.</p><p> The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.</p><p> \"Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\" Republican Sen.

Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, October 11th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global marks are higher this morning, on hopes of a deal with China. President Trump saying that the talks are going really well. China's top negotiator is headed to the White House today to meet with the president later today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures indicating a triple-digit move. Check this out. Dow Industrials right now, up 262 points, 1 percent, S&amp;P is up 29 points, 1 percent, and the NASDAQ up better than 1 percent, 85 points higher after China trade hopes fueled the rally yesterday, as well. At 4:00 on Wall Street, the Dow was up 150 points yesterday, the S&amp;P was up 18 and the NASDAQ was up 47.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we've got a firmer tone there, as well, and there is news there, as well. FT-100 up 32. There are some renewed hopes of a Brexit deal after the U.K. and Irish prime ministers met. They said that there is a pathway to a deal. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 65, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 250 points right now, better than 2 percent, in Germany.</p><p>Hopes of a deal, also triggered a rally overnight, in Asia, take a look, best performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index up 2-1/3 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, this, an Iranian oil tanker was hit by two missiles off the coast of Saudi Arabia, according to Iran. Oil prices are surging on the news, up 1.6 percent on light sweet crude.</p><p>California power outages, meanwhile, some power is being restored this morning, but hundreds of thousands of people are still in the dark, we have the very latest in California, coming up this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to break it all down, FOX Business' Dagen McDowell, Farvahar Partners founder and CEO, Omeed Malik, and Tengler Wealth Management chief investment strategist, Nancy Tengler. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>Have you seen the impact in California, of these power outages yet, Nancy, or have you been here in New York?</p><p>NANCY TENGLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, TENGLER WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Yes. No, well, I've been in communication. It is -- it's third worldly, and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>TENGLER: -- really difficult to wrap your brain around. I mean, some of the cities that are being shut off are not in high risk fire districts, they're close to the city of San Francisco, it makes no sense. I used to manage money for one of the largest firms in San Francisco, on the same street as PG&amp;E. We never lost our power. So, there is an arbitrariness to this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER AND CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: We have an office out there, and we lost internet yesterday --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You did?</p><p>MALIK: -- because of it, yes.</p><p>TENGLER: How do you work?</p><p>MALIK: So, I mean, it's a big problem, but also, we should start following the restructuring that's going on, as well, that's behind the story too. They're in bankruptcy. So, the bond holders are starting to fight, led by L.A. Capital, so let's see what happens. There are a lot more to see on this story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's also -- there's also the story of just the cities, in general, I mean, look at L.A., look at San Francisco, in terms of the homelessness problem.</p><p>MALIK: I was just out there. It's block-to-block without -- you can't go from a block without seeing it.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Those people who are living in tents.</p><p>MALIK: Absolutely, everywhere.</p><p>TENGLER: Needles, human --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you see the needles, as well, on the streets?</p><p>MALIK: Yes. Think about the disparity. You're talking about some of the richest places, not only on this country, but on earth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's really sad.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: But the -- but the issue is, this has been going on, literally, for decades. I lived in San Francisco for a year, during the first dot-com bubble.</p><p>TENGLER: You're right, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was a problem then, and they ignored it, and ignored it, and ignored it, and the problem is, the government -- the liberal -- left wing liberal government thinks that more money is the solution, and what you have happen, like, thrive New York.</p><p>The effort here, in New York City, started by the mayor's wife. He spent roughly $850 million on mental health because mental health is a critical part of homelessness, the Mental Health Initiative. Literally, the mental health situation in New York has gotten worst, despite nearly a billion dollars being spent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you think all this is a direct result of policies, bad policy?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is -- it is bad policy. It is the deinstitutionalization of people who are mentally ill in this country, which has been going on in my entire lifetime, is part of the issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We've got to -- we're going to talk more about that, really important insights from all of you. Our top story this hour, though, is the U.S.-China trade optimism. President Trump says that the talks are going really well. He's expected to meet with China's top negotiator in Washington later today.</p><p>Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning, with more on that. Good morning to you, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you, as well, happy Friday. It is a second day of talks that are set to take place here later this morning, between the main players with the United States and China, Robert Lighthizer, Steven Mnuchin, and Liu He, as those three met for about seven consecutive hours yesterday, here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Just about 45 minutes into the negotiations, President Trump tweeted out that he would be meeting today, with the Chinese vice premier. That Oval Office sit down expected at about 2:45 this afternoon. In China, this morning, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry was asked how the talks went yesterday on day one.</p><p>They would not specifically answer, but did say, \"we hope that the U.S. and China will work together, and work in tandem, and promote positive progress on consultations based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.</p><p>Now, as the meetings were wrapping up yesterday, President Trump gave a rather warm read out of the negotiations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, we just completed a negotiation with China, we're doing very well, we're having another one tomorrow. I'm meeting with the vice premier over at the White House. And I think it's going really well, I will say. I think it's going really well, so we had a very, very good negotiation with China.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: China says that it has proposed a three-tier timeline starting January 1st, to increase the number of wholly foreign-owned enterprises. This could potentially alleviate some of the concerns the U.S. has, regarding I.P. theft and forced technology transfer.</p><p>However, Maria, it's unclear how this proposal was received by the U.S. side. When you look, big picture here, heading into day two of two of these talks, Maria. The outstanding questions will be, will the tariffs be staved off, the tariffs that were expected to go into effect on Tuesday, will there be any sort of deal between the U.S. and China and, if so, what size --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURMAN: -- might that deal or those agreements --</p><p>BARTIROMO: To head off that increase which is expected to take effect on the 15th, I believe. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman is at the White House. Joining us right now, is former RNC chair, former Mississippi governor and the founding partner of BGR Group, Haley Barbour. Governor, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>HALEY BARBOUR, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MISSISSIPPI: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming to us from Washington today, what's your take on these talks with China? Where do you think this is going?</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, you know, I've always said that things are going to proceed with China, slowly. They are not -- you know, look at their history, look at their view of the world, they are very unlikely to jump to this kind of quick deal on a great big -- on a great big bunch of issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARBOUR: So, I think it will be piecemeal, small progress, I do think the president is right, the Chinese have been cheating on their WTO obligations since 2001. The Bush administration, the Obama administration never tried to do anything about it. Trump is right to try to do something about it, but you've got to have patience when you try to deal with the Chinese.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Let's talk 2020 for a second, we had a new FOX News poll, shows that former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren are gaining support of more than half of the Democratic primary voters. Biden remains the frontrunner, 32 percent there, that's up 3 points since last month. Warren is up 6 points, she's now at 22 percent. Bernie Sanders is down one point.</p><p>What's your take on the race, so far?</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, that's a great big field, but it's narrowing. I think, it's no question that Biden has been hurt by all of this going on in Ukraine and revelations, frankly, that he made himself about, when he was vice president, and threatening the Ukrainian government if they didn't fire their prosecutor general.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, very own message for the Democratic left and, of course, it helped her that Bernie Sanders had a little heart problem.</p><p>MALIK: Hi Governor, it's Omeed. Yes, with the race, it's very early days, a lot of game to be played. We remember that Howard Dean was leading John Kerry in 2004 at this time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.</p><p>MALIK: Look what happened there. But I --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's the night Howard Dean sounds.</p><p>MALIK: That was very scary, thanks for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're welcome.</p><p>MALIK: You woke me up. So, with respect to China, on the policy of maximum pressure, Marco Rubio is proposing a law about divesting pensions that invest in China, and in addition, there are other proposals not letting Chinese companies list on our stock exchanges.</p><p>I've been curious about our views on this as part of a maximum pressure effort on the Chinese, to try to get them to -- to get to the table and have a broader deal.</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, I do think that -- if we're serious about trying to get something done, there is going to have to be maximum pressure, if you will, if you want to use that term. There has to be real pressure that they feel that makes a difference. And you see in their economy that their growth has slowed down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARBOUR: They are feeling this, but, at the same time, it has negative effects on a lot of U.S. industries and agriculture. So, you know, this deal cuts both ways, but if not now, when? That's the real question.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, what about this whistleblower controversy, Governor? The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine scheduled to sit down for a transcribed interview later this morning. Now, we have this new report that the Ukraine whistleblower worked in the Obama administration, with then Vice President Joe Biden.</p><p>It is turning into one of Washington's most contentious issues. What's your take on this impeachment inquiry?</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, look, the Democrats decided long, long, long ago, that Donald Trump ought to be impeached, now they're trying to decide why. I mean, that's what all of this is about. They're looking for something that they can sell to the American people.</p><p>If you -- if you look at what Vice President Biden said he did, and threatening the Ukrainian government withholding nearly a billion dollars, if I remember right, of U.S. aid, if they didn't fire their prosecutor general. Donald Trump and his administration did nothing vaguely close to that.</p><p>And, you know, don't take my word for it, that's what the president of Ukraine says. That he didn't feel threatened, that it wasn't blackmail, that this was no pressure.</p><p>So -- but I just think that this is going to continue, the Democrats are absolutely focused on this, if Ukraine went away tomorrow, it would be something else next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARBOUR: I am -- I'm a -- I'm a recovering lawyer, Maria. And I remember in the American jurisprudence system in English, that people who are accused have a right to confront their accuser.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BARBOUR: In this case, the whistleblower rules, apparently. You not only don't have the right to confront your accuser, you don't even have right to know who your accuser is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's all in secret, Governor, I know. And that's why it's really lost a lot of credibility. It's all in secret. We don't know what anybody is saying. They want to impeach a president behind closed doors. Let me --</p><p>BARBOUR: And they want to do it purely on hearsay.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I want to --</p><p>BARBOUR: The whistleblower apparently has told the inspector general, I don't know anything directly, but I've heard all these. It's like me saying, well, I watch CNN, and I've heard all these bad stuff about Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And I also want to know if the Democrats met with the whistleblower. I mean, it sounds awfully similar to Christine Blasey Ford, where I know that they met with her for 30 hours, before she testified, and brought charges against Brett Kavanaugh. Did Adam Schiff and his staff meet with the whistleblower to help him or her carve up this complaint?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Some of the latest is, that the lawyers for this whistleblower don't want to have this individual testify in person or asking, that the whistleblower submit testimony in writing, instead of appearing in person. This is according to reporting in the Wall Street Journal today.</p><p>And Newt Gingrich brought up the issue of Trump impeachment. Here is the article, I've printed it out yesterday, will Trump be impeached? It was written in Vanity Fair, November 14th, 2016. It was right after -- there was actually someone quoted on the record saying, well, they can impeach him because of the Trump University --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- if it's judged to be a fraud, so this is at play. But what the Democrats are clearly trying to do, is use the Ukraine issue, to open the door, to investigate anybody and everybody, related to this administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And again, the thought that they would try to bring impeachment charges related to obstruction of Congress. So, this White House, legally, is withholding information and -- so they're going to try to impeach him for blocking an impeachment proceeding that actually isn't an impeachment proceeding.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How insane is that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: They got -- they got their guy. They've had their guy for a while now, took a couple of years, and they're just looking for the reason to impeach. They've got their guy, now, they've got to find the crime.</p><p>Also, it's really unnerving to see Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intel Committee, sit there at the podium, to kick off a hearing and make stuff up, right? He's got the transcript in front of him, but he decided to embellish and say -- and create this conversation that happened, that actually didn't happen. So, there's that, as well.</p><p>BARBOUR: Yes. You know, I was not an English major, Maria, but parity, usually doesn't have anything to do with the facts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Governor, it's great to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>BARBOUR: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Haley Barbour joining us. Coming up, eye on oil this morning, prices are up, 1-1/2 percent, and reports an Iranian oil tanker was hit by two missiles off the coast of Saudi Arabia. We are bringing you the very latest developments, all morning long, on that story.</p><p>Then, ready for takeoff, Boeing and Porsche joining forces to make a flying car, it is all-electric, wait until you see this, how you can get your hands on this, behind the wheel, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. An Iranian oil tanker attacked in the Red Sea. Cheryl Casone with headlines now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, Maria, Iranian officials are claiming that two missiles hit an oil tanker off the coast of Saudi Arabia. Iran state television says strike caused a leak and that's an oil spilling into the Red Sea. That leak is reportedly been stopped. Energy stocks heading higher on that news. Oil as well, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Schlumberger, all the stocks are higher in the premarket. Oil moving higher as well.</p><p>In California, hundreds of thousands of PG&amp;E customers are still in the dark. The utility cut power and areas that are vulnerable to wildfires. PG&amp;E CEO apologized for poor communication and incorrect outage maps. He also said future power outages are likely. Governor Gavin Newsom slammed PG&amp;E calling the situation \"unacceptable.\" PG&amp;E higher by half a percent in the premarket.</p><p>Flying cars may be here sooner than we think. Boeing and Porsche are partnering to make an electric-flying vehicle. Earlier this year, Boeing tested an aerial car that could fit four people and fly up to 50 miles. Porsche saying it wants to become a leading brand for premium mobility which could mean moving into the third dimension of travel.</p><p>And Georgia Mall. If you watch Stranger Things, you're going to like this story. The Georgia Mall that's in the last season of Stranger Things is actually up for sale. The whole mall. Now the price remains a mystery. The deal reportedly includes most of the Gwinnett Place Shopping Center. This is suburb of Duluth. The mall is crowded with people in Stranger Things but in real life, not so much. In fact, no one noticed that a body was left there for two weeks back in 2017. I know. But if you love the show, that story was for you. Even though the big monster kind of blew up the mall on the show. But anyway, besides that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cheryl, thank you. We have breaking news right now. I want to bring you this Fox Business alert. President Obrado of Mexico telling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a letter that he is confident that USMCA will pass. That's according to a report from Reuters this morning. He writes, Mexico is not seeking any changes to the deal and that the country is just waiting on others' approval.</p><p>We are also expecting Canada to do the same and of course we are waiting for the speaker to bring the bell to the floor for a vote. We'll take a short break. When we come back. Shares of Apple are nearing an all-time high this morning. We tell you what's driving that stock. Up 1-1/4 percent right now. And then beer without the buzz. Brooklyn brewery gears up to launch its first ever non-alcoholic beer. How it's impacting business later this hour. Right here. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We're watching shares of Apple this morning nearing all-time high, up 1-1/4 percent. Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at that and the border averages. Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right. Good morning, Maria. Hey, looks like a happy Friday down here. We'll have to wait and see what trade headlines we get but so far so good. Let's start with Apple. Shares of Apple higher today as you can see up 1.24 percent. Wedbush, Dan Ives raising his price target to 265 from 245. This is ahead of Apple's launch of its video streaming service. He sees big potential here.</p><p>Show stopping pricing is what he says in his note. They have an installed base of 900 million active users worldwide with those iPhones quickly. That closing 232.07, intro day 233.47. We'll be watching that all day. Meanwhile, Roku price target race from 107 to -- from 107 to 155 by RBC. The analysts saying one of the best positions to take share a very large under printed -- penetrated 70 billion T.V. market. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gerri, thank you so much. Wow. What a move 7-1/2 percent. You are watching Apple as well, this is one of your largest holdings, right?</p><p>TENGLER: Yes, yes, Maria. It is. We -- I spent half of my life defending this stock during periods of difficulty. Now, in 18, 19 multiple, we're net sellers of the stock. We've been taking some of our profits because we were buyers about four years ago. And I think you just have to come down and say, you know, the job of an investor is to sell to eager buyers.</p><p>And so we're going to -- we're going to scale out of the stock overtime. We were buying last January when -- or this January when it got, you know, when they disappointed on earnings. Nobody want to own that stock and now we're going to sell it to the growth stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you feel like -- obviously you must feel like much of the growth story has already been realized or you just made enough money that you don't want to be greed and you want get out or -- I mean, what's the growth story going forward?</p><p>TENGLER: Well, the growth story services and now you've got an iPhone cycle, Dan Ives is one of the best on this stock on Wall Street. So, I pay attention to what he says but as an investor, my job is to make money for my clients and not to just round trip things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TENGLER: So we're not selling out wholesale but we are turning back on our holdings. We sold some last week, you know, we'll be selling again. It's our largest and we -- or forced to sell actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Broader market is there. Arguments we made on me that you want to start scaling back and selling into these big rallies or do you think the growth story and the backdrop still remains strong?</p><p>MALIK: Yes. I'm saying when I think the backdrop definitely remains strong especially if we do get a deal, I do think market is going to react very positively even though a piecemeal deal which is where it looks we're headed, you know, politically I don't agree with that but the markets are in a different state of mind. They just want to see a deal get done.</p><p>They're desperate for it and we've seen over the last five or six months. They react to every piece of news. But broadly speaking, I think the indicators are still very positive about the American economy and by the way where else are you going to go?</p><p>TANGLER: That's true too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, the China trade hopes feeling markets this morning. Futures set for triple- digit move at the start of trading. What's at stake for a truce with China just hours ahead of President Trump's meeting with China's top negotiator.</p><p>Then a brew for everybody. Brooklyn brewery gears up to launch its first ever non-alcoholic beer across the country. We're taking you there live for a look and into the trend and how it's impacting business.

We're headed to brewery to find out what's all the excitement about.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning. But first, our top story this half an hour, U.S.-China trade talks day two. Talks of picking this up morning, President Trump is expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House later today. The president sounded optimistic last night and yesterday about the negotiations before he left for a campaign rally, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We just completed a negotiation with China, we're doing very well, we're having another one tomorrow. I'm meeting with the vice premier over at the White House and I think it's going really well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the China Beige Book CEO, Leland Miller. Leland, great to see you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>LELAND MILLER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BEIGE BOOK: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your characterization of this meeting and so far the talks between the U.S. and China?</p><p>MILLER: Well, it's a totally different environment than what we saw back in August when everybody was mad at each other. You are seeing a lot of U.S.-China tension of the national security side of the relationship but in trade they have been able to put this in separate track, I think both sides are interested in moving forward. The president wants A.G. Buys and he want something more if he can get it. The Chinese want some tariff funds, they want some tariff pullbacks if they can get it. And I think we're moving closer and closer to getting that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But can the president do a deal without including some of those big ticket items that the U.S. wants like the theft of intellectual property?</p><p>MILLER: I don't think so. I think what -- he could do a baby deal. He can -- he can get some A.G. purchases, he can get some forward momentum on this. But what the White House really wants is this perfect middle highway where they can actually pull back some of the tariffs, put them on a more sustainable trajectory. A lot of even hawks in the White House want to see tariffs pulled back to 250 billion.</p><p>At the same time, they get some concessions on Chinese I.P. from the original made text, they get agricultural buys. So there is a middle way and the White House is going in that direction and we're going to see if they can get it.</p><p>TENGLER: So, Leland, some of the -- rather we hear is that China is really slowing down in that we're in the much stronger position and we also know that sometimes the Chinese members are -- maybe somewhat suspect. And so, I'm wondering what your data collection is showing if it's matching what the government is putting forward?</p><p>And then do you think that this transition of American companies may be moving supply chains away will continue?</p><p>MILLER: No, this is exactly what we're seeing. You know, we actually saw a more resilient Chinese economy earlier in the year because there was a lot more credit provision into it and the Chinese were admitting but even with that credit provision and a return of shadow banking and record bond sales and quite high bank borrowing we still saw a third quarter that dropped almost across the board.</p><p>Much weaker data, the weakest quarter we've seen. So the Chinese are under pressure particularly in this third quarter more than they have been any other part of the year. And I think from the other -- the other part of this is that -- is this is pushing, the tensions and relationship are pushing this schism in terms of supply change. So, the Chinese have lots of pressure from all different directions which is why they're more amenable to a deal than I think many people think.</p><p>TENGLER: Interesting.</p><p>MALIK: Yes. I guess -- Leland, thanks for your input. How scare are they of the potential for us to divest out of their companies within pensions and mutual funds and more over to they think it's realistically concern that we may prevent them from listing on our exchanges here? Those would be very punitive measures for us to take against them.</p><p>And as you're probably aware right after financial crisis, there were these reverse mergers that their companies would come on to our stock exchanges, acquire them and then they were basically mostly frauds.</p><p>MILLER: Right. This is a huge move but it includes an entire spectrum of moves we could be doing towards it. Now, the idea of forceful delisting, just ordering a Chinese company off the stock is not going to happen. What has been talked about is requiring Chinese companies to adhere to the same rules that American companies do adhere to. So Alibaba doesn't need to have its books looked at.</p><p>TENGLER: Right.</p><p>MILLER: Wal-Mart does. There are fairness issues at play here. There is also another thing which they're pushing very hard right now which is that there is government pension money that is going to be flowing as of next year into Chinese companies if the government pension system starts reflecting the MSCI which is moving towards China's inclusive index, they're looking very closely at that and whether they tweak it and make sure that money is not flowing from U.S. government workers to Chinese companies and ultimately to the POA.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are we going to see any impacts from this latest news from China now? China is saying, it is willing to remove those limits in terms of foreign ownership for financial services companies. How significant is that in your view?</p><p>MILLER: I think it's a good first step. So, you know, we need to see this but the question is, not whether they're going to remove the limit. The question is whether U.S. companies, whether foreign companies can operate inside the Chinese economy without retribution, without non-tariff barriers, without un -- regulations that are -- that are just stymieing? Are they going to be able to operate in an entrenched environment where Chinese companies have market share in all the major sectors.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But right now if you're an American company, J.P. Morgan, I mean, any bank you want to go into China you can't own 51 percent, right? You have to own 49 percent of a joint venture, does this change that?</p><p>MILLER: It will change it. So 51 percent theoretically means you're in control of your business and will the Chinese really allow you to be in control of your business?</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're skeptical.</p><p>MILLER: I'm skeptical of this but even if you get the ownership change, the question is, can you compete against companies that have been entrenched there for two decades?</p><p>BARTIROMO: The protests in Hong Kong, how much pressure is this putting on Xi Jinping? Hundreds have already flooded the streets this morning for another weekend pro-democracy demonstrations, then there's the NBA story. NBA staying silent, canceling all media availability following that controversial news conference yesterday. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Hi. Christina MacFarlane, CNN. The NBA has always been a league that prides itself on its player and its coaches being able to speak out openly about political and societal affairs. I just wonder after the events of this week, and the fallout we've seen, whether you would both feel differently about speaking out in that way in the future?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Excuse me. We're taking basketball questions only.</p><p>MACFARLANE: It's a legitimate question. This is an event that happened this week during the NBA.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: This particular question has not been answered. James.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they apologized, should that CNN reporter now have canceled all media opportunities. This is going to have a wide ramifications. Isn't it?</p><p>MILLER: I think this is a game changer. You know, you've seen the Chinese government put pressure on hotel chains and airlines and others for years but that didn't really erupt in a public anger, it was just an inconvenience for Americans reading the paper. They didn't like it. This is something different. This is becoming America issue which crossing the partisan divide. I think Chinese badly played their over -- played -- overplayed their hand at this point and I think the NBA is realizing this and that's why they're shutting down their people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MILLER: They want to hit reset, they want to come back, you know, figure out the way they should handle this and realize they need to be into more than just the business. They got to figure out the political sensitivities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But look at all these other companies that are getting bullied, Marriott has been bullied and some companies are rolling over. We had the story of the app. Companies pulling apps related to the Hong Kong protests from their app stores after pushback from the Chinese government. You know, Apple among them pulling back that app that was allowing people at Hong Kong to identifier where the police where.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Google has pulled the Hong Kong protest app as well after Apple did</p><p>MILLER: Right. And I think the issue here is that, you know, everything is going to be questioned under free speech suppression line. So, Apple is going to get a lot of pushback by Americans, by Congress in terms of what they did there. Now, there's an open question, did it violate the technical rules that Apple has in terms of the app store? But the question -- the whole fact that we haven't been looking closer what rules are and what apps are getting kicked out because of this for clearly political sensitivities. This -- all of this needs to be reexamined. I think this is the -- just the beginning of the reexamination.</p><p>MALIK: We don't have the regulatory regime in place to handle these issues right now. We need to codify them. In the NBA's case, they probably are under an antitrust he exemption. And that might need to be looked at if they continue to put China's values over Americans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is a really important subject and I -- and I think what I hear you're saying is sure, the Chinese are going to relax these rules in terms of ownership but what happens when you get there, they're still going to be the bullying and the -- and pushing these companies to do it China's way even if app is in Hong Kong.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes.</p><p>MILLER: That's the problem. I mean, you know, this is -- this is going to be a question, you know, Congress has been looking for ways to get more involved in the U.S.-China relations for a whole. This may be a new era where Congress starts to really step its game in terms of U.S.-China relation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And every time I refer to Steve Kerr from now on I'm just going to say communist Steve Kerr --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- change the subject, comrade because he tried to change the subject rather than asked about human rights abuses in the United States here in China and brought up people mowing people down with AR-15s.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, to equate America, the freest country on the planet to what's going on in China is really disgraceful. I agree with you. I mean, you know, you have concentration camps that are holding, you know, two, three million Uyghurs right now, you've got the tracking of citizens, you got massive human abuses in China to equate that to the U.S. the way he did is unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They control the internet. The Chinese people can't -- they do not have the freedoms that we do here in the United States and rather than standing up, again, it's always the irony as he has the ability to speak his mind because he is an American citizen. Because he comes from this country, because we protect that very speech but to do it to use your freedom of speech to basically blow back at the United States and to criticize the United States and our way of life and our values on foreign soil is just beyond the pale.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really is, it's disgraceful and this is really a debate and a fight over values. You know, China and the U.S., very different value system. Leland, it's great to get your insights.</p><p>MILLER: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Leland Miller joining us. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The leader of Ethiopia winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Cheryl Casone with headlines now. Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been awarded this year's coveted award for his work to end two decades of conflict with neighboring Eritrea. The two countries feuding over border land causing financial and humanitarian issues there. Ahmed calls the award \"A price given to Africa, given to Ethiopia.\" He was elected Prime Minister just last year.</p><p>General Motors CEO Mary Barra looking to get striking workers back on the job hoping to jumpstart negotiations with the United Auto Workers Union. Barra met with the president of the UAW earlier this week. The strike is nearing the one-month mark. Despite that meeting though, the job action may not end for a while. Associated Press sending a letter to G.M. from the UAW's vice president which says he doesn't know how long it will take to come to terms. That is an issue.</p><p>And the separate-ledged employees, G.M. had a global manufacturing. So the company's offer of the union would increase compensation for workers as well as create \"a clear path to permanent employment for those temporary workers.\" G.M. is higher by almost 1-1/2 percent in the premarket. And there you go, Maria. Back over to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thanks so much. We want to show you this picture here. Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin is arriving for these talks this morning with the -- with the Chinese officials. We are waiting for any details out of this important meeting and we know that President Trump will be meeting with Liu He, the chief negotiator from China at about 2:45 p.m. Eastern this afternoon.</p><p>Of course, the meetings though are beginning eminently in Washington. We just saw Steven Mnuchin entered the building and we are waiting for the Chinese officials to enter as well as these high-level negotiations continue for day two today in Washington.</p><p>We've been talking a lot about this story of course all week. It has dominated markets attention and our program as well. Take a look at some of the top moments from the program this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chinese businesses cutting ties with the Houston Rockets after its manager expressed support for Hong Kong' pro-democracy activists in a tweet.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): He's got a large percentage of people standing up in Hong Kong every Saturday, peacefully protesting for the idea of freedom of speech. This is -- this is a defining moment. The Houston Rocket G.M. should be -- should be celebrated because he understands what America means.</p><p>PALMER LUCKEY, FOUNDER, ANDURIL INDUSTRIES: We have big problem where the biggest technology companies in United States, say China is their biggest revenue growth opportunity. And a lot of the smaller tech companies see China as a huge investment opportunity. The Chinese money is going to flow into their company. And so they make decisions that are based on this. And often they'll say that they're doing things for one reason, and behind- the-scenes they're actually being influenced by this desire to work with the Chinese over American interests.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chinese government, there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, you just got your partner back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Caught your reaction.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, that's cheeky and American. Good for South Park. Look, it's appalling to me what the NBA has done groveling in front of the Chinese. The idea -- with all due respect to Veronica, the idea that the Chinese people who love American basketball are going to change President Xi's mind. I think it's not accurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have been such as an incredible leader in this industry for 25 years that I know you with integrity and that's why the firm is trusted. Tell me how things have changed over this 25-year period.</p><p>CHARLES SCHWAB, FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION: Well, First of all, I loved investing, I love people who love to invest. And I've always want to make it better easier and cheaper for people to invest and get more people into our democracy in terms of free market capitalism. And so we've done it.</p><p>ANA BOTIN, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, BANCO SANTANDER: We are expecting lower rates means that the recovery could be more sustainable, you know, U.S. is at full employment. Basically the lowest unemployment ever for 50 years, so we see the U.S. consumer being very resilient and at the end of 70 percent will be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your thoughts on the president and the White House saying look, we're not going to participate in this impeachment what some people are calling show as opposed to an impeachment inquiry.</p><p>PETER SCHWEIZER, PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE: If you're going to conduct an impeachment inquiry, you might as well have a vote on it and make it official having an unofficial so to speak impeachment inquiry doesn't make sense, so I think the position is completely reasonable on the part of the White House.</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think if you have week after week of the New York Times and the Washington Post and all the major networks giving their version of reality, it has an effect. Does it mean that Trump is going to lose the election? No. Does it mean he's going to be impeached? No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I scream, you scream, we all scream for the museum of ice cream. New York City's sweetest pop-up experience.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I used to dream about going into the ocean filled of sprinkles and I was like, why doesn't this exist as an adult? And so we made it for world to experience.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The museum of ice cream is reportedly at $200 million. I mean, it's so successful, you've been dubbed the millennial Walt Disney.</p><p>MARYELLIS BUNN, CEO AND FOUNDER, MUSEUM OF ICE CREAM: You look at that, you know, creating the next Disney for both millennials and gen Z and they're really looking towards experiences of our products.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: You know, it's been a tough year for farmers. You're right during the crosshairs but they put something in the crosshairs, this is something called a corn cannon and what they do is you take one of those layers of corn, that doesn't get you much in commodity markets these days and then fire it, let's see. Ah, hey, I hit the pumpkin. Look at that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Brooklyn brewery launching its first ever non- alcoholic beer. Kristina Partsinevelos is there in Brooklyn with the details on this unique brew. Good morning, Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Look at this, I'm surrounded by alcohol but what I'm holding in my hand is a non-alcoholic beer. This is a Brooklyn Brewery Special Effects hens the design on the cans over here. Right now we are in the brewery, this is all alcoholic beer like I mentioned, they make over a hundred kegs, large kegs I have been told.</p><p>But the importance is the trend that we're starting to see towards non- alcoholic products. According to the Beer Institute, overall, beer sales have declined 2.5 percent which is quite drastically. So, you have a lot of companies that need to diversify. We spoke specifically to the CEO about this and about the demographics of his new customers. Listen in.</p><p>ROBIN OTTAWAY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BROOKLYN BREWERY: It's the younger people that can kind of see where this fits in their lives because maybe they don't have some of the preconceptions that older generations had about non-alcoholic beverages, so they're coming into our world with much more variety.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: The CEO went on to say that the goal of this is to break the stigma and it's not -- we're not talking about the stigma only for pregnant people and those that are sober but also that just don't want to drink some alcohol. So they're launching this. Hoping it will do -- what's actually doing quite well, they launched in it Sweden and several countries over there. It's going to be launched here in the United States in eight states by November but it's on tap behind me.</p><p>Then in January, they're going to have a massive rollout, about 30 states, so if you're wondering those at home, you know, I don't like beer or I'm concerned about how much is -- how many calories, how much it's going to cost, so this special effects can is 85 calories, so less than a can of beer. A six pack will cost you around 10 bucks. And this is something that we're starting to see more and more, Maria.</p><p>The fact that people are tapping into different trends and one of the last questions, we did ask the CEO is would you ever consider going into, you know, the CBD products, the hemp type of alcohol, the spiked seltzer and you -- he said, you know, they can go in any direction as long as it stays true to the brand. So, for first time ever, I will try, we got to do it this live television and let you know.</p><p>I did just brushed my teeth which is probably not -- oh, that's really what we want to happen on live television, just splatter on my face. And it's a hoppy lager. There you go, Maria. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, does it taste good? You like it?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: I -- so, yes, it actually -- it's a little bit lighter than what I expected but it definitely tastes like beer and I have it dripping down me right now but -- yes, I know, it taste like beer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Lighter though, a little bit lighter. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Kristina Partsinevelos. We'll be right back with some final thoughts in this all-star panel.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to show you more live pictures right here. Steve Mnuchin, treasury secretary, along with Liu He arriving for these trade talks right here. Bob Lighthizer, the trade representative as well. So this day two of talks is under way. As you can see there, just walking in. We know that Liu He is also going to meet with the president later today. That's happening at 2:45 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>But we're going to be watching these meetings of course for any news that comes out of these meetings in Washington and we have these new pictures for you as the Chinese delegation has arrived for the trade talks for day two and we will keep a watch on for any details in terms of what happens next. Markets are rallying on this meeting, of course, and the idea that maybe things are going well.</p><p>That's what the president said yesterday, after initial -- the initial meeting yesterday. Market is up 262 points but the markets have been following this like a bouncing ball, every comment that comes out, markets are trading on. We'll be right back. We want to keep looking at this, because this is the issue that's driving markets. But there are other issues as well. And you talked earlier about the potential for a slowdown. You're not seeing it, Nancy?</p><p>TENGLER: Not at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In terms of a recession.</p><p>TENGLER: Right. Yes. We don't -- we don't see it. The hand-wringing has been over the ISM, the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing. And we just don't see that happening. Five times since this expansion began, non -- or manufacturing has fallen to the 50 or below level which is where we get contraction in the economy. And we think we're going to bounce off this and that you will average about 10 to 12 percent in stocks and that's not bad. As we were talking earlier, there's not a lot of other places to go. So (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is -- this is the broader backdrop from a story that is obviously being driven by the Chinese talks. Going into this week, Dagen, you know that the Chinese said that they wanted a smaller deal. They wanted to just focus on trade and not anything else. We had headlines today that the Chinese are willing to do away with their foreign ownership rules on financial services companies.</p><p>That's the first industry that's going to get that. Up until now, you had to own 59 percent at best in terms of a -- having any ownership of your company in China.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, but it's -- and also, recently clearings the approval of licenses for American firms to do business with Huawei, if that move is completed that would be a huge improvement in these talks. So that's clearly under discussion in the last couple of days.</p><p>MALIK: This is a national security issue. We can't take that -- separate those two things. But my prediction is that we are going to get a small deal because this is bad for both countries and my hope is that some agreement will happen. But not lose sight of the bigger picture that this country is starting to talk about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you do that? The Chinese don't want any, you know, anything in there that gives consequences for theft of technology.</p><p>MALIK: And to your point, that's a huge issue. Because even if they allow you to have some percentage ownership of a business there, what ends up happening is they basically might steal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Great show, everybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And meantime, the NBA visit is a tire fire.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hasn't gone out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.

Our top stories. The special counsel flailing and the Dems' desperation and deep state dismay on full display tonight. Robert Mueller reportedly intent on using Attorney General Sessions in a poorly considered effort to go after President Trump, building a certain to fail argument of obstruction of justice, a charge that has nothing to do with Russia collusion and like collusion, it has nothing to do with President Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We take up the sorry state of Mueller's contrived witch hunt with attorney Victoria Toensing and FOX legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Congressional RINOs, determined, apparently, to save their own seats and skins by sacrificing the seats and skins of conservatives and mainstream Republicans. And the RINOs and their leaders have landed on, you guessed it, amnesty for illegal immigrants, which will assure the Dems a huge midterm victory if they follow through.</p><p>RINO Ryan acolyte Kevin McCarthy says they're still working on a DACA deal. Disaster at the border and in the midterms, no concern of theirs just as long as Wall Street, the Koch brothers and the Chamber of Commerce keep their money flowing. Tennessee Congresswoman Diane Black is among our guests here tonight. She'll be talking about the fight to fund the border wall, her means of funding the border wall and fake news caught in the act by the president once again.</p><p>The New York Times busted for lying about the massive crowd at President Trump's national rally. And this time, President Trump gets a rare gift in return. We'll tell you all about it here tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This feels just like before our election. This is a big crowd of people. This is a lot of people. It's a lot of people. With bad weather and bad everything and they're still coming in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And our top story tonight, Robert Mueller desperate to keep his presidential subversion mission going while RINO Republicans have developed a strange strain of schizophrenia in the increasingly absurdist Russia witch hunt. With the credibility of his all Democrat Dem (ph) team shredded (ph) and even Dem and (ph) the deep state warning him not to interfere in the midterm elections, Special Counsel Mueller is now fully focused on taking the farce he leads to new levels.</p><p>Obstruction of justice the call now. Mueller already knows he has zero chance of indicting a sitting president, period. And yet, he has apparently come up with a new direction for his incomprehensible and confused investigation, focusing now on a meeting between President Trump and his attorney general, a meeting in which the president asks Sessions to reconsider his recusal in the Russia case.</p><p>Even RINO Trey Gowdy, no friend of the president and committed establishmentarian admitted Sessions never should have taken the Attorney General job if he intended to recuse himself. But as is the RINO way, Gowdy found a quick way to return to his form and defend the FBI's action in planting a spy in the Trump presidential campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got and that it has nothing to do with Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: If you can believe that. Extraordinary. Extraordinary. A piece of reasoning. Here to sort it all out, attorney Victoria Toensing, founding partner at diGenova &amp; Toensing. Victoria, great to have you with us. I mean, but I -- when I saw Trey Gowdy say that, I -- I was stunned. Because even by his standards, that's confused, it is absolutely absurd and it's contradicted and contravened by history.</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, LAWYER, DIGENOVA &amp; TOENSING: Well, as I understand it, they didn't see documents, they just got a briefing. So there's -- to rely on -- on a briefing, I don't trust nothing until I see the documents and so I don't know why he's out spewing this stuff when -- he sounds incredible. And he also says -- this is (ph) the same thing -- well, if the president doesn't have anything to hide, he should just sit down with Mueller.</p><p>No. Give me a break. It's spoken like somebody who's never been a defense attorney, which he hasn't and if he were and gave that advice to Trump he could be sued for ineffective assistance of counsel. Let me tell you about Scooter Libby. You know -- you know -- the (ph) nutshell. He came in to the grand jury and said X and a journalist said Y and guess what? Scooter got indicted. And he didn't have anything to hide at all.</p><p>This is -- this is ridiculous. I'm -- I'm going to just quote Jim Comey about this. He says if a prosecutor doesn't know his case in a year, he should be fired because he's incompetent. And now it's been a year. Mr. Mueller, it should be over.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, Victoria, I think you're exactly right. But this goes beyond that. As all of us in the media -- let or right wing media, whatever you want to call it, is all of us following this, citizens by the tens of millions watching their president being pursued, persecuted when there -- there is (ph) on its face just nothing to the case whatsoever. And as you say, it's not only been a year for the special counsel but that special counsel case is built on over a -- almost a year of investigation by the FBI.</p><p>And it is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: -- everyone knows -- everyone knows there is nothing there by the - - by the admission of the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, by the report of the House Intelligence Committee and the special counsel himself has come forward with nothing within the scope of the mission.</p><p>TOENSING: Let me add one more point --</p><p>DOBBS: Sure.</p><p>TOENSING: -- that is (ph) also important because Trey was an assisting U.S. attorney out in -- you know, in South Carolina. But he doesn't know Maine (ph) justice. I do. I was deputy assistant A.G. there. And I know what cartwheels and -- and angst everyone went through to even open an investigation against a member of Congress. I can tell you that to open this investigation against the presidential campaign within months of the election had to go to the attorney if not to the White House.</p><p>This is not done lightly in the Department of Justice. And he doesn't -- Trey doesn't know. He doesn't know diddly-squat about what the rules are for opening an investigation into a presidential campaign.</p><p>DOBBS: And -- and -- and Gowdy is a lame duck. So it's almost like he's job hunting out there as he does -- gets ready for his term in Congress to end. I mean, the man is confused just in his own narrative. Let's turn to that narrative, that the people would want a spy planted in the presidential campaign if there were Russian meddling. Don't you think that it would be -- the first thing you would expect of the FBI is first to stop the meddling and to go after the Russians who were doing the meddling.</p><p>And instead, we had a president in President Obama who did absolutely nothing, an FBI, a CIA, an NSA who as best we can tell knew not a thing about what the Russians were doing and were absolutely impotent to stop it, to thwart them or any way defend the interests of the United States.</p><p>TOENSING: Well here's the proper protocol. They should have gone to the presidential campaign and told them that they were fearful that the Russians were trying to infiltrate, meddle, whatever it is, the term burn (ph) they want to use and ask for their support. And they did not do that. Why? Because they were busy making up the evidence to frame the president. That's what they were doing. That's what this is all about, talked about it for about six months now.</p><p>There was a brazen plot to frame President Trump, then the presidential candidate.</p><p>DOBBS: And again, you know, I think you're exactly right. But all of this understood, all of this now understood to the American people and yet the special counsel goes on. And we now are watching the Dems and the deep state in Washington in particular divide over the issue of whether there was a spy in the campaign or an informant, as if that is a distinction that amounts to a difference.</p><p>The -- the narrative is now turned, they were simply trying to protect the Trump campaign, not -- and watch out for Russians. Even as they did not do a thing, as far as we know, in the (ph) investigation whatsoever of (ph) the Russian offensive, largely a cyber offensive against the United States.</p><p>TOENSING: You know, one of the reasons, they say, was the Michael -- General Flynn got $45,000 for a speech paid for by Russia. Well, Bill Clinton got a half a million dollars on a speech from Russia. Where were they in there protecting the -- the Clintons from the Russians for goodness sake?</p><p>DOBBS: And as you mentioned, the president getting a half million dollar speaking fee, we cannot forget that almost $145 million went into the coffers of the Clinton Foundation and -- by any -- any reasoning of any kind of honesty there was a connection, a paper play that went right back to Uranium One and the scandal that followed. With Robert Mueller, by the way, acting as errand boy to the Russians during the entire -- well, event.</p><p>TOENSING: Mueller was the FBI director --</p><p>DOBBS: Yes.</p><p>TOENSING: -- at that time.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. Yes. And here we go, as if this is -- we're supposed to pretend that all of this makes sense Victoria? There -- where is there -- is there not a large, in this country, any spirit that says when your are confronted by the absurdity, the obvious lies, the obvious crimes that have been committed and the obvious dereliction of duty and failure to intercede in a Russian offensive against the U.S elections and the interest of this country, there was not a single person in the intelligence community that was so -- they were so sure of Trump's collusion with Russia, but the couldn't figure out what was happening in real time and couldn't mount a counter offensive. That's stunning.</p><p>TOENSING: Well here again is where Trey Gowdy is really off track. He says, well let's just let the investigation take it where it needs to go. No. The President has to be president and he has been harmed by this ever since the first day he took office.</p><p>He cannot make a decision about Russia without having it second guessed because of the Russian collusion. He's got to make decisions about Russia. I mean Barack Obama did, he was doing reset which failed.</p><p>But the President still has to deal with Russia. He has to deal with foreign leaders. What -- they read the papers, they have to come in and say, hey are you going to be here next year at this time. That takes away his leverage with them.</p><p>DOBBS: Which is .</p><p>TOENSING: This is affecting the Presidency and it's got to stop.</p><p>DOBBS: And it's obviously the purpose of the both the Special Counsel, the Democratic party and the deep state, which is to support this administration and they certainly, if they have their way, will not stop with this Special Counsel recon by .</p><p>TOENSING: And this obstruction of justice -- this obstruction of justice is ridiculous.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I haven't talked to an attorney who I respect that thinks that there is any possibility of prosecuting a president for obstruction of justice in any form. Period.</p><p>TOENSING: Well he could, yes, if they said, oh and destroy evidence, but let the tutorial on obstruction of justice is that you have to willfully interfere with the process of justice by threatening a witness, I'm reading it from the law books, influencing or impeding a witness. Now what impeding did the President asking the Attorney General to unrecuse himself? There was -- it didn't affect the investigation in any way what so ever .</p><p>DOBBS: And doesn't go to the intent .</p><p>TOENSING: Embarrassing legally. It's embarrassing that Mueller doesn't know better than that.</p><p>DOBBS: And powerfully there has never been a president, either ever indicted for obstruction of justice, ever charged with obstruction of justice .</p><p>TOENSING: You can't indict a .</p><p>DOBBS: . let alone successfully prosecuted. What?</p><p>TOENSING: You can't indict a sitting president, so there.</p><p>DOBBS: No, no. Another little problem for this Special Counsel. All right, Victoria, as always, instructive, great to have you with us. Thanks so much. Victoria Toensing.</p><p>TOENSING: Bye.</p><p>DOBBS: Still ahead, even Dems are warning the Mueller team not to meddle in the midterms. I think they're a little late. Looks to me like that effort is well underway. We'll have more on the fake witch hunt, well it's a real witch hunt, the fake Mueller phony witch hunt, how's that? Legal analyst Gregg Jarrett joins me here next.</p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Even some Dems, some of those in the deep state are warning Special Counsel Mueller and his 13 angry Democrats, as the President likes to call them, not -- not to mess around with the midterm elections. Take a listen to Congressman Chris Coons.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS, D-DE: I would expect that if there is going to be bombshell announcements out of the Mueller investigation, we'll see them in the next two months and we won't see big announcements in the weeks leading up to the midterm election.</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: And you're -- and that is what you are calling for, just to be clear, correct?</p><p>COONS: Yes, I think -- yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Okay.</p><p>COONS: I believe that it's important that the Special Counsel avoid any major announcements in the weeks before -- the months before the midterm elections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I misspoke, he's Senator Coons, not Congressman Coons. Fox News legal analyst is exactly that. Gregg Jarrett, author of the new book \"The Russia Hoax: The illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump,\" now available for preorder everywhere you go to preorder such wonderful products as your book.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, LEGAL ANALYST: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Which we recommend highly.</p><p>JARRETT: Thank you very much.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with \"The New York Times,\" I mean where do we go with all of this?</p><p>JARRETT: Well, \"The New York Times\" is desperate, but Robert Mueller must really be desperate if he thinks that scolding the attorney general over his wrongful recusal is somehow obstruction of justice.</p><p>Under the law, obstruction requires a corrupt purpose, and as Victoria pointed out, a lie, threat, bribe, destruction of evidence or altering a document. Scolding you A.G. because he was dumb in relying on the wrong regulation in his recusal is .</p><p>DOBBS: That's what I just pointed out for .</p><p>JARRETT: Yes. It is not obstruction of justice and so this just underscores what a colossal waste of tax payer money Mueller has cost us.</p><p>DOBBS: What -- as I asked Victoria, let me ask you this. I mean we now know many of the facts that are fundamental to the Special Counsel appointment, we know, for example, Rod Rosenstein, there is no question about his conflict. The series of conflicts profound and disqualifying conflicts that he had .</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: . whether it pertains to Mueller, whether it pertains to the very idea of being a Special Counsel. The country understands the corruption, the abject profound corruption of the Department of Justice leadership and then of the FBI, the five top officials in the FBI are gone. Why do we persist in this? Why are we, in the media, supposed to pretend, even though we certainly do not, but anyone in this media pretend this is just a perfectly rational process in history in which the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump is being persecuted by the deep state and the Democratic party.</p><p>JARRETT: Americans now are beginning to realize who the president is, the victim not the villain here. That there was never any evidence of a crime to justify a criminal investigation. No legitimate intelligence to justify counter intelligence investigation. And Americans are turning against Robert Mueller and James Comey. The latest CBS poll found, a majority of Americans believe this investigation is politically motivated and Americans are right, it is.</p><p>DOBBS: No question about it. Let's turn to Jeff Sessions. The president saying point blank and this is one of the many things that we love the president for. I mean he just said straight forwardly, I don't care what you call it. I wish I'd chosen a different man to be - or woman, to be the attorney general of the United States. And certainly, my gosh, when you look at what Jeff Sessions has done and the way in which he's gone about it. Anyone in their right mind would say what have I done here watching him perform.</p><p>JARRETT: Yes I've called it .</p><p>DOBBS: Perform.</p><p>JARRETT: . affectless attorney general and that's a generous assessment of his skills, he has no skills. The president is rightfully angry because Jeff Sessions, while he was standing there taking the oath of office knew that he would be recusing himself. He testified before congress that the very next morning he met with officials at the department of justice to put in motion his recusale. And again he relied on the wrong regulation in the recusal. But he betrayed the president, he wasn't honest with the president of that. He should have told president Trump, here is what I'm thinking about doing.</p><p>And the president who said hold on a minute this is an important investigation, you need to be in control of it. Let's look at the law and they would have concluded, I don't have to recuse myself in a counter intelligence probe only in a criminal case. Said it was then not a criminal case. So you know this was a severe and serious betrayal of the president of the United States. No wonder he is angry, I'd be doubably angry.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes it's - this president is measured, he's shown patience of an extraordinary degree. And he still is the sail from 360 degrees from every quarter in this country. Even though he has a rising approval rating and a base that is so understated by the national left way media that it's observed. But this is really cold comfort because we are watching a president who could do so much .</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: . if unfettered by these little left wing, deep state gnomes who inhabit much of Washington.</p><p>JARRETT: The democrats I think are running scared about this Mueller probe. They're beginning to realize the boomerang effect that it will have in the mid term elections if it persists.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes.</p><p>JARRETT: Unless you add(ph) senator Warner saying it needs to end this year. No kidding senator. Now isn't that a clever thing he did.</p><p>DOBBS: He's just got to be just cackling to himself at the old boys school lounge right now. As he suggested it. Wrap up sometimes this year. This is the man who - well, yes anyway. I'm more upset with Richard Burke wrinkle for turning over the senate intelligence.</p><p>JARRETT: They're two peas in a pod aren't they?</p><p>DOBBS: Yes well pea as you would say is a nice word for what they are. Gregg Jarrett who only uses nice words let me assure you.</p><p>JARRETT: Thank you Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Appreciate it. Be sure to vote in our poll tonight, do you believe Netflix will pay a price for it's partisan payoff to the former president and first lady? Just asking. Cast your vote on twitter at LouDobbs. Follow me on Twitter at Lou Dobbs, like me on Face Book, follow me on instagram at Lou Dobbs Tonight. I `m sure president Obama does.</p><p>JARRETT: Probably not.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely sure not.</p><p>JARRETT: Maybe not.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next president Trump holding a massive rally last night in Nashville and the fake news media, they got caught lying through their teeth. Can you imagine that? And we're going to tell you the really good news in that fake news. Ed Rollins, Michael Goodwin join me here next, stay with us we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: You're going to love this. Fake news, New York Times caught lying on the crowd size at the Trump rally in Nashville last night. President Trump called them out with his Tweet saying the \"Falling and Corrupt NYTimes estimated the crowd last night at \"1,000 people\" when in fact it was many times that number in the arena was rocking. This is the way they demean and disparage. They are very dishonest people who don't get me and never did!\" Well New York Times reporter Julie Davis did recant Tweeting \"President Trump is correct about his crowd last night. My estimate was way off and we have corrected our story to reflect the fire marshals estimate of 5,500 people. When we get it wrong we say so.\"</p><p>Oh sure you do. And even their apology the times continuing to down play the size of the crowd. All man, the president's campaign putting out their own report estimating a crowd of 8,000 strong. We're going right here with a 1,000. I'm telling you right now. And don't you love the fact that Ed Rollins former Reagan White House political director, great America pack chairmen and Michael Goodwin Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the New York Post are both with us tonight on this historic accusation which the New York Times - Michael the New York has admitted they were wrong and wronged the president.</p><p>MICHAEL GOODWIN: Yes I'm an aluminist of the New York Times and on days like this I don't tell anybody. So let's just keep it amongst ourselves.</p><p>DOBBS: He only missed by five times. I mean .</p><p>GOODWIN: But what's amazing is how can you -- if you are sitting in that crowd and you're estimating, how can you be so wrong unless, it's part of what you want. You want it to be a smaller crowd. That's the clear implication when you're so far off.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, I think he's right, the mean disparage.</p><p>GOODWIN: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: That's the purpose of a left-wing media in this country and they really think they're serving some high purpose. Namely, Hillary Clinton when they do it. I mean, there is still embedded in these people and absolute disgust for the craft and the tenets of this craft and a just an absolute commitment to furthering the interest of the left-wing ideology and the partisan Dems.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well it kills them because they just can't understand how someone like Donald Trump could be elected president and --</p><p>DOBBS: You know let's think about that, wait a minute,</p><p>ROLLINS: Seriously.</p><p>DOBBS: Think about that, which one of these idiots in the National left- wing media or the White House press core, you know, would be able to carry his books to school? He's smarter than they are, he's been more successful, I mean, who that heck they're these -- who do they think they are?</p><p>ROLLINS: They totally underestimate the public out, that the public basically had a very long tedious campaign. They made a judgment, she ran a crummy campaign, he ran a great campaign.</p><p>DOBBS: Wait a minute.</p><p>ROLLINS: No, just let me finish.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, I'm going to let you finish.</p><p>ROLLINS: She spent -- she spent 10 times more money than he did, she inherited the Obama campaign couldn't implement his structure and he wanted fair and square and they still -- two years later, still complaining about it.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, you know I want to find her square, but you left out one part, she ran a crooked campaign. The entire Democratic Party was led by crooked cheating, I don't even -- what do you call Debbie Wasserman Schultz? What do you call --</p><p>GOODWIN: Well and she -- and she had the FBI on her side, she had the CIA on her side, she cheated the Obama White House.</p><p>DOBBS: She quashed Bernie Sanders. And that -- and that guy basically went out and said you know, I got myself a beach house or on the lake, I mean -- and he was satisfied (INAUDIBLE) I mean that -- I mean they drained his blood, we could see it happening before our eyes.</p><p>GOODWIN: But Lou you asked her who do these people think they are, me in the New York Times, that they think they are the elite of the country who should pick the President of the United States. You know after the Washington Post editorial board met with John Kasich, one of the members came out and said we all thought that should be the Republican nominee. Now, this women editorial board that has never endorsed the Republican for president but they want to pick the Republican nominee, that's who they think they are.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well they pick President Hillary Clinton. The Hillary they pick President Kerry, they picked President Gore. Those are the endorsements that they've made in the last several elections, they'd never endorsed a Republican.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>ROLLINS: And never will.</p><p>GOODWIN: New York Times has not endorsed the Republicans since Dwight Eisenhower.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, let me turn real quickly to the Obama is going to work for Netflix their content officer Ted Sarandos and his wife -- his wife became ambassador to the Bahamas. Thank You Mr. President Obama. And they put $50 million, it looks like a payoff and he's pledging there won't be any politics in it. The only thing they know is politics, so just exactly what would be the point of bringing them on with $50 million of company money?</p><p>GOODWIN: Well Netflix has become a real Obama administration hopping off point, right. Susan Rice is on the Netflix board now.</p><p>DOBBS: Board.</p><p>GOODWIN: Well yes, look, I mean, I saw that too that there won't be any politics but that's what he said about Obamacare too. That's what he said about all those policies (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS: This was -- this was Sarandos saying and not just Trump -- not just Trump. We wouldn't take -- we wouldn't take -- I mean, not just Obama we wouldn't take Obama's word for that.</p><p>ROLLINS: I promise you, I don't know what's he going to do, talking about his presidency or he's going to talk about community organizing. But Netflix is an ongoing money-making machine right today and it's going to get damaged by this, I'm convinced of it.</p><p>DOBBS: Do you think people are going to boycott it?</p><p>ROLLINS: I think a lot of people boycott it.</p><p>DOBBS: I think anybody's going to --</p><p>ROLLINS: Just ask the NFL -- just ask the NFL how it works when you --</p><p>DOBBS: Do you think anybody's going to go to their account logo, go in there and just disengage from the DVD service, the streaming service and just --</p><p>ROLLINS: I think it could happen here. I think it could happen.</p><p>DOBBS: I think it could too. (INAUDIBLE) I know some people who did that, I know something. Ed Rollins, Michael Goodwin, thank you both for being here.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, things are looking out for the historic June 12 summit. The prospects for it at summit of course between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. We'll have the latest for you. Dr. Sebastian Gorka is here next. We're going to talk summit, we're going to talk Comeys and what happened to all of that intervention by the Russians in our elections? Do any of our intelligence agencies actually work? Let's find out here next, stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Negotiations between the United States and North Korea moving ahead, hoping to move ahead to in fact through the realization of that June 12th summit planned in Singapore. Today Secretary of State Pompeo met with the top North Korean diplomat here in New York City. The White House also sending delegations to Singapore and to the Korean DMZ where they are holding talks with North Korean officials. Joining us tonight is Fox News National Security Strategist, former strategist to the president, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Great to have you with us, Seb. Let's start with these talks moving ahead the White House making it clear, if they can and if the conditions are right and that means that basically assurances of denuclearization according to some template that the administration has that June 12th meeting they think can still happen.</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX BUSINESS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Yes Lou, it really looks as if things are back on track. And knowing who we have in the White House now John Bolton, Pompeo at State, Mattis at Defense, this isn't going to be some airy-fairy piece of paper, this is going to be incredibly stringent. I've recommended that we have American inspectors access to civilian and military sites and also snap inspections, none of that garbage from the Iran deal from Obama where the Iranian have 30 days where you have to clean up their sites.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, I don't think anyone has any illusions about this administration having any kinship to the previous administration. There is this issue of China that is --</p><p>GORKA: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: -- percolating and I think perhaps even profoundly in the background, whether it be the reaction to U.S. ships in freedom of navigation maneuvers in the South China Sea, whether it be trade talks that Mnuchin led frankly to the verge of disaster, which have been rescued it appears. But still we're looking at 301 actions by the administration against some of the imports that's in abeyance until of the 15th of June further penalties could ensue and by penalties, I mean, tariffs from -- so we're seeing some real tough talk here coming as well from the Chinese leadership. What do you make of the strains and the prospects and potential import to the overall relationship with China.</p><p>GORKA: Well I learned very rapidly once I was in the White House. I came in to do counterterrorism, but I learned once you have the clearances and read the reports that there's only one strategic threat we face today, and that's China. And luckily the president came around to that view as well and he takes this very seriously. That's why we have the 301 investigation, the tariffs and everything else. The real challenge is not the White House, the challenges the U.S. business elite especially in Silicon Valley. These people have facilitated the rise of China when Apple, when Google go in there and invest and give away their I.P., their intellectual property as part of their access to those markets. Basically, they're undermining not only the U.S. economy but U.S. national security. So, this is an educational process as much as a national security one. And we need the private sector to get on board with the president's message that China cannot be allowed to displace us economically or militarily.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, and to give that a balanced perspective as well in terms of the types of industry not only Silicon Valley and big tech but also U.S. manufacturing which includes --</p><p>GORKA: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: -- some of our most elite companies, including, elite in the good sense. They're rarified expertise and products. And that is Boeing for example, having to do compelled transfers of I.P. in order to sell aircraft to China. And the list goes on. All sorts of deals like that which the president to his great credit has identified and is trying to reverse but with a congress whose leadership is bought and paid for by the Koch brothers, the Business Roundtable and the Chamber of Commerce. It is very difficult and Wall Street, very difficult for the president to carry his message through. Today the president dealing with that very issue remembering very clearly Bob Iger walked off one of his industry councils, business councils, taking a shot at him. The bad blood inappropriately so this president when he needed help, and you know, people like Iger were a problem and not part of the solution.</p><p>GORKA: Yes, Lou at the end of the day it's a very simple question, it's the conflict between short-termism and making your shareholders happy at the next quarterly meeting or whether it's actually the interests of the nation writ large. All Americans we have to have a long-term approach because, guess what? The Chinese have won.</p><p>DOBBS: And there is also a very simple word for the problem and that is multi-national when applied to businesses. They are -- no matter where they do business they had better be American businesses operating globally. Dr. Sebastian Gorka as always, we appreciate it. Good to have you with us.</p><p>GORKA: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, President Trump calls out the left-wing national media for hypocrite -- hypocritical treatment of Roseanne Barr. We'll have the story for you straight ahead. Yes, it goes on, stay with us</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump accusing ABC of double standard after the network canceled its hit show Roseanne over the stars controversial and racist tweets. Fox News Media Correspondent Howard Kurtz with our report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Everyone has an opinion on ABC's cancellation of Roseanne Barr show which she plays a dogged Trump supporter. And today the President himself joined the fray. Rather than assess Bars racist tweet likening former Obama a Valerie Jarrett to an ape, the President tweeted that Disney CEO Bob Iger called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ABC does not tolerate comments like those made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J Trump to apologize for the horrible statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call. This followed a bizarre tweet storm overnight in which Barr ripped her critics, apologized and blamed a sleep medication. Guys, I did something unforgivable so do not defend me. It was 2:00 in the morning and I was ambient tweeting. It was egregious, indefensible. That prompted the drug's manufacturer to declare that racism is not a known side effect of any Santa Fe medication.</p><p>Now, some Roseanne fans say HBO should boot Bill Maher for once jokingly comparing Trump's hair to an orangutan. Twitter can be a treacherous tool for anyone in public life. CNN fired host Reza Aslan for tweeting that Trump was a piece of S an embarrassment to humankind. CNN also fired pro- Trump Contributor Jeffrey Lord for tweeting the Nazi salute, Sieg Heil. But ESPN took no action against former Sports Center co-host Jemele Hill for tweeting that Trump is a white supremacist. She was later suspended for suggesting that Dallas Cowboys be boycotted over player protests. MSNBC did not discipline host Joy Reid for decade-old homophobic tweets she admitted were dumb and hateful. Trump's tweeting has also drawn flak from mocking MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski for a supposed facelift to yesterday's unproven charge that Robert Mueller is meddling with the midterms but he also punches back against vicious criticism.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ: Twitter erupts in anger so quickly that offenders can lose their jobs and their reputations within hours as Roseanne Barr just learned even having T.V.s most popular show doesn't protect you. Lou?</p><p>DOBBS: Certainly not if you're in Hollywood. Howard Kurtz, thank you. On Wall Street, stocks closing higher. The Dow Jones Industrial is up more than 300 points, the S&amp;P up 34, the NASDAQ climbing 66 points, volume of the big board picking up to 3.5 billion shares, total mortgage application volume dropping nearly three percent for the week marking the sixth straight week of losses even as home prices rise. And a reminder to listen to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network. Up next, RINOs claim they're this close to getting an illegal alien amnesty vote on the House floor. All of this and more we, take up with Congressman Diane Black. She joins us here next.</p><p>DOBBS: Platoons of RINOs in the House are pushing for amnesty for illegal immigrants even if it runs the party right off the cliff in the midterms. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy telling Fox News the GOP is very close to bringing an immigration bill to the House floor that would include some kind of a DACA deal. A group of RINOs working with the Dems to force a House vote on a number of immigration bills but party leaders oppose that idea, we are told, but what if they're forced to do it? Wouldn't that be terrible because then they could line up with their, well the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, the Koch Brothers, you know the usual bunch? Well joining us tonight is an outstanding Republican Congressman from Tennessee. She's also the Chair of the House Budget Committee, Diane Black joining us tonight, great to have you with us. And this is -- I've got to share this with you because RINOs, do you like that word RINO?</p><p>REP. DIANE BLACK (R-TN), CHAIRWOMAN, HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE: I do like it. It says what they are.</p><p>DOBBS: We had a viewer named Wanda, if we can show this because Ed Rollins is very concerned about the use of the term RINO. RINO, he loves rhinoceroses and so Wanda's suggestion, instead of RINO, because he was looking for something -- some way to avoid it she suggested opossums, there they are, well, one of each and armadillos. And she said she prefers possums. Nobody ever calls them opossums that I've heard. Possums, I don't think we've got it yet Wanda but let's see what the Congressman says. What do you think? Do you want to go with RINO or armadillo or possums or keep looking?</p><p>BLACK: I think I'm going to stick with the RINOs because the acronym actually is just exactly what it is. And so I think I'll stick with RINO.</p><p>DOBBS: So you've got an idea about border security that I think's fascinating and that is to raise the money and build a dadgum wall. Just get it done.</p><p>BLACK: That's right Lou. Look, we have been talking about building this wall. Past administrations continue to say yes, we're going to build this wall but it doesn't get funded. And so I have an idea that will jumpstart all of this and that is to actually have a dedicated fund within the Treasury where the American people who want to see the wall will have an opportunity to be able to just send their money in. And people ask me well, is this something that's new? Of course it's crowdfunding but it was done actually with the Washington Monument where there was a lack of completion and the people all over the country said yes we want to have this finished and so they did what was now called crowdfunding and you can go to the Washington Monument you can see these are plaques that are dedicated to people that put the money in various groups and so on. Look, we know it won't fund the entire wall but people are anxious to support the President and secure our country and so we want to get crowdfunding going and this gives us an opportunity to be able to say send your money into a dedicated fund. We'll make sure the money goes to building the wall.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, I love the idea. I've only got one question. How long will it take?</p><p>BLACK: Well, of course, if we were only to crowdfund it would take probably quite some time but this is along with whatever we were able to get from Congress to put the money there. Look, we should have put the money there a long time ago.</p><p>DOBBS: Can I ask you this?</p><p>BLACK: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: I'm going to ask you this. You're the chair of the Budget Committee, you got a Republican leadership in the House, Republican leadership in the Senate, they're both RINOs as we know. I won't ask you to comment on that. I know it might create some unease for you and I don't intend that, but it does create more than unease for the American people. It's a national security issue. The President has proposed it and what the House sent to this President with at 1.3 omnibus was no funding for the wall whatsoever, not a dime, not a dime for the wall, and there's still no money to build a wall. And that's -- I'm sorry.</p><p>BLACK: Oh no that's because we have to deal with the Democrats and unfortunately --</p><p>DOBBS: Wait a minute. So what's the point of having a Republican Party are electing new people at?</p><p>BLACK: Well, that's what I say. If the Senate doesn't change their filibuster rule, they will continue to do this until they get 60 Republicans.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, but this was the House. This was the House, Congressman.</p><p>BLACK: But this has been something that we have talked about funding for a long time and we put that out there and we send it over to the Senate and the Senate is really our stopper in so many of these bills. It is so frustrating for me to do.</p><p>DOBBS: Can we -- can we agree then? Can we get rid of Mitch McConnell? Can you and I agree on that? I know it will work on Ryan --</p><p>BLACK: Now, that's up to the Senate to do, but I think we sent enough Republicans over there from the House of Representatives that were frustrated when they were in the House and then they end up not doing anything to push it in the Senate. We would have the last three to four years even when the Obama administration was there been able to get a lot more done had they just had a simple majority like the Constitution calls for, very frustrating.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, if we had more congressmen like Diane Black, I would agree. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.</p><p>BLACK: You're welcome. Thank you for having me.</p><p>DOBBS: Diane Black, good to see you. Tonight's quota the evening for the beleaguered and appropriately so Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It was Lao Tzu who said, \"If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.\" That's it for us tonight. Thanks for being with us. See you tomorrow night.

Yes, we'll see.</p><p>Also folks, coming up this morning: former Arkansas governor and former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee; chairman of Laffer Associates and former Reagan economic advisor, Art Laffer; former Whitewater independent counsel, former federal prosecutor and Thompson and Knight partner Robert Ray. And Milken Institute's Asia fellow Curtis Chin.</p><p>You do not want to miss this all-star line up.</p><p>Our top story though of the hour, President Trump versus the Democrats. Nearly half of the Democrat controlled House now back impeachment inquiry, at least, against the President. The numbers steadily climbing closer to a majority.</p><p>House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler ramping up his push for impeachment.</p><p>Maria Bartiromo spoke with House Judiciary and Intelligence committee member John Ratcliffe yesterday. He said the case for impeachment is becoming a joke.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): My personal view is that he richly deserves impeachment. He has done many impeachable offenses. He's violated the law six ways since Sunday but that's not the question.</p><p>The question is, can we develop enough evidence to put before the American people. We've engaged in investigations into these different alleged crimes and to whether the President violated his oath of office.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Do you think you've popped the impeachment bubble?</p><p>REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R-TX): I think everybody saw and a lot of Democrats have conceded that it's time to move on, that there's a hole in the impeachment balloon that's large enough for Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff to walk through together.</p><p>Look, it's becoming a joke. I think people see that and Nadler and Schiff are starting to look more like \"Laurel and Hardy\". It's time to move on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: Joining me now, Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House and \"Collusion\" author, Newt Gingrich. Newt -- thanks for joining us.</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Glad to be with you.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, it felt like last week with the Mueller testimony that this would have been the end. That we would never, ever hear about this yet again.</p><p>And here we are, where more and more Democrats are still climbing on-board the impeachment train. What do you make of it?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, look, I think that the Democrats don't have any policy ideas that they want to go to the country with so this is what they're left to talk about in the House.</p><p>But I watched Mueller last week and my first reaction was, and I wrote a piece on the newsletter about this Friday, I mean, who wrote the report? It was very clear that Mueller did not write the report. He didn't understand the report. At points, various congressmen were reading back to him his own report to correct what he was saying.</p><p>So, One -- we ought to find out and I hope Attorney General Barr will really push hard to find out who was really in charge since obviously Mueller wasn't.</p><p>But second, I reached the conclusion after all of this noise that there was an effort by a government to affect the election of 2016. Unfortunately, that government was the American government under Barack Obama and it was the FBI and the Justice Department and some other key people in the Obama administration who were trying to affect the election in a you way that clearly violates everything we've known about how to elect a president. PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GINGRICH: So, I came away from all this at least as worried about what the Americans had done illegally and inappropriately to change the election as I am about what the Russians may or may not have done.</p><p>PAYNE: So when you say who wrote the report, are you suggesting they're not those who did wrote the report were motivated -- politically motivated and hence, you know, taking us through this two and-a-half year, $30 million drama -- is that where you reach your conclusions that perhaps it was the Obama administration -- yes.</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, you know, When I first heard that Mueller was being appointed, I tweeted at the time and a lot of liberals have cheerfully retweeted since then that I thought that his record was terrific, he was an outstanding person, he had a clear tradition of being bipartisan.</p><p>But the man I watched last week, I began to realize that he really wasn't the Mueller of historic fame, that he had come into a job unprepared to do it. I'm assuming that the left wing Democrats, and that's all he hired -- I mean his lawyers were entirely anti-Trump. I assume they actually ran the project and the goal of the project was simple. Avoid dealing with the Clintons, avoid dealing with the real sources of corruption, avoid dealing with the people who started the whole Russian story. And focus only on the Trump side of the equation.</p><p>And I think if you were to look at it honestly, it's astonishing how many things the FBI and others were doing to interfere with and undermine the President and before that the Presidential candidate on a totally one-sided basis.</p><p>PAYNE: So how hopeful are you then that this will be, you know, revealed through efforts by Barr, the IG report we keep hearing about. Will we get more conclusive evidence of this?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, I think from everything I've heard and I don't know much more than anybody else, but from what I've heard the inspector general is doing a professional, very thorough job. In in fact that comes out with the kind of information I think it will, then I think the chairman, Lindsey Graham, of the Senate Judiciary Committee will have an opportunity to establish an investigation.</p><p>Look, for example, why was it if you were for Clinton you could lie and nothing was done to you, if you were for Trump you could end up in solitary confinement for months.</p><p>I mean you go back and look at exactly the same kind of patterns, it is such an overwhelmingly anti-Trump protect Clinton process that I have to assume that it was the left wing lawyers, some of whom by the way had worked for Hillary Clinton, some had actually been at an election night party for her. It's not exactly like this was in any way a neutral effort.</p><p>PAYNE: I want to talk about the White House shakeup. Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats will be leaving the job next month.</p><p>President Trump tweeting the announcement yesterday saying I'm pleased to announce that highly Dan Coats, the current director will respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to be the director of national intelligence. A former U.S. Attorney John will lead and inspire greatness for the country he loved.</p><p>Dan current Coates, current director will be leaving office on August 15, I would like to thank Dan for his great service to our country. The acting director will be named shortly.</p><p>Newt -- your take on this change.</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, first of all I think John Ratcliffe did an amazing job dealing with the Mueller deal today and I thought he clearly on television again on Sunday on Sunday was remarkably effective. I think he serves on the intelligence committee, he's a smart guy. I think he'll probably do a do a very good job as director of national intelligence.</p><p>Dan Coats has a long career of serving the country and the congress, the first in the House, then the senate, then as ambassador to berlin and then finally back in the senate and then the last couple years. But I think if the President believes that Ratcliffe is going to be dramatically different from Dan Coats, he's in for a surprise.</p><p>The director of national intelligence has to report to the congress as well as the President and their number one job, frankly, is to tell the truth, not to prop up policy. Sometimes presidents -- every president sooner or later gets unhappy if the intelligence doesn't fit what their bias was and I think that Dan Coats said what he thought was true. I have a hunch that John Ratcliffe is going to follow exactly the same process.</p><p>PAYNE: Want to talk about the Democrats divided, House Nancy Pelosi downplaying tensions with freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This following their meaning last week.</p><p>Pelosi tweeted afterward today Congresswoman -- tweeted afterwards. \"Today Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and I sat down to discuss working together to meet the needs of our districts and our country, fairness in our economy, diversity in our country. President Trumping just tweeting on the squad moments just a moment ago.</p><p>And if the Democrats are going to defend the radical left squad and King Elijah Baltimore failure, it will be a long road to 2020.</p><p>The good news for the Dems is that they have the fake news media in their pockets. Your thoughts?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, I thought it was wonderful that Speaker Pelosi met with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and that AOC and she are together. And I think everything we can do to get every Democrat to be with AOC is to the advantage of the Republicans.</p><p>You have a very radical group. Their views are way to the left of the American people. If the election next year is a choice of which direction we should go in, and the Democrats are represented as they were at the first set of debates -- remember, every single candidate raised their hand and said they were for giving tax paid free healthcare to illegal immigrants. That's a position that I think you have five or six positions like that, they could be in for a catastrophe, both in the Congress and the presidency.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes we'll see.

Turning to the Mueller probe, report, on Sunday morning futures Maria Bartiromo spoke with House intel committee ranking member Devin Nunes about former special Robert Mueller's testimony.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction from the Mueller testimony.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (D-CA): Well, first of all it's clear that Mueller didn't write the report. And so wrote the report. We think there were five or six lawyers and who wrote the report? We think there were five or six lawyers involved. We're trying to get to the bottom of that.</p><p>I would say, you know, one of the main take-aways is that we still don't have any Russians, right? We don't know who the Russians were that supposedly colluded with the Trump campaign? Why? Because they were none.</p><p>And that's what we said two and a half years ago. There is evidence that the Democrats colluded with the Russians. We tried to get to the bottom of that. But clearly, Mueller and his team of lawyers and 40 investigators and $40 million didn't bother to look for those Russians. They were only looking for the Russians that were mysterious because they don't exist and they never found them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: Joining me now, former Whitewater Independent, former federal prosecutor. Thompson and Knight partner, Robert Ray.</p><p>Robert -- we had Newt Gingrich on earlier and he says his conclusion from all of this that it proves there was a massive cover up of sorts. And a deliberate effort by officials in the Obama administration to sway the election. What did you get from this testimony?</p><p>ROBERT RAY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:: He may be right. But that's what we have an investigation to determine. That's why the inspector general's report when we eventually see it I think now, I'm being told sometime in September. It's been promised for some time and apparently there was more investigation to do as a result of the fact that other people became available to be interviewed. And then of course, also the attorney general has commissions now two U.S. attorneys, separately to look into -- I think what we all sort of now understand to be the let's figure out what happened as a result of how this investigation came into being.</p><p>And so we're going to learn in the fall, we're going to start I think to hear some more and the narrative will shift I think away from impeachment to the-called investigation of the investigators.</p><p>PAYNE: Everyone was shocked by something -- during the hearing. I just was not what was advertised. And a lot of people came away from that with different --</p><p>RAY: I hope they weren't too shocked. Because you know, I think you know, Bob Mueller did exactly what he said he was going to do. The Department of Justice was clear that they were going to make sure that he did what he said he was going to do. Which was track the report and don't stray outside of that report.</p><p>PAYNE: But if someone came in there where the report was like a maybe he oversaw it but he didn't seem to have as much knowledge about the report as one would have assumed.</p><p>RAY: It's a big investigation. I don't think it's surprising, since I've written final reports, that I wasn't responsible for writing every single word that was in a collection of five final reports that were sent ultimately to the court and then on to be -- and release to the public and the American people.</p><p>But it is also true that I read everything and stood behind every single word on that report. I did write some of it. Not all of it.</p><p>The only criticism I ever had of Bob Mueller was the fact essentially just one sentence. I don't think he should have gotten into this whole question about whether what the investigation represented.</p><p>It was either an exoneration or not an exoneration. That's not what prosecutors do. And that's out of 448 pages, again, on the assumption as he said and testified that the words were very carefully chosen.</p><p>In my own view that was a poor exercise of judgment. That sentence should not have been there.</p><p>CORKE: I'm really fascinated by that. Because I think everybody watched this whole thing, or not everybody watched the whole thing but all everybody took away from it was one sentence and that exoneration sentence, that statement that he made is what the Democrats are now hanging everything on.</p><p>They're saying, look, he just gave room for the fact that there was criminal behavior and then when he gets out of office we can go after him.</p><p>HOUGH: I agree with you. I don't think that one sentence is a bomb shell. I don't think it's appropriately in the report. If that's what you're hanging your hat on in order to justify prolonging the agony, and this sort of notion about well, we're not really conducting an impeachment proceeding but we have to say that we're at least having an inquiry to look to see whether we're going to have an impeachment proceeding so that we can get an additional --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>HOUGH: -- particularly on McGahn and all the rest of that.</p><p>PAYNE: -- particularly Ratcliffe hit him hard on that whole thing in the first place.</p><p>But I do want to shift a little bit because Maria also sat down with former Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos. He told her that he plans to head back to Greece to retrieve a !10,000 old payment that he said was used to entrap him by the FBI and the CIA.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You were given money in Israel, $10,000 in cash. You don't keep the money. You send it and you give it to your lawyers. And then you get on a flight to go home to go back to Dulles wherever you were going to Dulles.</p><p>When you land, there are FBI agents arresting you, asking you, do you have any money.</p><p>GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, FORMER TRUMP AIDE: Basically, that's exactly what happened. And what I think this whole setup was all about was trying to frame a FARA violation against me that I was under some sort of illicit surveillance, for actually I think years.</p><p>Of course, this $10,000 which I believe was a setup by the FBI, likely, or even the special counsel's office, it was designed to make it look like I was actually some sort of foreign agent which I never had been and I never will be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: Robert, your thoughts?</p><p>RAY: He has commented publicly in another -- on another occasion about I think the words were ridiculous prosecutorial overreach. And he may well have a substantial claim in that regard in my view, once we find out and get to the bottom of all this.</p><p>I will say for people who don't do this every day, you would be surprised what you see in the name of criminal investigations and the sorts of things that go on.</p><p>As the supreme court also once said, prosecutors are around to strike hard blows but not foul ones. And I think here what I think he is providing a window on is that there may well have been foul blows here, which is not acceptable.</p><p>PAYNE: Robert Ray -- thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>RAY: Thanks, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Coming up, U.S.-China trade talks are in focus, talks ready to resume.

Just how much -- ahead on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>PAYNE: Welcome back. I'm Charles Payne in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, July 29th. Your top stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Trade is in focus, face to face trade talks between the United States and China resuming tomorrow in Shanghai.

They were initially mixed but as you can see, all three major European indices higher.</p><p>However in Asia overnight, the markets were down there in South Korea especially hit hard by tech and auto.

China responding to the turmoil this morning.</p><p>Hi, Siri, who's listening to me? The shocking findings from a new report, straight ahead.</p><p>Plus, supporting older kids, the number of millennials getting money from their parents every month is higher than you think. Those details are straight ahead.</p><p>And our top story this half hour, U.S.-China trade negotiations for the two countries set to meet face-to-face in Shanghai tomorrow, looking to make a deal. President Trump downplaying chances of an agreement saying on Friday, maybe they will, maybe they won't.</p><p>Joining me now, Milken Institute Asia Fellow, Curtis Chin. Curtis, it's kind of ref -- it's kind of actually good, I think at least from Wall Street's perspective, that expectations have been ratcheted down. But what can come out of these meetings, out of this next meeting?</p><p>CURTIS CHIN, ASIA FELLOW, MILKEN INSTITUTE: You know, really, both sides I think understandably and appropriately are really downplaying expectations. You know, long-standing issues between the United States and China, forced technology transfers, mistreatment of U.S. companies, these issues cannot be resolved overnight. And I think the markets, you know, just are pleased right now that talks are resuming at this high level.</p><p>So, you know, Secretary Mnuchin, Lighthizer in Shanghai, as you noted, these next two days, that in itself is an important step forward. But clearly, don't expect any big breakthroughs this week out of Shanghai.</p><p>HOUGH: Hi, Kurt, it's Jack Hough from Barrons. It's getting to the point where we can start to envision election sees and approaching the election coming and not having a deal in place, yet the market doesn't seem to mind. Is that because you think that average Americans kind of get it with the -- with the trade deal and China and would rather have, you know, let's say a good deal rather than any deal at this point? What do you think?</p><p>CHIN: Yes, I think that President Trump to his great credit has been very consistent. What we're seeking is fair, balanced reciprocal trade. You know, it's not going to happen overnight. But very clear, with an election year and Xi Jinping's own challenges in China and I'm calling it a perfect storm now hitting Xi Jinping from the Hong Kong protests, to pushback with regards to what they're doing to Muslims in Xinjiang, calling out what Huawei is up to. You know, all of these issues are impacting Xi Jinping and China. And to in this context, both the United States and China have domestic concerns that they also have to address in trying to move this forward.</p><p>At the end of the day, though, a deal will be to the benefit of both China and the United States and I think that's what we all need to focus on.</p><p>CARTER: So Curtis, I've heard it said that the Chinese government does not trust Donald Trump in particular and it's not likely that they're going to be making a deal because of that. Do you think it's that they don't trust Trump in particular so they don't trust our interests and then we can't make them aligned?</p><p>CHIN: You know, I can't speak to that. You know, I'm thinking about trust, I'm not so sure businesses trust what China has said through the years.</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>CHIN: You know, and this goes back to in the Unite -- I began (INAUDIBLE) since when I began under Ronald Reagan where you know, he famously said trust, but verify.</p><p>And so clearly, what we need are some incremental steps forward. But I think when we look at the United States, you know, it has also has to get its act in order. And there's some things that Washington can do today.</p><p>I mean, one specific thing that I'm hearing more about -- I'm in Washington right now, is really the need to reauthorize an institution called the U.S. Export-Import Bank. And we really need to create that balanced playing field and if China is aggressively promoting its exporters, we the United States need to do something very similar.</p><p>We need to move this forward because in my heart, you know, I was at Commerce, I was at Treasury, in my heart I know that American businesses on a very balanced playing field will succeed.</p><p>PAYNE: You know --</p><p>CHIN: Right now I'm with the Milken Institute out of Singapore and what I'm hearing in South East Asia, and Asia is like, keep fighting Donald Trump. Because the concerns that the United States has about China's behavior are shared by Asian companies and countries throughout the region.</p><p>PAYNE: What -- OK, so we all have expectations a little bit, we want something, right, as they move the ball forward? I mean, should we anticipate a large order for soybeans? Should we expect something? Because it feels like really going into this meeting, Curtis, that President Trump has extended more olive branches if you will than the -- than the Chinese counterparts.</p><p>CHIN: Well, clearly we may well get large purchases of soybeans. I saw that some Chinese companies were already seeking exemptions from their own Chinese system about what they could actually sell right now to the United States. The Chinese government has said it's up to the businesses themselves.</p><p>But my fear is that we be, you know, looking back at what's happened in the past. My fear is that the U.S. Government might say that's enough, because clearly that is enough. That is not enough, you know, to paraphrase Margaret Thatcher from way back when. This is not a time for the United States to go wobbly in its negotiations in this case with China. The United States really in some ways I think is at an advantage here because of its strong economy. I mean, it's about --</p><p>PAYNE: And it's more to your point, this morning Hong Kong -- I mean, China rather, had even more weak economic data. By the way, Lighthizer isn't going to go wobbly. But right now on the -- on the screen we're showing the audience, Curtis, a Hong Kong protests. Police and demonstrators back on the streets this weekend, confrontations heating up on back to back days. You know, you mentioned this before. It really feels like the people in Hong Kong are rising up but here in America we're not quite sure what they're trying to achieve, since ultimately China will be in charge of Hong Kong as well.</p><p>CHIN: You know, I'm with you there. I mean, I think all Americans are for anyone really fighting for democracy, fighting for really a life that they can decide, you know, what they want to do.</p><p>Clearly I'm about to get on a plane to Hong Kong. You know, clearly this last eight weeks of protests have brought to the world what's happening there, which is unfortunately I feel more fast move towards this Hong Kong being absorbed by China.</p><p>You know, right now it lives under what's called a one country, two systems way of life. But increasingly there's an encroachment on that Hong Kong way of life.</p><p>You know, these protests began when the Hong Kong government sought to introduce an extradition law that would allow Hong Kong people to be -- all people really in Hong Kong to be extradited to China. And I think the world knows what rule of law of China looks like today, versus in a democracy of Canada and the United States.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>CHIN: And so, people are really fighting for their way of life. And when you look at those really striking visuals, tear gas, rubber bullets, you'll see of course people from all walks of life but you'll see a lot of young people. And one could really have tremendous empathy, tremendous sympathy for the Hong Kong young people fighting for, you know, their way of life.</p><p>I think we need to stand with the people of Hong Kong. Clearly, like Secretary Pompeo who is really soon also leaving for Asia, we want a peaceful resolution for this but clearly I think we -- most people here would identify with the Hong Kong protester.</p><p>PAYNE: There's no doubt that when they arranged those initially agreement upon, many people thought maybe Hong Kong would ultimately influence China but the hard line is there pushing back.</p><p>Curtis Chin, thank you very much, always appreciate it.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump versus big tech, more on the possible investigation into Google over China and Apple's request for tariff exemptions.</p><p>Plus, millennials and money, new data showing they really rely on mom and dad consistently to pay the bills.</p><p>PAYNE: Nearly half of millennials getting money from their parents and we're talking every month. Susan Li has the details.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Here we go.</p><p>PAYNE: Susan.</p><p>LI: So, millennials, what, we're snowflakey, we don't -- over lazy, we don't have ambition apparently. But, you know, it looks like the survey says for Money Under 30 says that over 46 percent of millennials still get help from their parents each and every month. In fact, parents are the first place that they turn to, 48 percent first look to their parents when they're short on cash. 13-1/2 get a bank loan. 4.9 percent go to their friends and 3.7 percent go to their grandparents. And it's not a lot of money that they need help on.</p><p>I mean, if you take a look at the bills that they ask their parents for help on, the number one thing is cell phone. Their mobile phone bills. 17.6 percent. Groceries come up next, close to 10 percent, rent, which I found surprising because I thought that would be on the top of the list since they cost so much money to live in these big cities. Rent was only third at 6.5 percent. Insurance and then gas round it all out.</p><p>So it's not a lot of money that they ask for but when they do ask for money on a monthly basis it's just for the things that they need to pay to I guess subsist each and every month, right?</p><p>But let's think about it. Being a millennial now is different from 30 years ago. I know people always want to make that comparison. Because when you're saddled with $1.5 trillion in student debt which by the way has gone up from $600 billion 10 years ago and those that owe $100,000 quadrupled in just in the past year alone, it's a different time. And rich are going up faster than wages are. So yes, they do need a little bit of help every month.</p><p>PAYNE: Susan, I'm breaking out the world's smallest violin right now.</p><p>LI: Oh, would you stop?</p><p>CARTER: I'm just curios though, I mean --</p><p>PAYNE: I'm going to play this Stratovarius that the micro (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>LI: wait, do you help out your kids?</p><p>PAYNE: Hell yes.</p><p>LI: Each and every month if they ask for help and say daddy.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, my son is in college but he lives in Notting Hill. He went to a college (INAUDIBLE) in Miami.</p><p>LI: Oh, so cheap rent.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, I mean, he's living a pretty good life. But I help everyone in my family out but, you know, they should have had Coachella on that list. They should have some (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>And by the way, why does a struggling person need gas money?</p><p>LI: Well, I think it's just easy.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Why isn't Uber on that list?</p><p>LI: What? Uber?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: You know, because that seems to be the most ubiquitous thing that shows up my credit card bills that I pay on behalf of my kids.</p><p>LI: On behalf of your kids? Well, I think (INAUDIBLE) City is --</p><p>PAYNE: I'm glad you said that. My son had a $4,000 Uber bill in high school and I only found out when someone I got a tipped -- I got a tip.</p><p>LI: $5,000 Uber bill? Where did he go?</p><p>PAYNE: No, over 4,000 during high school. I never knew that he would use and someone tipped me off, my stepson tipped me off. And he said listen, I looked through the -- it added up to $4,000.</p><p>LI: That's a lot.</p><p>CARTER: Wow.</p><p>PAYNE: That is a lot.</p><p>LI: And how did you react to that?</p><p>PAYNE: I don't know.</p><p>LI: You said, OK, well, if you need it --</p><p>PAYNE: If it was 30 years ago, it would have been different.</p><p>LI: What about the parents that enable their kids? You don't you think that the parent want to take car and say OK, well, you need some money for your mobile phone bill, sure, honey.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, we do.</p><p>CARTER: Well, is it that they're giving them money for them a little mobile phone or they just keep them on a family plan?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I think they're on the plan -- I think they're on the plan forever, for life.</p><p>LI: That millennials except parents' help forever?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: On the phone.</p><p>LI: On the phone.</p><p>CARTER: Family plan.</p><p>LI: Wait a second --</p><p>PAYNE: Great news for Apple, paid. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CARTER: You're right.</p><p>PAYNE: Susan, thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>Coming up, folks, big tech in focus. The Trump administration puts the scope on Google for its ties to China and Apple over a tariff exemption. So we're going to discuss that. Stay with us.</p><p>PAYNE: Welcome back. If you own an iPhone, it might be time to stop relying on Siri and turn the listening assistant off. Siri can be activated by something as simple as the sound of a zipper, that's what report say, leaving any conversation open to surveillance and user data like location and content.</p><p>Joining me now Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou Basenese and Lifewire.com editor-in-chief Lance Ulanoff.</p><p>Lance, let me start with you. I mean, we keep hearing these horror stories about all of these devices in our world. Is there any -- do we have to learn to live with this?</p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, LIFEWIRE.COM: Well, we should learn -- you know, how they actually work. So they are always listening for what's called the watch word, they're listening for the word Siri, they're listening for Alexa, or they're listening for OK Google. And so, that means they're actually listening all the time. They have to listen for that word, otherwise they don't work.</p><p>Everything after that word is considered a command, send it up to Cloud, try and figure it out, send it back. If it's nonsense, because it heard something that it thought was the watch word and wasn't the watch word.</p><p>PAYNE: But this means they're vetting all words though even if it's not activated, they're taking everything we say, they're vetting it and sending it somewhere --</p><p>ULANOFF: First of all, I wouldn't use the word they because it's not -- it's not people. It's the program literally that is trying to match up what you said with what a command that it understands, so it can do something, it's parsing it, just trying to figure it out.</p><p>No, there's nobody sitting there like trying to figure that out. That said, Amazon, Apple, all of them will take samples of anonymous data and samples of audio to try and improve the listening and text to speech or words to speech understanding technology to improve it overtime. If they don't do that, Siri won't understand you as well, you know, in the future, you know, later on, it won't improve.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But we've all had the experience when we talk about it on the show of having a conversation about a specific product and then having it show up in Google search.</p><p>CARTER: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Having it show up in your Amazon, you know, what to buy, when you didn't Google that product.</p><p>ULANOFF: I'm going to -- I will tell you the same thing I've told many, many people. It's not -- your phones aren't listening to when you think they're not. It is -- there are so many different ways that can triangulate what you're thinking about, even through relationships you have.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>ULANOFF: Yes, we are a web of connections on social media and through search and through all kinds of data. So that's how it happens. It's not that they're listening.</p><p>CARTER: OK.</p><p>ULANOFF: And by the way, Apple has no interest in hearing what you're doing in your private time.</p><p>PAYNE: Let's bring in Lou -- let's bring in Lou because we do have another guest.</p><p>LOU BASENESE, RESEARCH FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH: I'm not buying it. Look, I'm not buying that, Lance. I think -- I think you make perfectly valid points. But there's a lot of accidents happening on purpose here. We are giving them unfettered access to our data. And look, they can't resist the temptation.</p><p>Data is a drug to big tech. It allows Google and Facebook to serve you better ads. To think that they're not going to use this data that it's just going into the Cloud and being crunched by algorithms and not being put into their business I think is just a little bit naive. We are giving them that permission in today's day and age. I'm not saying that big tech is all bad for doing it. But we can't be naive to think that it's not happening.</p><p>ULANOFF: Well, I actually -- I know that all of these companies are using the data. That's what they do. That's how they sell -- and that's how they sell ads. Although, Apple doesn't -- Apple doesn't sell ads so they don't -- they don't have to do that. And also, nobody forced us to buy these devices and use them.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, let me ask you guys about President Trump, because on Friday he suggested the administration will investigate Google for its alleged work with China and the national security threat there that it could -- that it poses for our country. Some say his statements contradict Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who said Google had alter -- alleviated concerns of its work in China and said it was minimal. So where are we on this, Jack?</p><p>HOUGH: I tell you, every one of these big tech companies -- first of all, every one of them has problems with regulators. Every one of them has some reason to be despised by some part of the public right now. They also lead the American stock market. So when I see, you know, the White House saying look at how great our stock market is doing here in the U.S. but also we need to crack down on these big tech companies, we push that too far, it's going to turn our stock performance around.</p><p>What's really surprising to me here is the Microsoft. Suddenly it's the biggest company in the U.S. again. It's the only one I hear left out of this conversation.</p><p>CARTER: Right?</p><p>HOUGH: But when did Microsoft become the good guys? I mean, they are.</p><p>ULANOFF: They don't have the same technology. I mean, they don't -- who do uses Cortana really. So they're not doing the things whether collecting data, they're not selling ads in general.</p><p>PAYNE: And also, let's face it, we have the co-founder of Facebook saying that they're bad actors. It's not just the governments, right? There's governments around the world, even these big tech names seem to be -- and maybe Lou, it's a marketing ploy. Maybe they're pushing for more regulations to become a (INAUDIBLE) in the hands of their strength and makes competition harder.</p><p>But still, this seems to be a general acknowledgement Lou, that something is wrong, that something needs to be fixed or adjusted.</p><p>BASENESE: Look, big tech has gotten too big? Does that mean we break them up? I think that's an idiotic plan. Because how do you break up a social network and keep it from reforming itself? I just don't think that's possible. I mean, how do you break up Amazon which is underpinned by its Cloud computing in every business segment.</p><p>But look, they've -- they're actions have warned to this intervention from Facebook just laundry list of privacy violations to Google choosing to work on -- you know, historically it's been rumored they're working on a censored version in China, the search engine. You know, they're inviting the scrutiny and it's no surprise that we're seeing these --</p><p>PAYNE: And it doesn't help that they, you know, sort of kicked our Department of Defense to the curb over, you know -- you know --</p><p>BASENESE: Right.</p><p>PAYNE: And then --</p><p>ULANOFF: (INAUDIBLE) working on Dragonfly. They now -- they stopped that as of this year. So now that they're pulled out --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOUGH: But they did work with them before?</p><p>BASENESE: So that's my point, is they were working with the Chinese government so they invited (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>PAYNE: Lou, Lance, thank you both very much.</p><p>I want to get to the Trump tweet now. President Trump just tweeting on the E.U. and China. The E.U. and China will further lower interest rates and put money into their systems, making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product. In the meantime, and with very low inflation, our Fed does nothing and probably will do very little by comparison. Too bad.</p><p>Mitch, what do you make of it?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I think that there's -- and Jack made this point earlier, there's all of this negative yielding debt around the world. There's slowing economies around the world. And we'd like to say, we're an island but we're not -- our economies are coupled with the rest of the world. So central bankers have to most likely behave similarly if they want to stimulate global growth.</p><p>HOUGH: Did someone help the President Trump with that tweet because he's got it --</p><p>PAYNE: He's good.</p><p>PAYNE: He got it exactly right -- exactly right. Yes, we have to respond to the strong dollar because of all these negative issue --</p><p>PAYNE: But he's also suggesting 25 basis points is not going to be enough.</p><p>HOUGH: Well, it maybe won't be enough. But let me tell you, you need to leave some dry powder. This is an aging expansion.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>HOUGH: Eventually we'll get a recession. You don't want to sitting at zero when the next recession hits.</p><p>PAYNE: William suggested though that (INAUDIBLE) that forget about the rates, they'll have these unconventional tools.</p><p>In the meantime, still ahead, Medicare for All, Senator Kamala Harris releases her healthcare plan just ahead of the second Democratic debate.

A  stunning and extraordinary step.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  But the word is they are  firing the head of NBC. What a great thing to do. How smart.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KURTZ:  But is that crossing the line for the president of the United  States. Trump's twitter attacks come as CNN continues to stand by a  disputed story saying Michael Cohen is accusing the president of lying even  though one of its anonymous sources, Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, has outed  himself and says the allegation that's all been the Trump Tower meeting is  false.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) </p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This is just such a  mistake by CNN. I really can't understand it. Everybody has retracted their  story except CNN. </p><p>GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS COMMENTATOR:  I like the guys involved in CNN. I  think they've made a mistake. They are reluctant to withdraw it because  there is an animosity towards this president that is unprecedented. I think  it's clouding their judgment. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>KURTZ:  Lanny Davis who admits he made a mistake in dealing with the press  will be here in a \"Media Buzz\" exclusive. A week of glowing media tributes  to John McCain becomes a vehicle for taking shots at President Trump. Why  was a farewell to this war here transformed into a Trump story?</p><p>Pope Francis tells reporters he won't comment on an extraordinary  accusation that he helped cover-up a massive sexual abuse scandal in the  Catholic Church. This after a right-leaning Catholic news outlet ran a  letter from the archbishop demanding that the pontiff resign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tonight, there is rare silence from Pope Francis  making a point not to weigh in after explosive allegations were leveled  against him by a former top Vatican official who claims he told the pope  about abuse allegations against an American cardinal years ago and the pope  did did nothing. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  Are the media being skeptical of the archbishop's letter and  portraying this largely as a political attack from the pope's critics? </p><p>Plus, the president says Google is biased against him, against Republicans,  against conservatives. Is that true? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media  Buzz.\" </p><p>Whether you agree or disagree with the President Trump calling for the  firing of CNN president Jeff Zucker and NBC News chairman Andy Lack, it is  big news, but not on those networks, nothing on CNN. And the only MSNBC  comment we could find was on \"Morning Joe.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST:  Not only is he attacking NBC's chairman Andy  Lack, our boss, with stupid rumors, but also he's going after the truth. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  Despite mounting criticism, CNN continues to largely ignore the  controversy especially on the air is standing by this story. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Sources with knowledge tell myself and  Karl that Michael Cohen claims that then candidate Donald Trump knew in  advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  The president tweeted that CNN's hatred and extreme bias toward him  has clouded its thinking, and then addressed CNN's new parent company.  \"Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job, his ratings suck, and AT&amp;T should  fire him to save credibility.\"</p><p>One of the CNN reporters on the story is Jim Sciutto, a political appointee  in the Obama administration. The other, is Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame  who has called Trump an authoritarian. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  This is the greatest journalistic  challenge of the modern era, to report on a malignant presidency.</p><p>What we are watching in the Trump presidency is worse than Watergate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  After the president criticized Bernstein, CNN hit back, \"Make no  mistake, Mr. President, CNN does not lie. We report the news. And we report  when people in power tell lies. CNN stands by our reporting and our  reporters.\"</p><p>Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at  \"The Federalist\" and a Fox News contributor, Susan Ferrechio, chief  congressional correspondent for \"The Washington Examiner,\" and Philippe  Reines, former State Department official under Hillary Clinton. </p><p>Mollie, I say Donald Trump has every right to hit back at what he sees as  unfair media coverage including, perhaps especially this flawed CNN story,  but is the president of the United States go too far in calling for two  executives at private companies to be fired because he doesn't like the  media coverage by those companies?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, and I'm not sure if he's  calling for their firing simply because of that. He's pointing out the  series of failures that both of those media outlets have had. It's not just  about calling for firing. It's also the language he used in that tweet,  which as a mother and is someone -- is something I don't like to see some  of the language that's being used. </p><p>There are all sorts of lines being crossed. There really are problems.  Obviously, CNN is having a rough go of things right now, but also with  regard to Andy Lack, you know, he is someone who's been rumored to be  central to so many of the problems they are facing there, allegations --</p><p>KURTZ:  Those were rumors so. </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  Yes, well. But I mean, it's an interesting story but I don't  think it's appropriate for the president to be weighing in just -- it  diminishes him. </p><p>KURTZ:  Susan Ferechgio, Jeff Zucker who obviously is recuperating from  heart surgery has said in the past because these attacks have gone on for a  long time, that Donald Trump is trying to delegitimize journalism. What do  you make of the tone when CNN hit back at the president's tweets?</p><p>SUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:   I  think that the president is trying to delegitimize journalism because  journalists have tried to delegitimize the president in unprecedented way.  I don't think there is any way to question that at this point -- the  attacks, the number of attacks, the types of attacks by the media.</p><p>The way a lot of them had to be retracted, corrected. A lot of them have  not been corrected. They see him as I think as Carl Bernstein said, on the  leniency and so that's the way they treat him as a president. So I think  all's fair here for both sides. Whatever CNN says, whatever the president  says, it has devolved to a boxing match at this point and now the gloves  are off, and that has happened. </p><p>KURTZ:  And when I said on the air this week (inaudible) if President  Obama, who took lots of shots at Fox News, had said hey, Fox News, you  ought to get rid of Roger Ailes because I think the coverage is so unfair,  what would have been the reaction on the right? </p><p>PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON ADVISER:  Well look, the  relationship between the White House media and the media (inaudible) with  any president is going to be tense and adversarial. </p><p>KURTZ:  Sure.</p><p>REINES:  I saw Alan Dershowitz the other night say that that's a problem.  It's supposed to be adversarial to an extent and that's not to be bitter  and hateful, but if you look at what's going on with Jeff Zucker and Andy  Lack, there's a problem in the sense that he -- the president is constantly  trying to muddy the waters for both of those -- is due with Andy Lack.</p><p>Mollie is right. Andy Lack might have separate problems or rumored  problems, but he's going after Andy Lack because now it's fitting his  narrative of the Lester Holt interview was wrong. </p><p>KURTZ:  I'm going to comeback to that.</p><p>REINES:  On Jeff Zucker, I mean, the problem of calling Jeff Zucker's  firing is actually a subset of a problem of him trying to scuttle or insert  himself into the AT&amp;TTime Warner merger. This is something he's been  doing. Frankly, Donald Trump should send Jeff Zucker flowers for everything  he has done for him for the last 15 years. </p><p>KURTZ:  Let me turn to Carl Bernstein because he's one of the two main  reporters on this disputed CNN story, and the president really went after  him personal terms. If we could put up on the screen -- he called Bernstein  sloppy, a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool,  making up story after story, is being laughed at all over the country.</p><p>Carl Bernstein defended himself in his own tweet, \"I have spent my life as  a journalist bringing the truth to light, through administrations of both  parties. No taunt will diminish my commitment to that mission.\" Mollie,  what do you make of that?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  Well, there is this fantasy that is spewed by people on the  left, either in the media or not, but the media hold Democratic  administrations accountable. The problem is that many Americans were awake  for the previous eight years and they saw how the media treated the Obama  administration. Only rarely adversarial despite many opportunities.</p><p>And in fact, the need to hold that administration accountable. So Carl  Bernstein is also saying this. That he has an image of himself but I'm not  sure is matched by reality. CNN has major credibility problems with that  story. They have had a source who had admitted he was one of their sources.  They claimed he wasn't a source. They put that in the original thing that  said he declined to comment. </p><p>KURTZ:  And we'll talk to Lanny Davis in a few minutes. Go ahead.</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  And they have not done anything near what they need to to deal  with the problems with that story. And now they are trying to strongly  suggest that their other story is Michael Cohen himself, which is also kind  of inappropriate to reveal sources if you're sort of playing both sides of  the game. And they need to restore credibility. They have a pattern of  false stories on the Trump administration and this is just the latest one. </p><p>KURTZ:  Some of which had to be corrected. Does CNN have some  responsibility to be more front than having -- putting out a one-sentence  statement essentially this is to standby our story, to address problems  with this Trump Tower story after Lanny Davis, a pal of your friend Hillary  Clinton, denied it -- and to report on the president's attacks on the  network. I mean, its news, may be uncomfortable, but it's news that the  president was using that rhetoric. </p><p>REINES:  Well look, every media outlet whether it's CNN or Fox, has a  responsibility to first call balls and strikes when covering what they  think is the news. Obviously, I disagree with Mollie's describing how the  Obama White House -- Susan's description, but CNN said they made a mistake.  The source made a mistake. You don't see that often and I'm sure CNN's  frustration right now is saying, we're getting killed for admitting a  mistake.</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  CNN is standing by its story. </p><p>REINES:  I know, but --</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  They are saying that despite what everybody knows about that  one of their sources --</p><p>REINES:  They are saying they have another source. I don't know better. I  don't know any different that when you report something, but they made a  mistake. I mean, the most parallel thing to me is when Fox was reporting on  Seth Rich and it took months and months and months before anyone  acknowledged that there was a mistaken in -- </p><p>KURTZ:  The online story about Seth Rich, which was the young DNC staff who  was killed, was retracted, not months later. It was retracted and  apologized for. I want to move on to NBC. I'm not sorry that you brought  that up. So, Trump says the good news about Andy Lack -- he puts a Y, Andy  Lacky -- is about to be fired -- question mark -- for incompetence.</p><p>And what's worse, that is purely a rumor, I just want to clarify that. And  then he went on to the Lester Holt interview. This was last year, two days  after the president fired Jim Comey of the FBI. Let's take a brief look at  that interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Regardless of the recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing  there was no good time to do it. I said, you know, this Russia thing with  Trump and Russia is a made up story. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  The president treats, \"When Lester Holt got caught fudging my tape  on (inaudible) were heard badly. There is no credible allegation that NBC  did anything in terms of misleading editing. And in fact, the whole  interview was posted online. </p><p>FERRECHIO:  And the transcript, it's all there. If you do read the  transcript jut see at some point he said he didn't care about the  investigation. He says things that kind of undercut that statement we just  watched. But right, he's trying to make it look like they fudged a story  but they really didn't. </p><p>But at this point, you know, each side is accusing the other of fake news  and lying all the time that he probably can convince some of his base or  people who follow him on twitter that there is some truth on that even  though it's really completely false. </p><p>KURTZ:  Let me turn to some other news this week. So, we have Don McGahn,  White House counsel leaving. Trump announcing it by tweet without telling  him in advance. This is 11 days after a \"New York Times\" story saying that  McGahn spent 30 hours talking about Mueller's prosecutors and kind of  suggest that he was cooperating. </p><p>The media also seemed quite sympathetic, Mollie, at Jeff Sessions after new  taunts from the president. The implication that he is lashing out to his  own attorney general. Interesting that the media are taking Sessions' side. </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  Right. It is very good to cover the fact that Donald Trump is  dissatisfied at his attorney general. The problem with the media coverage  is that they go beyond that into actually deciding that it is somehow  inappropriate for the president to make decisions about who his attorney  general is or is not. </p><p>They should just cover the story and they should make sure they explain why  people are upset with Attorney-General Sessions. He recused himself from  most of the problems that are going on with the FBI and the Department of  Justice and it is causing some major problems for people who want to see  rule of law equally applied, and that's an important story too. </p><p>KURTZ:  Philippe, \"Washington Post\" reports that the president was again  pushing to fire Jeff Sessions which he has every right to do obviously.  Lawyers were said to have talked him out of it until the Mueller  investigation ended. Then he told Bloomberg that Sessions is safe until  after the midterms whatever that means. Everything leaks in this White  House. I mean, all these backstage struggles just sort of play out on  twitter and on the tube. </p><p>REINES:  If he wants to fire him, fire him. I mean, we don't have to read  about this everyday for six months. The president has not fired anyone  since Jim Comey on this matter because he knows how horribly that went for  him. He could fire Jeff Sessions right now, but it will not go well for him  tomorrow. </p><p>And it's not the media that is pressing him on that. It's Republicans in  Congress who are saying this is not a good idea. The fact that now Lindsey  Graham and Charles Grassley have changed their tune shows you how long it  has bent Republican Congress has been saying to him, sir, don't do this.  It's not going to go well.</p><p>KURTZ:  Just a brief comment.</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  In fact, media coverage is such a big part of the story. I  agree with what was said about fudging the Lester Holt interview, but the  way that that was portrayed as obstruction of the Russia investigation  instead of frustration with (inaudible) Russia investigation is a perfect  example of how the media control the conversation in a way that is not  helpful. </p><p>REINES:  But Mollie, it's a straight out lie to say that that tape is not  real. And now 35 percent of America believes it.</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  You can also have media coverage that is inaccurate and very  wrongly inaccurate. </p><p>REINES:  But that's not an example. </p><p>KURTZ:  We have to (inaudible) have you guys. Thank you south side (ph).  Ahead, as I mentioned, exclusive interview with Lanny Davis about his role  in the CNN story on the Trump Tower meeting that has drawn such harsh  criticism for the president.</p><p>But when we come back, a week of media praise after John McCain's passing.  But why did many pundits turn that into an attack on Donald Trump. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KURTZ:  The speakers at John McCain's funeral yesterday at the National  Cathedral, George w. Bush, Barack Obama, his daughter Megyn not only  praised the man but implicitly seemed to rebuke the man who wasn't there.  All week long, an emotional hero sendoff from most of the media kept  straining it's a criticism of Donald Trump especially when the president  initially refused to praise his bitter rival.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  To watch the president with President Kenyatta of  Kenya twice, you know, not saying anything about this hero, this lion of a  man -- it's despicable. It's despicable. </p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  McCain despised Trump. Trump for his part  despised McCain right back, and to their credit, neither man ever pretended  otherwise. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  Susan, we talked the show last week to spend an hour on the life  and legacy of John McCain. Political lead story this morning, Washington  mourns John McCain and its own demise under Trump. Has there been too much  focus on President Trump initially being holding back on anything positive  and the whole business about the flag, I mean, at half staff and coming  back up and then coming back down? </p><p>FERRECHIO:  Ridiculous and I think the Tucker quote was perfect. They did  hate each other. McCain not only hated Trump, he really doesn't like the  people who follow Trump, the tea partyers, that's why the reason -- that's  why Sara Palin was shut out of the whole funeral and all that stuff. </p><p>It really was, you know, the two of them were enemies basically. So to  expect the president to go on and on about what a hero McCain is, remember,  McCain also went to get the dossier and bring it back and give it to the  FBI --</p><p>(CROSTALK)</p><p>FERRECHIO:  -- creating a huge investigation (inaudible) his presidency.  That's never factored in here. It's just ridiculous. </p><p>KURTZ:  Mollie, I saw a lot of pundits say John McCain was a man of great  character and principle and obviously he was a war hero. So, of course, he  was totally opposed to Trump. I mean, this is how they worked it in. They  would sort of pivot and almost as if you couldn't praise the senator and  his life as a warrior and a lawmaker without bashing the president. </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  It was just a shame because this man who is a legitimate  American hero and who people regardless of their political views can  respect and appreciate. It was a little difficult to see some of the  coverage this week because I think people going to remember what happened  when he ran for president, when he was not treated as a lion or hero by the  same media who now say he was a lion and a hero. They remember -- </p><p>KURTZ:  It was in 2000 when he running against George W. Bush. He got  extraordinarily good coverage. I was there. In 2008, no so much as you  said.</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  This is hard to take it seriously that people can switch so  violently from one extreme to another.</p><p>KURTZ:  Right. So, Hillary Clinton praised McCain as did Obama, as did  Biden, as did all kinds of Democrats. Given that McCain had this  extraordinary life over many decades and Donald Trump the president or, you  know, a little more than a year and a half, were the media doing something  of a disservice by making so much of this about the contrast with President  Trump? </p><p>REINES:  I mean, I think at the end of the day only the McCain family can  really say whether this got away from them or not. </p><p>KURTZ:  You can say what you think.</p><p>REINES:  What I think is the man is dead and to start, you know, putting it  on a equivalency of what the president did last week and what John McCain  couldn't do this past week -- put the flag up. Put it down to half-mast.  This stuff is silly. And if you're going to bite your tongue, which Donald  Trump is unable to do, do it one week. Just do it one week. Just try it.</p><p>FERRECHIO:  If he has (ph) his tongue, what has he said this week that's  negative about McCain? Nothing. He actually -- I think he did the right  thing. He lowered the flag. That was the protocol. What he could have done  said don't put it back up, hold it. And then he pretty much went radio  silence on McCain despite all the attacks. </p><p>KURTZ:  Now, it is true that when you have a funeral and you have two  former presidents with the sort of an implicit rebuke of Trump's style of  politics while praising McCain, you have to report that that was part of  the story, Meghan McCain as well. But I'm talking more here about the  commentators, Mollie, who -- it almost became like the two stories were  intertwined, you know. </p><p>Washington used to be such a good bipartisan place. That was the John  McCain that we loved though he wasn't always easy to get along with as  we've said and President Trump has changed that. Is it Donald Trump single- handedly change the entire culture -- </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  Well, and that really is a legitimate viewpoint for, I think  they put it forth because it does very much represent what Washington, D.C.  thinks. The problem from a media coverage angle is that this a very complex  story and one where there are some things that people disagree with that  are happening politically in D.C. that haven't been well represented this  week. </p><p>KURTZ:  All right, Susan Ferrechio, Philippe Reines, great to see you.  Mollie, we'll see you a little later in the program. Ahead, Lanny Davis on  why he outed himself as an anonymous source in that hotly disputed CNN  story. But up next, the president says Google is rigged against him and  conservatives. We'll search for the right answer.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KURTZ:  President Trump is giving it to Google tweeting that its search  process is very dangerous and possibly illegal. \"Google search results for  Trump news shows only the viewing/reporting of fake news media. In other  words, they have it rigged, for me and others, so that almost all stories  and news is bad, Fake CNN is prominent.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat  conservatives and Republicans very unfairly. I could tell you that I have  personal experience.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  Joining us now, Shana Glenzer, technology analyst and commentator  here in Washington. So, Google may have flaws in the way it tweaks these  algorithms, but could the company be consistently rigging all searches  against Donald Trump and the Republican Party? </p><p>SHANA GLENZER, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST:  The short answer is no. There has been  time perhaps where because there are human beings behind the technology  some biases has resulted, I'm sure. But, you know, there is a set of rules  based on like 200 factors that Google considers when it is showing you the  news results. </p><p>And, you know, sure Google could prove that it's not biased by, you know,  opening the kimono (ph), showing you the algorithm. But you can even  imagine how many people would exploit that? You know, I can assure you -- </p><p>KURTZ:  Game the system. </p><p>GLENZER:  Game the system -- I can assure you it would not lead to a more  balanced list of news articles in your search. </p><p>KURTZ:  So, this 96 percent figure that the president cited in his tweet is  based on a blogger at the conservative site PJ Media who ran a test, Trump  news and found that most of the hits where from what she calls left-leaning  sites. It so happens I ran the same tests. Trump news -- Fox kept popping  up one or two out of three so I guess it depends on when you do it and how  you framed the search and all that. So is that enough to warrant this sort  of presidential blast? </p><p>GLENZER:  I understand his position here. I mean it certainly, the article  struck a chord with people who have been following recent news coverage  about bias at big tech companies and the concerns but what concerns me is  that there, you know, is that there was this woman.</p><p>That, you know, sat behind a few different computers and plugged in a few  different words into Google news and it's caused such an uproar, you know,  from complaints to, you know, from about censorship to calling for federal  investigation. I feel like it's a little mismatched to the actual study  that was performed. </p><p>KURTZ:  Right. And this call for government regulation which in my view  would be worse because who is going to test the government to somehow fair  and unbiased way to decide the perfect balance in all news searches. But it  seems to me that, you know, when CNN or \"Washington Post\" or \"New York  Times\" pops up in these ranking, I mean, doesn't Google reward the most  popular websites whether the president happens to think that those are  hostile to him or not? </p><p>GLENZER:  Yes. Yes, they do, I mean --</p><p>KURTZ:  Explain how it works.</p><p>GLENZER:  It's really hard to translate the journalistic values into like a  set of rules that they use and apply to every one, but you know, we've seen  that Google really does weigh original content, it weighs traffic to sites,  and that plays against these smaller sites with maybe a handful of  reporters putting out, you know, a few stories a day versus dozens of  stories being put out by, you know, \"Washington Post\" or other mainstream  media organizations. </p><p>KURTZ:  At which have hundreds of reporters. So you are saying Google  rewards that and it's not necessarily an ideological decision that there so  much more content and people click on it therefore Google deems it must be  relevant. </p><p>GLENZER:  I'm saying yes, there's probably truth to a little bit of the,  you know, suspicion but it's not a nefarious reason behind the bias. It is  because of the rules that they set in place.</p><p>KURTZ:  Yes. There is a reason people don't trust big tech and maybe  isolated some (inaudible) but in Google's case, I'm not sure the case has  been proved. Shana Glenzer, ghreat to see you. Thanks for stopping by this  Sunday. </p><p>Ahead on \"MediaBuzz,\" an explosive charge against Pope Francis in the  church's sexual abuse scandal. Some of the press rushing to the pontiff's  defense, but first, Lanny Davis, Michael Cohen's lawyer, sits down with me  exclusively on the lesson he says he's learned from the CNN controversy. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ, ANCHOR: Lanny Davis, the lawyer for Michael  Cohen, had been making the rounds saying that his client who now pled  guilty has more information about Donald Trump that could interest Robert  Mueller's prosecutors. His role became highly controversial after CNN went  with the story that Cohen knows the president had advance knowledge of that  Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer offering dirt on Hillary Clinton,  which Davis now flatly denies. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON SOOPER, ANDERSON COOPER 360, ANCHOR: So Michael Cohen does not  have information that President Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting  with the Russians beforehand. </p><p>LANNY DAVIS, MICHAEL COHEN'S LAWYER: No, he does not. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: And joining me now is Lanny Davis, the veteran lawyer who represents  Michael Cohen. His book, The Unmaking of a President 2016, comes out week  with a new afterword. So you had a rough week, which we'll get to in just a  second. </p><p>In the afterword of the book, you say Rudy Giuliani has openly admitted his  purpose is to appeal to the Trump base, undermine Mueller's credibility,  and get ready for an impeachment battle. He said it on his program, which  is on fighting the court of public opinion. When I was covering the Clinton  impeachment 20 years ago, that's exactly what you and your allies tried to  do to Ken Starr. </p><p>DAVIS: And it looks like we were successful in molding public opinion and  certainly in the November elections of 2000 -- of 1998. </p><p>KURTZ: So how do you criticize Rudy for using similar tactics? </p><p>DAVIS: I don't criticize him for using tactics if his concern is about  impeachment. I say that they're not successful because we were talking  about a subject that most people had forgiven the President Clinton about,  which is personal indiscretion. This is about a unanimous verdict by the  intelligence community that President Trump has denied that there was an  effort by the Kremlin to influence the American people to vote for Donald  Trump. And he has denied that. </p><p>And Rudy Giuliani could focus on the evidence of collusion or lack of  evidence. But instead, he's making personal attacks on Mueller. And the  late senator john McCain reminded me attacking the motives of Mr. Starr was  a mistake. And from that moment that he told me not to do that, I followed  that advice.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah, you said look, I have my regrets by too many attacks on  Starr's motives. All right. </p><p>DAVIS: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: So you turned down a whole lot of invitations just to appear on this  program. We appreciate it. You said -- you've told me you made a mistake in  your dealings with CNN. Where did you go wrong? </p><p>DAVIS: First, I want to say I respect CNN. I have known Jeff Zucker for  many years. I certainly respect revere -- the role that Bernstein played in  Watergate and respect them as a journalist. I took this responsibility  because I was unsure about the issue of the Trump Tower meeting. And I  thought there were other people that could have been in the room and that  it was up to journalists to go look at that. </p><p>KURTZ: Well, let's stop that there. Did you ever confirm to CNN reporters  this allegation about the Trump Tower meeting off-the-record?</p><p>DAVIS: I was never sure in my confirmation. I was uncertain. And in fact, I  expressed my uncertainty, but not clear enough. So I can understand that  they interpreted what I said as a confirmation and I have not blamed CNN. I  blamed myself for not being more clear that in my mind I did not know the  details about that meeting. And I should not have encouraged any reporter.  The lesson that I've learned, if I'm not certain even on background, I  should not be asking reporters to do investigative work when I'm not sure. </p><p>KURTZ: Does did bother you that some of the reports have sort of conflated  a lot of this and say Lanny Davis confirmed that there was advanced  knowledge by the president in this meeting, and then backed off and  recanted? You said you never.</p><p>DAVIS: It does bother me because recanting isn't easy. And I disclosed  myself as a source, seeking reporters to confirm something I was unsure  about. And I was very unclear in that. So yes. But I thought it was  important not to blame CNN, not to blame anyone other than myself. I even  wrote a book about taking responsibility. </p><p>So this hasn't been an easy week for me. But I do think -- for everybody  who deals with the media in my position, this is a lesson, maybe a teaching  moment. Don't even float stories on background, which is our expression for  anonymously, unless you have a certainty of the facts and you are asking  reporters to go look, to confirm those facts. </p><p>KURTZ: Lanny, you've also drawn from flak -- for an interview with Anderson  Cooper in which you said, you appeared to say you were not a source for  CNN, was that untrue?</p><p>DAVIS: So in my mind, again, I apologized for saying something that was not  intentionally a misleading sentence. But in my mind, I wasn't sure of that  story that was published, so I didn't think of myself as a source for that  story. But I left that impression and I am very sorry I didn't explain  myself better to Anderson Cooper. I have really no excuse, other than it  was a long day and I should have expanded on my sentence. I was not a  source for that particular story, because I couldn't be certain. But I  don't blame either Mr. Bernstein or Mr. Sciutto (ph) for doing whatever  they did in interpreting what I said. I should have been more clear and it  certainly is a learning moment for me. </p><p>KURTZ: But also to be clear with CNN sticking by this story, you are saying  now, as Michael Cohen's lawyer, that you don't believe your client had any  direct knowledge that the president allegedly, supposedly, extensively knew  in advance about the Trump Tower meeting with the Russian lawyers, am I  right on that? </p><p>DAVIS: Again, you can't -- I can't tell you what Mr. Cohen has told me,  except that I can say to you that I'm not sure he did, and that it requires  additional reporting. And I'm not sure he did not. I know that there is a  lot of fuzzy memories here. There are people in and out of the room with  Mr. Trump  all the time. I've heard somebody -- maybe close to Mr. Trump or  used to be a Steve Bannon say, of course he knew, his son would have told  him ahead of time. </p><p>KURTZ: That's an assumption.</p><p>DAVIS: That's the key mistake. </p><p>KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p>DAVIS: And I take the responsibility. An assumption is not a fact. </p><p>KURTZ: So you are coming forward and you're saying you made a mistake. And  that's pretty rare in Washington. But is there a difference in the way  things get processed by the media between a mistake and a lie?</p><p>DAVIS: So that's really an important question, Howard. But I wrote in my  book on the election and I saw Jim Comey through data as the decisive  reason for Donald Trump being president and an illegitimate presidency if  it was the result of an intervention 11 days out by James Comey. </p><p>KURTZ: Illegitimate through characterization.</p><p>DAVIS: Yes, illegitimate and that the data shows that after October 28,  Hillary Clinton's polls plunged. </p><p>KURTZ: There are a lot of the reasons she lost. Anyway, your point about  mistake.</p><p>DAVIS: Mistake is that when I wrote the book, I didn't use the word lie  because lie is an intentional willful misstatement. That was not me when I  talked to Anderson Cooper or when I talked to CNN. It was a mistake, but  not intentional. In this case, James Comey knew what he told Congress, not  that I will disclose something even 11 days from the election. I will take  a look first. </p><p>KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p>DAVIS: And he has never admitted to that. And during this interviews, he  never said I'm sorry, I made a mistake the way Donald Trump will never say  I'm sorry I made a mistake.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. </p><p>DAVIS: The way I'm saying I am sorry, I made a mistake. </p><p>KURTZ: Finally, you know, your critics say you are a big Hillary Clinton  booster, you wrote a book about how she got screwed out of the presidency,  a long time friend of the former first lady, that you took on Michael  Cohen's case to use him against the president where you clearly dislike and  to get revenge. In other words, that your representation here has a  political motive.</p><p>DAVIS: Well, there is no question that I believe that Donald Trump is an  extremely divisive and harmful president. And when Michael Cohen came to  me, it took me quite a while to listen to him as to why he had changed his  mind about Donald Trump. And I took on the representation because he was  ready to speak what he felt about Donald Trump. So certainly that was part  of my motive. </p><p>KURTZ: What was it that he said to you in just -- we have about less than  half a minute...</p><p>DAVIS: OK.</p><p>KURTZ: ... that made you decide yes, I, a lifelong time Democrat, want to  represent Donald Trump's former lawyer. </p><p>DAVIS: Well, it's a matter of public record when he spoke to your staff and  office as your answer. He suddenly saw Mr. Trump denouncing the  intelligence community, questioning the fact that indisputable intervention  in his behalf, that I knew that his now conversion, a true transformation  was important for the country and I would help him get those facts out. </p><p>KURTZ: All right. Lanny Davis, not an easy thing to do, a difficult week  for you, thanks very much. </p><p>DAVIS: Thank you, Howard. Thank you. </p><p>KURTZ: Coming up, why Pope Francis deflected allegations that he hated the  sexual misconduct cover-up by asking journalists to investigate.  </p><p>And later, the fury over the leaking of the president's off-the-record  comments on Canada. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KURTZ: Pope Francis has been very media savvy, but when reporters on his  plane asked him about a stunning memo accusing him of covering up some of  the church's worst sexual abuses, he sides step and turned it back on them,  quote, read the document carefully and judge it for yourselves. I will not  say one word on this.</p><p>The memo was written by the former Vatican ambassador to the United States  Archbishop Carlo Vigano who was recalled by Francis. He charged that ousted  former cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, whose alleged sexual  abuse of children and young adults has been extensively reported by New  York Times was actually punished earlier by former Pope Benedict. And that  Vigano told us that Pope Francis who ignored the sanctions, he says, and  perpetuated the cover-up. </p><p>And here is the key media angle. Archbishop Vigano took his charges to  Italian journalist Marco Tosatti, who helped him write the letter. There  was no documentation. And then provided it to the National Catholic  Register owned by a right-leaning Catholic news company, which is often  critical of the Pope. Joining us now, Fr. Tom Reese, a Jesuit priest and  commentator for Religion News Service, and former religion reporter, Mollie  Hemingway, is back with us. Father, why would the Pope tell reporters on  his plane to check out the document full of accusations, knowing full well  that that would be seen as not denying the allegations?</p><p>FR. THOMAS REESE, RELIGION NEWS SERVICE: Well, I think the Pope made a  mistake. You know, I think he was correct in telling the reporters hey,  look at the document, analyze it, and try and fact-check it. Because  frankly, if that document had been written by a journalist and given to  their editor, it would never have been published, because it was full of  allegations without any evidence and proof to support the allegations. </p><p>KURTZ: So what was the mistake in your view?</p><p>REESE: His mistake was you know he said he met with the Pope and told him  about these sanctions, and told him about the abuse, the seminarians by  Cardinal McCarrick. All the Pope needed to do was either verify that that,  say yes it did happen, or no, it did not happen. That's what he needed to  do. </p><p>KURTZ: Mollie, there is a cultural war going on in the church with Francis,  seen as taking a more tolerant approach, to gays, to divorce, opposite  factions seeing Vigano as part of that. But what do you make of this New  York Times' headline, Francis takes High Road as Conservatives Pounce,  Making Criticisms Public?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I was going to mention that  headline because I thought it was so inappropriate. What reporters need to  do is look into the allegations that have been made. They are happy to work  with anonymous sources who provide no evidence, as the previous segment  just showed us. But when they have allegations coming from someone on the  record that can be checked out, their job is not to put it in the context  of a culture war, although that is also interesting, it is to check out the  allegations. Don't assume Pope Francis is guilty, don't assume Archbishop  Vigano is lying. Get to the facts and report. People have the right to know  whether -- what is going on here.</p><p>KURTZ: Father, do you find anything questionable that an Italian journalist  helping Archbishop Vigano write this memo, he turned off his phone when he  went to the guy's apartment, so he wouldn't be tracked, giving it to the  National Catholic Register, and Vigano first conferring with the  conservative board member of the register's parent company, EWTN? Does it  look a little bit like collusion?</p><p>REESE: Well, Italian journalism is very different from American journalism.  There is no big distinction between you know the editorial page, the  commentary, the op-ed page, and news stories. You know, the papers have  strong ideological biases, one way or the other. So that a reporter did  this in Italy is not a surprise at all. </p><p>KURTZ: You said, Mollie, look, it's fine for journalists to take a  skeptical attitude towards Vigano's charges. He himself has been accused of  obstructing investigations, he denies that. But how could we have a  situation where Pope Benedict supposedly secretly imposed sanctions against  Theodore McCarrick, who is a major figure here as the head of the Catholic  Church inch D.C. and nobody knew about it? </p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, I think the allegation is that McCarrick knew about it and  he was told to keep -- to lay low. And he declined to do it. </p><p>KURTZ: Right. New York Times reporting this morning that he went to a lot  of public events for the church:</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Yeah. But I think that's actually what is interesting here.  People, instead of thinking about which team they are on, at best, Benedict  took a very light punishment to someone who had we now know very credible  allegations of abuse. </p><p>KURTZ: Yes, horrible abuse.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So it's not like he even looks particularly good, even if he  might look better than Francis for lifting that light punishment, which is  validation being made. But again, we just have so much we need to know. </p><p>KURTZ: Yeah, in this case, tangled because McCarrick's successor here in  Washington, and this Cardinal Donald Wuerl, is also under pressure to  resign because of the devastating Pennsylvania grand jury report on all  kinds of -- decades of sexual abuse. And Wuerl was accused of rehiring or  reassigning priests who had already been found guilty of sexual abuse when  he was in Pittsburgh. What gets lost in all of this, I think I fear is the  unspeakable toll on young boys and young men over 50 years now.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And that is what people should be caring about so much. Two  years ago, there was an Academy Award for Best Picture given for the movie  about the journalist uncovering abuse at the Boston Globe.</p><p>KURTZ: Spotlight.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And now, it seems like they're running interference for the  current situation, to not hold people accountable. You look at what  happens, you know, even with this media rollout that you're talking about,  well, even when people are trying to bring attention to these things, they  get so such resistance from people, even in the media. That is very  unfortunate to see when people should be caring a lot more about systematic  corruption in the Church and how to avoid it in the future. </p><p>KURTZ: I have been reading anguished pieces by Catholics columnists who are  grappling with this, one from there saying he has left the church, E.J.  Dionne, a noted political commentator saying he's struggling to answer the  question why do you stay in the Church? And so, journalists covering this,  commenting on it, but those who are Catholics are in anguish. </p><p>REESE: Absolutely. I mean, this has been a real challenge to everybody in  the church. But again, the focus has to be on the victims. They are the  ones who are really hurt by this, tragically scared. And the church needs  to respond to that and reach out to them. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KURTZ: I believe the focus has to be on the victims and the focus also have  to be on not just to call for Pope Francis to resign, which is what Vigano  wants, but holding accountable those who are responsible for this horrible  views. </p><p>REESE: Absolutely. There is no question about that. We have to have systems  in place, that if there is an accusation of cover-up that the bishop isn't  protecting children, it needs to be investigated. It needs to be tracked  down. And if it's true, he needs to lose his job. </p><p>KURTZ: Fr. Tom Reese, Mollie Hemingway, thanks very much for joining us on  this very difficult subject. </p><p>Still to come, a report that President Trump wanted to buy up all the  National Inquirer's secrets about him that goes back decades.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KURTZ: President Trump made some off-the-record comments about nasty  negotiations with Canada in an interview with Bloomberg News, which didn't  report them. But the Toronto Star, not bound by the agreement, found out  the president said he wasn't going to compromise, but it would be insulting  to Canada, if he said so publicly. </p><p>The leak disrupted the trade talks. Justin Trudeau had to respond. And  Trump blamed quote, dishonest reporting, saying wow, I made off-the-record  comment records to Bloomberg concerning Canada and this powerful  understanding was blatantly violated. Trump wants Bloomberg to apologize.  But Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale says he's smearing the Bloomberg  interviewers and they were not his source. I'm not saying who his source  actually was.</p><p>The National Inquirer buying and burying that story of former Playboy model  Karen McDougal may just be the tip of the iceberg. Now, that Inquirer  publisher and Trump pal, David Pecker, has been given immunity by  prosecutors. The New York Times reports that Donald Trump had a plan to buy  up all the so-called dirt that the tabloid supposedly vacuumed up on him  since the 1980s. That would be pretty expensive, no. But the deal never  happened. </p><p>And by the way, New York's Village Voice, which was a pioneer of the sort  of alternative weekly culture, in its hay-day had published an awful lot of  groundbreaking investigative reporting. It was certainly liberal, but it  was also the model for similar papers around the country died this week, a  victim of all kinds of trends that have hurt print publications and at the  same time, a lots of these other city papers have either shrunk, shriveled,  or gone away. And so, RIP Village Voice. </p><p>That's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz. I hope you're  enjoying this Labor Day weekend.

A stunning and extraordinary step.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But the word is they are firing the head of NBC. What a great thing to do. How smart.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KURTZ: But is that crossing the line for the president of the United States. Trump's twitter attacks come as CNN continues to stand by a disputed story saying Michael Cohen is accusing the president of lying even though one of its anonymous sources, Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, has outed himself and says the allegation that's all been the Trump Tower meeting is false.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is just such a mistake by CNN. I really can't understand it. Everybody has retracted their story except CNN.</p><p>GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS COMMENTATOR: I like the guys involved in CNN. I think they've made a mistake. They are reluctant to withdraw it because there is an animosity towards this president that is unprecedented. I think it's clouding their judgment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>KURTZ: Lanny Davis who admits he made a mistake in dealing with the press will be here in a \"Media Buzz\" exclusive. A week of glowing media tributes to John McCain becomes a vehicle for taking shots at President Trump. Why was a farewell to this war here transformed into a Trump story?</p><p>Pope Francis tells reporters he won't comment on an extraordinary accusation that he helped cover-up a massive sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. This after a right-leaning Catholic news outlet ran a letter from the archbishop demanding that the pontiff resign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tonight, there is rare silence from Pope Francis making a point not to weigh in after explosive allegations were leveled against him by a former top Vatican official who claims he told the pope about abuse allegations against an American cardinal years ago and the pope did did nothing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Are the media being skeptical of the archbishop's letter and portraying this largely as a political attack from the pope's critics?</p><p>Plus, the president says Google is biased against him, against Republicans, against conservatives. Is that true? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\"</p><p>Whether you agree or disagree with the President Trump calling for the firing of CNN president Jeff Zucker and NBC News chairman Andy Lack, it is big news, but not on those networks, nothing on CNN. And the only MSNBC comment we could find was on \"Morning Joe.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: Not only is he attacking NBC's chairman Andy Lack, our boss, with stupid rumors, but also he's going after the truth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Despite mounting criticism, CNN continues to largely ignore the controversy especially on the air is standing by this story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sources with knowledge tell myself and Karl that Michael Cohen claims that then candidate Donald Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: The president tweeted that CNN's hatred and extreme bias toward him has clouded its thinking, and then addressed CNN's new parent company. \"Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job, his ratings suck, and AT&amp;T should fire him to save credibility.\"</p><p>One of the CNN reporters on the story is Jim Sciutto, a political appointee in the Obama administration. The other, is Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame who has called Trump an authoritarian.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: This is the greatest journalistic challenge of the modern era, to report on a malignant presidency.</p><p>What we are watching in the Trump presidency is worse than Watergate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: After the president criticized Bernstein, CNN hit back, \"Make no mistake, Mr. President, CNN does not lie. We report the news. And we report when people in power tell lies. CNN stands by our reporting and our reporters.\"</p><p>Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist\" and a Fox News contributor, Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent for \"The Washington Examiner,\" and Philippe Reines, former State Department official under Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Mollie, I say Donald Trump has every right to hit back at what he sees as unfair media coverage including, perhaps especially this flawed CNN story, but is the president of the United States go too far in calling for two executives at private companies to be fired because he doesn't like the media coverage by those companies?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, and I'm not sure if he's calling for their firing simply because of that. He's pointing out the series of failures that both of those media outlets have had. It's not just about calling for firing. It's also the language he used in that tweet, which as a mother and is someone -- is something I don't like to see some of the language that's being used.</p><p>There are all sorts of lines being crossed. There really are problems. Obviously, CNN is having a rough go of things right now, but also with regard to Andy Lack, you know, he is someone who's been rumored to be central to so many of the problems they are facing there, allegations --</p><p>KURTZ: Those were rumors so.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Yes, well. But I mean, it's an interesting story but I don't think it's appropriate for the president to be weighing in just -- it diminishes him.</p><p>KURTZ: Susan Ferechgio, Jeff Zucker who obviously is recuperating from heart surgery has said in the past because these attacks have gone on for a long time, that Donald Trump is trying to delegitimize journalism. What do you make of the tone when CNN hit back at the president's tweets?</p><p>SUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: I think that the president is trying to delegitimize journalism because journalists have tried to delegitimize the president in unprecedented way. I don't think there is any way to question that at this point -- the attacks, the number of attacks, the types of attacks by the media.</p><p>The way a lot of them had to be retracted, corrected. A lot of them have not been corrected. They see him as I think as Carl Bernstein said, on the leniency and so that's the way they treat him as a president. So I think all's fair here for both sides. Whatever CNN says, whatever the president says, it has devolved to a boxing match at this point and now the gloves are off, and that has happened.</p><p>KURTZ: And when I said on the air this week (inaudible) if President Obama, who took lots of shots at Fox News, had said hey, Fox News, you ought to get rid of Roger Ailes because I think the coverage is so unfair, what would have been the reaction on the right?</p><p>PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON ADVISER: Well look, the relationship between the White House media and the media (inaudible) with any president is going to be tense and adversarial.</p><p>KURTZ: Sure.</p><p>REINES: I saw Alan Dershowitz the other night say that that's a problem. It's supposed to be adversarial to an extent and that's not to be bitter and hateful, but if you look at what's going on with Jeff Zucker and Andy Lack, there's a problem in the sense that he -- the president is constantly trying to muddy the waters for both of those -- is due with Andy Lack.</p><p>Mollie is right. Andy Lack might have separate problems or rumored problems, but he's going after Andy Lack because now it's fitting his narrative of the Lester Holt interview was wrong.</p><p>KURTZ: I'm going to comeback to that.</p><p>REINES: On Jeff Zucker, I mean, the problem of calling Jeff Zucker's firing is actually a subset of a problem of him trying to scuttle or insert himself into the AT&amp;T Time Warner merger. This is something he's been doing. Frankly, Donald Trump should send Jeff Zucker flowers for everything he has done for him for the last 15 years.</p><p>KURTZ: Let me turn to Carl Bernstein because he's one of the two main reporters on this disputed CNN story, and the president really went after him personal terms. If we could put up on the screen -- he called Bernstein sloppy, a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool, making up story after story, is being laughed at all over the country.</p><p>Carl Bernstein defended himself in his own tweet, \"I have spent my life as a journalist bringing the truth to light, through administrations of both parties. No taunt will diminish my commitment to that mission.\" Mollie, what do you make of that?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, there is this fantasy that is spewed by people on the left, either in the media or not, but the media hold Democratic administrations accountable. The problem is that many Americans were awake for the previous eight years and they saw how the media treated the Obama administration. Only rarely adversarial despite many opportunities.</p><p>And in fact, the need to hold that administration accountable. So Carl Bernstein is also saying this. That he has an image of himself but I'm not sure is matched by reality. CNN has major credibility problems with that story. They have had a source who had admitted he was one of their sources. They claimed he wasn't a source. They put that in the original thing that said he declined to comment.</p><p>KURTZ: And we'll talk to Lanny Davis in a few minutes. Go ahead.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And they have not done anything near what they need to to deal with the problems with that story. And now they are trying to strongly suggest that their other story is Michael Cohen himself, which is also kind of inappropriate to reveal sources if you're sort of playing both sides of the game. And they need to restore credibility. They have a pattern of false stories on the Trump administration and this is just the latest one.</p><p>KURTZ: Some of which had to be corrected. Does CNN have some responsibility to be more front than having -- putting out a one-sentence statement essentially this is to standby our story, to address problems with this Trump Tower story after Lanny Davis, a pal of your friend Hillary Clinton, denied it -- and to report on the president's attacks on the network. I mean, its news, may be uncomfortable, but it's news that the president was using that rhetoric.</p><p>REINES: Well look, every media outlet whether it's CNN or Fox, has a responsibility to first call balls and strikes when covering what they think is the news. Obviously, I disagree with Mollie's describing how the Obama White House -- Susan's description, but CNN said they made a mistake. The source made a mistake. You don't see that often and I'm sure CNN's frustration right now is saying, we're getting killed for admitting a mistake.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: CNN is standing by its story.</p><p>REINES: I know, but --</p><p>HEMINGWAY: They are saying that despite what everybody knows about that one of their sources --</p><p>REINES: They are saying they have another source. I don't know better. I don't know any different that when you report something, but they made a mistake. I mean, the most parallel thing to me is when Fox was reporting on Seth Rich and it took months and months and months before anyone acknowledged that there was a mistaken in --</p><p>KURTZ: The online story about Seth Rich, which was the young DNC staff who was killed, was retracted, not months later. It was retracted and apologized for. I want to move on to NBC. I'm not sorry that you brought that up. So, Trump says the good news about Andy Lack -- he puts a Y, Andy Lacky -- is about to be fired -- question mark -- for incompetence.</p><p>And what's worse, that is purely a rumor, I just want to clarify that. And then he went on to the Lester Holt interview. This was last year, two days after the president fired Jim Comey of the FBI. Let's take a brief look at that interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Regardless of the recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it. I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: The president treats, \"When Lester Holt got caught fudging my tape on (inaudible) were heard badly. There is no credible allegation that NBC did anything in terms of misleading editing. And in fact, the whole interview was posted online.</p><p>FERRECHIO: And the transcript, it's all there. If you do read the transcript jut see at some point he said he didn't care about the investigation. He says things that kind of undercut that statement we just watched. But right, he's trying to make it look like they fudged a story but they really didn't.</p><p>But at this point, you know, each side is accusing the other of fake news and lying all the time that he probably can convince some of his base or people who follow him on twitter that there is some truth on that even though it's really completely false.</p><p>KURTZ: Let me turn to some other news this week. So, we have Don McGahn, White House counsel leaving. Trump announcing it by tweet without telling him in advance. This is 11 days after a \"New York Times\" story saying that McGahn spent 30 hours talking about Mueller's prosecutors and kind of suggest that he was cooperating.</p><p>The media also seemed quite sympathetic, Mollie, at Jeff Sessions after new taunts from the president. The implication that he is lashing out to his own attorney general. Interesting that the media are taking Sessions' side.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Right. It is very good to cover the fact that Donald Trump is dissatisfied at his attorney general. The problem with the media coverage is that they go beyond that into actually deciding that it is somehow inappropriate for the president to make decisions about who his attorney general is or is not.</p><p>They should just cover the story and they should make sure they explain why people are upset with Attorney-General Sessions. He recused himself from most of the problems that are going on with the FBI and the Department of Justice and it is causing some major problems for people who want to see rule of law equally applied, and that's an important story too.</p><p>KURTZ: Philippe, \"Washington Post\" reports that the president was again pushing to fire Jeff Sessions which he has every right to do obviously. Lawyers were said to have talked him out of it until the Mueller investigation ended. Then he told Bloomberg that Sessions is safe until after the midterms whatever that means. Everything leaks in this White House. I mean, all these backstage struggles just sort of play out on twitter and on the tube.</p><p>REINES: If he wants to fire him, fire him. I mean, we don't have to read about this everyday for six months. The president has not fired anyone since Jim Comey on this matter because he knows how horribly that went for him. He could fire Jeff Sessions right now, but it will not go well for him tomorrow.</p><p>And it's not the media that is pressing him on that. It's Republicans in Congress who are saying this is not a good idea. The fact that now Lindsey Graham and Charles Grassley have changed their tune shows you how long it has bent Republican Congress has been saying to him, sir, don't do this. It's not going to go well.</p><p>KURTZ: Just a brief comment.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: In fact, media coverage is such a big part of the story. I agree with what was said about fudging the Lester Holt interview, but the way that that was portrayed as obstruction of the Russia investigation instead of frustration with (inaudible) Russia investigation is a perfect example of how the media control the conversation in a way that is not helpful.</p><p>REINES: But Mollie, it's a straight out lie to say that that tape is not real. And now 35 percent of America believes it.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: You can also have media coverage that is inaccurate and very wrongly inaccurate.</p><p>REINES: But that's not an example.</p><p>KURTZ: We have to (inaudible) have you guys. Thank you south side (ph). Ahead, as I mentioned, exclusive interview with Lanny Davis about his role in the CNN story on the Trump Tower meeting that has drawn such harsh criticism for the president.</p><p>But when we come back, a week of media praise after John McCain's passing. But why did many pundits turn that into an attack on Donald Trump.</p><p>KURTZ: The speakers at John McCain's funeral yesterday at the National Cathedral, George w. Bush, Barack Obama, his daughter Megyn not only praised the man but implicitly seemed to rebuke the man who wasn't there. All week long, an emotional hero sendoff from most of the media kept straining it's a criticism of Donald Trump especially when the president initially refused to praise his bitter rival.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To watch the president with President Kenyatta of Kenya twice, you know, not saying anything about this hero, this lion of a man -- it's despicable. It's despicable.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: McCain despised Trump. Trump for his part despised McCain right back, and to their credit, neither man ever pretended otherwise.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Susan, we talked the show last week to spend an hour on the life and legacy of John McCain. Political lead story this morning, Washington mourns John McCain and its own demise under Trump. Has there been too much focus on President Trump initially being holding back on anything positive and the whole business about the flag, I mean, at half staff and coming back up and then coming back down?</p><p>FERRECHIO: Ridiculous and I think the Tucker quote was perfect. They did hate each other. McCain not only hated Trump, he really doesn't like the people who follow Trump, the tea partyers, that's why the reason -- that's why Sara Palin was shut out of the whole funeral and all that stuff.</p><p>It really was, you know, the two of them were enemies basically. So to expect the president to go on and on about what a hero McCain is, remember, McCain also went to get the dossier and bring it back and give it to the FBI --</p><p>(CROSTALK)</p><p>FERRECHIO: -- creating a huge investigation (inaudible) his presidency. That's never factored in here. It's just ridiculous.</p><p>KURTZ: Mollie, I saw a lot of pundits say John McCain was a man of great character and principle and obviously he was a war hero. So, of course, he was totally opposed to Trump. I mean, this is how they worked it in. They would sort of pivot and almost as if you couldn't praise the senator and his life as a warrior and a lawmaker without bashing the president.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: It was just a shame because this man who is a legitimate American hero and who people regardless of their political views can respect and appreciate. It was a little difficult to see some of the coverage this week because I think people going to remember what happened when he ran for president, when he was not treated as a lion or hero by the same media who now say he was a lion and a hero. They remember --</p><p>KURTZ: It was in 2000 when he running against George W. Bush. He got extraordinarily good coverage. I was there. In 2008, no so much as you said.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: This is hard to take it seriously that people can switch so violently from one extreme to another.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. So, Hillary Clinton praised McCain as did Obama, as did Biden, as did all kinds of Democrats. Given that McCain had this extraordinary life over many decades and Donald Trump the president or, you know, a little more than a year and a half, were the media doing something of a disservice by making so much of this about the contrast with President Trump?</p><p>REINES: I mean, I think at the end of the day only the McCain family can really say whether this got away from them or not.</p><p>KURTZ: You can say what you think.</p><p>REINES: What I think is the man is dead and to start, you know, putting it on a equivalency of what the president did last week and what John McCain couldn't do this past week -- put the flag up. Put it down to half-mast. This stuff is silly. And if you're going to bite your tongue, which Donald Trump is unable to do, do it one week. Just do it one week. Just try it.</p><p>FERRECHIO: If he has (ph) his tongue, what has he said this week that's negative about McCain? Nothing. He actually -- I think he did the right thing. He lowered the flag. That was the protocol. What he could have done said don't put it back up, hold it. And then he pretty much went radio silence on McCain despite all the attacks.</p><p>KURTZ: Now, it is true that when you have a funeral and you have two former presidents with the sort of an implicit rebuke of Trump's style of politics while praising McCain, you have to report that that was part of the story, Meghan McCain as well. But I'm talking more here about the commentators, Mollie, who -- it almost became like the two stories were intertwined, you know.</p><p>Washington used to be such a good bipartisan place. That was the John McCain that we loved though he wasn't always easy to get along with as we've said and President Trump has changed that. Is it Donald Trump single- handedly change the entire culture --</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, and that really is a legitimate viewpoint for, I think they put it forth because it does very much represent what Washington, D.C. thinks. The problem from a media coverage angle is that this a very complex story and one where there are some things that people disagree with that are happening politically in D.C. that haven't been well represented this week.</p><p>KURTZ: All right, Susan Ferrechio, Philippe Reines, great to see you. Mollie, we'll see you a little later in the program. Ahead, Lanny Davis on why he outed himself as an anonymous source in that hotly disputed CNN story. But up next, the president says Google is rigged against him and conservatives. We'll search for the right answer.</p><p>KURTZ: President Trump is giving it to Google tweeting that its search process is very dangerous and possibly illegal. \"Google search results for Trump news shows only the viewing/reporting of fake news media. In other words, they have it rigged, for me and others, so that almost all stories and news is bad, Fake CNN is prominent.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat conservatives and Republicans very unfairly. I could tell you that I have personal experience.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Joining us now, Shana Glenzer, technology analyst and commentator here in Washington. So, Google may have flaws in the way it tweaks these algorithms, but could the company be consistently rigging all searches against Donald Trump and the Republican Party?</p><p>SHANA GLENZER, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST: The short answer is no. There has been time perhaps where because there are human beings behind the technology some biases has resulted, I'm sure. But, you know, there is a set of rules based on like 200 factors that Google considers when it is showing you the news results.</p><p>And, you know, sure Google could prove that it's not biased by, you know, opening the kimono (ph), showing you the algorithm. But you can even imagine how many people would exploit that? You know, I can assure you --</p><p>KURTZ: Game the system.</p><p>GLENZER: Game the system -- I can assure you it would not lead to a more balanced list of news articles in your search.</p><p>KURTZ: So, this 96 percent figure that the president cited in his tweet is based on a blogger at the conservative site PJ Media who ran a test, Trump news and found that most of the hits where from what she calls left-leaning sites. It so happens I ran the same tests. Trump news -- Fox kept popping up one or two out of three so I guess it depends on when you do it and how you framed the search and all that. So is that enough to warrant this sort of presidential blast?</p><p>GLENZER: I understand his position here. I mean it certainly, the article struck a chord with people who have been following recent news coverage about bias at big tech companies and the concerns but what concerns me is that there, you know, is that there was this woman.</p><p>That, you know, sat behind a few different computers and plugged in a few different words into Google news and it's caused such an uproar, you know, from complaints to, you know, from about censorship to calling for federal investigation. I feel like it's a little mismatched to the actual study that was performed.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. And this call for government regulation which in my view would be worse because who is going to test the government to somehow fair and unbiased way to decide the perfect balance in all news searches. But it seems to me that, you know, when CNN or \"Washington Post\" or \"New York Times\" pops up in these ranking, I mean, doesn't Google reward the most popular websites whether the president happens to think that those are hostile to him or not?</p><p>GLENZER: Yes. Yes, they do, I mean --</p><p>KURTZ: Explain how it works.</p><p>GLENZER: It's really hard to translate the journalistic values into like a set of rules that they use and apply to every one, but you know, we've seen that Google really does weigh original content, it weighs traffic to sites, and that plays against these smaller sites with maybe a handful of reporters putting out, you know, a few stories a day versus dozens of stories being put out by, you know, \"Washington Post\" or other mainstream media organizations.</p><p>KURTZ: At which have hundreds of reporters. So you are saying Google rewards that and it's not necessarily an ideological decision that there so much more content and people click on it therefore Google deems it must be relevant.</p><p>GLENZER: I'm saying yes, there's probably truth to a little bit of the, you know, suspicion but it's not a nefarious reason behind the bias. It is because of the rules that they set in place.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes. There is a reason people don't trust big tech and maybe isolated some (inaudible) but in Google's case, I'm not sure the case has been proved. Shana Glenzer, ghreat to see you. Thanks for stopping by this Sunday.</p><p>Ahead on \"MediaBuzz,\" an explosive charge against Pope Francis in the church's sexual abuse scandal. Some of the press rushing to the pontiff's defense, but first, Lanny Davis, Michael Cohen's lawyer, sits down with me exclusively on the lesson he says he's learned from the CNN controversy.</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ, ANCHOR: Lanny Davis, the lawyer for Michael Cohen, had been making the rounds saying that his client who now pled guilty has more information about Donald Trump that could interest Robert Mueller's prosecutors. His role became highly controversial after CNN went with the story that Cohen knows the president had advance knowledge of that Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer offering dirt on Hillary Clinton, which Davis now flatly denies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON SOOPER, ANDERSON COOPER 360, ANCHOR: So Michael Cohen does not have information that President Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting with the Russians beforehand.</p><p>LANNY DAVIS, MICHAEL COHEN'S LAWYER: No, he does not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: And joining me now is Lanny Davis, the veteran lawyer who represents Michael Cohen. His book, The Unmaking of a President 2016, comes out week with a new afterword. So you had a rough week, which we'll get to in just a second.</p><p>In the afterword of the book, you say Rudy Giuliani has openly admitted his purpose is to appeal to the Trump base, undermine Mueller's credibility, and get ready for an impeachment battle. He said it on his program, which is on fighting the court of public opinion. When I was covering the Clinton impeachment 20 years ago, that's exactly what you and your allies tried to do to Ken Starr.</p><p>DAVIS: And it looks like we were successful in molding public opinion and certainly in the November elections of 2000 -- of 1998.</p><p>KURTZ: So how do you criticize Rudy for using similar tactics?</p><p>DAVIS: I don't criticize him for using tactics if his concern is about impeachment. I say that they're not successful because we were talking about a subject that most people had forgiven the President Clinton about, which is personal indiscretion. This is about a unanimous verdict by the intelligence community that President Trump has denied that there was an effort by the Kremlin to influence the American people to vote for Donald Trump. And he has denied that.</p><p>And Rudy Giuliani could focus on the evidence of collusion or lack of evidence. But instead, he's making personal attacks on Mueller. And the late senator john McCain reminded me attacking the motives of Mr. Starr was a mistake. And from that moment that he told me not to do that, I followed that advice.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah, you said look, I have my regrets by too many attacks on Starr's motives. All right.</p><p>DAVIS: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: So you turned down a whole lot of invitations just to appear on this program. We appreciate it. You said -- you've told me you made a mistake in your dealings with CNN. Where did you go wrong?</p><p>DAVIS: First, I want to say I respect CNN. I have known Jeff Zucker for many years. I certainly respect revere -- the role that Bernstein played in Watergate and respect them as a journalist. I took this responsibility because I was unsure about the issue of the Trump Tower meeting. And I thought there were other people that could have been in the room and that it was up to journalists to go look at that.</p><p>KURTZ: Well, let's stop that there. Did you ever confirm to CNN reporters this allegation about the Trump Tower meeting off-the-record?</p><p>DAVIS: I was never sure in my confirmation. I was uncertain. And in fact, I expressed my uncertainty, but not clear enough. So I can understand that they interpreted what I said as a confirmation and I have not blamed CNN. I blamed myself for not being more clear that in my mind I did not know the details about that meeting. And I should not have encouraged any reporter. The lesson that I've learned, if I'm not certain even on background, I should not be asking reporters to do investigative work when I'm not sure.</p><p>KURTZ: Does did bother you that some of the reports have sort of conflated a lot of this and say Lanny Davis confirmed that there was advanced knowledge by the president in this meeting, and then backed off and recanted? You said you never.</p><p>DAVIS: It does bother me because recanting isn't easy. And I disclosed myself as a source, seeking reporters to confirm something I was unsure about. And I was very unclear in that. So yes. But I thought it was important not to blame CNN, not to blame anyone other than myself. I even wrote a book about taking responsibility.</p><p>So this hasn't been an easy week for me. But I do think -- for everybody who deals with the media in my position, this is a lesson, maybe a teaching moment. Don't even float stories on background, which is our expression for anonymously, unless you have a certainty of the facts and you are asking reporters to go look, to confirm those facts.</p><p>KURTZ: Lanny, you've also drawn from flak -- for an interview with Anderson Cooper in which you said, you appeared to say you were not a source for CNN, was that untrue?</p><p>DAVIS: So in my mind, again, I apologized for saying something that was not intentionally a misleading sentence. But in my mind, I wasn't sure of that story that was published, so I didn't think of myself as a source for that story. But I left that impression and I am very sorry I didn't explain myself better to Anderson Cooper. I have really no excuse, other than it was a long day and I should have expanded on my sentence. I was not a source for that particular story, because I couldn't be certain. But I don't blame either Mr. Bernstein or Mr. Sciutto (ph) for doing whatever they did in interpreting what I said. I should have been more clear and it certainly is a learning moment for me.</p><p>KURTZ: But also to be clear with CNN sticking by this story, you are saying now, as Michael Cohen's lawyer, that you don't believe your client had any direct knowledge that the president allegedly, supposedly, extensively knew in advance about the Trump Tower meeting with the Russian lawyers, am I right on that?</p><p>DAVIS: Again, you can't -- I can't tell you what Mr. Cohen has told me, except that I can say to you that I'm not sure he did, and that it requires additional reporting. And I'm not sure he did not. I know that there is a lot of fuzzy memories here. There are people in and out of the room with Mr. Trump all the time. I've heard somebody -- maybe close to Mr. Trump or used to be a Steve Bannon say, of course he knew, his son would have told him ahead of time.</p><p>KURTZ: That's an assumption.</p><p>DAVIS: That's the key mistake.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p>DAVIS: And I take the responsibility. An assumption is not a fact.</p><p>KURTZ: So you are coming forward and you're saying you made a mistake. And that's pretty rare in Washington. But is there a difference in the way things get processed by the media between a mistake and a lie?</p><p>DAVIS: So that's really an important question, Howard. But I wrote in my book on the election and I saw Jim Comey through data as the decisive reason for Donald Trump being president and an illegitimate presidency if it was the result of an intervention 11 days out by James Comey.</p><p>KURTZ: Illegitimate through characterization.</p><p>DAVIS: Yes, illegitimate and that the data shows that after October 28, Hillary Clinton's polls plunged.</p><p>KURTZ: There are a lot of the reasons she lost. Anyway, your point about mistake.</p><p>DAVIS: Mistake is that when I wrote the book, I didn't use the word lie because lie is an intentional willful misstatement. That was not me when I talked to Anderson Cooper or when I talked to CNN. It was a mistake, but not intentional. In this case, James Comey knew what he told Congress, not that I will disclose something even 11 days from the election. I will take a look first.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p>DAVIS: And he has never admitted to that. And during this interviews, he never said I'm sorry, I made a mistake the way Donald Trump will never say I'm sorry I made a mistake.</p><p>KURTZ: All right.</p><p>DAVIS: The way I'm saying I am sorry, I made a mistake.</p><p>KURTZ: Finally, you know, your critics say you are a big Hillary Clinton booster, you wrote a book about how she got screwed out of the presidency, a long time friend of the former first lady, that you took on Michael Cohen's case to use him against the president where you clearly dislike and to get revenge. In other words, that your representation here has a political motive.</p><p>DAVIS: Well, there is no question that I believe that Donald Trump is an extremely divisive and harmful president. And when Michael Cohen came to me, it took me quite a while to listen to him as to why he had changed his mind about Donald Trump. And I took on the representation because he was ready to speak what he felt about Donald Trump. So certainly that was part of my motive.</p><p>KURTZ: What was it that he said to you in just -- we have about less than half a minute...</p><p>DAVIS: OK.</p><p>KURTZ: ... that made you decide yes, I, a lifelong time Democrat, want to represent Donald Trump's former lawyer.</p><p>DAVIS: Well, it's a matter of public record when he spoke to your staff and office as your answer. He suddenly saw Mr. Trump denouncing the intelligence community, questioning the fact that indisputable intervention in his behalf, that I knew that his now conversion, a true transformation was important for the country and I would help him get those facts out.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. Lanny Davis, not an easy thing to do, a difficult week for you, thanks very much.</p><p>DAVIS: Thank you, Howard. Thank you.</p><p>KURTZ: Coming up, why Pope Francis deflected allegations that he hated the sexual misconduct cover-up by asking journalists to investigate.</p><p>And later, the fury over the leaking of the president's off-the-record comments on Canada.</p><p>KURTZ: Pope Francis has been very media savvy, but when reporters on his plane asked him about a stunning memo accusing him of covering up some of the church's worst sexual abuses, he sides step and turned it back on them, quote, read the document carefully and judge it for yourselves. I will not say one word on this.</p><p>The memo was written by the former Vatican ambassador to the United States Archbishop Carlo Vigano who was recalled by Francis. He charged that ousted former cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, whose alleged sexual abuse of children and young adults has been extensively reported by New York Times was actually punished earlier by former Pope Benedict. And that Vigano told us that Pope Francis who ignored the sanctions, he says, and perpetuated the cover-up.</p><p>And here is the key media angle. Archbishop Vigano took his charges to Italian journalist Marco Tosatti, who helped him write the letter. There was no documentation. And then provided it to the National Catholic Register owned by a right-leaning Catholic news company, which is often critical of the Pope. Joining us now, Fr. Tom Reese, a Jesuit priest and commentator for Religion News Service, and former religion reporter, Mollie Hemingway, is back with us. Father, why would the Pope tell reporters on his plane to check out the document full of accusations, knowing full well that that would be seen as not denying the allegations?</p><p>FR. THOMAS REESE, RELIGION NEWS SERVICE: Well, I think the Pope made a mistake. You know, I think he was correct in telling the reporters hey, look at the document, analyze it, and try and fact-check it. Because frankly, if that document had been written by a journalist and given to their editor, it would never have been published, because it was full of allegations without any evidence and proof to support the allegations.</p><p>KURTZ: So what was the mistake in your view?</p><p>REESE: His mistake was you know he said he met with the Pope and told him about these sanctions, and told him about the abuse, the seminarians by Cardinal McCarrick. All the Pope needed to do was either verify that that, say yes it did happen, or no, it did not happen. That's what he needed to do.</p><p>KURTZ: Mollie, there is a cultural war going on in the church with Francis, seen as taking a more tolerant approach, to gays, to divorce, opposite factions seeing Vigano as part of that. But what do you make of this New York Times' headline, Francis takes High Road as Conservatives Pounce, Making Criticisms Public?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I was going to mention that headline because I thought it was so inappropriate. What reporters need to do is look into the allegations that have been made. They are happy to work with anonymous sources who provide no evidence, as the previous segment just showed us. But when they have allegations coming from someone on the record that can be checked out, their job is not to put it in the context of a culture war, although that is also interesting, it is to check out the allegations. Don't assume Pope Francis is guilty, don't assume Archbishop Vigano is lying. Get to the facts and report. People have the right to know whether -- what is going on here.</p><p>KURTZ: Father, do you find anything questionable that an Italian journalist helping Archbishop Vigano write this memo, he turned off his phone when he went to the guy's apartment, so he wouldn't be tracked, giving it to the National Catholic Register, and Vigano first conferring with the conservative board member of the register's parent company, EWTN? Does it look a little bit like collusion?</p><p>REESE: Well, Italian journalism is very different from American journalism. There is no big distinction between you know the editorial page, the commentary, the op-ed page, and news stories. You know, the papers have strong ideological biases, one way or the other. So that a reporter did this in Italy is not a surprise at all.</p><p>KURTZ: You said, Mollie, look, it's fine for journalists to take a skeptical attitude towards Vigano's charges. He himself has been accused of obstructing investigations, he denies that. But how could we have a situation where Pope Benedict supposedly secretly imposed sanctions against Theodore McCarrick, who is a major figure here as the head of the Catholic Church inch D.C. and nobody knew about it?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, I think the allegation is that McCarrick knew about it and he was told to keep -- to lay low. And he declined to do it.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. New York Times reporting this morning that he went to a lot of public events for the church:</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Yeah. But I think that's actually what is interesting here. People, instead of thinking about which team they are on, at best, Benedict took a very light punishment to someone who had we now know very credible allegations of abuse.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes, horrible abuse.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So it's not like he even looks particularly good, even if he might look better than Francis for lifting that light punishment, which is validation being made. But again, we just have so much we need to know.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah, in this case, tangled because McCarrick's successor here in Washington, and this Cardinal Donald Wuerl, is also under pressure to resign because of the devastating Pennsylvania grand jury report on all kinds of -- decades of sexual abuse. And Wuerl was accused of rehiring or reassigning priests who had already been found guilty of sexual abuse when he was in Pittsburgh. What gets lost in all of this, I think I fear is the unspeakable toll on young boys and young men over 50 years now.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And that is what people should be caring about so much. Two years ago, there was an Academy Award for Best Picture given for the movie about the journalist uncovering abuse at the Boston Globe.</p><p>KURTZ: Spotlight.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And now, it seems like they're running interference for the current situation, to not hold people accountable. You look at what happens, you know, even with this media rollout that you're talking about, well, even when people are trying to bring attention to these things, they get so such resistance from people, even in the media. That is very unfortunate to see when people should be caring a lot more about systematic corruption in the Church and how to avoid it in the future.</p><p>KURTZ: I have been reading anguished pieces by Catholics columnists who are grappling with this, one from there saying he has left the church, E.J. Dionne, a noted political commentator saying he's struggling to answer the question why do you stay in the Church? And so, journalists covering this, commenting on it, but those who are Catholics are in anguish.</p><p>REESE: Absolutely. I mean, this has been a real challenge to everybody in the church. But again, the focus has to be on the victims. They are the ones who are really hurt by this, tragically scared. And the church needs to respond to that and reach out to them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KURTZ: I believe the focus has to be on the victims and the focus also have to be on not just to call for Pope Francis to resign, which is what Vigano wants, but holding accountable those who are responsible for this horrible views.</p><p>REESE: Absolutely. There is no question about that. We have to have systems in place, that if there is an accusation of cover-up that the bishop isn't protecting children, it needs to be investigated. It needs to be tracked down. And if it's true, he needs to lose his job.</p><p>KURTZ: Fr. Tom Reese, Mollie Hemingway, thanks very much for joining us on this very difficult subject.</p><p>Still to come, a report that President Trump wanted to buy up all the National Inquirer's secrets about him that goes back decades.</p><p>KURTZ: President Trump made some off-the-record comments about nasty negotiations with Canada in an interview with Bloomberg News, which didn't report them. But the Toronto Star, not bound by the agreement, found out the president said he wasn't going to compromise, but it would be insulting to Canada, if he said so publicly.</p><p>The leak disrupted the trade talks. Justin Trudeau had to respond. And Trump blamed quote, dishonest reporting, saying wow, I made off-the-record comment records to Bloomberg concerning Canada and this powerful understanding was blatantly violated. Trump wants Bloomberg to apologize. But Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale says he's smearing the Bloomberg interviewers and they were not his source. I'm not saying who his source actually was.</p><p>The National Inquirer buying and burying that story of former Playboy model Karen McDougal may just be the tip of the iceberg. Now, that Inquirer publisher and Trump pal, David Pecker, has been given immunity by prosecutors. The New York Times reports that Donald Trump had a plan to buy up all the so-called dirt that the tabloid supposedly vacuumed up on him since the 1980s. That would be pretty expensive, no. But the deal never happened.</p><p>And by the way, New York's Village Voice, which was a pioneer of the sort of alternative weekly culture, in its hay-day had published an awful lot of groundbreaking investigative reporting. It was certainly liberal, but it was also the model for similar papers around the country died this week, a victim of all kinds of trends that have hurt print publications and at the same time, a lots of these other city papers have either shrunk, shriveled, or gone away. And so, RIP Village Voice.</p><p>That's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz. I hope you're enjoying this Labor Day weekend.

I'm Julia Chatterley. This is FIRST MOVE. And here's your need to know. Face-to-face: President Trump wants to meet the whistleblower as impeachment calls intensify. Nothing is forever. Teenage clothing brand Forever 21 filing for bankruptcy. And a Starship Enterprise. Elon Musk unveils the rocket he says will fly to Mars. It's Monday, let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome back to the show. We are back in action and rocketing towards the final quarter of the year. Yes, it's the last trading day of the month, the last trading day of the quarter, too. No shortage of twists and turns as far as the news flow is concerned whether it's U.S.-China or the impeachment crisis here in the United States over in D.C.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the bright side, though, U.S. stock futures are higher at this moment. Let me give you a look at what we're seeing right now, helped along, I think today by statements over the weekend from the U.S. Treasury saying that it isn't considering restricting Chinese firms who want to list on the U.S. stock exchanges.</p><p>Peter Navarro, Trade Adviser to the White House went one step further on air this morning on CNBC Network said it's all fake news. I'll tell you what though, U.S. stocks did they come under pressure on Friday. The NASDAQ losing some one percent as a result of these reports, U.S. listings of big Chinese companies like Alibaba, jd.com, Baidu all coming under pressure. They are recovering here premarket to and I think overall, this helps sentiment in Asia as well.</p><p>Let me give you a sense of why I think there was nervousness here. There are roughly 160 Chinese firms listed on the major three U.S. stock markets. So we're talking $1.2 trillion worth of assets, perhaps even more. It is easy to understand why there was some nervousness here.</p><p>Look, we'll get more insight later on in the show. But I think the big takeaway for me here is this isn't happening anytime soon. Beijing also want the decoupling of the two economies, the U.S. and China here, will be bad for everyone. I have to agree. What a backdrop though, for the trade talks that's set to resume next week.</p><p>For now, a brief respite. Chinese markets are closed for the next seven days marking National Day, and it is 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic. Perhaps some respite for Trump as well here on the trade war front at least. Plenty though to distract him at home.</p><p>The Impeachment Inquiry is where we begin the drivers, so let's get to it. President Trump ramping up attacks on the whistleblower here. The President demanding to meet his accuser. He says incorrect information was passed to that person and illegally.</p><p>Meanwhile, the whistleblower's lawyer has serious concerns about their client's safety. Suzanne Malveaux joins us now. Suzanne, fantastic to have you with us. Adam Schiff, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee saying that the whistleblower will appear before U.S. Congress. What more do we know about this and when perhaps?</p><p>SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Sure, Julia. The investigation is really going at lightning speed here. What you have is the House and the Senate on recess, but certainly the House Intelligence Committee is working in earnest to make this happen, to happen as quickly as possible.</p><p>There was a conference call with Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic Caucus over the weekend, just yesterday, sharing what the plan is going to be urging for members not to be partisan or political. She says this is not about whether or not you like Trump, but it is about the Constitution.</p><p>So Chairman Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee, essentially saying that these hearings will begin this week, and one of the deals that they are still negotiating working on a tentative negotiation with the whistleblower to go before the Committee on some conditions here that that whistleblower is protected, their identity as well as their safety.</p><p>Lawyers for the whistleblower sent a letter to both the Chair of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, saying that they were concerned about the safety of the whistleblower because of statements and tweets coming from the President over the weekend, saying that he wanted to meet face-to- face, that there would be repercussions.</p><p>They also said there was a $50,000.00 bounty on the head of the whistleblower -- for the whistleblower's identity. So you can imagine those talks still ongoing to make sure that that person is safe in participating in this.</p><p>Also what we're expecting from Chairman Schiff, a possible subpoena for documents for Rudy Giuliani, the President's attorney, very much, they believe involved in this, as well as over the weekend, they also said that they were going to be taking a look at the former U.S. Ambassador to the Ukraine for testimony as well as the Special Envoy to the Ukraine who just recently resigned and the Intelligence Committee's Inspector General, who was the one who said that the whistleblower's complaint was urgent and credible, all of this beginning this week -- Julia.</p><p>[09:05:34]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's so complicated, but to your point, as well, for anyone wanting to raise their hand here and say there's things going on that I'm worried about, fears around the safety of the whistleblower, I think front and center here.</p><p>Very quickly, Suzanne, for an international viewer that's looking at this, do we need to illustrate the point that even if we see impeachment in the House, there are not the numbers to impeach President Trump at this moment in the Senate.</p><p>So whatever happens, he will remain unless Republican senators shift their position here.</p><p>MALVEAUX: That's right, Julia. And when you look at the numbers here, you have the House, which can certainly impeach the President. It just takes for a simple majority, the Democrats in charge, but the Republicans in charge of the Senate, they would go through the trial and actually remove the President.</p><p>You would need all the Democrats, the independents and at least 20 Republicans to make that happen. And that would be a huge shift in the Senate to actually remove him from office.</p><p>And so what you're looking at here are Democrats who are saying a couple of things, the leadership saying it is their constitutional duty to move forward with impeachment -- Articles of Impeachment -- even if he's not removed in the Senate.</p><p>There are some other Democrats who are looking at it certainly at the political side of this, saying that look, at the very least by going through this exercise, they will convince voters and show the American people that he is unfit for office and potentially that he would not win the 2020 race that they would demonstrate that through this process. And so that is really what you're looking at.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The risk is that it becomes just a huge distraction here. Suzanne, fantastic to have you with us. Thank you so much for joining FIRST MOVE this morning.</p><p>All right, let's move on to our next driver. Nothing lasts forever, it seems, fast fashion retailer Forever 21 filing for bankruptcy. Clare Sebastian joins as now. Another victim it seems to intense competition and the shift to e-commerce here, but Clare, just explain what Forever 21 is and where they operate and what we've seen as a result of this filing.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia. This is a fast fashion retailer really. It caters to kind of teenagers and early 20s, very cheap clothing and a couple of issues that affect Forever 21, which has made the shift in the retail industry even more acutely felt by them, I don't know when the last time is that you've been to a Forever 21 store, but they are huge.</p><p>According to their website, the average size is 38,000 square foot which is really more akin to the size of a supermarket than a clothes retailer and this is part of the problem for them. Their stores are enormous. They've been expanding since the financial crisis, just as other retailers were starting to kind of downsize their physical footprint and shift more to online.</p><p>This has made the crisis with being able to pay their rents more acute as sales have been slowing. And they're also, you know, kind of the wrong end of another shift in retail, and that is the shift away from fast fashion. People are really looking for something more sustainable nowadays. You see this in terms of how, you know, even influencers operate online.</p><p>They're pushing people to be a bit more careful with constantly spending on cheap clothing and Forever 21 definitely on the wrong side of that, too, Julia. So this is, you know, something that has been precipitating for a long time for this company.</p><p>They say they are going to be able to stay in business. They've managed to secure some financing to help them do that, but the pressure is on to prove that they can, you know, they can downsize now and really get things back on track.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You make such great points here, Clare. This is about far more than just more people buying things over the internet rather than anything else.</p><p>The specific challenges for this brand, too, which you illustrate. It's also a problem for the mall operators hereto. And I do want to speak about some of these guys, Simon Property Group, Brookfield Property Partners, one of the biggest tenants here is having a ripple effect.</p><p>They're shifting the changes that we see in the underlying retail environment having repercussions for others hereto.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Absolutely, Julia. This is one of the biggest tenants and American malls. I think it's interesting if we talk about the size of Forever 21, this is kind of a microcosm of what we see for America's malls as well. Just too much space too, many stores. Too much square footage more than is needed now for today's shopper who of course is shifting online.</p><p>Simon Property Group has lost about a third of its value really in the last three years. Interestingly, a couple of years ago they actually teamed up with another mall and stepped in to rescue a retailer, Aeropostale. It remains to be seen whether they're considering doing that again in the future.</p><p>But I think that is a sign of just how much these mall owners need these stores. Forever 21, not an anchor tenant as such, but these malls have been losing others. The likes of Sears, you know, we've seen other bankruptcies this year, Payless, Gymboree, this is something that just keeps happening and the mall owners have really got to step up their game. It is experiences rather than just shopping that people want from these malls.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. I want to circle to point, too. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that update there. And later on in the show, we'll be speaking to the CEO of Majid Al Futtaim. The company owns many malls across the Middle East, across the E.U. and Asia, including Forever 21, as well appearing in their malls. He'll be joining us live from Dubai at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. So stick around for that.</p><p>For now, to our next driver and raising a glass to its first day of trading. Beer maker AB InBev's Asia arm finally going public in Hong Kong. It finished over four percent higher in the first day of trade.</p><p>Paul La Monica joins us now. Second time-ish lucky. They sold off the Australian business, came back to the market and it looks pretty successful here.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, you have to think that it's a success, Julia. The fact that they were able to get this offering out and for it to go up a little bit.</p><p>Keep in mind, though, that they did downsize the offering. It was originally expected to sell about $10 billion in stock, which would have made it the biggest IPO of the year; instead, it is about $5 billion. It's the second biggest globally, behind Uber.</p><p>They also had to bring the price range down I think to make it more palatable to investors as well. But that aside, at least the stock did go up, which is not something that can be said for a lot of unicorns in the U.S. that have been going public lately. The likes of Uber and Peloton and SmileDirect Club which have really been more IPO no than IPO oh this year.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting. For me, there are a couple of questions here. One, does this tie back to the broader questions that we're asking about private market valuations versus public in a sort of rationalization? Or was this business well enough known that we don't have to have those kinds of fears.</p><p>And the second thing is, this is good news for Hong Kong, too admit 17th weekend of protest that we just saw. Surely, they're still managing to get listings done here.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think to just take that latter part first, definitely very encouraging news in light of the political instability in Hong Kong right now that this offering was just able to get out in the first place.</p><p>As to the question of whether or not this shows that, you know, maybe there's an appetite for companies with no solid financials. And I think it is worth noting that there's a big difference here between a large multinational conglomerate like AB InBev selling off a piece of its business and these private companies that had been you know, given higher valuations probably than they deserve by Silicon Valley than going out and having their day of reckoning on Wall Street.</p><p>So I'm not sure it's totally apples to apples. But yes, it is true that investors obviously like profitability and big brand names, companies like Uber, they have the ladder, the brand name; the profitability, not so much and probably not anytime soon.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I couldn't agree more. Apples to Asian pears in this case. No more questions, I've been told of. I've got to move on. Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Let's move on. There's turbulence for Airbus coming back. The WTO expected to approve a record U.S. tariff here, retaliation for aircraft subsidies. Anna Stewart joins us and Anna, you've been covering this story for a while. What can we expect in terms of the fine that we're looking at, a record potentially from the WTO here?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Yes, okay, so the broadband for that number is expected between $5 billion and $8 billion. Most reports putting it at $7.5 billion. We'll see whether that's correct.</p><p>Once we get the number of course, the next question is, will the U.S. administration immediately announce tariffs in new European goods, and what will they include because they already drafted up a potential list on $25 billion, a much more substantial. That would include everything from French wine, Italian cheese, cashmere, you name it.</p><p>I would expect any tariffs of course to have planes, plane parts front and center because this is about Airbus and Boeing as well, that dispute.</p><p>Of course, the CCO of Airbus recently told us though, that any tariffs that are on them will end up hurting America. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTIAN SCHERER, CHIEF COMMERCIAL OFFICER, AIRBUS: Tariffs will be a hurdle for us in the beginning, then it will have ripple effects on the supply chain. And I'd like to point out that 40 percent of what we procure comes from the United States.</p><p>So if Airbus is facing an impediment to doing business in the U.S., there will be an immediate negative effect on the U.S. aerospace industry, not to mention the effect of higher aircraft prices and ticket prices affecting the consumer and therefore, the whole economic activity of this sector in the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:15:00]</p><p>STEWART: He did go on to say that he thinks this is all posturing and that it will bring both sides to the negotiating table, he was looking at the U.S. and China in their trade dispute. It doesn't look so good.</p><p>Of course, if the E.U. wants to retaliate and they've got the separate Boeing ruling, that won't come too early next year, so they won't know what they can potentially tariff back in retaliation. It is a long running dispute, it could be heading up for negotiation, Julia. It could be heading up for more tit-for-tat. We really don't know at this stage. But that number between $5 billion and $8 billion is expected shortly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. And we are waiting to see that in eight months' time whether the WTO says that Boeing has been subsidized as well under and that the E.U. can respond in kind. We'll see. Anna Stuart, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we're following around the world.</p><p>Dozens of world leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin have been in Paris for the funeral, a former French President Jacques Chirac.

As the leader of Saudi Arabia, he say he takes full responsibility though. The \"Washington Post\" journalist was brutally murdered and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey a year ago. Here is what bin Salman told CBS News.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NORAH O'DONNELL, CBS EVENING NEWS ANCHOR: Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?</p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN AL SAUD, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA (through translator): Absolutely not. This was a heinous crime. But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.</p><p>O'DONNELL: What does that mean that you take responsibility?</p><p>BIN SALMAN (through translator): When a crime is committed against a Saudi citizen by officials working for the Saudi government, as a leader I must take responsibility. This was a mistake and I must take all actions to avoid such a thing in the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: To Hong Kong now where protests turn violent on Sunday as the city prepares for more demonstrations on China's National Day.</p><p>Some protesters threw petrol bombs as local police deployed water cannon and tear gas.

Stay with us.</p><p>[09:20:55]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and a look once again at our top story. The impeachment crisis brewing in Washington, D.C. Our next guest believes the odds of an impeachment in the House have climbed above 50 percent. Meanwhile, the probability of a China-U.S. trade deal has slipped below 50 percent.</p><p>Greg Valliere joins me now. He is Chief U.S. strategist at AGF Investments. Greg, fantastic to have you on the show. Let's start with impeachment first, a probability above 50 percent of A House impeachment. Explain why you believe that, and then I'll ask you why it could be an exercise in futility here if the Senate isn't on board, too?</p><p>GREG VALLIERE, CHIEF U.S. STRATEGIST AGF INVESTMENTS: Well, I have to say, Julia, that the last three or four days have been devastating for the white house because there's a new element to the story and that's a possible cover up.</p><p>You need 218 votes in the House and I think the Democrats have 215 to 216. I think when the vote comes probably right around Christmas, there will be the 218 in the House to impeach or indict. The words are interchangeable. As you point out, the big story is in the Senate.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And the big story there, it seems at least today is that there simply aren't enough Republicans that are going to turn against the President to impeach him.</p><p>So I think for our international audience, they going, is this simply just a lot of sound and noise and distraction, actually, for the Democrats. And the only way to remove the President is to win an election in 2020.</p><p>VALLIERE: Well, you're absolutely right in that there's a rhetorical issue here and that people hear the word impeachment and they think that means he is out if the House impeaches.</p><p>The real story is would the Senate convict or acquit after a trial. I'm not even sure Mitch McConnell will allow a trial. But if there is one, I still think the odds favor acquittal with Trump not being ousted if people want him gone, they've got to vote him out.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What about the Senate then here? Is there anything that may come from the whistleblower's account that could change the minds here of enough senators to make them go, you know what, actually the Republican Party, the country is better off without the President here.</p><p>VALLIERE: You know, it's not out of the question. I think as of this morning, maybe there's three, four or five Republicans who might consider voting to convict. But I think we've got to see what the whistleblower has. Are there tapes? What about trust meetings with Vladimir Putin and others? Is there really a cover up? A lot of talk about a cover up. Has there been obstruction of justice?</p><p>So there are issues that could all come together to make the Senate vote closer, but as of right now, I still think the smart bet is that he gets acquitted in the Senate.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You it's interesting, public sentiment, it seems has shifted with people looking at this and saying perhaps pushing for impeachment here is a good idea. What's the risk? And given that you're talking probabilities, how high is the probability here that this backfires on the Democrats, and it backfires on Joe Biden too, because the Republicans don't let the noise surrounding Ukraine die down?</p><p>VALLIERE: Well, Washington is a city that is addicted to the polls. And I do think that the polls will be pivotal in this entire story. Right now over the weekend, the polls have gone up a little, people wanting maybe to at least have a hearing of all of these issues.</p><p>But I still think the country is averse to going through the trauma of a long drawn out trial. I don't think anyone wants to see that. Certainly not the markets for all of next year.</p><p>So I think that the polls right now are still another reason why the Senate would probably vote to acquit.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And very quickly, Greg, I have about 30 seconds, why slipping chances of the U.S.-China trade deal here now below 50 percent in your mind?</p><p>[09:25:00]</p><p>VALLIERE: Two or three things very quickly. On Friday, the White House had an absurd leak that they might try to stop U.S. companies from investing in China. But what a negative story that is.</p><p>Hong Kong if China has to crush the insurrection, that's not going to help the trade talks. But most importantly, the Chinese read the polls, and they know that impeachment is now in the air. Might they want to wait until after the election and to see if Trump is still around?</p><p>If Trump is not around, I think the Chinese might think they could get a better deal with someone else.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such a great point. Mr. Peter Navarro called that rumor fake news this morning on CNBC, but your broader point is very valid. Greg, fantastic to have you on as always. Greg Valliere there.</p><p>VALLIERE: Great, you bet.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you. All right. The outgoing head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde warning about the economic costs of the impeachment distraction here in D.C., but she did have to say, steer clear of politics. Listen to what she had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTINE LEGARDE, OUTGOING MANAGING DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND: You know, I lived through Watergate, and I was actually working on the Hill as a little intern of a Member of the House Judiciary Committee, Bill Cohen. And I could see in those days, how much energy, focus, brainpower was actually spent on the Watergate issues.</p><p>If this is going to be the same again, I can only imagine how much more energy, brainpower and focus there will be on those purely political issues, which will be a complete distraction from focusing on the economy, producing values, the wellbeing of people.</p><p>I respect what is going on, and I have no opinion and no view because I'm not an American. But from an economic point of view, and from the global economic point of view, it could very well create massive disruption, and I think it would undermine the U.S. leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: A great interview with Richard coming up this evening on \"Quest Means Business.\" It's about her tenure at the IMF, and her new role as President of the ECB, eight o'clock, London time. 3:00 p.m. Eastern, nine o'clock Frankfurt. Plenty more to come in the market open, next.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the New York Stock Exchange here and the opening bell for the first session of the week this Monday.</p><p>A slightly higher open for U.S. markets. We were anticipating that taking back some of the losses that we saw in Friday's session helping us along with that, that U.S. Treasury statement saying that there were no immediate plans to restrict access to Chinese companies listing here on the U.S. markets when Pete Navarro was asked earlier on CNBC of any plans to delist Chinese companies that have already listed here in the United States. He called it fake news.</p><p>But obviously that creating some caution on Friday. We'll talk about that more in the show. But China has warned decoupling the United States here would harm both sides. It's a message that they've reiterated often here. High level talks on those trade deal or hopes for a trade deal set to resume next week.</p><p>In the session today though, keep an eye on retailers. We were discussing earlier about Forever 21 filing for bankruptcy here in the United States, a victim of among many things here, changing consumer tastes and a shift to e-commerce.</p><p>Forever 21 has a presence in malls owned by Majid Al Futtaim Group, which has a huge footprint across the Middle East, Africa and Asia with shopping malls, cinemas and leisure facilities, too.</p><p>The company also boasts over three and a half thousand hotel rooms and the franchise for at least 280 Carrefour supermarkets and hypermarkets across 15 different countries.</p><p>And I'm glad to say, our next guest is the CEO, Alain G. Bejjani. Sir, fantastic to have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us. Unfortunately, Forever 21, an illustration, as I mentioned about some of the challenges that your business faces with the changing consumer taste, a growing presence in e-commerce versus customers coming to shopping malls and shopping there. Talk to me about what you're seeing and how you're dealing with that.</p><p>ALAIN G. BEJJANI, CEO, MAJID AL FUTTAIM HOLDING: Thank you for having me. Well, effectively, there is a change in channel that's becoming more and more important and we are seeing that customers are favoring more experience over product and price. So we are going to see these kinds of situations. This is not the first time that we have a global retailer that goes into this situation.</p><p>But in reality, the retail sector in the GCC is going to grow up to $308 billion between now and 2023, so there is still a lot of demand. But this demand has to be underlined by a very strong customer experience. And of course, a great omni-channel experience as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know it is interesting when I look at -- if we look at specifically the retail part of your business, how much of that and what proportion is driven by domestic spending versus tourism, which is also surely key?</p><p>BEJJANI: When you look at -- when you look at the region, most of it is domestic tourism driven and our business across the 15 countries, our brand is primarily there to cater for the local customers.</p><p>This being said, markets like Dubai and the UAE primarily have a big tourism impact, that's for sure. But this does not -- it does not exceed something like 15 to 20 percent depending on the locations.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Because I think a lot of people, particularly if we're talking about the Middle East here, look at the noise level right now, the escalation in tensions between the United States and Iran in particular here. I just wonder what kind of dampening effect that is also having on consumer appetites and spending here versus the broader challenges that we've talked about, which is structural shifts here in retail.</p><p>BEJJANI: Consumer confidence had been impacted negatively in the past three to four years. I think currently the regional instability, the volatility that we're seeing globally, the trade wars and so on are also taking a toll on consumer sentiment.</p><p>But we also have to remember that the Middle East at large is a very young population, more than 50 percent of the population is below 25 years old. The internet penetration is very high. The mobile penetration is very high.</p><p>So modern lifestyle is something that every customer across the countries that we operate in want and wants more and more over time, too. We are seeing a big shift towards modern trade and this is good news.</p><p>This being said we'll have to overcome a negative consumer sentiment in the region. We hope that in the coming year, we would see more clarity and the current tensions between Iran and the rest of the world will actually come to basically some kind of a solution.</p><p>[09:35:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I think many would agree with you, sir. I want to talk about the good news here, which is the growth regions and you point to Saudi Arabia, you point to opportunities in in Egypt. I want to start with the first one and talk about what you're doing in in Saudi Arabia in particular and the shift that we've seen in the last year with access now to cinemas because I know this is something where you're ramping up investment. Talk us through what you're doing there.</p><p>BEJJANI: Absolutely. So Saudi Arabia has been on this path of liberalization opening up the country. And I think we just heard in the past few days, the new tourism, sorry, the new visa program that will boost inbound tourism into Saudi Arabia, that's very important.</p><p>So we have been -- we have been in Saudi Arabia for more than a decade in different businesses, but the latest I would say addition is VOX Cinema. So we introduced our cinemas into Saudi Arabia with the lifting of the ban a year and a half ago.</p><p>And today we are leading the Saudi cinema sector, and we're also developing local content, and this is something that has been extremely well received by the population. In addition, of course, with the liberalization of the woman condition, and basically bringing and making some historical decisions that aren't anywhere else in the world, I would say the basics of what it should be.</p><p>So we are very happy that Saudi Arabia is still a great story that needs to be told. I think there is more and more efforts that are being put in order to drive this narrative.</p><p>Cinemas in Saudi Arabia are doing fantastically well. There is a lot of runway for that and we are extremely engaged on that side. But if we look also across the region, Egypt is another great story. Egypt is developing well. It is growing well in the past year and a half after difficult times it went through.</p><p>I think the reforms in both Egypt and Saudi Arabia were extremely welcomed, and they have been dealing with some structural issues to a large extent. We hope to see more of that. And we're seeing that the Egyptian population is responding very well.</p><p>And I think Saudi Arabia is going to go better and better, unless something I would say, something on the geopolitics comes and changes the characteristic.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's great to hear about the growth stories in addition to the challenges here. Sir, fantastic to have you on FIRST MOVE this morning. And please come back and talk to us again. Alain G. Bejjani there, the CEO of Majid Al Futtaim Group. All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE. Plenty more to come. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:40:54]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. The Trump administration says there are no current plans to delist Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. Three major Chinese stocks listed in New York -- Alibaba, jd.com and Baidu rebounding this morning. As you can see after plunging on Friday where report said that the White House was considering action to limit U.S. investment in China. Trump Trade adviser, Pete Navarro is now slamming those reports as fake news.</p><p>And more than 160 companies listed on the U.S. exchanges are Chinese with upwards of $1 trillion worth of market cap. So talk of delisting put the markets on edge clearly, and understandably.</p><p>But my next guest says nothing imminent. So let's understand what's going on. Leland Miller is the expert on China's financial system. He is the CEO of China Beige Book. I tell you what, you're a lot more of an expert than that, quite frankly. But we'll move on.</p><p>Talk me through what is fact from fiction here because for those reasons, people were cautious, but we need to what's going on here or not going on more importantly.</p><p>LELAND MILLER, CEO, CHINA BEIGE BOOK: Well, as the U.S. and China have a trade war and have broader tensions that are devolving. Right now, the White House is evaluating all different types of things, what will happen in a best case scenario, worst case scenario. Some of those are being conflated right now into being one big nuclear option against China.</p><p>So you're talking about the idea of delisting Chinese companies if they don't adhere to certain regulatory standards. And then separately, you're talking about whether U.S. pension money, for instance, should be prohibited from being sent abroad to Chinese companies, because you don't know what they're being dumped into.</p><p>These are all questions that it's fair to evaluate. Some are very big deals and some are not so big deals, and it's all being sort of pushed into Trump White House looking to go crazy on China.</p><p>And so I think it's worth sort of carving these things into what's really going on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Just bad reporting, quite frankly, because we need to understand here, and we've talked about it on this show a number of times. If you're simply looking at U.S. investors of whatever kind, investing in Chinese companies, you want to know that those companies are following the same kind of financial systems, rules, regulations that U.S. companies are, otherwise you could be investing and your money is at risk.</p><p>These are fair questions to be asking at this stage. That's very different from saying whoever is listed on these exchanges is certainly going to be thrown off.</p><p>MILLER: That's exactly right. So if you're a Walmart, you have to subject yourself to audits by Peekaboo. It's the public company accounting oversight board, and you have to adhere to certain regulatory standards.</p><p>Now, if you're a Chinese firm on one of these U.S. exchanges, theoretically you have to do that. But what's happened over the past decade almost is you've had China simply say, no, no, we're not going to let you look at our books and U.S. administrations have said well, okay, well, we want Chinese money. We want Chinese -- we want Chinese capital. We want Chinese companies on our exchanges. We're just going to look the other way.</p><p>And what's happening right now is people looking at this issue and saying, why in the world? Are we getting these Chinese companies many of which are fraudulent, many of which are good companies, but many of which are fraudulent. Why are we allowing potential U.S. investors and pensions to be susceptible to just going down this black hole, despite the fact that it looks like they have the imprimatur of the SEC and the U.S. administration. So it's a problem.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How far away from actual policy on any of these things do you think we are?</p><p>MILLER: Well, there have been a number of bills that have gone through Congress. They're, being talked about a lot right now on Capitol Hill that could put something like this into play on delisting side in the not distant future.</p><p>But then you have long face-its and then you have time for a negotiation period, then you have time for the enforcement to start. This would be years before Chinese companies would actually feel the true compulsion to move.</p><p>Now that doesn't mean that China right now isn't sweating and looking to do secondary listings in Hong Kong in order to hedge their bets, but none of this stuff is eminent.</p><p>The other side of this whether you prohibit pension money from being invested abroad, much bigger deal that is not imminent at all. It could if you saw the second Trump term and things devolved and trade deal is off, you could go to a separate land. Right now, none of these things are going to happen.</p><p>[09:45:16]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You said China is sweating. Chinese companies sweating or China itself sweating? Beijing sweating? Because I can't help but feel that the Chinese government here would be like, you know what, we've just opened a big tech exchange in Shanghai. Hong Kong is the option; admittedly, there's a bit of turmoil there right now. But AB InBev's Asia unit proved you could still list there. They'd welcome those companies back with open arms, surely.</p><p>MILLER: Yes, some of them. So if you're Alibaba, they want to list in Hong Kong and they'll be able to do it. People want to invest in those companies.</p><p>All of these companies, though, you've got a lot of companies that can do this. You're talking about hundreds of companies.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>MILLER: Chinese companies that would be subject to having to delist and do the expensive process of figuring out how to list somewhere else, and basically, the champions wouldn't have a hard time with this, but a lot of the middle end companies, which is most of them would have a pretty difficult time.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Because it means money.</p><p>MILLER: Lots of money.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You've got to have people willing to give you money as well. And that's perhaps not such an easy question. Trade deal prospects? Hurt by this?</p><p>MILLER: No, because I think what everyone is realizing right now is the Trump administration wants a deal. They don't -- they want -- they would like at least a baby deal going into the end of the year.</p><p>But right now, the Chinese are shut down for national day, you're not having the back and forth. But the amusing thing about this was we were talking to clients on Friday, and everyone was saying, has China -- you know, China will be shut down? Is this an escalation?</p><p>No, because what's happening behind the scenes is actually a lot of interaction between the two sides trying to get to some sort of smaller deal and a ramp up a Ag purchases, and possibly pull back on tariffs, pause on tariffs, all kinds of new stuff. So this is going in a very different direction behind the scenes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When the ultimate China hawk, Pete Navarro goes on air on a morning like this to say it's fake news. To me, that tells you something, too.</p><p>MILLER: I think they got some pushback on this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Always great to have you on the show.</p><p>MILLER: A pleasure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Leland Miller, CEO of China Beige Book International. And you have a great report out, which we will get you back on to discuss, but we've dealt with that for now.</p><p>All right. Well, there's not been an apparent light bulb moment just yet on the U.S.-China trade deal. But I do want to talk to you about electricity.</p><p>When the lights go out, most of us simply flick a switch to restore power, but an American engineer has invented something that will make this process even faster.</p><p>Behold, the digital breaker as John Defterios reports on this week's \"Global Energy Challenge.\" Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TEXT: The Global Energy Challenge.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: On this edition of \"The Global Energy Challenge,\" how an American company's invention can help modernize our old power systems.</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): More than a century ago, Thomas Edison received the first patent for the circuit breaker, which was later improved by Granville Woods. Now, Adam Power in North Carolina has radically upgraded the technology for a digital age.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN KENNEDY, CEO, ADAM POWER: If there's a problem on this 30-amp circuit breaker, it will trip open and then to reclose it, you've got to go manually reclose it. It's just like a light switch.</p><p>Here, this is what's coming next. A circuit breaker that you can remotely control through software. And you can actually shed, load and manage the energy in your facility all remotely, preprogrammed. If we have a short circuit in the field like actually at the location. Because of this art flash, it means an explosion of electrical plasma.</p><p>A solid circuit breaker like this actually opens the circuit about 3,000 times faster than circuit breakers do today. And that speed is key to ensuring that you can actually stop that arc, stop that short circuit before it actually propagates into the system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): These efficiencies and safety features are key to multiple source energy distribution.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: If you put something like solar onto the same source as your utility or energy storage or another renewable source, they have to sync up. Which means if they don't, then you can have a fire.

And a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Africa's top smartphone maker, Transsion made its market debut in Shanghai soaring as much as 96 percent before closing up 64 percent, so it gave back a little bit. Transsion sells nearly half of all mobile phones sold in Africa. The IPO is the second largest for Shanghai's NASDAQ-style star market. We were just talking about that.</p><p>Bob Iger says Disney is moving aggressively into the busy streaming market and argues there's nothing out there like his $7.00 a month streaming service. Christiane Amanpour put him on the spot and asked him, why bother?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: So Disney Plus, the streaming device is set to launch in November and there's plenty other out there, right? There's NBC Universal, there's Netflix, obviously and Amazon. Some people might say the field is a bit crowded, you may be a bit late to this, what do you hope for Disney Plus? And what do you say to you know, your chances there now?</p><p>BOB IGER, CEO, DISNEY: Well, it's a really interesting time in the media business today when people are accessing media or consuming media in many different ways than they used to, buying it and watching it.</p><p>And it's important, as I mentioned earlier, I talked earlier about being relevant. It is important to be relevant to be front and center in terms of modern relevant platforms, and basically the most advanced ways for people to access their content. So this is clearly a bold move. I mean, an aggressive move in that direction.</p><p>We have the benefit of these phenomenal brands at the company, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars; now, National Geographic through our acquisition of 21st Century Fox. And so what we're doing is we're creating a service to the United States. It will be for $6.99 a month called Disney Plus that will feature those five brands, and both library products made by all of those brands from the past and original products made by those creative engines or brands. There's nothing like it out there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And you can watch the full interview on \"Amanpour\" today at 6:00 p.m. London time, 7:00 p.m. in Berlin.</p><p>Now, shoot for the stars and you may land on Mars. Elon Musk's plan to colonize Mars maybe closer to reality. He told our Rachel Crane, it could even be as soon as next year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, SPACEX: If the development continues to improve exponentially, then I think we could -- we could be sending people to orbit before the end of next year. You know, within a year, approximately.</p><p>RACHEL CRANE, CNN BUSINESS INNOVATION AND SPACE CORRESPONDENT: But SpaceX hasn't put a human in space yet. How are you guys going to do this in a year?</p><p>MUSK: Well, we will be putting people into orbit soon. We will be transporting astronauts for NASA in probably, I don't know three or four months to the Space Station.</p><p>CRANE: Yes, on that point. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted yesterday saying that he was very excited about the event today but he also said quote, \"Commercial crew is years behind schedule and it's time to deliver.\" Did you take that --</p><p>MUSK: This is a commercial crew SOS.</p><p>CRANE: It is a commercial --</p><p>MUSK: Oh, okay.</p><p>CRANE: Interchangeable. No, but how do you respond to that? And did you take that as a dig?</p><p>[09:55:06]</p><p>MUSK: Well, I mean, first of all everything in aerospace is light years behind, okay. It is really a question of relatively speaking which one is more late, so the hardware for the -- how to board demonstration for Crew Dragon, it will be there in October. The hardware for the first crew flight will be there in November.</p><p>And so most of the work that is required from now through flight of NASA astronauts is a long series of safety reviews, so it's not really hardware related. And it's really going as fast as we can make it go.</p><p>If there's some way just to make it go faster, I would make it go faster.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That was quite cute. Musk says the starship rocket will cost a lot less than initially expected. But for those of you dreaming to go to the Red Planet, your air ticket will still set you back $200,000.00. Get in line behind me, my friends.</p><p>All right, that's it for the show. I'm Julia Chatterley. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours.

I'm Bianca Nobilo, live in London. And this is CNNNewsroom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ahead this hour. Siding with Saudi Arabia. Donald Trump suggest the kingdom won't be punished for the killing of American journalist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, U.S. stocks take another tumble. All of the gains made on Wall Street this year have been erased.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And crews are finally getting control of wildfires burning in California. But a new threat may be just around the corner. </p><p>It's been more than two years since Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton for the U.S. presidency. But apparently, he can't seem to accept his victory and move on.</p><p>The New York Times reports Mr. Trump wanted the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton and FBI director James Comey. But the White House counsel warned him against it, telling the president it could lead to his impeachment. </p><p>A source tells CNN that Mr. Trump has repeatedly asked for updates on investigations into Clinton. </p><p>And Mr. Trump appears satisfied with Saudi Arabia's explanation of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. He issued a statement signaling he would not take strong action against Riyadh for Khashoggi's death. </p><p>The CIA believes Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the journalist killing at the consulate in Istanbul. The president is defying intense pressure from U.S. lawmakers to impose stronger sanctions. He insists the CIA did not reach a definitive conclusion and the truth may never be known. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They didn't make a determination. And it's just like I said, I think it was very -- maybe he did it, and maybe he didn't. They did not make that assessment. The CIA has looked at it. They've studied it a lot. They have nothing definitive. And the fact is, maybe he did, maybe he didn't. (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NOBILO:  Let's go now to Jomana Karadsheh in Istanbul with the latest. Jomana, President Trump saying maybe he did, or maybe he didn't, referring to the crown prince's knowledge of the killing. How are those remarks likely to be received across the region? </p><p>JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, Bianca, I don't think it's going to be much of a surprise the president's stance. I think he's made it very cheer from day one that his priority here as he mentioned is America. </p><p>First his relationship with Saudi Arabia, that he's described as a spectacular ally. But I think that statement, the way it was written, the way it was delivered, that has really had some people very surprised in this region. </p><p>We're talking about a very polarized and divided region. So, you are going to get different reactions. You've got some countries that are in the Saudi camp. And they will be pretty pleased with this reaction from the United States. This stance from the president. </p><p>There are other countries in the region, Bianca, other U.S. allies that will be probably be very concerned and very worried about this reaction, whether it is Turkey, a NATO ally, that saw this incident, the killing of Jamal Khashoggi on its soil, while it took place at the consulate they said this took place on their territory. </p><p>You know, they see this as a violation of Turkey sovereignty, a NATO ally that was hoping that other countries, especially the United States, would take a stronger stance and make sure that this doesn't happen again. </p><p>And then, you've got other countries, for example, Qatar. I'm pretty sure they will not be very pleased to see this kind of reaction from the United States. Some countries that were hoping that, perhaps, this would be a defining moment. This is the moment where the United States will draw a line. </p><p>They have been concerned about what some would see as this reckless leadership of the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his policies in the region. </p><p>So, you know, the feeling was maybe the United States, an international community, to an extent, was turning a blind eye to some of the actions of the Saudis in the region. And they had hope that maybe perhaps this would be the moment where it will all change but that this not happen clearly.</p><p>And you know what, Bianca, it's not just about these countries. It is also about individuals. It's about people. Over the past few weeks since the killing of Jamal Khashoggi I've spoken to activists and dissidents, opposition figures in this region who will tell you that it was never easy to be critical of governments in this part of the world. They've always felt that their life is in danger.  [03:04:58] But with the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, they say they fear for their lives even more right now. And they were saying that unless the international community, especially the United States, holds the Saudis accountable for that killing, they fear that there will be many more Jamals. Bianca? </p><p>NOBILO:  Jomana, thank you for your reporting. Jomana Karadsheh for us in Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>Well, for more now on the implications of this, Kate Andrews joins us. She's a political columnist for City A.M. Thank you for being here, Kate. </p><p>KATE ANDREWS, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, CITY AM:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>NOBILO:  Now you know your economics. And the president has said quite explicitly here, that the tradeoff he is making in his mind is the fact that any strain on the relationship with Saudi Arabia would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Do you think it's unusual for an American president to be explicit about that kind of transactional thinking? </p><p>ANDREWS:  Yes, I actually do. Now a lot of Americans have always felt quite uncomfortable with our relationship with Saudi Arabia. It does feel very tactical. We want to have allies in the region, especially with countries like Iran which are becoming more aggressive over the years. </p><p>However, no U.S. president in my knowledge so far has come out and said, basically, we're going to turn a blind eye to what our own intelligence agencies are telling us about a murder because we value the investment because we value these American jobs. </p><p>I think as horrible as I found Donald Trump's comments, I think they're timely. I think it's important that Americans do recognize the trade-off that goes on with Saudi Arabia. I think it is one of our biggest hypocrisies actually. </p><p>And we are a country that claims to stand up for human rights within our own country and around the world. And yet, we do turn a blind eye on so many different occasions. Not simply to this horrific murder but to the treatment of women and minorities in places like Saudi Arabia. </p><p>Perhaps more people will look up and say actually the president is being honest about our relationship with Saudi Arabia and maybe we should take a stand. </p><p>NOBILO:  And speaking of areas where the president certainly doesn't turn a blind eye, these are reports that the president was trying to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey. What do you make of them? </p><p>ANDREWS:  Well, to speak of human rights, I mean, in America, we don't bully our political foes. And to try to implicate somebody who you have been running against in a Democratic election after the fact is quite worrying.  Now I think for Donald Trump, he knows that when Hillary Clinton is being investigated, that plays to his base. He knows I think that certainly that did help him during the 2016 election when Comey re- open that case against her and her e-mail server. He got a bump in the polls. </p><p>So, I don't think there's any question that, you know, from his own tactical point of view, he would like to see further investigation. I think he's a bad winner. I think he's, as you said before when you were introducing us on CNN, he is still struggling to accept the fact that he won. that this isn't a campaign against her anymore. </p><p>NOBILO:  And now, if you could explain to our international viewers as well why the U.S. Justice Department would regard those actions in particular of the president as a potential abuse of power. </p><p>ANDREWS:  So, you know, when you are approaching the deputy attorney general suggesting that somebody who you just beat in a Democratic election should then possibly see prison time, you are going into very, very murky territory. </p><p>Now, you know, that nobody should be above the law. And there were legitimate questions around the 2016 campaign with both candidates if some of their actions should be investigated. And I'm not opposed to that in the slightest. But at the end of the say Donald Trump is president. It is his actions that need to be the most accountable. </p><p>And to be spending his political capital on potentially trying to put his political opponent behind bars is certainly not where you want the president be channeling his efforts. </p><p>NOBILO:  And also, lots of news coming out of the White House, as we--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ANDREWS:  Around the e-mails. </p><p>NOBILO:  -- we expected. </p><p>ANDREWS:  Yes.</p><p>NOBILO:  So, what, again, what do you make of this story? So, Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, reportedly using her personal e-mail account for business. Explain why that's precarious for somebody in her position. And are the Democrats justified in their resistance to that and their intention to investigate? </p><p>ANDREWS:  It's remarkable that a president who ran half of his campaign on the fact that Hillary Clinton had this private e-mail server, was sending work e-mails from a private account, could then be in a position where, not just his daughter, but someone who is a very senior member of his team, has e-mails on her private account. </p><p>There are differences. The reason that they were so able to easily find Ivanka's e-mails is because she didn't have them on a private server in her basement in her own private compound. There are differences. </p><p>But the big concern here is that legally, you're not supposed to have these kinds of documents on your personal e-mail or your personal computer. They are sensitive. They could potentially be classified information. So that can be a threat to American security. </p><p>But also, we have mid-level managers in government getting jail time or being fined for far less explicitly bad circumstances in which they have accidentally put a work e-mail on their private phone or taking something out of the office. And so, it feels like there's a two-tier system here for both the Hillary Clintons and the Ivankas of the world, and then everybody else. </p><p>NOBILO:  Kate Andrews, it's always lovely to talk to you. Thank you for panning over with the politics with us. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>[03:10:00] ANDREWS:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>NOBILO:  Now, the trading day is just getting started in the financial capitals of Europe. Stocks in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Zurich are all looking to rebound from losses on Tuesday. Still a bit early to get a sense of direction for today. </p><p>Markets in Tokyo and Seoul were lower but not by too much. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai composite managed modest gains. </p><p>On Wall Street, the Dow dropped more than 550 points Tuesday, wiping out all its gains for the year. Big tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix have been a drag on the NASDAQ, too. Retailers including Target and Kohl's pulled the S&amp;P lower.  </p><p>Let's head to Abu Dhabi now. And CNN's Emerging Markets editor, John Defterios. Now, John, it seems that the market all around the world having some fairly shaky days. What's driving that kind of nervous sentiment?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Well, it's being led by Wall Street. There's no doubt about that, Bianca. We've seen this washout on Wall Street on the last two months of trading. And the big question is, how much do we need to see further selling before we correct after years of gains. </p><p>Looking at that Dow Industrial correction. We were down better than 600 points. But still with the loss of 550 points, it's pretty messy. The S&amp;P 500, the broader index of the technology companies of the United States is now down 10 percent from the September highs. </p><p>Let's bring up the Asian screen. I thought this was interesting that we saw Hong Kong and Shanghai moving higher despite the U.S. trade pressure against China right now. Tokyo and South Korea are down slightly. And that was the wider trend, down slightly throughout Asia but not bad considering what we saw. </p><p>In the introduction there you talked about the technology sell off and this is a predominant theme, but it actually has a spillover effect for economies like China and stretch it down to Southeast Asia in Thailand, the so-called supply chain. </p><p>The retailers again are bad sign for the manufacturers of China and there are worries here going into 2019 that the growth is going to be slowing down even for a Christmas buying season of 2018 that the U.S. economy slowing down. </p><p>The final leg of this I think are the financials themselves. Once again, we have President Trump leaning on the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central banks saying this is a worry for us, with the Federal Reserve still moving interest rates higher. This puts a lot of pressure on the emerging market currencies around the world and pressure on the stock markets, as well. </p><p>So, it's constantly a moving game here. And the U.S. president, keeping the trade pressure on China and also on the Federal Reserve, which keeps investors very nervous with the valuation we've seen on Wall Street for the last 24 months. </p><p>NOBILO:  And John, there is also some big political risks which are driving markets. Talk to us through those. </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  You know, Bianca, I think we're downplaying a story that you're glued on. I'm saying downplaying the financial risks because of Brexit and what's happening on Downing Street. Or shall I say what's not happening on Downing Street because we don't have clarity. </p><p>This is not only bad for the U.K. economy and the U.K. markets but also for continental Europe as well. This could send a shock wave right through the heart of Europe. I'm thinking of France and Germany. The second what we should consider here and this is not playing out in the markets that we see in the early trading as they're starting to recovery is Italy.</p><p>I mean, again, we talk about the political challenges of Italy but the $2 trillion risk with the rest of Europe. So, you could have kind of two columns going lower or getting rattled in 2019. That would be the U.K. and Italy. Those are risks that we have to watch right now. </p><p>I talked about the China trade risk. Now the other one here is the risk of oil. Donald Trump when he gave the support to Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and broadly for the king, King Salman, as well, he thanked Saudi Arabia for not taking action on oil. Actually, providing oil for the last six months but kind of a very strong hint, don't think about cutting oil as a quid pro quo for my support for you. </p><p>So, this is going to make the December 6th, 7th meeting of OPEC very interesting in Vienna. I bring it up as we saw a sharp selloff of 6 to 8 percent at different times during the day for oil prices. </p><p>Donald Trump wants to keep them lower to extend the economic cycle United States, Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf countries where I'm sitting here would like to see a slightly higher. They want to go through the selling price of 2015 and '16 again. And we're looking down the road, Bianca, once again in 2019 drop in demand would mean downward pressure on oil prices.</p><p>NOBILO:  John, thank you as ever for your reporting. John Defterios for us in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Now, I'm joined by Vicky Pryce, she's an economist at the Centre for Economic and Business Research and author of the book, \"Economics.\" Vicky, thank you for being with us again.</p><p>Now, John in Abu Dhabi was just mentioning Brexit and the risk that are facing European markets. Let's talk a bit more about that because we are in London. I was freezing at Downing Street yesterday. It seemed that.</p><p>[03:15:02] Now the prime minister heading to Brussels today for meetings with Juncker. How much is riding in terms of the markets in the U.K. and in Europe on getting a deal this week on signing this off?</p><p>VICKY PRYCE, ECONOMIST, CENTRE FOR ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS RESEARCH: Well, it's very interesting because when a withdrawal agreement came back supposedly, you know, with the full acceptance of the E.U. 27 and other negotiators in the U.K. that the markets seemed to be reasonably happy. That at least there were some progress and of course, the pound recovered a little bit, and then of course everything went wrong. </p><p>Given that we had so many resignations from the cabinets and also for the downing terms of other ministers. I supposed the challenge for Theresa May's leadership. </p><p>So, there could be a vote of confidence already but in fact, it hasn't quite materialized. So, in a way, Theresa May has survived and she is going back. And what she hopes to do in a summit this coming Sunday is actually sign that agreement, with all the details being sorted out now because there is a political agreement too. </p><p>It's not just the withdraw agreement, which sets out the terms of the English with which we're leaving the E.U., in terms of how much we have to pay. What happens to E.U. citizens here and what happens to U.K. citizens abroad. And of course, very significantly, the Northern Ireland border which has been an issue.</p><p>Now, she may indeed sign that, once we get a little more information of what this -- why the political agreement for the future says because it's been attached to this. So, there's a withdraw agreement and there is a sort of political statement, in terms of what may happen in the future, in no way binding. </p><p>So, she could sign that. Everything, you know, from her side might work out. She would still be prime minister certainly by Sunday. But then, the question is, does she get it through parliament. And that is what is worrying the Europeans who are already saying, that maybe we've given too many concessions to the U.K. </p><p>So, they're not all terribly, terribly happy about this. But it's been a compromise of business for the moment, it seems to have been quite happy to accept.  NOBILO:  And presumably, a lot of this instability was price in. </p><p>PRYCE:  Up to a point. It changes from day-to-day. Because we don't actually know the exact detail of what the trading arrangement is going to be in the future. </p><p>And even if we get a transition period from, starting from the end of March next year, originally it was just going to be just under two years. We're now talking about possibly extending it to 2022. That suggests there is more uncertainty for businesses on both sides for the U.K. and Europe, and therefore a bit of calm.</p><p>But in reality, there will still need to be so much negotiation during it. And there will be a lot of concern as to whether in fact we might be withdrawing various things that we've agreed to do on paper but not necessarily finding them binding, and therefore accepting them on regulation with the E.U. </p><p>Huge areas which are not covered in any serious details such as the financial services. The service sector generally, which is 80 percent of the U.K. economy. And you look at this and you look at what's going on in Europe right now with the serious slowdown that's taking place in some big countries like Germany, for example, the problems with Italy which we've been hearing a little bit on that as well.</p><p>And basically, when you look at Europe you wonder, do you want to buy stocks, is it actually in entering quiet slow period of growth. The U.K. is not going to grow particularly fast even if there is a proper deal that is signed. </p><p>So, a lot of concern because the markets obviously are going to correct a little bit today or at least they're beginning to look like there might be some correction. </p><p>NOBILO:  Yes.</p><p>PRYCE:  Not a big one. But a lot remains to be seen. I think this week is going to be crucial but for the U.K. and for Europe the next month. Will the deal be approved by parliament? It's going to be very crucial.</p><p>NOBILO:  That is the big question. Vicky Pryce, thank you so much for joining us. </p><p>Still to come on CNNNewsroom. Parts of California already scorched by wildfires may now face heavy rain. And that could mean even more disaster for the state. </p><p>Plus, the global police organization, Interpol, has chosen its new leader. And the choice is quite a surprise. </p><p>[03:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NOBILO:  Welcome back. We're tracking developments in Hong Kong. A U.S. aircraft carrier strike group has arrived. China has blocked a U.S. warship from visiting just two months ago. So, this could be a sign of better ties ahead of next week's G-20 summit. </p><p>CNN's Ivan Watson is on the water of Hong Kong and joins us now with the very latest. Ivan, explain to our viewers exactly where you are, what's going on and why it's so significant. </p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Bianca, I'm giving you a view from a tiny, bobbing motor boat in the harbor of Hong Kong of an American nuclear power supercarrier. Behind me is the USS Ronald Reagan. Now, its presence here is significant because tensions have been ratcheting up in recent months between Beijing and Washington. </p><p>And just two months ago, China refused to allow a port of call from another American warship. There are number of flash points right now, notably, the South China Sea. And that's where the U.S. and Chinese navy's have been shadowing each other because China has claimed -- claim virtually all of that important body of water for itself amid objections from the U.S. government. </p><p>So, this aircraft carrier has just been performing maneuvers there alongside other American warships, two other warships that are also paying a visit to the same Chinese port. </p><p>You also have the trade war being waged between Beijing and Washington and there are some who believe that maybe there is some hope here for ratcheting down the tensions, because on Tuesday, just yesterday, the same vessel welcomed a Chinese delegation, welcomed a senior Chinese military commander aboard its deck which is now bristling with U.S. fighter jets for a visit aboard that.</p><p>[03:24:58] And perhaps that could be interpreted as a sign that both sides are trying to calm down the tensions ahead of a much-anticipated face-to-face meeting between the Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump that is scheduled to take place later this month at the G-20 Summit in Argentina. Bianca?</p><p>NOBILO:  And Ivan, how has this gesture been received where you are by people who can see what's going on? Or by the media? Is it getting a good reception? Is there a goodwill behind trying to soften the relationship? </p><p>WATSON:  I'll just give you the personal reaction. I was pretty surprised when I saw this giant ship, again, bristling with fighter jets, steaming past my apartment window a couple of hours ago. It is being reported in the Hong Kong press. It was front page news here when USS Wasp was denied a port of call here in Hong Kong two months ago. And the media have been invited on board. </p><p>So, this is an example of what the U.S. navy often gauges in, it's kind of naval diplomacy. Ports of call by U.S. warships are a sign that countries that may have a differences of opinion, not always agree, still welcome each other's warships in each other's harbors in each other's ports. </p><p>So, if you are going to use that as a barometer of relations, the fact that this giant floating military, piece of military equipment is being allowed here is a sign perhaps that the Chinese are being a little bit more welcoming of the U.S. navy despite the differences they have in other areas.</p><p>And I'll just remind you that this same ship leading a U.S. naval strike group was operating in the South China Sea, those contested waters just days ago, but now it's being welcomed here in this Chinese harbor. Bianca?</p><p>NOBILO:  Ivan Watson, thank you so much for your reporting. Not every day you see Ivan bobbing off of the coast of Hong Kong in a little boat. </p><p>Still to come on CNNNewsroom, the global police organization, Interpol has chosen its new leader. We're live from Dubai with all the details. </p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNNNEWSROOM ANCHOR:  Welcome back to our viewers in the United States and around the world.  I'm Bianca Nobilo, live in London with a check of the headlines this hour.  Donald Trump apparently wanted the U.S. Justice Department to prosecute Hillary Clinton, but was warned against it by the White House counsel.  A source tells CNN, the President has also repeatedly asked for progress reports on the investigations into his former presidential opponent.  </p><p>U.S. lawmakers are sharply critical of President Donald Trump's loyalty to Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of Jamal Khashoggi's death. The CIA believes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, ordered the killing, but Mr. Trump says maybe the Crown Prince knew about it maybe he didn't.  </p><p>Interpol has just selected South Korea's Kim Jong Yang as its new president after vote in Dubai.  He is to replace the organization's former leader Meng Hongwei, who left after the in mysterious circumstances.  Our Sam Kiley joins us now from Dubai with the very latest.  Sam, you're in Dubai where this election happened.  Talk about us about who Kim Jong Yang, what we know about him and whether or not this was the expected result.  </p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Mr. Kim is the former Vice President of Interpol.  He was before that, a provincial police commissioner as we would understand it in South Korea.  He had broad support, particularly from western countries, who were very anxious, indeed, about the possible election against his rival for the presidency of Interpol and that is 180 nation body that links the police forces of the world effectively.  </p><p>The rival, was coming from Russia, he is a former general in the ministry of the interior, his name, Alexander Prokopchuk, and he was anticipated, according to many, to be likely to take the winning post. To past the post first, but it turns out that Mr. Kim has been elected.  And I think that would mean there is a sigh of relief being breathed.  Not least because of course, Mr. Meng, the Chinese former President of Interpol was arrested on his return home just about six weeks ago, accused of corruption charges.   Interpol, at that time, was itself accused of being pretty (inaudible) in its response to the arrest of his most senior official, really rolling over and accepting the resignation letter from him that they wouldn't be absolutely sure, he had not written under duress.  </p><p>On top of that, of course, there was a concern that if a Russian was elected to the post, that Interpol might be used to chase down the opponents of Vladimir Putin around the world.  There has been some form for that.  The Russians have frequently are trying to use Interpol to issue to what is known as a red notice, falsely described as an international arrest warrant, for opponents of the Putin government.  But, He is going to remain in post.  He is also a Vice President of Interpol.  So he still remains a man of considerable influence in this international police body.  But for now, I think there is a generalized sigh of relief that a well-known, much- respected police bureaucrat, without the potential political agenda is going to have the top job, Bianca.  </p><p>NOBILO:  And Sam, do you think that the concerns over having a Russian official in the top job was quite rampant?  There is a grieved of U.S. senators I believe said it would be like having a Fox in the hen house.  Do you think they were the most influential factor behind this decision?  </p><p>KILEY:  Well, I think that certainly the United States made its views very clear.  So did the United Kingdom.  This is a majority vote among the members in the building behind me, Bianca.  It's not strictly true necessarily at least structurally that the President would be the Fox in charge of the hen house.  Because, when we were speaking to Interpol officials earlier on.  </p><p>[03:35:00] Their spokeswoman saying that actually the President's role is largely ceremonial.  That access to data, which is the most sensitive aspect of this, is controlled by national Interpol offices. And there's no automatic right that a Russian President or a Chinese President or either a British or American President, would be able to do a deep dive into the filing system, if you like, and use that to political ends.  That said, of course, if you are the president of a body, you get to change it, fashion it, select who sits on the committees.  And that certainly would have given Russia, certainly from the western perspective, undue influence inside Interpol, but those fears are now over.  And a populous South Korean candidate has won.  So, Interpol is back certainly from in western perspective in safe hands.  But no doubt, Vladimir Putin maybe excitedly grinding his teeth over this result.  Bianca?  </p><p>NOBILO:  Thanks for your reporting, Sam.  Sam Kiley for us there in Dubai with the latest on Kim Jong Yang being the new Interpol chief.  </p><p>Now, Renault says, Carlos Ghosn remains chairman and CEO.  It wants more information about accusations of financial misconduct against him.  Renault has named an acting CEO to take charge of day-to-day operations while it investigates claims.  CNN's Ana Stewart is following the story for us.  Ana, thank you for joining us early on Saturday.  So, how are investors reacting to all of this news?   ANNA STEWART, CNN PRODUCER:  Interesting, the share price just opened. The European markets are open.  And the share price is slightly higher.  At least the crisis, as we were seeing it, may have stalled. You have to bear in mind, this is a stock that is lost a lot of ground over the last few days.  At one point, yesterday, some two billion Euros was wipe off its market cap.  So yesterday what we had, late last night, and I was here, as well, Bianca, the Renault board men met.  </p><p>They met, they decided they would keep Carlos Ghosn in place as CEO and chairman.  They have an acting CEO in the meantime.  But will it be enough to satisfy the French government?  Now expecting to hear any moment from the French finance minister Bruno Lemaire.  We heard from him yesterday morning, he effectively said yesterday, you have to bear in mind that the French government is the biggest stake holder in Renault in addition to Nissan.  </p><p>And he said yesterday. Carlos Ghosn is not capable of leading the company, at this moment, of course he is under arrest in Japan.  So, hopefully this interim management will be enough to please him.  He was meeting with the management team early this morning.  So we will wait to hear from him.  </p><p>NOBILO:  And so what is the latest on the man himself?  We still have not had any word from him?  </p><p>STEWART:  This is the thing.  We have not heard from Carlos Ghosn.  He is been under arrest since Monday.  Japanese prosecutors have told us what he is accused of.  He and (inaudible) and another director of Nissan accused of collaborating to under report.  Carlos Ghosn SALN by some $44 million.  In addition to that we know that there were numerous significant other acts of misconduct flagged by Nissan themselves.  And there were plenty of other reports from Japanese, NHK about various exotic homes that Nissan provided to Carlos Ghosn, but we have not heard from the man himself yet.  It's a hard story to report on because, frankly, the one person we really want to hear from is silent.  </p><p>NOBILO:  And what is the first that anybody had ever heard about allegations against him?  </p><p>STEWART:  So what has happen, a whistleblower report at Nissan happened several months ago.  Nissan had been investigating this entirely for some several months now.  What surprise (inaudible) even Nissan, in fact that Japanese prosecutors came out with it on Monday and arrested Carlos Ghosn.  Raided his office then and that is when it really fell into media hands.  And I think Nissan have to play very big catch, a very quick press conference Monday.  And now, the board rooms of all three cars in these alliance are having to decide what to do next.  Nissan's CEO proposed they removed Carlos Ghosn as chairman from Nissan.  That board meeting is set to happen tomorrow, but Renault has come to a very different decision.  </p><p>NOBILO:  Anna Stewart, thank you so much for the very latest.  I'll let you go.  So you could watch that press conference.   Still to come on \"CNN Newsroom,\" trapped in a war that they can't escape.  And now a new report says that the children of Yemen are starving to death at an alarming rate.  We'll have more for you right after this.  </p><p>[03:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>NOBILO:  Welcome back.  As firefighters work to contain the two wildfires burning in California, the state may be facing another big problem, heavy rain is in the forecast.  And that could mean that flash flooding and mudslides in the areas that have been scorched. The death toll from the fires now stands at 84.  Many more people are still unaccounted for.  Crews are now racing to find more possible victims before the bad weather strikes.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When the rain comes, what should happen is going to consolidate that material and make it more dense and pack it down. It's going to present mush more like soil. So anything we find or hope to find is still there, is going to be very -- it's going to make a difficult task even that much more difficult.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>NOBILO:  Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera joins us more with the rain finally moving to California.  Ivan, I say finally, but as you were tell me last hour, this is not exactly give them relief, but actually presents new problems.  </p><p>IVAN CABRERA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, you are absolutely right.  As you was mentioning there, I mean the fire without the rainfall is already 75 percent contained.  So really in a way, ironically, we don't want the rain.  The rain is actually going to make things worse. We'll talk about the potential mud flows in a second here.  We've already burn of course, California's worst fire ever, 152,250 acres. And here comes the pacific moisture now, the fire late this season is unusual, this is not we typically we get these storms right off from the Pacific in California and now it is going to come in and it is going to come in hard and heavy as far as the rainfall.  </p><p>We are not juts talking about one day and by the way Day one is today. Day two, and then, day three.  This is a multiday event of very heavy rainfall, we have the string of moisture just right on top of northern California.  As far as the rainfall tallies, when all said and done, we're talking anywhere from three to as high as five inches.  It looks like the worst areas as far as how much rainfall would be right over paradise here.  This is not good.  </p><p>A three-day, five-inch rainfall event for northern California.  So obviously flash flood watches are in effect.  That is going to be a big threat, along with the mudslides and the debris flows that we're expecting as a result of that rain mixing with all that burnt soil out there.  As far as temperatures holding in the 40's there you see the improvement on Saturday.  But for the next three days, it will be raining and it is going to be raining heavily.   So let's talk about why this is such a big threat.  We had the fires. They have been put out for the most part, at 75 percent containment, but the rain is going to come in.  Typically, when you have the vegetation, that rain is going to get absorbed by trees, by brush. Not the case this time.  That is going to fall basically on cement.  </p><p>[03:45:02] And so one thing that is going to happen, it is going to run down the hill very quickly.  But when it mixes with the ash and that burnt topsoil, what you get is basically a muddy mess.  That is going to be coming down the hills, which is why we had to evacuate folks that had been in the foothill there.  And so this is going to create a significant problem, I think.  We had this last year in the fire season.  We have multiple deaths as a result of that.  So we have to watch this carefully.  A big threat on top of that -- we had California here.  Again this is going to happen Wednesday, Thursday and until Friday, Bianca.  </p><p>NOBILO:  Ivan Cabrera, thank you so much.  </p><p>A suicide bombing in Kabul has killed at least 50 people, in one of the deadliest attacks in the Afghan capital this year.  The bombing targeted religious scholars who had gathered at a wedding hall to mark the birthday of the prophet Muhammad.  There has been no claim of responsibilities so far.  The security situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated in recent months, despite diplomatic effort to end the country's 17 year war.  </p><p>In Yemen, starvation is one of the biggest killers in the country's brutal war.  Since 2015, as many as 85,000 children under the age of five may have died from extreme hunger or disease.  That is according to the charity groups Save the Children.  For more, CNN's Ben Wedeman is live in Beirut, Lebanon.  Ben, thanks for joining us.  So what does this new analysis from Save the Children tell us about quite how severe the humanitarian disaster is in Yemen?  </p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Bianca, war is always an obscenity, but certainly this report underscores just how horrific the war in Yemen is.  Keep in mind, around 10,000 people have been killed in the fighting.  But according to Save the Children, around 85 children under the age of five have died from what they describe as severe acute malnutrition.  Which I assume NGO's for simply starvation.  And this is not a natural disaster.  This is very much a manmade catastrophe caused by this war between Saudi Arabia, the richest country in the Arab world, against a faction in Yemen, which is the poorest country in the Arab world.  </p><p>Now according to the U.N., 22 million people out of the approximate 28 million population of Yemen are in need of some aid or food assistance.  They believe that the U.N. says that in 2018, 400,000 Yemeni children will suffer from, again, this term, severe acute malnutrition, which of course is just, as I said, starvation.  </p><p>Now yesterday, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are the two main members of the Saudi led coalition in this war against Yemen, announced that they will provide $500 billion in food aid to Yemen, but they are spending far more than that in this war against their opponent in Yemen.  Bianca?  </p><p>NOBILO:  Ben, you referenced this was a manmade crisis.  Does reports like this move the dial in terms of international efforts to bring this conflicts to an end?  Does it have any effect?  </p><p>WEDEMAN:  Well, certainly if you went through President Trump's rather interesting statement yesterday regarding Saudi Arabia and the killing, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, it's clear he doesn't care too much.  He is much more interested in the money that comes from Saudi Arabia, than the havoc that is being wreaked on children under five in Yemen, or a Washington-opposed columnist.  </p><p>Now we do know that Martin Griffith, the special U.N. envoy for Yemen, is trying to bring the warring parties to peace talks that are supposed to be held in Sweden before the end of the year, but certainly, the signal that came from Washington was, that this war is not -- bringing this war to an end is not a high priority for the United States.  Bianca?  </p><p>NOBILO:  Ben Wedeman, thank you very much for your reporting.  </p><p>We're going to take a short break.  I'll be back with more news after this.  </p><p>[03:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>NOBILO:  Welcome back.  Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg has faced heavy criticism for how he handled Russian efforts to spread misinformation and divide Americans during the 2016 election.  Critics say he could and should have done more to stop it.  CNN Laurie Segall spoke exclusively with Zuckerberg about where the company is headed and if his longtime colleague Sheryl Sandburg will remain in charge alongside him.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)  </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  There's a lot of questions about Sheryl Sandburg's role and latest controversy, can you definitely say Sheryl stay in her role?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK:  Yes.  Look, Sheryl is a really important part of this company, and is leading a lot of the efforts to address a lot of the biggest issues that we've had.  So, when you look at a lot of the progress we've made over the last 12 to 18 months on issues around elections or content, or security, Sheryl is leading a lot of that work.  And she is been an important partner for me for 10 years.  You know. I'm really proud of the work we've done together. And I hope that we work together for decades more to come.  </p><p>SEGALL:  You are CEO and chairman of Facebook.  That is an extraordinary amount of power, given that you rule a kingdom of 2 billion people digitally.  Shouldn't your power be checked?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.  I think that ultimately the issues that we're working on here, you know, things like, preventing interference in elections from other countries, finding the balance between giving people a voice and keeping people safe.  </p><p>[03:55:00] These are not issues that any one company can address.  But let me give you an example of a place where I think independent governance is really helpful.  So one of the things that we're going to start rolling out soon, is basically, letting people in the community, get an independent appeal when they feel like their content is taken down in a way that doesn't fit with our community standards.  </p><p>Now, you know, you post something.  If someone else reports it, we might take it down if we find that it's hate speech or violates our policies.  But if you disagree, you can be able to appeal and you'll also be able to appeal to an independent body.  That is an example where, that independent body will have real teeth and power and will be transparent in the decision that they're making.  And if I want to overrule that independent body, then I'm not going to be able to.  </p><p>SEGALL:  You're not stepping down as chairman?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  That is not the plan.  </p><p>SEGALL:  That is not the plan.  Would anything change that?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I mean, eventually, overtime.  I'm not going to be doing this forever, but I certainly am not currently thinking that makes sense.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>NOBILO:  Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, talking exclusively there with our Laurie Segall.  </p><p>You've been watching \"CNN Newsroom.\"  I'm Bianca Nobilo.  \"Early Start\" is next for our viewers in the United States.

I'm Bianca Nobilo, live in London. And this is CNNNewsroom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ahead this hour. Siding with Saudi Arabia. Donald Trump suggest the kingdom won't be punished for the killing of American journalist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, U.S. stocks take another tumble. All of the gains made on Wall Street this year have been erased.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And crews are finally getting control of wildfires burning in California. But a new threat may be just around the corner.</p><p>It's been more than two years since Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton for the U.S. presidency. But apparently, he can't seem to accept his victory and move on.</p><p>The New York Times reports Mr. Trump wanted the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton and FBI director James Comey. But the White House counsel warned him against it, telling the president it could lead to his impeachment.</p><p>A source tells CNN that Mr. Trump has repeatedly asked for updates on investigations into Clinton.</p><p>And Mr. Trump appears satisfied with Saudi Arabia's explanation of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. He issued a statement signaling he would not take strong action against Riyadh for Khashoggi's death.</p><p>The CIA believes Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the journalist killing at the consulate in Istanbul. The president is defying intense pressure from U.S. lawmakers to impose stronger sanctions. He insists the CIA did not reach a definitive conclusion and the truth may never be known.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They didn't make a determination. And it's just like I said, I think it was very -- maybe he did it, and maybe he didn't. They did not make that assessment. The CIA has looked at it. They've studied it a lot. They have nothing definitive. And the fact is, maybe he did, maybe he didn't. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: Let's go now to Jomana Karadsheh in Istanbul with the latest. Jomana, President Trump saying maybe he did, or maybe he didn't, referring to the crown prince's knowledge of the killing. How are those remarks likely to be received across the region?</p><p>JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, Bianca, I don't think it's going to be much of a surprise the president's stance. I think he's made it very cheer from day one that his priority here as he mentioned is America.</p><p>First his relationship with Saudi Arabia, that he's described as a spectacular ally. But I think that statement, the way it was written, the way it was delivered, that has really had some people very surprised in this region.</p><p>We're talking about a very polarized and divided region. So, you are going to get different reactions. You've got some countries that are in the Saudi camp. And they will be pretty pleased with this reaction from the United States. This stance from the president.</p><p>There are other countries in the region, Bianca, other U.S. allies that will be probably be very concerned and very worried about this reaction, whether it is Turkey, a NATO ally, that saw this incident, the killing of Jamal Khashoggi on its soil, while it took place at the consulate they said this took place on their territory.</p><p>You know, they see this as a violation of Turkey sovereignty, a NATO ally that was hoping that other countries, especially the United States, would take a stronger stance and make sure that this doesn't happen again.</p><p>And then, you've got other countries, for example, Qatar. I'm pretty sure they will not be very pleased to see this kind of reaction from the United States. Some countries that were hoping that, perhaps, this would be a defining moment. This is the moment where the United States will draw a line.</p><p>They have been concerned about what some would see as this reckless leadership of the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his policies in the region.</p><p>So, you know, the feeling was maybe the United States, an international community, to an extent, was turning a blind eye to some of the actions of the Saudis in the region. And they had hope that maybe perhaps this would be the moment where it will all change but that this not happen clearly.</p><p>And you know what, Bianca, it's not just about these countries. It is also about individuals. It's about people. Over the past few weeks since the killing of Jamal Khashoggi I've spoken to activists and dissidents, opposition figures in this region who will tell you that it was never easy to be critical of governments in this part of the world. They've always felt that their life is in danger. [03:04:58] But with the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, they say they fear for their lives even more right now. And they were saying that unless the international community, especially the United States, holds the Saudis accountable for that killing, they fear that there will be many more Jamals. Bianca?</p><p>NOBILO: Jomana, thank you for your reporting. Jomana Karadsheh for us in Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>Well, for more now on the implications of this, Kate Andrews joins us. She's a political columnist for City A.M. Thank you for being here, Kate.</p><p>KATE ANDREWS, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, CITY AM: Thanks for having me.</p><p>NOBILO: Now you know your economics. And the president has said quite explicitly here, that the tradeoff he is making in his mind is the fact that any strain on the relationship with Saudi Arabia would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Do you think it's unusual for an American president to be explicit about that kind of transactional thinking?</p><p>ANDREWS: Yes, I actually do. Now a lot of Americans have always felt quite uncomfortable with our relationship with Saudi Arabia. It does feel very tactical. We want to have allies in the region, especially with countries like Iran which are becoming more aggressive over the years.</p><p>However, no U.S. president in my knowledge so far has come out and said, basically, we're going to turn a blind eye to what our own intelligence agencies are telling us about a murder because we value the investment because we value these American jobs.</p><p>I think as horrible as I found Donald Trump's comments, I think they're timely. I think it's important that Americans do recognize the trade-off that goes on with Saudi Arabia. I think it is one of our biggest hypocrisies actually.</p><p>And we are a country that claims to stand up for human rights within our own country and around the world. And yet, we do turn a blind eye on so many different occasions. Not simply to this horrific murder but to the treatment of women and minorities in places like Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Perhaps more people will look up and say actually the president is being honest about our relationship with Saudi Arabia and maybe we should take a stand.</p><p>NOBILO: And speaking of areas where the president certainly doesn't turn a blind eye, these are reports that the president was trying to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey. What do you make of them?</p><p>ANDREWS: Well, to speak of human rights, I mean, in America, we don't bully our political foes. And to try to implicate somebody who you have been running against in a Democratic election after the fact is quite worrying. Now I think for Donald Trump, he knows that when Hillary Clinton is being investigated, that plays to his base. He knows I think that certainly that did help him during the 2016 election when Comey re- open that case against her and her e-mail server. He got a bump in the polls.</p><p>So, I don't think there's any question that, you know, from his own tactical point of view, he would like to see further investigation. I think he's a bad winner. I think he's, as you said before when you were introducing us on CNN, he is still struggling to accept the fact that he won. that this isn't a campaign against her anymore.</p><p>NOBILO: And now, if you could explain to our international viewers as well why the U.S. Justice Department would regard those actions in particular of the president as a potential abuse of power.</p><p>ANDREWS: So, you know, when you are approaching the deputy attorney general suggesting that somebody who you just beat in a Democratic election should then possibly see prison time, you are going into very, very murky territory.</p><p>Now, you know, that nobody should be above the law. And there were legitimate questions around the 2016 campaign with both candidates if some of their actions should be investigated. And I'm not opposed to that in the slightest. But at the end of the say Donald Trump is president. It is his actions that need to be the most accountable.</p><p>And to be spending his political capital on potentially trying to put his political opponent behind bars is certainly not where you want the president be channeling his efforts.</p><p>NOBILO: And also, lots of news coming out of the White House, as we--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANDREWS: Around the e-mails.</p><p>NOBILO: -- we expected.</p><p>ANDREWS: Yes.</p><p>NOBILO: So, what, again, what do you make of this story? So, Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, reportedly using her personal e-mail account for business. Explain why that's precarious for somebody in her position. And are the Democrats justified in their resistance to that and their intention to investigate?</p><p>ANDREWS: It's remarkable that a president who ran half of his campaign on the fact that Hillary Clinton had this private e-mail server, was sending work e-mails from a private account, could then be in a position where, not just his daughter, but someone who is a very senior member of his team, has e-mails on her private account.</p><p>There are differences. The reason that they were so able to easily find Ivanka's e-mails is because she didn't have them on a private server in her basement in her own private compound. There are differences.</p><p>But the big concern here is that legally, you're not supposed to have these kinds of documents on your personal e-mail or your personal computer. They are sensitive. They could potentially be classified information. So that can be a threat to American security.</p><p>But also, we have mid-level managers in government getting jail time or being fined for far less explicitly bad circumstances in which they have accidentally put a work e-mail on their private phone or taking something out of the office. And so, it feels like there's a two-tier system here for both the Hillary Clintons and the Ivankas of the world, and then everybody else.</p><p>NOBILO: Kate Andrews, it's always lovely to talk to you. Thank you for panning over with the politics with us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>[03:10:00] ANDREWS: Thanks for having me.</p><p>NOBILO: Now, the trading day is just getting started in the financial capitals of Europe. Stocks in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Zurich are all looking to rebound from losses on Tuesday. Still a bit early to get a sense of direction for today.</p><p>Markets in Tokyo and Seoul were lower but not by too much. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai composite managed modest gains.</p><p>On Wall Street, the Dow dropped more than 550 points Tuesday, wiping out all its gains for the year. Big tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix have been a drag on the NASDAQ, too. Retailers including Target and Kohl's pulled the S&amp;P lower.</p><p>Let's head to Abu Dhabi now. And CNN's Emerging Markets editor, John Defterios. Now, John, it seems that the market all around the world having some fairly shaky days. What's driving that kind of nervous sentiment?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Well, it's being led by Wall Street. There's no doubt about that, Bianca. We've seen this washout on Wall Street on the last two months of trading. And the big question is, how much do we need to see further selling before we correct after years of gains.</p><p>Looking at that Dow Industrial correction. We were down better than 600 points. But still with the loss of 550 points, it's pretty messy. The S&amp;P 500, the broader index of the technology companies of the United States is now down 10 percent from the September highs.</p><p>Let's bring up the Asian screen. I thought this was interesting that we saw Hong Kong and Shanghai moving higher despite the U.S. trade pressure against China right now. Tokyo and South Korea are down slightly. And that was the wider trend, down slightly throughout Asia but not bad considering what we saw.</p><p>In the introduction there you talked about the technology sell off and this is a predominant theme, but it actually has a spillover effect for economies like China and stretch it down to Southeast Asia in Thailand, the so-called supply chain.</p><p>The retailers again are bad sign for the manufacturers of China and there are worries here going into 2019 that the growth is going to be slowing down even for a Christmas buying season of 2018 that the U.S. economy slowing down.</p><p>The final leg of this I think are the financials themselves. Once again, we have President Trump leaning on the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central banks saying this is a worry for us, with the Federal Reserve still moving interest rates higher. This puts a lot of pressure on the emerging market currencies around the world and pressure on the stock markets, as well.</p><p>So, it's constantly a moving game here. And the U.S. president, keeping the trade pressure on China and also on the Federal Reserve, which keeps investors very nervous with the valuation we've seen on Wall Street for the last 24 months.</p><p>NOBILO: And John, there is also some big political risks which are driving markets. Talk to us through those.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: You know, Bianca, I think we're downplaying a story that you're glued on. I'm saying downplaying the financial risks because of Brexit and what's happening on Downing Street. Or shall I say what's not happening on Downing Street because we don't have clarity.</p><p>This is not only bad for the U.K. economy and the U.K. markets but also for continental Europe as well. This could send a shock wave right through the heart of Europe. I'm thinking of France and Germany. The second what we should consider here and this is not playing out in the markets that we see in the early trading as they're starting to recovery is Italy.</p><p>I mean, again, we talk about the political challenges of Italy but the $2 trillion risk with the rest of Europe. So, you could have kind of two columns going lower or getting rattled in 2019. That would be the U.K. and Italy. Those are risks that we have to watch right now.</p><p>I talked about the China trade risk. Now the other one here is the risk of oil. Donald Trump when he gave the support to Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and broadly for the king, King Salman, as well, he thanked Saudi Arabia for not taking action on oil. Actually, providing oil for the last six months but kind of a very strong hint, don't think about cutting oil as a quid pro quo for my support for you.</p><p>So, this is going to make the December 6th, 7th meeting of OPEC very interesting in Vienna. I bring it up as we saw a sharp selloff of 6 to 8 percent at different times during the day for oil prices.</p><p>Donald Trump wants to keep them lower to extend the economic cycle United States, Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf countries where I'm sitting here would like to see a slightly higher. They want to go through the selling price of 2015 and '16 again. And we're looking down the road, Bianca, once again in 2019 drop in demand would mean downward pressure on oil prices.</p><p>NOBILO: John, thank you as ever for your reporting. John Defterios for us in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Now, I'm joined by Vicky Pryce, she's an economist at the Centre for Economic and Business Research and author of the book, \"Economics.\" Vicky, thank you for being with us again.</p><p>Now, John in Abu Dhabi was just mentioning Brexit and the risk that are facing European markets. Let's talk a bit more about that because we are in London. I was freezing at Downing Street yesterday. It seemed that.</p><p>[03:15:02] Now the prime minister heading to Brussels today for meetings with Juncker. How much is riding in terms of the markets in the U.K. and in Europe on getting a deal this week on signing this off?</p><p>VICKY PRYCE, ECONOMIST, CENTRE FOR ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS RESEARCH: Well, it's very interesting because when a withdrawal agreement came back supposedly, you know, with the full acceptance of the E.U. 27 and other negotiators in the U.K. that the markets seemed to be reasonably happy. That at least there were some progress and of course, the pound recovered a little bit, and then of course everything went wrong.</p><p>Given that we had so many resignations from the cabinets and also for the downing terms of other ministers. I supposed the challenge for Theresa May's leadership.</p><p>So, there could be a vote of confidence already but in fact, it hasn't quite materialized. So, in a way, Theresa May has survived and she is going back. And what she hopes to do in a summit this coming Sunday is actually sign that agreement, with all the details being sorted out now because there is a political agreement too.</p><p>It's not just the withdraw agreement, which sets out the terms of the English with which we're leaving the E.U., in terms of how much we have to pay. What happens to E.U. citizens here and what happens to U.K. citizens abroad. And of course, very significantly, the Northern Ireland border which has been an issue.</p><p>Now, she may indeed sign that, once we get a little more information of what this -- why the political agreement for the future says because it's been attached to this. So, there's a withdraw agreement and there is a sort of political statement, in terms of what may happen in the future, in no way binding.</p><p>So, she could sign that. Everything, you know, from her side might work out. She would still be prime minister certainly by Sunday. But then, the question is, does she get it through parliament. And that is what is worrying the Europeans who are already saying, that maybe we've given too many concessions to the U.K.</p><p>So, they're not all terribly, terribly happy about this. But it's been a compromise of business for the moment, it seems to have been quite happy to accept. NOBILO: And presumably, a lot of this instability was price in.</p><p>PRYCE: Up to a point. It changes from day-to-day. Because we don't actually know the exact detail of what the trading arrangement is going to be in the future.</p><p>And even if we get a transition period from, starting from the end of March next year, originally it was just going to be just under two years. We're now talking about possibly extending it to 2022. That suggests there is more uncertainty for businesses on both sides for the U.K. and Europe, and therefore a bit of calm.</p><p>But in reality, there will still need to be so much negotiation during it. And there will be a lot of concern as to whether in fact we might be withdrawing various things that we've agreed to do on paper but not necessarily finding them binding, and therefore accepting them on regulation with the E.U.</p><p>Huge areas which are not covered in any serious details such as the financial services. The service sector generally, which is 80 percent of the U.K. economy. And you look at this and you look at what's going on in Europe right now with the serious slowdown that's taking place in some big countries like Germany, for example, the problems with Italy which we've been hearing a little bit on that as well.</p><p>And basically, when you look at Europe you wonder, do you want to buy stocks, is it actually in entering quiet slow period of growth. The U.K. is not going to grow particularly fast even if there is a proper deal that is signed.</p><p>So, a lot of concern because the markets obviously are going to correct a little bit today or at least they're beginning to look like there might be some correction.</p><p>NOBILO: Yes.</p><p>PRYCE: Not a big one. But a lot remains to be seen. I think this week is going to be crucial but for the U.K. and for Europe the next month. Will the deal be approved by parliament? It's going to be very crucial.</p><p>NOBILO: That is the big question. Vicky Pryce, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>Still to come on CNNNewsroom. Parts of California already scorched by wildfires may now face heavy rain. And that could mean even more disaster for the state.</p><p>Plus, the global police organization, Interpol, has chosen its new leader. And the choice is quite a surprise.</p><p>[03:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NOBILO: Welcome back. We're tracking developments in Hong Kong. A U.S. aircraft carrier strike group has arrived. China has blocked a U.S. warship from visiting just two months ago. So, this could be a sign of better ties ahead of next week's G-20 summit.</p><p>CNN's Ivan Watson is on the water of Hong Kong and joins us now with the very latest. Ivan, explain to our viewers exactly where you are, what's going on and why it's so significant.</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, I'm giving you a view from a tiny, bobbing motor boat in the harbor of Hong Kong of an American nuclear power supercarrier. Behind me is the USS Ronald Reagan. Now, its presence here is significant because tensions have been ratcheting up in recent months between Beijing and Washington.</p><p>And just two months ago, China refused to allow a port of call from another American warship. There are number of flash points right now, notably, the South China Sea. And that's where the U.S. and Chinese navy's have been shadowing each other because China has claimed -- claim virtually all of that important body of water for itself amid objections from the U.S. government.</p><p>So, this aircraft carrier has just been performing maneuvers there alongside other American warships, two other warships that are also paying a visit to the same Chinese port.</p><p>You also have the trade war being waged between Beijing and Washington and there are some who believe that maybe there is some hope here for ratcheting down the tensions, because on Tuesday, just yesterday, the same vessel welcomed a Chinese delegation, welcomed a senior Chinese military commander aboard its deck which is now bristling with U.S. fighter jets for a visit aboard that.</p><p>[03:24:58] And perhaps that could be interpreted as a sign that both sides are trying to calm down the tensions ahead of a much-anticipated face-to-face meeting between the Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump that is scheduled to take place later this month at the G-20 Summit in Argentina. Bianca?</p><p>NOBILO: And Ivan, how has this gesture been received where you are by people who can see what's going on? Or by the media? Is it getting a good reception? Is there a goodwill behind trying to soften the relationship?</p><p>WATSON: I'll just give you the personal reaction. I was pretty surprised when I saw this giant ship, again, bristling with fighter jets, steaming past my apartment window a couple of hours ago. It is being reported in the Hong Kong press. It was front page news here when USS Wasp was denied a port of call here in Hong Kong two months ago. And the media have been invited on board.</p><p>So, this is an example of what the U.S. navy often gauges in, it's kind of naval diplomacy. Ports of call by U.S. warships are a sign that countries that may have a differences of opinion, not always agree, still welcome each other's warships in each other's harbors in each other's ports.</p><p>So, if you are going to use that as a barometer of relations, the fact that this giant floating military, piece of military equipment is being allowed here is a sign perhaps that the Chinese are being a little bit more welcoming of the U.S. navy despite the differences they have in other areas.</p><p>And I'll just remind you that this same ship leading a U.S. naval strike group was operating in the South China Sea, those contested waters just days ago, but now it's being welcomed here in this Chinese harbor. Bianca?</p><p>NOBILO: Ivan Watson, thank you so much for your reporting. Not every day you see Ivan bobbing off of the coast of Hong Kong in a little boat.</p><p>Still to come on CNNNewsroom, the global police organization, Interpol has chosen its new leader. We're live from Dubai with all the details.</p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNNNEWSROOM ANCHOR: Welcome back to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Bianca Nobilo, live in London with a check of the headlines this hour. Donald Trump apparently wanted the U.S. Justice Department to prosecute Hillary Clinton, but was warned against it by the White House counsel. A source tells CNN, the President has also repeatedly asked for progress reports on the investigations into his former presidential opponent.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers are sharply critical of President Donald Trump's loyalty to Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of Jamal Khashoggi's death. The CIA believes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, ordered the killing, but Mr. Trump says maybe the Crown Prince knew about it maybe he didn't.</p><p>Interpol has just selected South Korea's Kim Jong Yang as its new president after vote in Dubai. He is to replace the organization's former leader Meng Hongwei, who left after the in mysterious circumstances. Our Sam Kiley joins us now from Dubai with the very latest. Sam, you're in Dubai where this election happened. Talk about us about who Kim Jong Yang, what we know about him and whether or not this was the expected result.</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Mr. Kim is the former Vice President of Interpol. He was before that, a provincial police commissioner as we would understand it in South Korea. He had broad support, particularly from western countries, who were very anxious, indeed, about the possible election against his rival for the presidency of Interpol and that is 180 nation body that links the police forces of the world effectively.</p><p>The rival, was coming from Russia, he is a former general in the ministry of the interior, his name, Alexander Prokopchuk, and he was anticipated, according to many, to be likely to take the winning post. To past the post first, but it turns out that Mr. Kim has been elected. And I think that would mean there is a sigh of relief being breathed. Not least because of course, Mr. Meng, the Chinese former President of Interpol was arrested on his return home just about six weeks ago, accused of corruption charges. Interpol, at that time, was itself accused of being pretty (inaudible) in its response to the arrest of his most senior official, really rolling over and accepting the resignation letter from him that they wouldn't be absolutely sure, he had not written under duress.</p><p>On top of that, of course, there was a concern that if a Russian was elected to the post, that Interpol might be used to chase down the opponents of Vladimir Putin around the world. There has been some form for that. The Russians have frequently are trying to use Interpol to issue to what is known as a red notice, falsely described as an international arrest warrant, for opponents of the Putin government. But, He is going to remain in post. He is also a Vice President of Interpol. So he still remains a man of considerable influence in this international police body. But for now, I think there is a generalized sigh of relief that a well-known, much- respected police bureaucrat, without the potential political agenda is going to have the top job, Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: And Sam, do you think that the concerns over having a Russian official in the top job was quite rampant? There is a grieved of U.S. senators I believe said it would be like having a Fox in the hen house. Do you think they were the most influential factor behind this decision?</p><p>KILEY: Well, I think that certainly the United States made its views very clear. So did the United Kingdom. This is a majority vote among the members in the building behind me, Bianca. It's not strictly true necessarily at least structurally that the President would be the Fox in charge of the hen house. Because, when we were speaking to Interpol officials earlier on.</p><p>[03:35:00] Their spokeswoman saying that actually the President's role is largely ceremonial. That access to data, which is the most sensitive aspect of this, is controlled by national Interpol offices. And there's no automatic right that a Russian President or a Chinese President or either a British or American President, would be able to do a deep dive into the filing system, if you like, and use that to political ends. That said, of course, if you are the president of a body, you get to change it, fashion it, select who sits on the committees. And that certainly would have given Russia, certainly from the western perspective, undue influence inside Interpol, but those fears are now over. And a populous South Korean candidate has won. So, Interpol is back certainly from in western perspective in safe hands. But no doubt, Vladimir Putin maybe excitedly grinding his teeth over this result. Bianca?</p><p>NOBILO: Thanks for your reporting, Sam. Sam Kiley for us there in Dubai with the latest on Kim Jong Yang being the new Interpol chief.</p><p>Now, Renault says, Carlos Ghosn remains chairman and CEO. It wants more information about accusations of financial misconduct against him. Renault has named an acting CEO to take charge of day-to-day operations while it investigates claims. CNN's Ana Stewart is following the story for us. Ana, thank you for joining us early on Saturday. So, how are investors reacting to all of this news? ANNA STEWART, CNN PRODUCER: Interesting, the share price just opened. The European markets are open. And the share price is slightly higher. At least the crisis, as we were seeing it, may have stalled. You have to bear in mind, this is a stock that is lost a lot of ground over the last few days. At one point, yesterday, some two billion Euros was wipe off its market cap. So yesterday what we had, late last night, and I was here, as well, Bianca, the Renault board men met.</p><p>They met, they decided they would keep Carlos Ghosn in place as CEO and chairman. They have an acting CEO in the meantime. But will it be enough to satisfy the French government? Now expecting to hear any moment from the French finance minister Bruno Lemaire. We heard from him yesterday morning, he effectively said yesterday, you have to bear in mind that the French government is the biggest stake holder in Renault in addition to Nissan.</p><p>And he said yesterday. Carlos Ghosn is not capable of leading the company, at this moment, of course he is under arrest in Japan. So, hopefully this interim management will be enough to please him. He was meeting with the management team early this morning. So we will wait to hear from him.</p><p>NOBILO: And so what is the latest on the man himself? We still have not had any word from him?</p><p>STEWART: This is the thing. We have not heard from Carlos Ghosn. He is been under arrest since Monday. Japanese prosecutors have told us what he is accused of. He and (inaudible) and another director of Nissan accused of collaborating to under report. Carlos Ghosn SALN by some $44 million. In addition to that we know that there were numerous significant other acts of misconduct flagged by Nissan themselves. And there were plenty of other reports from Japanese, NHK about various exotic homes that Nissan provided to Carlos Ghosn, but we have not heard from the man himself yet. It's a hard story to report on because, frankly, the one person we really want to hear from is silent.</p><p>NOBILO: And what is the first that anybody had ever heard about allegations against him?</p><p>STEWART: So what has happen, a whistleblower report at Nissan happened several months ago. Nissan had been investigating this entirely for some several months now. What surprise (inaudible) even Nissan, in fact that Japanese prosecutors came out with it on Monday and arrested Carlos Ghosn. Raided his office then and that is when it really fell into media hands. And I think Nissan have to play very big catch, a very quick press conference Monday. And now, the board rooms of all three cars in these alliance are having to decide what to do next. Nissan's CEO proposed they removed Carlos Ghosn as chairman from Nissan. That board meeting is set to happen tomorrow, but Renault has come to a very different decision.</p><p>NOBILO: Anna Stewart, thank you so much for the very latest. I'll let you go. So you could watch that press conference. Still to come on \"CNN Newsroom,\" trapped in a war that they can't escape. And now a new report says that the children of Yemen are starving to death at an alarming rate. We'll have more for you right after this.</p><p>[03:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NOBILO: Welcome back. As firefighters work to contain the two wildfires burning in California, the state may be facing another big problem, heavy rain is in the forecast. And that could mean that flash flooding and mudslides in the areas that have been scorched. The death toll from the fires now stands at 84. Many more people are still unaccounted for. Crews are now racing to find more possible victims before the bad weather strikes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When the rain comes, what should happen is going to consolidate that material and make it more dense and pack it down. It's going to present mush more like soil. So anything we find or hope to find is still there, is going to be very -- it's going to make a difficult task even that much more difficult.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera joins us more with the rain finally moving to California. Ivan, I say finally, but as you were tell me last hour, this is not exactly give them relief, but actually presents new problems.</p><p>IVAN CABRERA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, you are absolutely right. As you was mentioning there, I mean the fire without the rainfall is already 75 percent contained. So really in a way, ironically, we don't want the rain. The rain is actually going to make things worse. We'll talk about the potential mud flows in a second here. We've already burn of course, California's worst fire ever, 152,250 acres. And here comes the pacific moisture now, the fire late this season is unusual, this is not we typically we get these storms right off from the Pacific in California and now it is going to come in and it is going to come in hard and heavy as far as the rainfall.</p><p>We are not juts talking about one day and by the way Day one is today. Day two, and then, day three. This is a multiday event of very heavy rainfall, we have the string of moisture just right on top of northern California. As far as the rainfall tallies, when all said and done, we're talking anywhere from three to as high as five inches. It looks like the worst areas as far as how much rainfall would be right over paradise here. This is not good.</p><p>A three-day, five-inch rainfall event for northern California. So obviously flash flood watches are in effect. That is going to be a big threat, along with the mudslides and the debris flows that we're expecting as a result of that rain mixing with all that burnt soil out there. As far as temperatures holding in the 40's there you see the improvement on Saturday. But for the next three days, it will be raining and it is going to be raining heavily. So let's talk about why this is such a big threat. We had the fires. They have been put out for the most part, at 75 percent containment, but the rain is going to come in. Typically, when you have the vegetation, that rain is going to get absorbed by trees, by brush. Not the case this time. That is going to fall basically on cement.</p><p>[03:45:02] And so one thing that is going to happen, it is going to run down the hill very quickly. But when it mixes with the ash and that burnt topsoil, what you get is basically a muddy mess. That is going to be coming down the hills, which is why we had to evacuate folks that had been in the foothill there. And so this is going to create a significant problem, I think. We had this last year in the fire season. We have multiple deaths as a result of that. So we have to watch this carefully. A big threat on top of that -- we had California here. Again this is going to happen Wednesday, Thursday and until Friday, Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Ivan Cabrera, thank you so much.</p><p>A suicide bombing in Kabul has killed at least 50 people, in one of the deadliest attacks in the Afghan capital this year. The bombing targeted religious scholars who had gathered at a wedding hall to mark the birthday of the prophet Muhammad. There has been no claim of responsibilities so far. The security situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated in recent months, despite diplomatic effort to end the country's 17 year war.</p><p>In Yemen, starvation is one of the biggest killers in the country's brutal war. Since 2015, as many as 85,000 children under the age of five may have died from extreme hunger or disease. That is according to the charity groups Save the Children. For more, CNN's Ben Wedeman is live in Beirut, Lebanon. Ben, thanks for joining us. So what does this new analysis from Save the Children tell us about quite how severe the humanitarian disaster is in Yemen?</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, war is always an obscenity, but certainly this report underscores just how horrific the war in Yemen is. Keep in mind, around 10,000 people have been killed in the fighting. But according to Save the Children, around 85 children under the age of five have died from what they describe as severe acute malnutrition. Which I assume NGO's for simply starvation. And this is not a natural disaster. This is very much a manmade catastrophe caused by this war between Saudi Arabia, the richest country in the Arab world, against a faction in Yemen, which is the poorest country in the Arab world.</p><p>Now according to the U.N., 22 million people out of the approximate 28 million population of Yemen are in need of some aid or food assistance. They believe that the U.N. says that in 2018, 400,000 Yemeni children will suffer from, again, this term, severe acute malnutrition, which of course is just, as I said, starvation.</p><p>Now yesterday, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are the two main members of the Saudi led coalition in this war against Yemen, announced that they will provide $500 billion in food aid to Yemen, but they are spending far more than that in this war against their opponent in Yemen. Bianca?</p><p>NOBILO: Ben, you referenced this was a manmade crisis. Does reports like this move the dial in terms of international efforts to bring this conflicts to an end? Does it have any effect?</p><p>WEDEMAN: Well, certainly if you went through President Trump's rather interesting statement yesterday regarding Saudi Arabia and the killing, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, it's clear he doesn't care too much. He is much more interested in the money that comes from Saudi Arabia, than the havoc that is being wreaked on children under five in Yemen, or a Washington-opposed columnist.</p><p>Now we do know that Martin Griffith, the special U.N. envoy for Yemen, is trying to bring the warring parties to peace talks that are supposed to be held in Sweden before the end of the year, but certainly, the signal that came from Washington was, that this war is not -- bringing this war to an end is not a high priority for the United States. Bianca?</p><p>NOBILO: Ben Wedeman, thank you very much for your reporting.</p><p>We're going to take a short break. I'll be back with more news after this.</p><p>[03:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NOBILO: Welcome back.

So, when you look at a lot of the progress we've made over the last 12 to 18 months on issues around elections or content, or security, Sheryl is leading a lot of that work. And she is been an important partner for me for 10 years. You know. I'm really proud of the work we've done together. And I hope that we work together for decades more to come.</p><p>SEGALL: You are CEO and chairman of Facebook. That is an extraordinary amount of power, given that you rule a kingdom of 2 billion people digitally. Shouldn't your power be checked?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes. I think that ultimately the issues that we're working on here, you know, things like, preventing interference in elections from other countries, finding the balance between giving people a voice and keeping people safe.</p><p>[03:55:00] These are not issues that any one company can address. But let me give you an example of a place where I think independent governance is really helpful. So one of the things that we're going to start rolling out soon, is basically, letting people in the community, get an independent appeal when they feel like their content is taken down in a way that doesn't fit with our community standards.</p><p>Now, you know, you post something. If someone else reports it, we might take it down if we find that it's hate speech or violates our policies. But if you disagree, you can be able to appeal and you'll also be able to appeal to an independent body. That is an example where, that independent body will have real teeth and power and will be transparent in the decision that they're making. And if I want to overrule that independent body, then I'm not going to be able to.</p><p>SEGALL: You're not stepping down as chairman?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: That is not the plan.</p><p>SEGALL: That is not the plan. Would anything change that?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I mean, eventually, overtime. I'm not going to be doing this forever, but I certainly am not currently thinking that makes sense.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, talking exclusively there with our Laurie Segall.</p><p>You've been watching \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Bianca Nobilo. \"Early Start\" is next for our viewers in the United States.

Bottom line, Republicans don't want to give up that fight, because they realize it could boomerang on them. Here comes \"THE FIVE.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters, along with Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, Juan Williams, and Katie Pavlich. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. President Trump wrapping up his speech in the all-important state of Texas, Trump talking about energy independence and going after Joe Biden for embracing far-left policies, take a look.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't think Biden's going to do too well in Texas. He's already written it off. He's gone no fracking. That's part of his platform. If these far-left politicians ever get into power, they will demolish not only your industry, but the entire U.S. economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: And Joe Biden continuing to bash Trump over the pandemic and claims he's unqualified to be president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump faces a real test, and he has failed it, the basic threshold of being president, the duty to care for the entire country, not just his re-election prospects. He has shown that he can't beat the pandemic and keep you safe. He can't turn the economy around and get America back to work.</p><p>And he has horrifyingly and not surprisingly and intentionally stoking the flames of division and racism country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: OK. Dana Perino, it seems like Trump is trying to put Joe in this left-wing box, where he says he's beholden to the far-left, because, you know, Joe Biden is pretty far-left if you look at his policies on trade, immigration, healthcare, and taxes. And if Joe says no, no, no, I'm not a left-wing guy, then that turns off the Bernie bros, which he needs.</p><p>But if embraces the far-left label, it just turns off the people he needs in the battlegrounds.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah, he's in a pickle. But it was just yesterday that Joe Biden said in response to a reporter's question that he would be the most progressive president in U.S. history, which felt a little confusing because he won the primary based on the fact that he wasn't the most progressive person in the Democratic Party that was running for president.</p><p>But yet, he still feels the need to continue to win over that part of the party. On energy issues, you know, today, the president of the American Petroleum Institute was quoted, saying that they were glad that the Biden policy book is -- basically didn't say that they would get rid of fracking, that they felt like it was pretty much OK.</p><p>So I do think that President Trump going to Texas today shows us a couple of things. One, Ted Cruz last week warned the Republicans and the White House that Texas is in real danger. And there were numbers today that backed that up, so I think going to Texas is good. It doesn't mean Biden's going to win Texas. But one of the things he pointed out is that in 2018, during the midterms, the turnout for Democrats in Texas was way up.</p><p>So think about a presidential election year. That will also be the case. So shoring up Texas makes a lot of sense. But I also think that you've seen a switch from the Trump campaign painting Biden as senile to then focusing on him as a leftist, a progressive, somebody who will be a tool for the far- left. And that must be where they think they can have more fertile ground in order to plant some seeds going into this last 96 days.</p><p>WATTERS: And it does look like it's moving some numbers in the battleground states. All right, Greg Gutfeld, I mean, every candidate whenever they run for president, the other guy's going to destroy the country, going to divide the country, all hell's going to break loose. And, you know, you just expect whoever is the better salesman wins.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. It's funny, though. You know, I don't think Donald Trump has to put Joe Biden in a left-wing box, because I think he's doing it right in front of everybody. It's not a coffin, but it's a box that he jumps into and it makes no sense at all, because he is chasing people who are going to hate him more than they hate Trump.</p><p>I mean, do you think that everybody on the streets, those are all leftists by the way, the people that are burning the buildings and looting and tormenting our police. Those are all leftists. Do you think that suddenly they are just going to stop because Joe might -- Joe wins, if he wins? Of course not, of course not.</p><p>They are going to look at him as part of the same problem because they are anarchists. So he's not going to actually have any effect on making the world a less divisive place. And let's not forget. He was the first guy to start using divisive language when he called Donald Trump the most racist president ever and pushing the fine people hoax over and over again. He has been following the divisive playbook since day one.</p><p>WATTERS: And he learned it from his mentor, Barack Obama. Katie, how do you see things shaping up? It looks like it's shaping up to be a traditional presidential election, where both sides throw mud, raise a hell of a lot of money, and the debates pretty much catapult the winner into the Oval?</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I do think it's really interesting that the president is in Texas heeding the warnings and, you know, not taking any vote for granted and also reminding Republicans in Texas that they have to get out to vote if they want to keep their state red, if Democrats have -- had Texas on the map for a long time as a golden ticket to winning presidential elections for the near future.</p><p>So they have always had that target that they wanted to reach in those goals to turn Texas blue. It's something that activists there have been working on for a very long time. And they're getting close. Ted Cruz didn't win -- very much against Beto O'Rourke. You have to remember that. But in terms of these other swing states, you know.</p><p>There is that Zogby poll out today showing that President Trump beats Biden 3-1 when it comes to voters who switched from Obama to Trump in 2016. So that's good news for the Trump campaign, because that means that they are holding onto those voters that really push them over the top in a lot of those places. And in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan, I think it's going to be a very tough sell for Joe Biden to be able to kind of, you know, capitulate to his far-left base on environmental policies.</p><p>While also trying to somehow make the argument that he's going to keep manufacturing jobs, bring them back from overseas, and somehow allow oil and gas and fracking to move forward. I mean, they say that in their outline. But when it comes to actually implementing that kind of policy, I think the left might win on that when it comes to pushing that in terms of legislation if he were to become president.</p><p>WATTERS: All right. Juan, I want you to react to all that, but also tell us about the buzz going on with Kamala Harris as the VP pick. What are you hearing?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, you know, everybody was talking, Jesse, about Vice President Biden's notes. Remember that photographer got a picture of Biden's notes, and it said that he doesn't hold grudges and all this about Kamala Harris. You can see it there on the screen. But the buzz is not about Kamala Harris. I mean, in fact, the energy all seems to be about either Susan Rice or Karen Bass, the congresswoman from California.</p><p>So -- but I don't -- I mean, I don't know what to make of it, because you get all kinds of various signals. Somebody said to me the other day we haven't heard much from Kamala Harris. That's the way it goes before (ph) people show up standing next to the nominee. I don't know. I will say this about the race and reacting. You said react -- all I've heard.</p><p>You know, I think the president is obviously running against Joe Biden. And I don't think he can make Joe Biden into the far-left. Nobody's buying that. Even the far-left doesn't think Joe Biden is far-left, OK? But I find it interesting that Trump is preoccupied with Dr. Fauci. Yesterday at White House, he's saying that, you know, he doesn't understand why Dr. Fauci, 80- year-old doctor, researcher is more popular than he is.</p><p>And he says it must that it's his personality. Well, what about -- and this applies to Texas and everything else. What about the Coronavirus? I think Biden is plus 17 in the Fox poll on how he would handle the Coronavirus and protect us, the American people from this scourge. And I think that's when you start to see problems in Texas. That's where you have the real clear politics.</p><p>The average has, I think, Biden up 8.4. That's where you start to see a big peeling away of people who say, you know what? I think it's time to move on. So for me, I think the virus has become the number one political issue, and that's where President Trump is coming up short.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. We'll see about that, won't we, Juan? I think Dukakis was up 17 points at the same point before the election. And I think we all remember what happened to him. Coming up, tech titans under fire on the Hill, facing tough questions about social media censorship. You will want to hear their answers next.</p><p>PERINO: You are looking live at Capitol Hill, where the biggest names in tech are still on the hot seat. They've been there all afternoon. The CEOs of Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon getting drilled during an antitrust hearing that earlier Republicans went after the executives over allegations over conservatives being censored on social media.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll just cut to the chase. Big tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact. If I had a nickel for every time I heard it was just a glitch, I wouldn't be as wealthy as our witnesses, but I would be doing all right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Conservatives are consumers, too. And the way the net was put together, in the eyes of Congress, is that everybody should be able to speak their mind.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And can you today assure Americans you will not tailor your features in any way to help -- specifically help one candidate over the other -- what I'm concerned about is you're helping Joe Biden over President Trump.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We won't do any work to, you know, to politically tilt anything one way or the other. It's against our core values.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: All right. The CEOs denied any bias. So another day, another hearing, let me go to you, Jesse. I don't know if you got a chance to see much of that today. But, you know, anytime we have hearings on Capitol Hill about tech, you just kind of want to cringe through the questions that are being asked. Because many times, you realize that the members -- they have an idea of what they are talking about, but they are not well-versed in the technology.</p><p>WATTERS: They don't know the difference between Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, nothing. They are worse than I am. I do have to give credit where credit is due, Dana, because the Democrats have done something very smart, and it really pains me to say that. They've launched this campaign in Silicon Valley for these tech giants to root out hate speech and misinformation.</p><p>But the Democrats in D.C. agree with the Democrats in Silicon Valley that hate speech and misinformation only comes from conservatives. Because so -- when -- hate speech is basically anything that offends a Democrat. And misinformation is anything a Democrat disagrees with. So these PC police types and the fact-checkers and the mainstream media get on these platforms, and they build these speech walls against conservative speech.</p><p>And these walls keep closing in. Yet, the Democrats, they can talk about misinformation all day long, like, the Russia hoax and they can pay no price. They can slander conservatives all day long. Call them white supremacists, rapists. They can plan riots on social media. They don't pay a price. So it's unfair. And the Democrats say you better do this, since you're conservatives to these tech giants or we will break up your monopolies.</p><p>The Republicans say you better stop censoring us and aligning yourselves with the Chinese, or we'll break up your monopolies. And what do the big guys do? They just shower them with money. They pay everybody off. And they have all their lobbyists take everybody on (Inaudible) and to fancy dinners. Because all they know is that once a year they come up.</p><p>Bend over, get spanked, and then they walk back to their desk their desks, and make a billion dollars a day and nothing changes.</p><p>PERINO: All right, so one of those people that are under the gun from Democrats is Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. And Juan, take a listen to what he said very consistent with what he told us month or so ago when we did an interview with him about this issue of the Democrats wanting Facebook to take down all sorts of things, including basically Trump's Twitter feed or Facebook feed. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas. Be able distinguish their selves as one of the companies that defends free expression the most. We do not want to become the arbiters of truth. That would be a bad position for us to be in, and not what we should be doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Why can't the Democrats seem to think that that's OK, Juan, to say that you want to be neutral on a platform?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think it's all right with everybody. I think the real issue going back to what Jesse was saying has to do with, you know, propaganda, lies, hate speech, that kind of thing. But, you know, I think today, just to pick up again on what Jesse was saying. I saw Sensenbrenner asking Zuckerberg about Twitter like he thought Zuckerberg ran Twitter.</p><p>He doesn't even know the difference, apparently. So I get the idea that really watching this, it looked like Republicans, you know, how do you guys said the Democrats weren't allowing Barr to speak yesterday. So today, its Republicans not allowing any of these tech executives to speak, and basically working the rev (ph) saying we don't like it when you limit, you know, Don Jr., when he's putting stuff out there.</p><p>We don't like it at all. So OK, I mean, I guess that's their message. But to me, this was supposed to be an antitrust hearing. And, you know, to the point of who's got more political leverage, I think right now, President Trump and his administration had done nothing in terms promoting competition on the high-tech sector. There is more of a threat to those --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- from the prospect -- I'll just finish up. It's more of a threat, I think, from Joe Biden and Democratic Congress in terms of actually putting in place legislation and passing it that would rein in these monopolies and allow real competition to allow the little guy to get in the game. So if that's the issue, than I think the political leverage is more on the right.</p><p>PERINO: But, Greg, thinking about this, you know, free market system, and here you have these four tech CEOs, American companies, employing lots of Americans. And also, you are having a global presence. And you have these guys saying that big government should be -- would be better at running -- making decisions for these companies than the free market.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah. It's -- when you look at these hearings in general, it's why I didn't even watch these hearings today because I was hearing doubt. It took all of my self-control not to drive to D.C. and TP the Capitol. Whenever you take any issue, whether it's justice or it's the internet, hearings are an intellect removal machine.</p><p>It's like -- it replaces brains without range (ph) theater. And I don't think -- you never get to the bottom of anything. You just go back to the top. We're participating in an experiment with social media. It affects all of our lives. It's only going to get bigger and ubiquitous and more powerful. So the question for a conservative is -- conservatives are do you want it to become the fourth horseman of the left, you know -- the left won when it comes to culture.</p><p>They have the entertainment industry. They have media. They have academia. So we have this fourth thing. It's social media. It's the social media platform. Do you want to just hand it over without a fight? Because once you hand it over, it never comes back. And we know that with academia. There's never -- academia is purely left. And you know the media will never be conservative.</p><p>None of these things will change. And by the way, to Jesse's point, I want to back it up. It's not about hate speech. It's about the accusation of hate speech, which is used to silence you and damage your career. And this is happening everywhere, not just social media.</p><p>PERINO: Yeah. Katie, one thing I thought that -- you know, you didn't hear too much about it today. But the Trump administration has gone to bat for these American companies, especially overseas, when you have governments like in the E.U., for example that want to heavily tax or regulate or change these companies. They have gone to bat for them. You know, would a Biden administration do the same?</p><p>PAVLICH: I think it depends. You know, there's not a lot in Washington, D.C. that both sides of the political aisle agree on, and they still disagree. But the one thing they do agree on is that big tech. There are problems on both sides. Jim Jordan today was very adamant about pointing out issues of bias that have been alleged against these big tech companies and the double standard that does exist when it comes to free speech on their platforms.</p><p>And I have to say, you know, Mark Zuckerberg says we're not going to regulate speech. We're -- arbiters of truth. But they actually kind of -- they cop out, because they hire, quote, \"fact-checkers\" from, like, the Associated Press or the New York Times that are left-leaning publications to do to the fact-checking for them. And then those posts are then flagged in the pages that they are on are flagged.</p><p>And they are limited in terms of their views. So this idea that they don't actually regulate what goes on their platforms isn't necessarily true. But I also don't know if the government is the way to fix this, especially considering how today went. And they always think that they're better than everyone that they're smarter than their witnesses. Today was a show that is not necessarily true.</p><p>PERINO: Not true. All right, coming up, a massive teachers union says its members will not go back to school until its demands are met. Wait until you hear what they are asking for.</p><p>GUTFELD: As America struggles with COVID, rising crime, and riots, it's nice that the teachers unions are helping out, I kid. And their demand for reopening schools, the United Teachers of LA, a union for public school teachers, has included, surprise, de-funding the police, and a shutdown of publicly-funded, privately-operated charter schools.</p><p>Now, these go beyond what normal unions demand. Worse, they use this crisis to preserve their power by destroying those who won't conform, by trying to shutdown charter schools they are demanding the elimination of any competition and depriving desperate poor families of an education that might change kids' lives. This speaks to the real truth of a big American problem.</p><p>It's not systemic racism. It's not systemically corrupt education system. It's the teachers union, led by leftists, whose only goal is to cancel competition that might reveal their incompetence. And so at the start of life, poor students are placed in the system where no matter how many billions of tax dollars are shovelled into it, it just gets worse.</p><p>The students don't stand a chance. And the unions prefer it that way. Yet, charter schools produce better educated kids with a far better head start in life. You think that would be embraced, but the price of union success is student failure. Once we see the results of charter schools, we realize the cause of all our inequalities isn't racism. It's the scandalous lack of choices.</p><p>Left for poor blacks, poor whites, poor everyone, victimized by urban liberals, so these kids begin their lives in a whole, a whole that isn't a grave, but might as well be one, at least for their futures. Dana, how can a union make these demands? I mean, isn't this just basically symbolic crap?</p><p>PERINO: Well, I think partly it's that the unions are not serving the teachers or the students well, and this happens often when you have a union that wants to get involved in other political matters like de-funding the police. And this is really probably not the time to be doing an exercise in overreach because you've had people who have had to rethink everything, maybe their job, maybe where they live. Maybe you know how they live, and how they educate their kids.</p><p>Many school districts, including I believe down in Miami, they're pushing school back. They're starting later. They're going to start online, and then they're going to try to figure out a way to get into classrooms. I think people generally want their kids back in school, but they are really concerned about safety.</p><p>However, one of the things that this is also doing is make people think about how they educate their kids. And necessity is the mother of invention. And you have the opportunity now to say, wait, why do I have to do it this way? Maybe I could try it a different way. And you start to see the possibility of either homeschooling or little pods or people getting together.</p><p>Now that might leave behind, though, and there's a very real concern the lower income students that you were talking about. So that has to be a consideration. But I think that this pandemic is going to forever change the way that some parents decide to teach their kids at home.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, what could be their legitimate defense of wanting to defund charter schools?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Charter schools worked, and you just say that. I agree with it. You know, I say that generally, obviously, there are some charter schools that don't work. But I think in general, it's innovation and it forces the option to be made available to parents to say I like this school or I don't like this school, and it does away a lot with a lot of the kind of zip codes segregation, you know, where kids in better neighborhoods get better schools because they get more supplemental funding, more parent parental support.</p><p>You know, just picking up on what Dana was saying. One of the issues has to be that if you have innovation in the like, do poor kids. You know, oftentimes I say this with a sad, hard kids coming from single parent families where the mom may be an essential worker, a low income worker and not able to provide that kind of personal interaction with the kid during the day. Does that child there get left behind? That would have been me.</p><p>And I think that, you know, obviously, you can imagine how I feel, and I'm a big school choice proponent. Just one last thought though, Greg, on the opening of schools. I just want to make it clear that even people like the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, a Democrat, Bill Gates, nobody is hardline, you know, conservative, but these people everybody wants schools open. It's just a matter of doing it safely.</p><p>Parents are hardwired to protect their children. Teachers, obviously have a stake in this. And I think we have to just work at it but we can -- we'll find a way.</p><p>GUTFELD: Speaking of which, I think we have taped Bill Gates and a couple of governors saying the very -- what Juan just said, if you want to play that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT CORPORATION: I'm a big believer that for young children, the benefits in almost every location, particularly if you can protect the teachers, well, the benefits outweigh the costs. As you get up to age like 13 and higher, then you'll have to look at your locale to decide what you'll do with high schools.</p><p>And if they're not in and then you have to put massive effort into trying to get there to be continued learning online.</p><p>GOV. KRISTI NOEM (R-SD): The science is clear. Our kids need to be in school. For us, our kids are going back to school on time. We've had great -- definitely, they will definitely be in the classroom.</p><p>GOV. PHIL MURPHY (D-NJ): Every education expert we've spoken to over the past few months has confirmed that in-person education is critical. We must try to include at least some aspect of in-person education for our children this fall.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Katie, feel free to either discuss that or the unions. Your pick.</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, that's the scientific path that everybody should be following when it comes to kids being in schools. But on the union side, it is just absolutely despicable that they're putting this laundry list of demands into the futures of America's kids when they claim that they actually, you know, care about them and pretend to care about them.</p><p>And it's the reason why a lot of teachers around the country have actually sued their governments which have forced them into these unions, because they don't want to be part of a political party and pay dues to those unions when they don't have the best interests of the kids in mind.</p><p>In terms of getting rid of the charter schools. They want to do that because charter schools present them with competition and force them to do better. And they don't want to do better, they just want to be paid for not doing their jobs, and they want to hold kids hostage for generations to come if this keeps going on.</p><p>GUTFELD: Jesse, the president of the American Federation -- Teachers Federation is going to be on \"THE DAILY BRIEFING\" tomorrow with Dana Perino to discuss this. I assume you will be tuning in and watching it.</p><p>WATTERS: As always. Also, Greg, did you dress like a middle school math teacher just to do this monologue?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I did. This is a new shirt.</p><p>WATTERS: I mean, honest to goodness, you look like my middle school math teacher. Did you have sweat stains here too, and chalk in your hands? My God. You also dress like Bill Gates with the glasses and the sweater. Enough about you, Greg. This was a social justice shakedown.</p><p>Did you have any idea that teachers' union was this liberal? I mean, who wrote the demands, Omar? This is fanatical stuff here. No wonder that kids can riot better than they can read. I'm terrified of the teachers' union. I think they're the most hardcore union out there, but I can't say anything mean about them because I'll be attacked for going after teachers.</p><p>I just know that Trump just send them 100 billion. I hope that winds up in the right hands and not into some pockets of some administrators for fatter pensions and bonuses. I hope that goes to the right place.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, it's such a good point. If you may -- if you'd say something about the unions, they accuse you of going after teachers, and then you're an evil, evil person which I am. Up next, summer shark fears after a fatal attack and several beaches are forced to close.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Park shark panics sweeping the country after a woman is tragically killed in Maine. 63-year-old Julie Holowach was killed by a great white shark while swimming with her daughter. The shark reportedly threw her into the air during the deadly encounter. The kayaker who recovered the body describes the scene.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLIE WEMYSS-DUNN, SHARK ATTACK WITNESS: I was almost -- I was about to get in the water essentially because I still thought that it could be something like a boat propeller or some sort of accident like that. My wife is screaming at me not to get into water.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: The death is the first fatal shark attack in Maine's history, but it's the 13th unprovoked attack in the U.S. this year. And several beaches near New York City shut down after three shark sightings. Police now using helicopters to help spot them.</p><p>So Jesse, I didn't want to just like grab and pull out what little here I have left. I mean, we have the virus, now we have killer sharks, is a terminator coming next?</p><p>WATTERS: (AUDIO GAP) attack the United States pre-emptive war on (AUDIO GAP). I call Americans to join me in that fight. Two things here. First, I'm very sorry to hear about this tragedy and my heart goes out to the family. But you know, this is your typical summer ratings ploy by producer Megan Albano who thinks this is really hip and fun to do at this time of the year.</p><p>Last point is this. I am taking a pre-planned vacation to Maine next week. So everybody is aware of that in case I say something controversial the day before I go to Maine. I'm not in trouble.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, so Greg, let's ask you about that. Are you afraid to go to the beach? We see here in the -- in the statistics that you're more likely to get hit by a car to get cancer. What do you say?</p><p>GUTFELD: It's actually you probably would have a better chance of having a vending machine fall on you. (AUDIO GAP) in Maine, in Maine's history, so even like (AUDIO GAP) attack they've had in 200 years, I'm going to go in Jesse's side and say this is a ratings ploy on Megan Albano's behalf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. Hey, Katie, I wanted to ask you, I have some suggestions. If you stay away from schools of fish, if you don't dress in dark colors and look like a seal, I think you're pretty safe. What do you think?</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, first, it's horrible that this woman was killed this way. But you're right, Juan. I mean, if there are seals around anywhere near the beach that you want to be swimming, I would say do not go in the water at all where there's fish food, meaning shark food, there will be sharks there and seals can be mistaken -- or humans can be mistaken for seals quite often. That's usually what these attacks end up being. So, number one tip, stay away from the shark food.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's a good move. And Dana, just the final thing. The only news here is that some people say oh, it's warmer waters. That's why the sharks are coming in. What do you think?</p><p>PERINO: I discount that. Obviously -- we had an expert on the \"DAILY BRIEFING\" today, a shark expert who said this is -- it's a pretty typical year for shark attacks. We know that they happen. I do feel for the family because I imagine every time they close their eyes, they have a horrible image in their mind and I pray for them because like obviously we're going to talk about it because it is scary. That is why I don't ever go in past my ankles into the -- into the ocean, but I have great respect for everything that lives under the water.</p><p>WATTERS: You can swim can you, Dana?</p><p>PERINO: I can swim. I won't drown. I will go in a pool to swim but I can't go in the ocean.</p><p>WATTERS: OK, you can't swim.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right guys, next up. This is big news, folks. Jesse has a hair news update next for you on THE FIVE.</p><p>PAVLICH: Welcome back. They say you never forget how to ride a bike, but what if you never learned? Some adults are using the pandemic as a good excuse to teach themselves how to ride without looking foolish or getting hurt. So Greg, you can keep your dignity if you only ride bikes inside.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't understand how you become an adult without learning how to ride a bike. I mean, what did you do when you were a teenager? I guess -- I mean, I lived in the suburbs. So maybe in the city, you didn't have a bike. I just got an electric bike. And that is like, you don't ever need to ride another bike. Just get an electric bike. It's the best thing ever.</p><p>PAVLICH: Does it -- but Dana, is an electric bike really riding a bike? Does that count?</p><p>PERINO: It's basically a moped, I think. But I remember one of the sweetest things I ever saw at Central Park was an adult woman learning to ride a bike and the guy who was trying to teach her was so patient and so kind and she was so humiliated. But I watched it for a while and she got it and I thought this is a great thing.</p><p>And I see kids around here, four years old, riding a bike with no training wheels. Something is going on. Kids are learning earlier today.</p><p>PAVLICH: Juan, do you know how to ride a bike?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh yes. And you know, I remember teaching my kids. I took him down to the local high school track. And you know, because the surface there is a little bit softer. But that's the big difference between learning as a kid and learning as an adult is if you're a kid, it's a shorter distance to fall. Bumps and bruises are just part of life. But if you're an adult, you better get a helmet, you know.</p><p>PAVLICH: A helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, Jesse, all the things. Shouldn't these people get credit for trying something new, especially when the gyms are closed? They're trying to get their exercise.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I have a Jessie's friendly neighborhood dispute question. So I was riding a bike with my daughter the other day at the beach, and apparently she just ran over some other girl's foot with her bike. And she just said sorry and kept on pedaling. Shouldn't she have stopped turned around and walked back and apologize or was sorry while riding away good enough.</p><p>PAVLICH: She probably should have stopped to make sure her foot wasn't broken.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, OK. Good to know.</p><p>PAVLICH: You should have stopped, Jesse, to make sure she's OK.</p><p>WATTERS: I didn't see it. I didn't see it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, was she?</p><p>WATTERS: I didn't.</p><p>PAVLICH: All right, finally, everybody, we have breaking news today. It finally happened. Jesse's mullet is no more after fans of THE FIVE voted and told him to get it cut. Jesse is no longer looking like a Long Island version of Billy Ray Cyrus. So now the question is, what do we think of his new, new hair? Dana?</p><p>PERINO: I think it's still a little long.</p><p>WATTERS: Seriously? No, it's not. It's nice. It's nice. It's very nice.</p><p>PERINO: See how it lifts up in the back a little bit.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, shut up, everybody. My hair is fine.</p><p>PERINO: I have a prediction I'd like to make. I believe that --</p><p>PERINO: I think that's a trim, not a cut.</p><p>PERINO: I believe that after the haircut, I'm going to predict that Jesse will bring back wearing a tie on the Tuesday. The first -- right after Labor Day, the day after Labor Day, I predict Jesse will start wearing a tie again on the show.</p><p>WATTERS: Dana --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Jesse reminds me of the local younger weatherman, who thinks he's kind of cool. He has a kind of a pseudo hip haircut and kind of goes to the bars at night at the local affiliate bar near the -- near the station and just hangs out.</p><p>WATTERS: Why don't you teach me some long division, Gutfeld?</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Jesse, Jesse, I approve of your haircut. I think you look really clean.</p><p>PAVLICH: Juan, do you think that he should cut it?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, you know, I was getting worried. I didn't want dreadlocks. I tell you that.</p><p>WATTERS: Don't worry. That's not my scene.</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, I would have I would have voted no for cutting. I want to see how far this is going to go.</p><p>WATTERS: Thank you, Katie.</p><p>PAVLICH: But we'll just have to see if you can keep crawling it out.</p><p>WATTERS: Thank you.</p><p>PAVLICH: All right,\" ONE MORE THING\" up next.</p><p>WATTERS: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" Dana.</p><p>PERINO: America lost one of its great -- her great patriots yesterday. I want to take a moment to celebrate the life of someone you might recognize here. Granny Rich, the grandmother of John Rich, our colleague and our friend. Granny rich passed away yesterday. She was 88-years-old. You might know that she was a part of John Rich's Instagram, and his Twitter feed, and he was -- she was also a big part of the wonderful whiskey, Redneck Riviera Whiskey that John Rich and his granny put out.</p><p>She was a wonderful woman, a good friend to America, and she will be greatly missed. And we're sorry for your loss John.</p><p>WATTERS: Granny Rich, one of the best grandmother names I've ever heard. Juan Williams</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, God bless, John. I hope you're OK. Keep your head to the sky, folks. You never know when good times are coming. Take a look at eight-year-old Ryan Senneff. He has Down Syndrome and from birth he struggled with health issues including speaking. But now, as you can see there, here comes the sun.</p><p>In the last month with therapy and medical help, Ryan had a breakthrough. He started skipping, doing jumping jacks, tying his shoes, and speaking more easily. And watch this. Here's Ryan telling his dad he's so proud of him for skipping next to him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN SENNEFF, HAS DOWN SYNDROME: I'm so proud of you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm so proud of you.</p><p>SENNEFF: I'm so proud of you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's pretty wonderful. I'm sure Ryan is proud of his mom too.</p><p>WATTERS: Kids are working out more than I am these days.</p><p>PAVLICH: That's sweet.</p><p>WATTERS: I better get back after it. All right, Katie.</p><p>PAVLICH: All right. Well, music can have an interesting effect not just on humans but on animals as well. Take a look at this.</p><p>This was a deer in Canada drawn in by this musician's harp playing. Her name -- her name is Naomi and she was practicing outside as the deer just got a little closer to hear her concert. She said that she got a little bit scared not knowing what it was but said next time she hopes that rabbits and squirrels decided to stop by.

With it, the president also rallied his widely followed online allies - whom he described as \"journalists and influencers\" and who together can reach roughly half a billion people - entering the 2020 presidential election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump delivered his diatribe against Facebook, Google and Twitter - charges of political bias that all three companies long have denied - at a White House event featuring Republican lawmakers, GOP campaign strategists and social media meme-makers, a move that led some critics to express dismay that the president aimed to use the policy summit as a reelection push.</p><p>But Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups said they were most alarmed that Trump had invited supporters who have a history of targeting the president's political opponents with inflammatory tweets, misleading videos and hard-to-debunk conspiracy theories. At one point, the president praised James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, which has released widely criticized, highly edited videos of his subjects.</p><p>\"Somebody said he's controversial,\" Trump said. \"He's truthful.\"</p><p>In response, critics fretted that Trump had essentially endorsed such tactics in the early days of the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>\"This has the appearance not of a social media summit but a political rally and call for the right,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.). \"The fact that some of the most extreme voices on social media are coming to the White House, and they get a forum to complain about how often they're retweeted, and that the actual platform companies aren't even invited, smacks of the absurd.\"</p><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center charged that the president is \"essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,\" said Heidi Beirich, the director of the group's work to track online extremism.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter each declined to comment.</p><p>For much of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump's aides appeared to line the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry's alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives' speech - along with at least one tweet from Trump calling himself \"the best\" at using the service.</p><p>And Trump threatened additional scrutiny to come, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for an upcoming meeting while directing federal agencies to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>Trump has skewered Facebook, Google and Twitter for months on allegations that they are biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in \"collusion\" and worked in opposition to a \"certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\" Repeatedly, the president also has threatened to investigate or regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter, sparking hearings and similar calls for tough new laws among Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Trump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or U.S. elections, and some of the examples he has cited to illustrate industry bias have been debunked. For example, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company long has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as it removes spam.</p><p>\"A lot of bad things are happening,\" he said.</p><p>Trump's attacks often have come in response to efforts by Facebook, Google and Twitter to remove hate speech, threats of violence and other troubling content from their platforms. These tech giants have been under pressure to address a litany of online ills, including the rise of disinformation, three years after Russian agents spread falsehoods on social media during the 2016 election. But Trump and his close allies have decried some social media content-moderation policies as censorship, putting those companies in a political bind.</p><p>\"This is largely, I think, a political event,\" said Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, a Washington-based trade group that represents Facebook, Google and other tech giants. He said there is \"no conservative bias on our platforms.\"</p><p>Some of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O'Keefe and Project Veritas, whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump's praise Thursday.</p><p>\"Project Veritas can be synergistic with the Trump administration to pull back the curtain surrounding Big Tech,\" O'Keefe said in a statement online after receiving the invitation.</p><p>Other attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial, inflammatory tweet questioning whether Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an \"American black,\" and Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit founder who has long been faulted for spreading conspiracy theories online.</p><p>\"After the 2016 election Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon (in advertising) decided the best way to prevent another Trump win was to silence conservative voices in America,\" according to a statement from the Gateway Pundit site. \"The tech giants in two years did more to destroy Freedom of Speech than at any other time in US history.\"</p><p>Initially, the White House had invited Ben Garrison, whose cartoons long have provoked the ire of groups including the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center for including hateful imagery, including anti-Semitism. But the White House this week appeared to rescind its invitation, Garrison tweeted in a statement Wednesday, out of concern his presence would be a \"media distraction from the president's message.\"</p><p>Trump also invited lawmakers such as Rep.

With it, the president also rallied his widely followed online allies - whom he described as \"journalists and influencers\" and who together can reach roughly half a billion people - entering the 2020 presidential election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump delivered his diatribe against Facebook, Google and Twitter - charges of political bias that all three companies long have denied - at a White House event featuring Republican lawmakers, GOP campaign strategists and social media meme-makers, a move that led some critics to express dismay that the president aimed to use the policy summit as a reelection push.</p><p>But Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups said they were most alarmed that Trump had invited supporters who have a history of targeting the president's political opponents with inflammatory tweets, misleading videos and hard-to-debunk conspiracy theories. At one point, the president praised James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, which has released widely criticized, highly edited videos of his subjects.</p><p>\"Somebody said he's controversial,\" Trump said. \"He's truthful.\"</p><p>In response, critics fretted that Trump had essentially endorsed such tactics in the early days of the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>\"This has the appearance not of a social media summit but a political rally and call for the right,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.). \"The fact that some of the most extreme voices on social media are coming to the White House, and they get a forum to complain about how often they're retweeted, and that the actual platform companies aren't even invited, smacks of the absurd.\"</p><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center charged that the president is \"essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,\" said Heidi Beirich, the director of the group's work to track online extremism.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter each declined to comment.</p><p>For much of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump's aides appeared to line the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry's alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives' speech - along with at least one tweet from Trump calling himself \"the best\" at using the service.</p><p>And Trump threatened additional scrutiny to come, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for an upcoming meeting while directing federal agencies to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>Trump has skewered Facebook, Google and Twitter for months on allegations that they are biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in \"collusion\" and worked in opposition to a \"certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\" Repeatedly, the president also has threatened to investigate or regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter, sparking hearings and similar calls for tough new laws among Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Trump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or U.S. elections, and some of the examples he has cited to illustrate industry bias have been debunked. For example, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company long has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as it removes spam.</p><p>\"A lot of bad things are happening,\" he said.</p><p>Trump's attacks often have come in response to efforts by Facebook, Google and Twitter to remove hate speech, threats of violence and other troubling content from their platforms. These tech giants have been under pressure to address a litany of online ills, including the rise of disinformation, three years after Russian agents spread falsehoods on social media during the 2016 election. But Trump and his close allies have decried some social media content-moderation policies as censorship, putting those companies in a political bind.</p><p>\"This is largely, I think, a political event,\" said Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, a Washington-based trade group that represents Facebook, Google and other tech giants. He said there is \"no conservative bias on our platforms.\"</p><p>Some of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O'Keefe and Project Veritas, whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump's praise Thursday.</p><p>\"Project Veritas can be synergistic with the Trump administration to pull back the curtain surrounding Big Tech,\" O'Keefe said in a statement online after receiving the invitation.</p><p>Other attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial, inflammatory tweet questioning whether Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an \"American black,\" and Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit founder who has long been faulted for spreading conspiracy theories online.</p><p>\"After the 2016 election Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon (in advertising) decided the best way to prevent another Trump win was to silence conservative voices in America,\" according to a statement from the Gateway Pundit site. \"The tech giants in two years did more to destroy Freedom of Speech than at any other time in US history.\"</p><p>Initially, the White House had invited Ben Garrison, whose cartoons long have provoked the ire of groups including the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center for including hateful imagery, including anti-Semitism. But the White House this week appeared to rescind its invitation, Garrison tweeted in a statement Wednesday, out of concern his presence would be a \"media distraction from the president's message.\"</p><p>Trump also invited lawmakers such as Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) who have accused Twitter of limiting the reach of their tweets. They were joined by organizations such as the Media Research Center, a conservative group that has called for the breakup of big tech companies, and PragerU, which produces right-leaning videos that it says Google has censored - a matter the two sides are battling in court.</p><p>In an early-morning series of tweets, Trump said that the focus of the conversation would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,\" though he did not mention any by name. \"We will not let them get away with it much longer,\" he added.</p><p>Trump also appeared to suggest social media sites \"would be driven out of business\" once he leaves office in six years - or more, acknowledging he had made a joke about exceeding presidential term limits.</p><p>Some lawmakers bristled at the summit, saying that the Trump administration had missed an opportunity to explore real challenges facing social media ahead of the 2020 election, amid heightened fears about the spread of hate speech and even harder-to-detect viral falsehoods.</p><p>\"It's not surprising that one of the loudest disseminators of misinformation is inviting known extremists and conspiracy theory peddlers to the White House social media summit,\" tweeted Rep.

And this week, President Trump goes to New York to join other  world leaders there for the first time.  With plenty of hot spots to  discuss, what will the president focus on and what action will he seek?  </p><p>Joining us live here in Washington, the president's national security  advisor, General H.R. McMaster.  </p><p>General, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p>MCMASTER:  Thanks, Chris, great to be here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  As we say, President Trump speaks to the U.N. General Assembly on  Tuesday, his first time on that stage.  How important does he think the  speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his  doctrine of America First?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously  to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really  three things.  First is to protect the American people, the second is to  promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote  accountability and sovereignty.  And in those three things will allow him  to communicate his vision for America's role in the world, but also what  his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but  also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the  sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, let's unpack that and let's start with issue number one.   And that, of course, is North Korea.  The president tweeted about that this  morning.  Let's put it up on the screen.  </p><p>The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night,  asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas  lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.</p><p>Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from  the president before or is that a new one?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, that's a new one and I think maybe for the president, but  it reminds me of a cover of the \"Economist\" a few years ago, portraying him  as Rocket Man.  But, of course, that's where the rockets are coming from.   Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they  do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  But let me --  </p><p>MCMASTER:  As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global  problem.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's pick up on that, here's what you had to say on Friday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCMASTER:  We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road.   And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of  a military option, there is a military option.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  General, what does that mean, out of road?  The fact is you want  to get sanctions more time.  You're not about to go to war.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat  continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have.   We're out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of  North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long,  drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an  agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks.  </p><p>And what that agreement does, though, that's particularly dangerous  oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo  as the new normal.  And this regime is so close now to threatening the  United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move  with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing,  if necessary, a military option.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, how do you draw that line?  How do you decide we've reached  the point that we have to move to a military option now?  How long do you  get sanctions?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this.  So, we  can't really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are  coming to.  </p><p>But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing  militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies  and partners to be as effective as we can.  And what we recognize is not  really much time.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  The administration -- I want to pick up on one part  of that.  The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea's  trading partners.  </p><p>Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will use economic sanctions to  bring North Korea to the table.  </p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  You're saying stopping trade with China?  </p><p>MNUCHIN:  Stopping trade with anybody.  Nobody would be off the table.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China.  They're our  single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for  export of goods.  </p><p>General, we're not about to cut off trade with China.  It would crater our  economy.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, this is an indication, isn't it, of how serious this  problem is with North Korea, and why it's in all of our interest to work  together to resolve it.  So, of course, we China to help as much as they  can.  You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over  North Korea.  And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it's in  their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, I mean, let's be serious here.  We're not going to cut off  all trade with China.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade  in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that  allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their  missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own  people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn't it  possible -- in fact, isn't it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key  to his survival is to have a nuclear capability?  He talked this week about  having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there's nothing that can be done  diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him  from pursuing that effort.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that  continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more  vulnerable and makes him less and less secure.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject.  The president is also going to  talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations.  But this week,  he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of  the nuclear deal.  He didn't do that.</p><p>So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement.  I know he has to  recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this  talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn't he going to live with  it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, we have to see what live with it means, right?  Live with  can't be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability.  And so,  a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that  agreement.  It is under-enforced now.  We know Iran has already violated  parts of the agreement by -- </p><p>WALLACE:  But the IAEA says that they're complying with it, sir.</p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the IAEA has identified and we've identified some of these  breaches that Iran has then corrected.  But what does that tell you about  Iranian behavior?  They're not just walking up to the line on the  agreement.  They're crossing the line at times.  </p><p>So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have  to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal.  It is -- as the president  said -- it is the worst deal.  It gave all these benefits to the Iranian  regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this  humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East.  </p><p>This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist  organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of  the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad  regime in Syria are Iranian proxies.  </p><p>And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian  destabilizing behavior and we can't allow this deal to enable that.  Their  missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian  network with more and more destructive capability that places all their  neighbors at risk.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is  terror.  The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to  continue its war on terror.  Here's what he had to say this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the  previous eight years against ISIS.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  But, I don't have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London  subway this week.  That's the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just  this year.  And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in  pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only  getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S. </p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental  things very effectively.  </p><p>The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and  support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks  against us and against our allies.  </p><p>The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they  resource these kinds of operations.  </p><p>And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology.  And this has a lot  to do with some of Prime Minister May's top priorities, which is to  constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other.  </p><p>And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law  enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability  to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and  defeat them.  </p><p>WALLACE:  There is a report this weekend, I'm sure you read, that says that  President Trump has decided he's not going to pull out of the Paris climate  accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions  but he's going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a  reduced commitment.</p><p>Is that true, sir?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  No, it's false.  That's a false report.  The president decided  to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American  people and because it was a bad deal for the environment.  It gave the  worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon  without significantly reducing those levels.  </p><p>The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air  on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also  provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and  globally.  And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively  within this flawed agreement.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, he's out of the Paris Climate Accord?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  He's out of the Paris Climate Accord.  What he said, the door is  open.  If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing  from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if  there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But the allies said they're not going to renegotiate.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the president's ears are open, though, if at some point  they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the  president's very legitimate concerns about Paris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  One final area.  It's widely known in Washington that you  and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world.  One of the  first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a  regular official member of the NSC.  </p><p>He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as  globalists.  He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to  double down in Afghanistan.  </p><p>Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the  White House?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the  president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and  agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with  multiple options.  And then, based on his decisions, to help the president  implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the  interests of the American people.  </p><p>And so, what's important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to  manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda.  You  know, we're advancing the president's agenda and we are advancing policies  and strategies that are for the American people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker.  Are you saying  that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and  advance his own agenda?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the  president well in bringing him multiple options.  There were some who try  to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that  didn't serve the president well.  </p><p>WALLACE:  That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  I think this has been too hyped on one individual.  I mean,  these reports of feuding, this really didn't even happen.  I mean, we had  our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council,  and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that  door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process.  </p><p>WALLACE:  General McMaster, thank you.  Thanks for your time.  You're a  busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  It's always a pleasure, Chris.  Thank you.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.  And we'll be watching the president's speech, of  course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll talk with two leading senators about the  president's move to cut deals with Democrats.  How long will it affect the  Trump agenda and how long will it last?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  President Trump had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and  Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a  deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters  worried.  So, where do we stand on DACA and whose driving the agenda now  here in Washington?  </p><p>Joining us from Chicago, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.   And here in Washington, Republican Senator Roy Blunt.  </p><p>Well, gentlemen, let's start with the big question here in Washington.  The  most immediate question, does President Trump have a deal with speaker --  former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to  DACA or not?  </p><p>And here's part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The wall is going to be  built, and it will be funded a little bit later.  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  It was a very, very  positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without  insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.  </p><p>TRUMP:  They cannot obstruct the wall.  The wall, to me, is vital.  If I  don't get the wall, then we will become the obstruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points.  Is there  a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall?  And is there  a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship?  </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, there's a basic  understanding.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President  Thursday night.  They came to a basic understanding, without the details,  without the obvious negotiations that have to follow.  And then, Chuck and  Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a  press release, so it's clear on both sides what we've agreed to.  They did  exactly that.  </p><p>There was great pushback from the right.  They didn't like the parameters  of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since.  But  we are going forward.  We are going forward with the understanding that we  can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes  DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM  Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection.   Those are the two pillars of this understanding.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the  president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Yes.  </p><p>WALLACE:  That's pretty brief.  </p><p>OK.  Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the  citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday.  Let's take a look at  that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're not talking about amnesty at all.  We have not talked about  amnesty.  There will be no amnesty.  We're not talking about that as part  of the transaction.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there's  genuine confusion here in Washington.  Do you believe that there is a deal  on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could  support?  </p><p>SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI:  Well, I think there's a desire to come to a  conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border  security as part of the understanding, but the details haven't been worked  out, another thing that he mentioned.  </p><p>Well, the details here matter.  You know, it's always been three separate  questions in my view.  One is, how do you secure the border?  Two is, what  are the legitimate workforce needs of the country?  And three, what you do  with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the DREAMers, were  brought to the country illegally?  </p><p>I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve  the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here.  If  you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably  solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and  deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally.  </p><p>But you're not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way  unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point  in the future say the border is now operationally secure.  That allows  everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris.  </p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be  as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border,  does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for  the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for  DREAMers?  </p><p>BLUNT:  It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it  doesn't have to include the wall at this point I don't think.  There are a  lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms  of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn't have to take the test that  everybody else takes?  How long would you have to be here under the DREAM  Act (ph)?  There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let's turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or  not President Trump is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats  at the expense of Republicans.  Here is what the president had to say about  that on Air Force One.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to  do more work.  If they are unable to stick together, then I'm going to have  to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass  Obamacare repeal and replace, isn't it wise for this president to go to  Democrats and look for some votes?  </p><p>BLUNT:  Well, I think the minority can't abuse the rules of the Senate.   But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work  with you to get most things done.  The tenures -- I was either the chief  deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10  years that didn't have Democrats vote for them.  That's part of the work --  that's how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else  to move forward.  </p><p>So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it  impossible to get your work done because you've lost your own side is not  part of that either.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a  real -- not permanent, but working alliance between President Trump and  congressional Democrats?  And what you say to those members -- folks on the  left who don't trust this president and don't trust making deals with him?  </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, of course, there will  be people on the right and left who will be critical.  But Senator Roy  Blunt and I are good examples of how this can work.  I have joined him and  applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in  the United States on a bipartisan basis.  Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray  joined us.  </p><p>Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other  leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey  assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn't  shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we'll do it  on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President.  That's what American wants.  And the  president said, I'll take it.  </p><p>We did it.  And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another,  respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a  goal.  Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last  two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to  make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we  achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate.   It can be done.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But there are some differences.  I mean, you talked for instance  about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending.  </p><p>And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax  reform.  The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate  tax, Democrats opposed both.  The president talks about paying for tax cuts  based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that.  </p><p>Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences,  fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Chris, there will be differences, but that's what the Senate is  all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the  Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment  process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to  some degree.  That's where you get the best legislation and that's where  you get something the American people can trust.  </p><p>Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to  achieve it.  We proved that with repeal and replace.  That did not achieve  what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with  insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018  midterm elections?  You have the president out on the stump recently with  North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp.  This is somebody who was a vulnerable  Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in  2018.  The president is saying nice things about her.  </p><p>When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his  basic campaign pledges, couldn't this hurt Republicans in 2018?  </p><p>BLUNT:  Well, on the tax front, it's very important we get something done - - increases take-home pay for working families, that we're almost into a  decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home  pay.  A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates  better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where  we should be headed.  </p><p>We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that.  But, you  know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we'd be glad  to work with you as long as you don't do these three things that you think  are important parts of the tax package.  That's not a good way to start.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there  was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight.  People angry about the  acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the  death of a drug -- black drug suspect.  I know everyone opposes the  violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the  shooting and appalled by the verdict.  </p><p>So, what's your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a  lot of people in the African-American community?  </p><p>BLUNT:  Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in  what the chiefs are doing.  I also talked to a number of community leaders  and African-American pastors.  I do think this is a place where we have to  figure out how to come together.  You do have to accept what the judge who  has the obligation to look at this case determined.  </p><p>But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the  community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders  have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson.  This happened before  that happened.  And we just need to continue to watch this.  </p><p>The division in the country whether it's St. Louis or Baltimore is not a  good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both.  We'll stay on top  of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out  in Congress.  Thank you all, gentlemen.  </p><p>Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President Trump's new  search for votes on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's potential  deal to protect DREAMers without getting funding for the border wall?  </p><p>Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your  question on the air.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump reaching across the aisle on tax  reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty  much where they are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax  reform.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: He likes us. He likes me anyway. </p><p>I said, Mr. President, you're much better off if you can sometimes step  right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction  you're boxed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on  a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to President Trump to  deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. </p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt  Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace,  Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of  townhall.com. </p><p>Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he  wasn't doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from  both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what President Trump  is doing here, and will it work? </p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better  dealmaker. I think that's -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the  job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston,  terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual  partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal. </p><p>And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe  we'll do a little more.</p><p>Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their  base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may  be smaller than people would like. But I think it's perfectly reasonable. I  -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because  it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when  they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have  a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base.</p><p>WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what  are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with  Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare  repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said,  on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what  they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there's such  big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with  the Democrats? </p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think you have to put this in  context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan.  With McConnell in particular, there's just not much of a relationship  there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the  president sees that McConnell just can't get it over the finish line,  there's not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there  was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on  the Capitol. </p><p>And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but  Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a  president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with  someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they  are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an  agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he's been hearing from people  like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is  actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like  Trump, who isn't particularly ideological, who doesn't have deep roots to  the conservative movement or Republican ideology. </p><p>WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well,  maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes.</p><p>PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you've seen the  president multiple times when he's had a chance to go to the mat over the  wall and say, I'm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I'm  going to veto it over this wall. He's backed off. And I think that for his  base, that's going to continue to be a frustration, but he's certainly  shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit. </p><p>WALLACE:  We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the  president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of  confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let's put some of  it up.</p><p>Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get  funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he  rally his base? </p><p>And Rick Conner posted this on FaceBook, how do you think amnesty for these  illegals will square with the president's campaign promises to the  contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall  and all? </p><p>Guy, how do you answer them?</p><p>GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's what everyone is trying to figure  out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just  interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure  out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the  contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to  be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the  future. Unclear. </p><p>But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the  gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats  agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration  enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for  something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a  victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40  billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of  fencing. That's a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in  the so-called \"border surge.\" So there's a chance that while the wall might  be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or  framed as a wall or a physical barrier. </p><p>WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it's crazy to ask you what's the  base going to do, but I'm going to ask you, what do you think the reaction  of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on  DACA that includes citizenship and doesn't include a wall as it had been  commonly thought to exist? </p><p>BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio  for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened  the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some  trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But,  overall, there was a sense that they trust President Trump, that they think  that he's three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he's got  their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board  for most of his supporters. So that's what I would guess would be the case,  unless it is egregiously bad. </p><p>WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think  is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the  prospects for a deal on tax reform? </p><p>RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell  you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with  Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership.  You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and  they see this. They say he knows our interests, he's going to do what is  best for us.</p><p>There's a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I  heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What  is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses  of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing  for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you  that. </p><p>For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership  who were saying that they don't understand why he took the wall off the  table to begin with. It's the number one bargaining chip, they said, in  terms of negotiating a deal. If you're going to take it off the table with  Democrats, you should get something for it. So they're going to try to push  him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that  is possible that conservatives could vote for it.</p><p>WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two  senators, they're so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy,  on whether or not it's going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put  in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is  a guess whether or not it's going to happen. </p><p>BADE: Yes, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in  trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift  we're seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to  now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill,  Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn,  they've all been writing a Republican bill and they're about to unveil it. </p><p>Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing  taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and  goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a  tax bill. So there's a fear that he's overstepping right now in terms of  reaching out to Democrats and they're concerned that this is going to  undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what  he wants to do. </p><p>WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker? </p><p>GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this  big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are  going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in  December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the  majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions  Schumer most wanted. And --</p><p>WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can  keep the debt ceiling going till March. </p><p>GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the  majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And  Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn't break -- he couldn't say no. So  we're a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think  the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than  they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that's the way I'd  drive it. I'd say these people are so ideological they'd rather sacrifice  the dreamers. </p><p>WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington. </p><p>All right, panel, we have to take a break here. </p><p>When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley,  powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We'll  bring back the panel to discuss Congress' new scrutiny of big tech. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we're still at the tip of  the iceberg. The fact is, I don't think FaceBook has put the resources, the  time. My understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those  accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after FaceBook admitted  it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to  Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and  Special Counsel Robert Mueller. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see  the end of Washington's hands-off approach to big tech and especially these  huge Internet companies? </p><p>GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the  curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they  can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that  having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying  nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are  the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age,  they have enormous power. And I don't think you, in a free society, you  can't have power that's hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of  billionaires.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy  himself before he went into politics, said, that it's the wild, wild west  there. Now, some people would say that's one of the reasons it succeed. Are  you saying put government clamps on it? </p><p>GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are  small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that  there's some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have  global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in  effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company  and wipe -- I mean they can be anti-conservative, they can be anti-liberal,  they can do all sorts of things, and there's been almost no supervision,  just to surface (ph) the information. </p><p>WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you'd  agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet  companies, like FaceBook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on  Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a  partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet  behemoths? </p><p>BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the  sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now.  Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech  industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia- linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is  oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people's  private information being gathered and what happens if they're hacked. And  so those are all concerns.</p><p>So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington  and they're typically anti-regulation. But it's safe to say that this sort  of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else. </p><p>WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber  hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but  with some guardrails? </p><p>BADE: I think that's the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with  right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow,  that influences everyone's life so much? Look, there's a test case that's  going on right now on Capitol Hill. There's going to be some hearings  coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech  companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet.  Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the  Internet. </p><p>So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is  putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this  is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can't -- if they're  not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason  to regulate, then it's safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power. </p><p>WALLACE: It's funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the  big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in \"The  Wall Street Journal\" that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies  has just skyrocketed in the last few years. </p><p>Julie, where are President Trump and his administration on this? You talk  about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating  FaceBook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation. </p><p>PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So,  look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when  it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which  really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon's and FaceBooks and  presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are  growing strong and are dominating on the global stage. </p><p>Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the  leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his  administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don't think you  can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that.  But he's also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos's role in owning  \"The Washington Post,\" he's taken on Amazon on his Twitter account. </p><p>I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president's  populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and  some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the  same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he  looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration  of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant  like Amazon. </p><p>WALLACE: Yes. There's also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy,  about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don't  have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on main street  does have to pay taxes. </p><p>PACE: And that's when you've see him go after Amazon in particular for.  He's done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be  interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax  reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package. </p><p>WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn't it?</p><p>PACE: Yes (ph).</p><p>WALLACE:  That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because,  Guy, there's another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and  that's growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p>You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope  will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion  discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and  lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild  west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p>BENSON: That's right. So you'll have Democrats, in particular I think,  focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in  Silicon Valley. And then you'll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded  to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla  a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having  traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of  Google. </p><p>Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against  conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having  information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about  that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying,  uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this  country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on  both sides, rather, start to dig in. </p><p>WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich,  because there's no question that these companies have been engines of huge  economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington --  obviously there's a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington  getting more involved in regulation of the Internet? </p><p>BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker  raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith  in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is  very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of  innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn't exist as it does  today if the government's clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one.  And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from  D.C., I'm just not sure that works out well. </p><p>WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker. </p><p>GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department  of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American  history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged  by government. And that's overall been good for protecting our liberty. </p><p>WALLACE: All right. We'll continue this debate. </p><p>This is an important subject and we'll keep talking about it. </p><p>Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The doctor who keeps both the  Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in  pro sports. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream  of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of  derailing those hopes, which brings us to our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine,  people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better. </p><p>WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the  time she's the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she's  the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington  Nationals. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head  doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL? </p><p>WEST: I don't even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my  mind. I -- I never think of myself as different. </p><p>WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose  tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She  examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a  season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle. </p><p>West told us how different injuries are in the two sports. </p><p>WEST: It's over use typically in baseball. We're dealing with a lot of  shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it's a lot of  traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage  quickly. </p><p>WALLACE: That's another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out  of the game. But in football -- </p><p>WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I'm examining the kid, is he going to  play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly. </p><p>WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision.</p><p>WEST: I'm the players' doctor, right? So it's -- I want the best for the  player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don't work for the team, I -- I  want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players' best  interests. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to  doing your job? </p><p>WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and  their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high  regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they  are very trusting, I think. </p><p>WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries,  but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the  field. </p><p>WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he's a  mental fortress. But yet I have another player who's coming to me and  saying, I'm just -- I'm so depressed.  I'm not around my team. I -- and  they're coming to me and they're asking me for help on the mental side. </p><p>WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body. Her mom  noticed. </p><p>WEST: When I was five, she got me a \"Gray's Anatomy\" book for Christmas. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Why?</p><p>WEST: That was my present. I don't know. I just was fascinated by it.</p><p>WALLACE:  Now the big concern is brain injuries, but she says the NFL has  developed a much stricter policy on concussions. </p><p>WEST: I think football's the safest it's ever been. </p><p>WALLACE: Before Washington, West was an assistant team doctor for the  Pittsburgh Steelers and got two Super Bowl rings. Her dream now, to win  championships in both football and baseball. </p><p>WEST: That's our goal, right? That's everyone's goal on the team is to keep  the players healthy and to be as successful as we can. It's a pentacle, and  you can't get any better than that. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: Dr. West says the Redskins have 15 medical professionals at each  game on the field and up in the stands watching to see if any player gets  hurt and relaying that information to her. </p><p>And that's it for today. Have a great week. And we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

How important does he think the  speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his  doctrine of America First?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously  to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really  three things.  First is to protect the American people, the second is to  promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote  accountability and sovereignty.  And in those three things will allow him  to communicate his vision for America's role in the world, but also what  his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but  also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the  sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, let's unpack that and let's start with issue number one.   And that, of course, is North Korea.  The president tweeted about that this  morning.  Let's put it up on the screen.  </p><p> The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night,  asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas  lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.</p><p> Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from  the president before or is that a new one?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, that's a new one and I think maybe for the president, but  it reminds me of a cover of the \"Economist\" a few years ago, portraying him  as Rocket Man.  But, of course, that's where the rockets are coming from.   Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they  do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  But let me --  </p><p> MCMASTER:  As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global  problem.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's pick up on that, here's what you had to say on Friday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCMASTER:  We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road.   And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of  a military option, there is a military option.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  General, what does that mean, out of road?  The fact is you want  to get sanctions more time.  You're not about to go to war.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat  continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have.   We're out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of  North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long,  drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an  agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks.  </p><p> And what that agreement does, though, that's particularly dangerous  oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo  as the new normal.  And this regime is so close now to threatening the  United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move  with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing,  if necessary, a military option.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, how do you draw that line?  How do you decide we've reached  the point that we have to move to a military option now?  How long do you  get sanctions?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this.  So, we  can't really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are  coming to.  </p><p> But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing  militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies  and partners to be as effective as we can.  And what we recognize is not  really much time.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  The administration -- I want to pick up on one part  of that.  The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea's  trading partners.  </p><p> Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will use economic sanctions to  bring North Korea to the table.  </p><p> BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  You're saying stopping trade with China?  </p><p> MNUCHIN:  Stopping trade with anybody.  Nobody would be off the table.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China.  They're our  single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for  export of goods.  </p><p> General, we're not about to cut off trade with China.  It would crater our  economy.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, this is an indication, isn't it, of how serious this  problem is with North Korea, and why it's in all of our interest to work  together to resolve it.  So, of course, we China to help as much as they  can.  You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over  North Korea.  And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it's in  their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But, I mean, let's be serious here.  We're not going to cut off  all trade with China.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade  in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that  allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their  missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own  people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn't it  possible -- in fact, isn't it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key  to his survival is to have a nuclear capability?  He talked this week about  having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there's nothing that can be done  diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him  from pursuing that effort.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that  continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more  vulnerable and makes him less and less secure.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject.  The president is also going to  talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations.  But this week,  he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of  the nuclear deal.  He didn't do that.</p><p> So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement.  I know he has to  recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this  talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn't he going to live with  it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, we have to see what live with it means, right?  Live with  can't be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability.  And so,  a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that  agreement.  It is under-enforced now.  We know Iran has already violated  parts of the agreement by -- </p><p> WALLACE:  But the IAEA says that they're complying with it, sir.</p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the IAEA has identified and we've identified some of these  breaches that Iran has then corrected.  But what does that tell you about  Iranian behavior?  They're not just walking up to the line on the  agreement.  They're crossing the line at times.  </p><p> So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have  to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal.  It is -- as the president  said -- it is the worst deal.  It gave all these benefits to the Iranian  regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this  humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East.  </p><p> This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist  organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of  the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad  regime in Syria are Iranian proxies.  </p><p> And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian  destabilizing behavior and we can't allow this deal to enable that.  Their  missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian  network with more and more destructive capability that places all their  neighbors at risk.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is  terror.  The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to  continue its war on terror.  Here's what he had to say this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the  previous eight years against ISIS.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  But, I don't have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London  subway this week.  That's the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just  this year.  And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in  pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only  getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S.</p><p> MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental  things very effectively.  </p><p> The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and  support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks  against us and against our allies.  </p><p> The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they  resource these kinds of operations.  </p><p> And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology.  And this has a lot  to do with some of Prime Minister May's top priorities, which is to  constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other.  </p><p> And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law  enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability  to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and  defeat them.  </p><p> WALLACE:  There is a report this weekend, I'm sure you read, that says that  President Trump has decided he's not going to pull out of the Paris climate  accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions  but he's going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a  reduced commitment.</p><p> Is that true, sir?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  No, it's false.  That's a false report.  The president decided  to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American  people and because it was a bad deal for the environment.  It gave the  worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon  without significantly reducing those levels.  </p><p> The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air  on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also  provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and  globally.  And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively  within this flawed agreement.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, he's out of the Paris Climate Accord?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  He's out of the Paris Climate Accord.  What he said, the door is  open.  If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing  from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if  there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  But the allies said they're not going to renegotiate.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the president's ears are open, though, if at some point  they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the  president's very legitimate concerns about Paris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK.  One final area.  It's widely known in Washington that you  and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world.  One of the  first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a  regular official member of the NSC.  </p><p> He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as  globalists.  He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to  double down in Afghanistan.  </p><p> Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the  White House?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the  president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and  agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with  multiple options.  And then, based on his decisions, to help the president  implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the  interests of the American people.  </p><p> And so, what's important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to  manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda.  You  know, we're advancing the president's agenda and we are advancing policies  and strategies that are for the American people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker.  Are you saying  that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and  advance his own agenda?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the  president well in bringing him multiple options.  There were some who try  to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that  didn't serve the president well.  </p><p> WALLACE:  That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  I think this has been too hyped on one individual.  I mean,  these reports of feuding, this really didn't even happen.  I mean, we had  our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council,  and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that  door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process.  </p><p> WALLACE:  General McMaster, thank you.  Thanks for your time.  You're a  busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  It's always a pleasure, Chris.  Thank you.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Thank you.  And we'll be watching the president's speech, of  course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Thank you.</p><p> WALLACE:  Up next, we'll talk with two leading senators about the  president's move to cut deals with Democrats.  How long will it affect the  Trump agenda and how long will it last?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  President Trump had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and  Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a  deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters  worried.  So, where do we stand on DACA and whose driving the agenda now  here in Washington?  </p><p> Joining us from Chicago, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.   And here in Washington, Republican Senator Roy Blunt.  </p><p> Well, gentlemen, let's start with the big question here in Washington.  The  most immediate question, does President Trump have a deal with speaker --  former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to  DACA or not?  </p><p> And here's part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The wall is going to be  built, and it will be funded a little bit later.  </p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  It was a very, very  positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without  insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.  </p><p> TRUMP:  They cannot obstruct the wall.  The wall, to me, is vital.  If I  don't get the wall, then we will become the obstruction.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points.  Is there  a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall?  And is there  a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship?  </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, there's a basic  understanding.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President  Thursday night.  They came to a basic understanding, without the details,  without the obvious negotiations that have to follow.  And then, Chuck and  Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a  press release, so it's clear on both sides what we've agreed to.  They did  exactly that.  </p><p> There was great pushback from the right.  They didn't like the parameters  of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since.  But  we are going forward.  We are going forward with the understanding that we  can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes  DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM  Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection.   Those are the two pillars of this understanding.  </p><p> WALLACE:  And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the  president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night?  </p><p> DURBIN:  Yes.  </p><p> WALLACE:  That's pretty brief.  </p><p> OK.  Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the  citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday.  Let's take a look at  that.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We're not talking about amnesty at all.  We have not talked about  amnesty.  There will be no amnesty.  We're not talking about that as part  of the transaction.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there's  genuine confusion here in Washington.  Do you believe that there is a deal  on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could  support?  </p><p> SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI:  Well, I think there's a desire to come to a  conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border  security as part of the understanding, but the details haven't been worked  out, another thing that he mentioned.  </p><p> Well, the details here matter.  You know, it's always been three separate  questions in my view.  One is, how do you secure the border?  Two is, what  are the legitimate workforce needs of the country?  And three, what you do  with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the DREAMers, were  brought to the country illegally?  </p><p> I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve  the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here.  If  you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably  solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and  deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally.  </p><p> But you're not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way  unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point  in the future say the border is now operationally secure.  That allows  everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris.  </p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be  as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border,  does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for  the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for  DREAMers?  </p><p> BLUNT:  It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it  doesn't have to include the wall at this point I don't think.  There are a  lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms  of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn't have to take the test that  everybody else takes?  How long would you have to be here under the DREAM  Act (ph)?  There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let's turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or  not President Trump is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats  at the expense of Republicans.  Here is what the president had to say about  that on Air Force One.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  If the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to  do more work.  If they are unable to stick together, then I'm going to have  to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass  Obamacare repeal and replace, isn't it wise for this president to go to  Democrats and look for some votes?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, I think the minority can't abuse the rules of the Senate.   But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work  with you to get most things done.  The tenures -- I was either the chief  deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10  years that didn't have Democrats vote for them.  That's part of the work --  that's how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else  to move forward.  </p><p> So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it  impossible to get your work done because you've lost your own side is not  part of that either.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a  real -- not permanent, but working alliance between President Trump and  congressional Democrats?  And what you say to those members -- folks on the  left who don't trust this president and don't trust making deals with him?  </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, of course, there will  be people on the right and left who will be critical.  But Senator Roy  Blunt and I are good examples of how this can work.  I have joined him and  applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in  the United States on a bipartisan basis.  Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray  joined us.  </p><p> Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other  leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey  assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn't  shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we'll do it  on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President.  That's what American wants.  And the  president said, I'll take it.  </p><p> We did it.  And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another,  respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a  goal.  Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last  two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to  make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we  achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate.   It can be done.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But there are some differences.  I mean, you talked for instance  about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending.  </p><p> And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax  reform.  The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate  tax, Democrats opposed both.  The president talks about paying for tax cuts  based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that.  </p><p> Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences,  fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform?  </p><p> DURBIN:  Chris, there will be differences, but that's what the Senate is  all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the  Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment  process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to  some degree.  That's where you get the best legislation and that's where  you get something the American people can trust.  </p><p> Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to  achieve it.  We proved that with repeal and replace.  That did not achieve  what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with  insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018  midterm elections?  You have the president out on the stump recently with  North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp.  This is somebody who was a vulnerable  Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in  2018.  The president is saying nice things about her.  </p><p> When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his  basic campaign pledges, couldn't this hurt Republicans in 2018?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, on the tax front, it's very important we get something done - - increases take-home pay for working families, that we're almost into a  decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home  pay.  A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates  better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where  we should be headed.  </p><p> We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that.  But, you  know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we'd be glad  to work with you as long as you don't do these three things that you think  are important parts of the tax package.  That's not a good way to start.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there  was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight.  People angry about the  acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the  death of a drug -- black drug suspect.  I know everyone opposes the  violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the  shooting and appalled by the verdict.  </p><p> So, what's your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a  lot of people in the African-American community?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in  what the chiefs are doing.  I also talked to a number of community leaders  and African-American pastors.  I do think this is a place where we have to  figure out how to come together.  You do have to accept what the judge who  has the obligation to look at this case determined.  </p><p> But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the  community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders  have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson.  This happened before  that happened.  And we just need to continue to watch this.  </p><p> The division in the country whether it's St. Louis or Baltimore is not a  good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both.  We'll stay on top  of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out  in Congress.  Thank you all, gentlemen.  </p><p> Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President Trump's new  search for votes on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p> Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's potential  deal to protect DREAMers without getting funding for the border wall?  </p><p> Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your  question on the air.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump reaching across the aisle on tax  reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty  much where they are.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax  reform.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: He likes us. He likes me anyway. </p><p> I said, Mr. President, you're much better off if you can sometimes step  right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction  you're boxed.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on  a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to President Trump to  deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. </p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt  Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace,  Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of  townhall.com. </p><p> Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he  wasn't doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from  both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what President Trump  is doing here, and will it work? </p><p> NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better  dealmaker. I think that's -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the  job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston,  terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual  partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal. </p><p> And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe  we'll do a little more.</p><p> Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their  base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may  be smaller than people would like. But I think it's perfectly reasonable. I  -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because  it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when  they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have  a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base.</p><p> WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what  are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with  Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare  repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said,  on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what  they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there's such  big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with  the Democrats? </p><p> JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think you have to put this in  context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan.  With McConnell in particular, there's just not much of a relationship  there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the  president sees that McConnell just can't get it over the finish line,  there's not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there  was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on  the Capitol. </p><p> And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but  Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a  president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with  someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they  are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an  agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he's been hearing from people  like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is  actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like  Trump, who isn't particularly ideological, who doesn't have deep roots to  the conservative movement or Republican ideology. </p><p> WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well,  maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes.</p><p> PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you've seen the  president multiple times when he's had a chance to go to the mat over the  wall and say, I'm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I'm  going to veto it over this wall. He's backed off. And I think that for his  base, that's going to continue to be a frustration, but he's certainly  shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit. </p><p> WALLACE:  We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the  president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of  confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let's put some of  it up.</p><p> Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get  funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he  rally his base? </p><p> And Rick Conner posted this on FaceBook, how do you think amnesty for these  illegals will square with the president's campaign promises to the  contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall  and all? </p><p> Guy, how do you answer them?</p><p> GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's what everyone is trying to figure  out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just  interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure  out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the  contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to  be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the  future. Unclear. </p><p> But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the  gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats  agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration  enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for  something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a  victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40  billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of  fencing. That's a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in  the so-called \"border surge.\" So there's a chance that while the wall might  be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or  framed as a wall or a physical barrier. </p><p> WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it's crazy to ask you what's the  base going to do, but I'm going to ask you, what do you think the reaction  of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on  DACA that includes citizenship and doesn't include a wall as it had been  commonly thought to exist? </p><p> BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio  for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened  the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some  trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But,  overall, there was a sense that they trust President Trump, that they think  that he's three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he's got  their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board  for most of his supporters. So that's what I would guess would be the case,  unless it is egregiously bad. </p><p> WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think  is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the  prospects for a deal on tax reform? </p><p> RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell  you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with  Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership.  You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and  they see this. They say he knows our interests, he's going to do what is  best for us.</p><p> There's a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I  heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What  is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses  of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing  for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you  that. </p><p> For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership  who were saying that they don't understand why he took the wall off the  table to begin with. It's the number one bargaining chip, they said, in  terms of negotiating a deal. If you're going to take it off the table with  Democrats, you should get something for it. So they're going to try to push  him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that  is possible that conservatives could vote for it.</p><p> WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two  senators, they're so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy,  on whether or not it's going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put  in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is  a guess whether or not it's going to happen. </p><p> BADE: Yes, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in  trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift  we're seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to  now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill,  Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn,  they've all been writing a Republican bill and they're about to unveil it. </p><p> Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing  taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and  goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a  tax bill. So there's a fear that he's overstepping right now in terms of  reaching out to Democrats and they're concerned that this is going to  undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what  he wants to do. </p><p> WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker? </p><p> GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this  big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are  going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in  December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the  majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions  Schumer most wanted. And --</p><p> WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can  keep the debt ceiling going till March. </p><p> GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the  majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And  Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn't break -- he couldn't say no. So  we're a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think  the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than  they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that's the way I'd  drive it. I'd say these people are so ideological they'd rather sacrifice  the dreamers. </p><p> WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington. </p><p> All right, panel, we have to take a break here. </p><p> When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley,  powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We'll  bring back the panel to discuss Congress' new scrutiny of big tech. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we're still at the tip of  the iceberg. The fact is, I don't think FaceBook has put the resources, the  time. My understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those  accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after FaceBook admitted  it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to  Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and  Special Counsel Robert Mueller. </p><p> And we're back now with the panel.</p><p> Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see  the end of Washington's hands-off approach to big tech and especially these  huge Internet companies? </p><p> GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the  curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they  can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that  having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying  nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are  the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age,  they have enormous power. And I don't think you, in a free society, you  can't have power that's hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of  billionaires.</p><p> WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy  himself before he went into politics, said, that it's the wild, wild west  there. Now, some people would say that's one of the reasons it succeed. Are  you saying put government clamps on it? </p><p> GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are  small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that  there's some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have  global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in  effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company  and wipe -- I mean they can be anti-conservative, they can be anti-liberal,  they can do all sorts of things, and there's been almost no supervision,  just to surface (ph) the information. </p><p> WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you'd  agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet  companies, like FaceBook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on  Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a  partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet  behemoths? </p><p> BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the  sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now.  Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech  industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia- linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is  oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people's  private information being gathered and what happens if they're hacked. And  so those are all concerns.</p><p> So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington  and they're typically anti-regulation. But it's safe to say that this sort  of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else. </p><p> WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber  hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but  with some guardrails? </p><p> BADE: I think that's the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with  right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow,  that influences everyone's life so much? Look, there's a test case that's  going on right now on Capitol Hill. There's going to be some hearings  coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech  companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet.  Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the  Internet. </p><p> So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is  putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this  is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can't -- if they're  not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason  to regulate, then it's safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power. </p><p> WALLACE: It's funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the  big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in \"The  Wall Street Journal\" that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies  has just skyrocketed in the last few years. </p><p> Julie, where are President Trump and his administration on this? You talk  about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating  FaceBook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation. </p><p> PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So,  look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when  it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which  really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon's and FaceBooks and  presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are  growing strong and are dominating on the global stage. </p><p> Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the  leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his  administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don't think you  can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that.  But he's also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos's role in owning  \"The Washington Post,\" he's taken on Amazon on his Twitter account. </p><p> I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president's  populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and  some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the  same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he  looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration  of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant  like Amazon. </p><p> WALLACE: Yes. There's also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy,  about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don't  have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on main street  does have to pay taxes. </p><p> PACE: And that's when you've see him go after Amazon in particular for.  He's done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be  interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax  reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package. </p><p> WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn't it?</p><p> PACE: Yes (ph).</p><p> WALLACE:  That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because,  Guy, there's another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and  that's growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p> You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope  will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion  discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and  lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild  west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p> BENSON: That's right. So you'll have Democrats, in particular I think,  focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in  Silicon Valley. And then you'll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded  to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla  a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having  traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of  Google. </p><p> Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against  conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having  information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about  that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying,  uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this  country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on  both sides, rather, start to dig in. </p><p> WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich,  because there's no question that these companies have been engines of huge  economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington --  obviously there's a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington  getting more involved in regulation of the Internet? </p><p> BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker  raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith  in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is  very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of  innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn't exist as it does  today if the government's clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one.  And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from  D.C., I'm just not sure that works out well. </p><p> WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker. </p><p> GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department  of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American  history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged  by government. And that's overall been good for protecting our liberty. </p><p> WALLACE: All right. We'll continue this debate. </p><p> This is an important subject and we'll keep talking about it. </p><p> Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p> Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The doctor who keeps both the  Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in  pro sports. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream  of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of  derailing those hopes, which brings us to our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine,  people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better. </p><p> WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the  time she's the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she's  the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington  Nationals. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head  doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL? </p><p> WEST: I don't even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my  mind. I -- I never think of myself as different. </p><p> WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose  tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She  examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a  season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle. </p><p> West told us how different injuries are in the two sports. </p><p> WEST: It's over use typically in baseball. We're dealing with a lot of  shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it's a lot of  traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage  quickly. </p><p> WALLACE: That's another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out  of the game. But in football -- </p><p> WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I'm examining the kid, is he going to  play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly. </p><p> WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision.</p><p> WEST: I'm the players' doctor, right? So it's -- I want the best for the  player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don't work for the team, I -- I  want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players' best  interests. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to  doing your job? </p><p> WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and  their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high  regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they  are very trusting, I think. </p><p> WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries,  but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the  field. </p><p> WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he's a  mental fortress. But yet I have another player who's coming to me and  saying, I'm just -- I'm so depressed.  I'm not around my team. I -- and  they're coming to me and they're asking me for help on the mental side. </p><p> WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body. Her mom  noticed. </p><p> WEST: When I was five, she got me a \"Gray's Anatomy\" book for Christmas. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): Why?</p><p> WEST: That was my present. I don't know. I just was fascinated by it.</p><p> WALLACE:  Now the big concern is brain injuries, but she says the NFL has  developed a much stricter policy on concussions. </p><p> WEST: I think football's the safest it's ever been. </p><p> WALLACE: Before Washington, West was an assistant team doctor for the  Pittsburgh Steelers and got two Super Bowl rings. Her dream now, to win  championships in both football and baseball. </p><p> WEST: That's our goal, right? That's everyone's goal on the team is to keep  the players healthy and to be as successful as we can. It's a pentacle, and  you can't get any better than that. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: Dr. West says the Redskins have 15 medical professionals at each  game on the field and up in the stands watching to see if any player gets  hurt and relaying that information to her. </p><p> And that's it for today. Have a great week. And we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

And this week, President Trump goes to New York to join other  world leaders there for the first time.  With plenty of hot spots to  discuss, what will the president focus on and what action will he seek?  </p><p> Joining us live here in Washington, the president's national security  advisor, General H.R. McMaster.  </p><p> General, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p> MCMASTER:  Thanks, Chris, great to be here.  </p><p> WALLACE:  As we say, President Trump speaks to the U.N. General Assembly on  Tuesday, his first time on that stage.  How important does he think the  speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his  doctrine of America First?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously  to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really  three things.  First is to protect the American people, the second is to  promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote  accountability and sovereignty.  And in those three things will allow him  to communicate his vision for America's role in the world, but also what  his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but  also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the  sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, let's unpack that and let's start with issue number one.   And that, of course, is North Korea.  The president tweeted about that this  morning.  Let's put it up on the screen.  </p><p> The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night,  asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas  lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.</p><p> Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from  the president before or is that a new one?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, that's a new one and I think maybe for the president, but  it reminds me of a cover of the \"Economist\" a few years ago, portraying him  as Rocket Man.  But, of course, that's where the rockets are coming from.   Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they  do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  But let me --  </p><p> MCMASTER:  As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global  problem.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's pick up on that, here's what you had to say on Friday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCMASTER:  We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road.   And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of  a military option, there is a military option.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  General, what does that mean, out of road?  The fact is you want  to get sanctions more time.  You're not about to go to war.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat  continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have.   We're out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of  North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long,  drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an  agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks.  </p><p> And what that agreement does, though, that's particularly dangerous  oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo  as the new normal.  And this regime is so close now to threatening the  United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move  with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing,  if necessary, a military option.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, how do you draw that line?  How do you decide we've reached  the point that we have to move to a military option now?  How long do you  get sanctions?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this.  So, we  can't really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are  coming to.  </p><p> But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing  militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies  and partners to be as effective as we can.  And what we recognize is not  really much time.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  The administration -- I want to pick up on one part  of that.  The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea's  trading partners.  </p><p> Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will use economic sanctions to  bring North Korea to the table.  </p><p> BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  You're saying stopping trade with China?  </p><p> MNUCHIN:  Stopping trade with anybody.  Nobody would be off the table.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China.  They're our  single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for  export of goods.  </p><p> General, we're not about to cut off trade with China.  It would crater our  economy.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, this is an indication, isn't it, of how serious this  problem is with North Korea, and why it's in all of our interest to work  together to resolve it.  So, of course, we China to help as much as they  can.  You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over  North Korea.  And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it's in  their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But, I mean, let's be serious here.  We're not going to cut off  all trade with China.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade  in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that  allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their  missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own  people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn't it  possible -- in fact, isn't it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key  to his survival is to have a nuclear capability?  He talked this week about  having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there's nothing that can be done  diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him  from pursuing that effort.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that  continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more  vulnerable and makes him less and less secure.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject.  The president is also going to  talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations.  But this week,  he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of  the nuclear deal.  He didn't do that.</p><p> So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement.  I know he has to  recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this  talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn't he going to live with  it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, we have to see what live with it means, right?  Live with  can't be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability.  And so,  a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that  agreement.  It is under-enforced now.  We know Iran has already violated  parts of the agreement by -- </p><p> WALLACE:  But the IAEA says that they're complying with it, sir.</p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the IAEA has identified and we've identified some of these  breaches that Iran has then corrected.  But what does that tell you about  Iranian behavior?  They're not just walking up to the line on the  agreement.  They're crossing the line at times.  </p><p> So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have  to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal.  It is -- as the president  said -- it is the worst deal.  It gave all these benefits to the Iranian  regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this  humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East.  </p><p> This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist  organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of  the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad  regime in Syria are Iranian proxies.  </p><p> And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian  destabilizing behavior and we can't allow this deal to enable that.  Their  missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian  network with more and more destructive capability that places all their  neighbors at risk.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is  terror.  The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to  continue its war on terror.  Here's what he had to say this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the  previous eight years against ISIS.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  But, I don't have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London  subway this week.  That's the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just  this year.  And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in  pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only  getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S. </p><p> MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental  things very effectively.  </p><p> The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and  support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks  against us and against our allies.  </p><p> The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they  resource these kinds of operations.  </p><p> And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology.  And this has a lot  to do with some of Prime Minister May's top priorities, which is to  constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other.  </p><p> And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law  enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability  to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and  defeat them.  </p><p> WALLACE:  There is a report this weekend, I'm sure you read, that says that  President Trump has decided he's not going to pull out of the Paris climate  accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions  but he's going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a  reduced commitment.</p><p> Is that true, sir?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  No, it's false.  That's a false report.  The president decided  to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American  people and because it was a bad deal for the environment.  It gave the  worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon  without significantly reducing those levels.  </p><p> The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air  on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also  provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and  globally.  And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively  within this flawed agreement.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, he's out of the Paris Climate Accord?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  He's out of the Paris Climate Accord.  What he said, the door is  open.  If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing  from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if  there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  But the allies said they're not going to renegotiate.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the president's ears are open, though, if at some point  they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the  president's very legitimate concerns about Paris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK.  One final area.  It's widely known in Washington that you  and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world.  One of the  first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a  regular official member of the NSC.  </p><p> He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as  globalists.  He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to  double down in Afghanistan.  </p><p> Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the  White House?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the  president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and  agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with  multiple options.  And then, based on his decisions, to help the president  implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the  interests of the American people.  </p><p> And so, what's important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to  manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda.  You  know, we're advancing the president's agenda and we are advancing policies  and strategies that are for the American people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker.  Are you saying  that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and  advance his own agenda?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the  president well in bringing him multiple options.  There were some who try  to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that  didn't serve the president well.  </p><p> WALLACE:  That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  I think this has been too hyped on one individual.  I mean,  these reports of feuding, this really didn't even happen.  I mean, we had  our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council,  and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that  door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process.  </p><p> WALLACE:  General McMaster, thank you.  Thanks for your time.  You're a  busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  It's always a pleasure, Chris.  Thank you.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Thank you.  And we'll be watching the president's speech, of  course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Thank you.</p><p> WALLACE:  Up next, we'll talk with two leading senators about the  president's move to cut deals with Democrats.  How long will it affect the  Trump agenda and how long will it last?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  President Trump had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and  Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a  deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters  worried.  So, where do we stand on DACA and whose driving the agenda now  here in Washington?  </p><p> Joining us from Chicago, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.   And here in Washington, Republican Senator Roy Blunt.  </p><p> Well, gentlemen, let's start with the big question here in Washington.  The  most immediate question, does President Trump have a deal with speaker --  former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to  DACA or not?  </p><p> And here's part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The wall is going to be  built, and it will be funded a little bit later.  </p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  It was a very, very  positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without  insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.  </p><p> TRUMP:  They cannot obstruct the wall.  The wall, to me, is vital.  If I  don't get the wall, then we will become the obstruction.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points.  Is there  a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall?  And is there  a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship?  </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, there's a basic  understanding.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President  Thursday night.  They came to a basic understanding, without the details,  without the obvious negotiations that have to follow.  And then, Chuck and  Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a  press release, so it's clear on both sides what we've agreed to.  They did  exactly that.  </p><p> There was great pushback from the right.  They didn't like the parameters  of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since.  But  we are going forward.  We are going forward with the understanding that we  can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes  DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM  Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection.   Those are the two pillars of this understanding.  </p><p> WALLACE:  And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the  president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night?  </p><p> DURBIN:  Yes.  </p><p> WALLACE:  That's pretty brief.  </p><p> OK.  Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the  citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday.  Let's take a look at  that.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We're not talking about amnesty at all.  We have not talked about  amnesty.  There will be no amnesty.  We're not talking about that as part  of the transaction.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there's  genuine confusion here in Washington.  Do you believe that there is a deal  on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could  support?  </p><p> SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI:  Well, I think there's a desire to come to a  conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border  security as part of the understanding, but the details haven't been worked  out, another thing that he mentioned.  </p><p> Well, the details here matter.  You know, it's always been three separate  questions in my view.  One is, how do you secure the border?  Two is, what  are the legitimate workforce needs of the country?  And three, what you do  with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the DREAMers, were  brought to the country illegally?  </p><p> I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve  the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here.  If  you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably  solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and  deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally.  </p><p> But you're not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way  unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point  in the future say the border is now operationally secure.  That allows  everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris.  </p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be  as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border,  does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for  the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for  DREAMers?  </p><p> BLUNT:  It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it  doesn't have to include the wall at this point I don't think.  There are a  lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms  of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn't have to take the test that  everybody else takes?  How long would you have to be here under the DREAM  Act (ph)?  There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let's turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or  not President Trump is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats  at the expense of Republicans.  Here is what the president had to say about  that on Air Force One.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  If the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to  do more work.  If they are unable to stick together, then I'm going to have  to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass  Obamacare repeal and replace, isn't it wise for this president to go to  Democrats and look for some votes?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, I think the minority can't abuse the rules of the Senate.   But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work  with you to get most things done.  The tenures -- I was either the chief  deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10  years that didn't have Democrats vote for them.  That's part of the work --  that's how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else  to move forward.  </p><p> So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it  impossible to get your work done because you've lost your own side is not  part of that either.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a  real -- not permanent, but working alliance between President Trump and  congressional Democrats?  And what you say to those members -- folks on the  left who don't trust this president and don't trust making deals with him?  </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, of course, there will  be people on the right and left who will be critical.  But Senator Roy  Blunt and I are good examples of how this can work.  I have joined him and  applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in  the United States on a bipartisan basis.  Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray  joined us.  </p><p> Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other  leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey  assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn't  shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we'll do it  on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President.  That's what American wants.  And the  president said, I'll take it.  </p><p> We did it.  And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another,  respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a  goal.  Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last  two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to  make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we  achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate.   It can be done.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But there are some differences.  I mean, you talked for instance  about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending.  </p><p> And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax  reform.  The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate  tax, Democrats opposed both.  The president talks about paying for tax cuts  based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that.  </p><p> Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences,  fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform?  </p><p> DURBIN:  Chris, there will be differences, but that's what the Senate is  all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the  Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment  process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to  some degree.  That's where you get the best legislation and that's where  you get something the American people can trust.  </p><p> Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to  achieve it.  We proved that with repeal and replace.  That did not achieve  what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with  insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018  midterm elections?  You have the president out on the stump recently with  North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp.  This is somebody who was a vulnerable  Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in  2018.  The president is saying nice things about her.  </p><p> When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his  basic campaign pledges, couldn't this hurt Republicans in 2018?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, on the tax front, it's very important we get something done - - increases take-home pay for working families, that we're almost into a  decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home  pay.  A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates  better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where  we should be headed.  </p><p> We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that.  But, you  know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we'd be glad  to work with you as long as you don't do these three things that you think  are important parts of the tax package.  That's not a good way to start.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there  was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight.  People angry about the  acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the  death of a drug -- black drug suspect.  I know everyone opposes the  violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the  shooting and appalled by the verdict.  </p><p> So, what's your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a  lot of people in the African-American community?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in  what the chiefs are doing.  I also talked to a number of community leaders  and African-American pastors.  I do think this is a place where we have to  figure out how to come together.  You do have to accept what the judge who  has the obligation to look at this case determined.  </p><p> But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the  community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders  have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson.  This happened before  that happened.  And we just need to continue to watch this.  </p><p> The division in the country whether it's St. Louis or Baltimore is not a  good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both.  We'll stay on top  of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out  in Congress.  Thank you all, gentlemen.  </p><p> Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President Trump's new  search for votes on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p> Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's potential  deal to protect DREAMers without getting funding for the border wall?  </p><p> Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your  question on the air.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump reaching across the aisle on tax  reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty  much where they are.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax  reform.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: He likes us. He likes me anyway. </p><p> I said, Mr. President, you're much better off if you can sometimes step  right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction  you're boxed.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on  a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to President Trump to  deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. </p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt  Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace,  Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of  townhall.com. </p><p> Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he  wasn't doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from  both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what President Trump  is doing here, and will it work? </p><p> NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better  dealmaker. I think that's -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the  job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston,  terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual  partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal. </p><p> And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe  we'll do a little more.</p><p> Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their  base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may  be smaller than people would like. But I think it's perfectly reasonable. I  -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because  it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when  they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have  a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base.</p><p> WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what  are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with  Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare  repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said,  on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what  they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there's such  big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with  the Democrats? </p><p> JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think you have to put this in  context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan.  With McConnell in particular, there's just not much of a relationship  there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the  president sees that McConnell just can't get it over the finish line,  there's not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there  was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on  the Capitol. </p><p> And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but  Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a  president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with  someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they  are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an  agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he's been hearing from people  like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is  actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like  Trump, who isn't particularly ideological, who doesn't have deep roots to  the conservative movement or Republican ideology. </p><p> WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well,  maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes.</p><p> PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you've seen the  president multiple times when he's had a chance to go to the mat over the  wall and say, I'm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I'm  going to veto it over this wall. He's backed off. And I think that for his  base, that's going to continue to be a frustration, but he's certainly  shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit. </p><p> WALLACE:  We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the  president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of  confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let's put some of  it up.</p><p> Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get  funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he  rally his base? </p><p> And Rick Conner posted this on FaceBook, how do you think amnesty for these  illegals will square with the president's campaign promises to the  contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall  and all? </p><p> Guy, how do you answer them?</p><p> GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's what everyone is trying to figure  out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just  interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure  out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the  contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to  be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the  future. Unclear. </p><p> But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the  gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats  agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration  enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for  something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a  victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40  billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of  fencing. That's a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in  the so-called \"border surge.\" So there's a chance that while the wall might  be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or  framed as a wall or a physical barrier. </p><p> WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it's crazy to ask you what's the  base going to do, but I'm going to ask you, what do you think the reaction  of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on  DACA that includes citizenship and doesn't include a wall as it had been  commonly thought to exist? </p><p> BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio  for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened  the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some  trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But,  overall, there was a sense that they trust President Trump, that they think  that he's three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he's got  their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board  for most of his supporters. So that's what I would guess would be the case,  unless it is egregiously bad. </p><p> WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think  is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the  prospects for a deal on tax reform? </p><p> RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell  you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with  Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership.  You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and  they see this. They say he knows our interests, he's going to do what is  best for us.</p><p> There's a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I  heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What  is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses  of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing  for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you  that. </p><p> For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership  who were saying that they don't understand why he took the wall off the  table to begin with. It's the number one bargaining chip, they said, in  terms of negotiating a deal. If you're going to take it off the table with  Democrats, you should get something for it. So they're going to try to push  him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that  is possible that conservatives could vote for it.</p><p> WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two  senators, they're so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy,  on whether or not it's going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put  in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is  a guess whether or not it's going to happen. </p><p> BADE: Yes, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in  trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift  we're seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to  now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill,  Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn,  they've all been writing a Republican bill and they're about to unveil it. </p><p> Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing  taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and  goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a  tax bill. So there's a fear that he's overstepping right now in terms of  reaching out to Democrats and they're concerned that this is going to  undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what  he wants to do. </p><p> WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker? </p><p> GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this  big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are  going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in  December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the  majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions  Schumer most wanted. And --</p><p> WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can  keep the debt ceiling going till March. </p><p> GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the  majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And  Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn't break -- he couldn't say no. So  we're a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think  the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than  they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that's the way I'd  drive it. I'd say these people are so ideological they'd rather sacrifice  the dreamers. </p><p> WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington. </p><p> All right, panel, we have to take a break here. </p><p> When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley,  powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We'll  bring back the panel to discuss Congress' new scrutiny of big tech. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we're still at the tip of  the iceberg. The fact is, I don't think FaceBook has put the resources, the  time. My understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those  accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after FaceBook admitted  it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to  Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and  Special Counsel Robert Mueller. </p><p> And we're back now with the panel.</p><p> Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see  the end of Washington's hands-off approach to big tech and especially these  huge Internet companies? </p><p> GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the  curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they  can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that  having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying  nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are  the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age,  they have enormous power. And I don't think you, in a free society, you  can't have power that's hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of  billionaires.</p><p> WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy  himself before he went into politics, said, that it's the wild, wild west  there. Now, some people would say that's one of the reasons it succeed. Are  you saying put government clamps on it? </p><p> GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are  small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that  there's some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have  global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in  effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company  and wipe -- I mean they can be anti-conservative, they can be anti-liberal,  they can do all sorts of things, and there's been almost no supervision,  just to surface (ph) the information. </p><p> WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you'd  agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet  companies, like FaceBook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on  Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a  partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet  behemoths? </p><p> BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the  sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now.  Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech  industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia- linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is  oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people's  private information being gathered and what happens if they're hacked. And  so those are all concerns.</p><p> So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington  and they're typically anti-regulation. But it's safe to say that this sort  of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else. </p><p> WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber  hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but  with some guardrails? </p><p> BADE: I think that's the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with  right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow,  that influences everyone's life so much? Look, there's a test case that's  going on right now on Capitol Hill. There's going to be some hearings  coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech  companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet.  Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the  Internet. </p><p> So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is  putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this  is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can't -- if they're  not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason  to regulate, then it's safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power. </p><p> WALLACE: It's funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the  big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in \"The  Wall Street Journal\" that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies  has just skyrocketed in the last few years. </p><p> Julie, where are President Trump and his administration on this? You talk  about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating  FaceBook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation. </p><p> PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So,  look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when  it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which  really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon's and FaceBooks and  presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are  growing strong and are dominating on the global stage. </p><p> Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the  leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his  administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don't think you  can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that.  But he's also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos's role in owning  \"The Washington Post,\" he's taken on Amazon on his Twitter account. </p><p> I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president's  populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and  some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the  same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he  looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration  of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant  like Amazon. </p><p> WALLACE: Yes. There's also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy,  about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don't  have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on main street  does have to pay taxes. </p><p> PACE: And that's when you've see him go after Amazon in particular for.  He's done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be  interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax  reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package. </p><p> WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn't it?</p><p> PACE: Yes (ph).</p><p> WALLACE:  That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because,  Guy, there's another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and  that's growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p> You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope  will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion  discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and  lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild  west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p> BENSON: That's right. So you'll have Democrats, in particular I think,  focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in  Silicon Valley. And then you'll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded  to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla  a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having  traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of  Google. </p><p> Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against  conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having  information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about  that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying,  uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this  country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on  both sides, rather, start to dig in. </p><p> WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich,  because there's no question that these companies have been engines of huge  economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington --  obviously there's a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington  getting more involved in regulation of the Internet? </p><p> BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker  raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith  in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is  very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of  innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn't exist as it does  today if the government's clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one.  And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from  D.C., I'm just not sure that works out well. </p><p> WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker. </p><p> GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department  of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American  history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged  by government. And that's overall been good for protecting our liberty. </p><p> WALLACE: All right. We'll continue this debate. </p><p> This is an important subject and we'll keep talking about it. </p><p> Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p> Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The doctor who keeps both the  Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in  pro sports. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream  of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of  derailing those hopes, which brings us to our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine,  people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better. </p><p> WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the  time she's the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she's  the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington  Nationals. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head  doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL? </p><p> WEST: I don't even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my  mind. I -- I never think of myself as different. </p><p> WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose  tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She  examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a  season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle. </p><p> West told us how different injuries are in the two sports. </p><p> WEST: It's over use typically in baseball. We're dealing with a lot of  shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it's a lot of  traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage  quickly. </p><p> WALLACE: That's another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out  of the game. But in football -- </p><p> WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I'm examining the kid, is he going to  play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly. </p><p> WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision.</p><p> WEST: I'm the players' doctor, right? So it's -- I want the best for the  player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don't work for the team, I -- I  want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players' best  interests. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to  doing your job? </p><p> WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and  their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high  regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they  are very trusting, I think. </p><p> WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries,  but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the  field. </p><p> WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he's a  mental fortress. But yet I have another player who's coming to me and  saying, I'm just -- I'm so depressed.  I'm not around my team. I -- and  they're coming to me and they're asking me for help on the mental side. </p><p> WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body. Her mom  noticed. </p><p> WEST: When I was five, she got me a \"Gray's Anatomy\" book for Christmas. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): Why?</p><p> WEST: That was my present. I don't know. I just was fascinated by it.</p><p> WALLACE:  Now the big concern is brain injuries, but she says the NFL has  developed a much stricter policy on concussions. </p><p> WEST: I think football's the safest it's ever been. </p><p> WALLACE: Before Washington, West was an assistant team doctor for the  Pittsburgh Steelers and got two Super Bowl rings. Her dream now, to win  championships in both football and baseball. </p><p> WEST: That's our goal, right? That's everyone's goal on the team is to keep  the players healthy and to be as successful as we can. It's a pentacle, and  you can't get any better than that. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: Dr. West says the Redskins have 15 medical professionals at each  game on the field and up in the stands watching to see if any player gets  hurt and relaying that information to her. </p><p> And that's it for today.

And this week, President Trump goes to New York to join other  world leaders there for the first time.  With plenty of hot spots to  discuss, what will the president focus on and what action will he seek?  </p><p> Joining us live here in Washington, the president's national security  advisor, General H.R. McMaster.  </p><p> General, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p> MCMASTER:  Thanks, Chris, great to be here.  </p><p> WALLACE:  As we say, President Trump speaks to the U.N. General Assembly on  Tuesday, his first time on that stage.  How important does he think the  speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his  doctrine of America First?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously  to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really  three things.  First is to protect the American people, the second is to  promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote  accountability and sovereignty.  And in those three things will allow him  to communicate his vision for America's role in the world, but also what  his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but  also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the  sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, let's unpack that and let's start with issue number one.   And that, of course, is North Korea.  The president tweeted about that this  morning.  Let's put it up on the screen.  </p><p> The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night,  asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas  lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.</p><p> Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from  the president before or is that a new one?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, that's a new one and I think maybe for the president, but  it reminds me of a cover of the \"Economist\" a few years ago, portraying him  as Rocket Man.  But, of course, that's where the rockets are coming from.   Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they  do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  But let me --  </p><p> MCMASTER:  As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global  problem.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's pick up on that, here's what you had to say on Friday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCMASTER:  We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road.   And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of  a military option, there is a military option.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  General, what does that mean, out of road?  The fact is you want  to get sanctions more time.  You're not about to go to war.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat  continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have.   We're out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of  North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long,  drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an  agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks.  </p><p> And what that agreement does, though, that's particularly dangerous  oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo  as the new normal.  And this regime is so close now to threatening the  United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move  with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing,  if necessary, a military option.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, how do you draw that line?  How do you decide we've reached  the point that we have to move to a military option now?  How long do you  get sanctions?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this.  So, we  can't really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are  coming to.  </p><p> But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing  militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies  and partners to be as effective as we can.  And what we recognize is not  really much time.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  The administration -- I want to pick up on one part  of that.  The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea's  trading partners.  </p><p> Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will use economic sanctions to  bring North Korea to the table.  </p><p> BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  You're saying stopping trade with China?  </p><p> MNUCHIN:  Stopping trade with anybody.  Nobody would be off the table.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China.  They're our  single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for  export of goods.  </p><p> General, we're not about to cut off trade with China.  It would crater our  economy.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, this is an indication, isn't it, of how serious this  problem is with North Korea, and why it's in all of our interest to work  together to resolve it.  So, of course, we China to help as much as they  can.  You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over  North Korea.  And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it's in  their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But, I mean, let's be serious here.  We're not going to cut off  all trade with China.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade  in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that  allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their  missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own  people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn't it  possible -- in fact, isn't it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key  to his survival is to have a nuclear capability?  He talked this week about  having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there's nothing that can be done  diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him  from pursuing that effort.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that  continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more  vulnerable and makes him less and less secure.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject.  The president is also going to  talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations.  But this week,  he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of  the nuclear deal.  He didn't do that.</p><p> So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement.  I know he has to  recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this  talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn't he going to live with  it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, we have to see what live with it means, right?  Live with  can't be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability.  And so,  a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that  agreement.  It is under-enforced now.  We know Iran has already violated  parts of the agreement by -- </p><p> WALLACE:  But the IAEA says that they're complying with it, sir.</p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the IAEA has identified and we've identified some of these  breaches that Iran has then corrected.  But what does that tell you about  Iranian behavior?  They're not just walking up to the line on the  agreement.  They're crossing the line at times.  </p><p> So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have  to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal.  It is -- as the president  said -- it is the worst deal.  It gave all these benefits to the Iranian  regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this  humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East.  </p><p> This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist  organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of  the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad  regime in Syria are Iranian proxies.  </p><p> And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian  destabilizing behavior and we can't allow this deal to enable that.  Their  missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian  network with more and more destructive capability that places all their  neighbors at risk.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is  terror.  The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to  continue its war on terror.  Here's what he had to say this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the  previous eight years against ISIS.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  But, I don't have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London  subway this week.  That's the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just  this year.  And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in  pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only  getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S. </p><p> MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental  things very effectively.  </p><p> The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and  support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks  against us and against our allies.  </p><p> The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they  resource these kinds of operations.  </p><p> And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology.  And this has a lot  to do with some of Prime Minister May's top priorities, which is to  constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other.  </p><p> And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law  enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability  to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and  defeat them.  </p><p> WALLACE:  There is a report this weekend, I'm sure you read, that says that  President Trump has decided he's not going to pull out of the Paris climate  accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions  but he's going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a  reduced commitment.</p><p> Is that true, sir?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  No, it's false.  That's a false report.  The president decided  to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American  people and because it was a bad deal for the environment.  It gave the  worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon  without significantly reducing those levels.  </p><p> The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air  on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also  provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and  globally.  And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively  within this flawed agreement.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, he's out of the Paris Climate Accord?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  He's out of the Paris Climate Accord.  What he said, the door is  open.  If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing  from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if  there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  But the allies said they're not going to renegotiate.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the president's ears are open, though, if at some point  they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the  president's very legitimate concerns about Paris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK.  One final area.  It's widely known in Washington that you  and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world.  One of the  first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a  regular official member of the NSC.  </p><p> He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as  globalists.  He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to  double down in Afghanistan.  </p><p> Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the  White House?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the  president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and  agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with  multiple options.  And then, based on his decisions, to help the president  implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the  interests of the American people.  </p><p> And so, what's important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to  manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda.  You  know, we're advancing the president's agenda and we are advancing policies  and strategies that are for the American people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker.  Are you saying  that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and  advance his own agenda?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the  president well in bringing him multiple options.  There were some who try  to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that  didn't serve the president well.  </p><p> WALLACE:  That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  I think this has been too hyped on one individual.  I mean,  these reports of feuding, this really didn't even happen.  I mean, we had  our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council,  and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that  door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process.  </p><p> WALLACE:  General McMaster, thank you.  Thanks for your time.  You're a  busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  It's always a pleasure, Chris.  Thank you.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Thank you.  And we'll be watching the president's speech, of  course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Thank you.</p><p> WALLACE:  Up next, we'll talk with two leading senators about the  president's move to cut deals with Democrats.  How long will it affect the  Trump agenda and how long will it last?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  President Trump had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and  Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a  deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters  worried.  So, where do we stand on DACA and whose driving the agenda now  here in Washington?  </p><p> Joining us from Chicago, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.   And here in Washington, Republican Senator Roy Blunt.  </p><p> Well, gentlemen, let's start with the big question here in Washington.  The  most immediate question, does President Trump have a deal with speaker --  former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to  DACA or not?  </p><p> And here's part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The wall is going to be  built, and it will be funded a little bit later.  </p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  It was a very, very  positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without  insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.  </p><p> TRUMP:  They cannot obstruct the wall.  The wall, to me, is vital.  If I  don't get the wall, then we will become the obstruction.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points.  Is there  a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall?  And is there  a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship?  </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, there's a basic  understanding.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President  Thursday night.  They came to a basic understanding, without the details,  without the obvious negotiations that have to follow.  And then, Chuck and  Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a  press release, so it's clear on both sides what we've agreed to.  They did  exactly that.  </p><p> There was great pushback from the right.  They didn't like the parameters  of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since.  But  we are going forward.  We are going forward with the understanding that we  can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes  DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM  Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection.   Those are the two pillars of this understanding.  </p><p> WALLACE:  And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the  president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night?  </p><p> DURBIN:  Yes.  </p><p> WALLACE:  That's pretty brief.  </p><p> OK.  Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the  citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday.  Let's take a look at  that.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We're not talking about amnesty at all.  We have not talked about  amnesty.  There will be no amnesty.  We're not talking about that as part  of the transaction.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there's  genuine confusion here in Washington.  Do you believe that there is a deal  on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could  support?  </p><p> SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI:  Well, I think there's a desire to come to a  conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border  security as part of the understanding, but the details haven't been worked  out, another thing that he mentioned.  </p><p> Well, the details here matter.  You know, it's always been three separate  questions in my view.  One is, how do you secure the border?  Two is, what  are the legitimate workforce needs of the country?  And three, what you do  with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the DREAMers, were  brought to the country illegally?  </p><p> I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve  the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here.  If  you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably  solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and  deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally.  </p><p> But you're not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way  unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point  in the future say the border is now operationally secure.  That allows  everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris.  </p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be  as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border,  does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for  the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for  DREAMers?  </p><p> BLUNT:  It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it  doesn't have to include the wall at this point I don't think.  There are a  lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms  of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn't have to take the test that  everybody else takes?  How long would you have to be here under the DREAM  Act (ph)?  There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let's turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or  not President Trump is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats  at the expense of Republicans.  Here is what the president had to say about  that on Air Force One.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  If the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to  do more work.  If they are unable to stick together, then I'm going to have  to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass  Obamacare repeal and replace, isn't it wise for this president to go to  Democrats and look for some votes?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, I think the minority can't abuse the rules of the Senate.   But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work  with you to get most things done.  The tenures -- I was either the chief  deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10  years that didn't have Democrats vote for them.  That's part of the work --  that's how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else  to move forward.  </p><p> So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it  impossible to get your work done because you've lost your own side is not  part of that either.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a  real -- not permanent, but working alliance between President Trump and  congressional Democrats?  And what you say to those members -- folks on the  left who don't trust this president and don't trust making deals with him?  </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, of course, there will  be people on the right and left who will be critical.  But Senator Roy  Blunt and I are good examples of how this can work.  I have joined him and  applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in  the United States on a bipartisan basis.  Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray  joined us.  </p><p> Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other  leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey  assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn't  shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we'll do it  on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President.  That's what American wants.  And the  president said, I'll take it.  </p><p> We did it.  And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another,  respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a  goal.  Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last  two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to  make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we  achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate.   It can be done.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But there are some differences.  I mean, you talked for instance  about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending.  </p><p> And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax  reform.  The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate  tax, Democrats opposed both.  The president talks about paying for tax cuts  based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that.  </p><p> Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences,  fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform?  </p><p> DURBIN:  Chris, there will be differences, but that's what the Senate is  all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the  Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment  process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to  some degree.  That's where you get the best legislation and that's where  you get something the American people can trust.  </p><p> Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to  achieve it.  We proved that with repeal and replace.  That did not achieve  what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with  insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018  midterm elections?  You have the president out on the stump recently with  North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp.  This is somebody who was a vulnerable  Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in  2018.  The president is saying nice things about her.  </p><p> When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his  basic campaign pledges, couldn't this hurt Republicans in 2018?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, on the tax front, it's very important we get something done - - increases take-home pay for working families, that we're almost into a  decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home  pay.  A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates  better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where  we should be headed.  </p><p> We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that.  But, you  know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we'd be glad  to work with you as long as you don't do these three things that you think  are important parts of the tax package.  That's not a good way to start.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there  was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight.  People angry about the  acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the  death of a drug -- black drug suspect.  I know everyone opposes the  violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the  shooting and appalled by the verdict.  </p><p> So, what's your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a  lot of people in the African-American community?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in  what the chiefs are doing.  I also talked to a number of community leaders  and African-American pastors.  I do think this is a place where we have to  figure out how to come together.  You do have to accept what the judge who  has the obligation to look at this case determined.  </p><p> But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the  community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders  have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson.  This happened before  that happened.  And we just need to continue to watch this.  </p><p> The division in the country whether it's St. Louis or Baltimore is not a  good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both.  We'll stay on top  of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out  in Congress.  Thank you all, gentlemen.  </p><p> Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President Trump's new  search for votes on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p> Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's potential  deal to protect DREAMers without getting funding for the border wall?  </p><p> Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your  question on the air.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump reaching across the aisle on tax  reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty  much where they are.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax  reform.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: He likes us. He likes me anyway. </p><p> I said, Mr. President, you're much better off if you can sometimes step  right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction  you're boxed.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on  a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to President Trump to  deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. </p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt  Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace,  Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of  townhall.com. </p><p> Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he  wasn't doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from  both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what President Trump  is doing here, and will it work? </p><p> NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better  dealmaker. I think that's -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the  job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston,  terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual  partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal. </p><p> And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe  we'll do a little more.</p><p> Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their  base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may  be smaller than people would like. But I think it's perfectly reasonable. I  -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because  it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when  they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have  a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base.</p><p> WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what  are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with  Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare  repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said,  on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what  they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there's such  big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with  the Democrats? </p><p> JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think you have to put this in  context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan.  With McConnell in particular, there's just not much of a relationship  there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the  president sees that McConnell just can't get it over the finish line,  there's not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there  was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on  the Capitol. </p><p> And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but  Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a  president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with  someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they  are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an  agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he's been hearing from people  like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is  actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like  Trump, who isn't particularly ideological, who doesn't have deep roots to  the conservative movement or Republican ideology. </p><p> WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well,  maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes.</p><p> PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you've seen the  president multiple times when he's had a chance to go to the mat over the  wall and say, I'm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I'm  going to veto it over this wall. He's backed off. And I think that for his  base, that's going to continue to be a frustration, but he's certainly  shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit. </p><p> WALLACE:  We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the  president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of  confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let's put some of  it up.</p><p> Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get  funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he  rally his base? </p><p> And Rick Conner posted this on FaceBook, how do you think amnesty for these  illegals will square with the president's campaign promises to the  contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall  and all? </p><p> Guy, how do you answer them?</p><p> GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's what everyone is trying to figure  out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just  interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure  out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the  contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to  be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the  future. Unclear. </p><p> But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the  gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats  agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration  enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for  something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a  victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40  billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of  fencing. That's a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in  the so-called \"border surge.\" So there's a chance that while the wall might  be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or  framed as a wall or a physical barrier. </p><p> WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it's crazy to ask you what's the  base going to do, but I'm going to ask you, what do you think the reaction  of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on  DACA that includes citizenship and doesn't include a wall as it had been  commonly thought to exist? </p><p> BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio  for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened  the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some  trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But,  overall, there was a sense that they trust President Trump, that they think  that he's three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he's got  their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board  for most of his supporters. So that's what I would guess would be the case,  unless it is egregiously bad. </p><p> WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think  is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the  prospects for a deal on tax reform? </p><p> RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell  you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with  Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership.  You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and  they see this. They say he knows our interests, he's going to do what is  best for us.</p><p> There's a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I  heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What  is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses  of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing  for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you  that. </p><p> For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership  who were saying that they don't understand why he took the wall off the  table to begin with. It's the number one bargaining chip, they said, in  terms of negotiating a deal. If you're going to take it off the table with  Democrats, you should get something for it. So they're going to try to push  him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that  is possible that conservatives could vote for it.</p><p> WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two  senators, they're so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy,  on whether or not it's going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put  in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is  a guess whether or not it's going to happen. </p><p> BADE: Yes, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in  trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift  we're seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to  now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill,  Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn,  they've all been writing a Republican bill and they're about to unveil it. </p><p> Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing  taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and  goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a  tax bill. So there's a fear that he's overstepping right now in terms of  reaching out to Democrats and they're concerned that this is going to  undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what  he wants to do. </p><p> WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker? </p><p> GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this  big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are  going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in  December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the  majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions  Schumer most wanted. And --</p><p> WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can  keep the debt ceiling going till March. </p><p> GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the  majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And  Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn't break -- he couldn't say no. So  we're a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think  the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than  they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that's the way I'd  drive it. I'd say these people are so ideological they'd rather sacrifice  the dreamers. </p><p> WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington. </p><p> All right, panel, we have to take a break here. </p><p> When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley,  powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We'll  bring back the panel to discuss Congress' new scrutiny of big tech. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we're still at the tip of  the iceberg. The fact is, I don't think FaceBook has put the resources, the  time. My understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those  accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after FaceBook admitted  it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to  Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and  Special Counsel Robert Mueller. </p><p> And we're back now with the panel.</p><p> Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see  the end of Washington's hands-off approach to big tech and especially these  huge Internet companies? </p><p> GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the  curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they  can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that  having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying  nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are  the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age,  they have enormous power. And I don't think you, in a free society, you  can't have power that's hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of  billionaires.</p><p> WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy  himself before he went into politics, said, that it's the wild, wild west  there. Now, some people would say that's one of the reasons it succeed. Are  you saying put government clamps on it? </p><p> GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are  small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that  there's some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have  global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in  effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company  and wipe -- I mean they can be anti-conservative, they can be anti-liberal,  they can do all sorts of things, and there's been almost no supervision,  just to surface (ph) the information. </p><p> WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you'd  agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet  companies, like FaceBook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on  Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a  partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet  behemoths? </p><p> BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the  sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now.  Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech  industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia- linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is  oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people's  private information being gathered and what happens if they're hacked. And  so those are all concerns.</p><p> So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington  and they're typically anti-regulation. But it's safe to say that this sort  of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else. </p><p> WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber  hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but  with some guardrails? </p><p> BADE: I think that's the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with  right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow,  that influences everyone's life so much? Look, there's a test case that's  going on right now on Capitol Hill. There's going to be some hearings  coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech  companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet.  Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the  Internet. </p><p> So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is  putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this  is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can't -- if they're  not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason  to regulate, then it's safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power. </p><p> WALLACE: It's funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the  big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in \"The  Wall Street Journal\" that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies  has just skyrocketed in the last few years. </p><p> Julie, where are President Trump and his administration on this? You talk  about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating  FaceBook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation. </p><p> PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So,  look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when  it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which  really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon's and FaceBooks and  presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are  growing strong and are dominating on the global stage. </p><p> Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the  leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his  administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don't think you  can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that.  But he's also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos's role in owning  \"The Washington Post,\" he's taken on Amazon on his Twitter account. </p><p> I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president's  populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and  some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the  same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he  looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration  of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant  like Amazon. </p><p> WALLACE: Yes. There's also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy,  about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don't  have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on main street  does have to pay taxes. </p><p> PACE: And that's when you've see him go after Amazon in particular for.  He's done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be  interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax  reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package. </p><p> WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn't it?</p><p> PACE: Yes (ph).</p><p> WALLACE:  That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because,  Guy, there's another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and  that's growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p> You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope  will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion  discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and  lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild  west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p> BENSON: That's right. So you'll have Democrats, in particular I think,  focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in  Silicon Valley. And then you'll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded  to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla  a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having  traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of  Google. </p><p> Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against  conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having  information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about  that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying,  uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this  country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on  both sides, rather, start to dig in. </p><p> WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich,  because there's no question that these companies have been engines of huge  economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington --  obviously there's a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington  getting more involved in regulation of the Internet? </p><p> BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker  raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith  in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is  very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of  innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn't exist as it does  today if the government's clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one.  And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from  D.C., I'm just not sure that works out well. </p><p> WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker. </p><p> GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department  of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American  history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged  by government. And that's overall been good for protecting our liberty. </p><p> WALLACE: All right. We'll continue this debate. </p><p> This is an important subject and we'll keep talking about it. </p><p> Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p> Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The doctor who keeps both the  Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in  pro sports. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream  of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of  derailing those hopes, which brings us to our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine,  people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better. </p><p> WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the  time she's the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she's  the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington  Nationals. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head  doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL? </p><p> WEST: I don't even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my  mind. I -- I never think of myself as different. </p><p> WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose  tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She  examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a  season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle. </p><p> West told us how different injuries are in the two sports. </p><p> WEST: It's over use typically in baseball. We're dealing with a lot of  shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it's a lot of  traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage  quickly. </p><p> WALLACE: That's another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out  of the game. But in football -- </p><p> WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I'm examining the kid, is he going to  play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly. </p><p> WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision.</p><p> WEST: I'm the players' doctor, right? So it's -- I want the best for the  player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don't work for the team, I -- I  want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players' best  interests. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to  doing your job? </p><p> WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and  their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high  regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they  are very trusting, I think. </p><p> WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries,  but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the  field. </p><p> WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he's a  mental fortress. But yet I have another player who's coming to me and  saying, I'm just -- I'm so depressed.  I'm not around my team. I -- and  they're coming to me and they're asking me for help on the mental side. </p><p> WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body. Her mom  noticed. </p><p> WEST: When I was five, she got me a \"Gray's Anatomy\" book for Christmas. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): Why?</p><p> WEST: That was my present. I don't know. I just was fascinated by it.</p><p> WALLACE:  Now the big concern is brain injuries, but she says the NFL has  developed a much stricter policy on concussions. </p><p> WEST: I think football's the safest it's ever been. </p><p> WALLACE: Before Washington, West was an assistant team doctor for the  Pittsburgh Steelers and got two Super Bowl rings. Her dream now, to win  championships in both football and baseball. </p><p> WEST: That's our goal, right? That's everyone's goal on the team is to keep  the players healthy and to be as successful as we can. It's a pentacle, and  you can't get any better than that. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: Dr. West says the Redskins have 15 medical professionals at each  game on the field and up in the stands watching to see if any player gets  hurt and relaying that information to her. </p><p> And that's it for today. Have a great week. And we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

And this week, President Trump goes to New York to join other  world leaders there for the first time.  With plenty of hot spots to  discuss, what will the president focus on and what action will he seek?  </p><p>Joining us live here in Washington, the president's national security  advisor, General H.R. McMaster.  </p><p>General, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p>MCMASTER:  Thanks, Chris, great to be here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  As we say, President Trump speaks to the U.N. General Assembly on  Tuesday, his first time on that stage.  How important does he think the  speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his  doctrine of America First?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously  to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really  three things.  First is to protect the American people, the second is to  promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote  accountability and sovereignty.  And in those three things will allow him  to communicate his vision for America's role in the world, but also what  his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but  also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the  sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, let's unpack that and let's start with issue number one.   And that, of course, is North Korea.  The president tweeted about that this  morning.  Let's put it up on the screen.  </p><p>The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night,  asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas  lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.</p><p>Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from  the president before or is that a new one?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, that's a new one and I think maybe for the president, but  it reminds me of a cover of the \"Economist\" a few years ago, portraying him  as Rocket Man.  But, of course, that's where the rockets are coming from.   Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they  do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  But let me --  </p><p>MCMASTER:  As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global  problem.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's pick up on that, here's what you had to say on Friday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCMASTER:  We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road.   And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of  a military option, there is a military option.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  General, what does that mean, out of road?  The fact is you want  to get sanctions more time.  You're not about to go to war.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat  continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have.   We're out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of  North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long,  drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an  agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks.  </p><p>And what that agreement does, though, that's particularly dangerous  oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo  as the new normal.  And this regime is so close now to threatening the  United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move  with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing,  if necessary, a military option.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, how do you draw that line?  How do you decide we've reached  the point that we have to move to a military option now?  How long do you  get sanctions?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this.  So, we  can't really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are  coming to.  </p><p>But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing  militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies  and partners to be as effective as we can.  And what we recognize is not  really much time.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  The administration -- I want to pick up on one part  of that.  The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea's  trading partners.  </p><p>Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will use economic sanctions to  bring North Korea to the table.  </p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  You're saying stopping trade with China?  </p><p>MNUCHIN:  Stopping trade with anybody.  Nobody would be off the table.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China.  They're our  single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for  export of goods.  </p><p>General, we're not about to cut off trade with China.  It would crater our  economy.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, this is an indication, isn't it, of how serious this  problem is with North Korea, and why it's in all of our interest to work  together to resolve it.  So, of course, we China to help as much as they  can.  You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over  North Korea.  And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it's in  their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, I mean, let's be serious here.  We're not going to cut off  all trade with China.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade  in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that  allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their  missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own  people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn't it  possible -- in fact, isn't it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key  to his survival is to have a nuclear capability?  He talked this week about  having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there's nothing that can be done  diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him  from pursuing that effort.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that  continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more  vulnerable and makes him less and less secure.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject.  The president is also going to  talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations.  But this week,  he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of  the nuclear deal.  He didn't do that.</p><p>So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement.  I know he has to  recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this  talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn't he going to live with  it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, we have to see what live with it means, right?  Live with  can't be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability.  And so,  a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that  agreement.  It is under-enforced now.  We know Iran has already violated  parts of the agreement by -- </p><p>WALLACE:  But the IAEA says that they're complying with it, sir.</p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the IAEA has identified and we've identified some of these  breaches that Iran has then corrected.  But what does that tell you about  Iranian behavior?  They're not just walking up to the line on the  agreement.  They're crossing the line at times.  </p><p>So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have  to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal.  It is -- as the president  said -- it is the worst deal.  It gave all these benefits to the Iranian  regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this  humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East.  </p><p>This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist  organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of  the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad  regime in Syria are Iranian proxies.  </p><p>And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian  destabilizing behavior and we can't allow this deal to enable that.  Their  missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian  network with more and more destructive capability that places all their  neighbors at risk.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is  terror.  The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to  continue its war on terror.  Here's what he had to say this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the  previous eight years against ISIS.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  But, I don't have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London  subway this week.  That's the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just  this year.  And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in  pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only  getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S. </p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental  things very effectively.  </p><p>The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and  support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks  against us and against our allies.  </p><p>The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they  resource these kinds of operations.  </p><p>And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology.  And this has a lot  to do with some of Prime Minister May's top priorities, which is to  constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other.  </p><p>And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law  enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability  to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and  defeat them.  </p><p>WALLACE:  There is a report this weekend, I'm sure you read, that says that  President Trump has decided he's not going to pull out of the Paris climate  accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions  but he's going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a  reduced commitment.</p><p>Is that true, sir?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  No, it's false.  That's a false report.  The president decided  to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American  people and because it was a bad deal for the environment.  It gave the  worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon  without significantly reducing those levels.  </p><p>The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air  on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also  provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and  globally.  And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively  within this flawed agreement.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, he's out of the Paris Climate Accord?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  He's out of the Paris Climate Accord.  What he said, the door is  open.  If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing  from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if  there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But the allies said they're not going to renegotiate.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the president's ears are open, though, if at some point  they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the  president's very legitimate concerns about Paris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  One final area.  It's widely known in Washington that you  and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world.  One of the  first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a  regular official member of the NSC.  </p><p>He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as  globalists.  He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to  double down in Afghanistan.  </p><p>Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the  White House?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the  president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and  agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with  multiple options.  And then, based on his decisions, to help the president  implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the  interests of the American people.  </p><p>And so, what's important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to  manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda.  You  know, we're advancing the president's agenda and we are advancing policies  and strategies that are for the American people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker.  Are you saying  that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and  advance his own agenda?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the  president well in bringing him multiple options.  There were some who try  to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that  didn't serve the president well.  </p><p>WALLACE:  That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  I think this has been too hyped on one individual.  I mean,  these reports of feuding, this really didn't even happen.  I mean, we had  our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council,  and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that  door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process.  </p><p>WALLACE:  General McMaster, thank you.  Thanks for your time.  You're a  busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  It's always a pleasure, Chris.  Thank you.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.  And we'll be watching the president's speech, of  course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll talk with two leading senators about the  president's move to cut deals with Democrats.  How long will it affect the  Trump agenda and how long will it last?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  President Trump had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and  Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a  deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters  worried.  So, where do we stand on DACA and whose driving the agenda now  here in Washington?  </p><p>Joining us from Chicago, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.   And here in Washington, Republican Senator Roy Blunt.  </p><p>Well, gentlemen, let's start with the big question here in Washington.  The  most immediate question, does President Trump have a deal with speaker --  former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to  DACA or not?  </p><p>And here's part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The wall is going to be  built, and it will be funded a little bit later.  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  It was a very, very  positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without  insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.  </p><p>TRUMP:  They cannot obstruct the wall.  The wall, to me, is vital.  If I  don't get the wall, then we will become the obstruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points.  Is there  a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall?  And is there  a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship?  </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, there's a basic  understanding.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President  Thursday night.  They came to a basic understanding, without the details,  without the obvious negotiations that have to follow.  And then, Chuck and  Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a  press release, so it's clear on both sides what we've agreed to.  They did  exactly that.  </p><p>There was great pushback from the right.  They didn't like the parameters  of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since.  But  we are going forward.  We are going forward with the understanding that we  can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes  DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM  Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection.   Those are the two pillars of this understanding.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the  president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Yes.  </p><p>WALLACE:  That's pretty brief.  </p><p>OK.  Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the  citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday.  Let's take a look at  that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're not talking about amnesty at all.  We have not talked about  amnesty.  There will be no amnesty.  We're not talking about that as part  of the transaction.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there's  genuine confusion here in Washington.  Do you believe that there is a deal  on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could  support?  </p><p>SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI:  Well, I think there's a desire to come to a  conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border  security as part of the understanding, but the details haven't been worked  out, another thing that he mentioned.  </p><p>Well, the details here matter.  You know, it's always been three separate  questions in my view.  One is, how do you secure the border?  Two is, what  are the legitimate workforce needs of the country?  And three, what you do  with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the DREAMers, were  brought to the country illegally?  </p><p>I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve  the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here.  If  you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably  solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and  deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally.  </p><p>But you're not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way  unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point  in the future say the border is now operationally secure.  That allows  everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris.  </p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be  as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border,  does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for  the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for  DREAMers?  </p><p>BLUNT:  It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it  doesn't have to include the wall at this point I don't think.  There are a  lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms  of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn't have to take the test that  everybody else takes?  How long would you have to be here under the DREAM  Act (ph)?  There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let's turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or  not President Trump is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats  at the expense of Republicans.  Here is what the president had to say about  that on Air Force One.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to  do more work.  If they are unable to stick together, then I'm going to have  to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass  Obamacare repeal and replace, isn't it wise for this president to go to  Democrats and look for some votes?  </p><p>BLUNT:  Well, I think the minority can't abuse the rules of the Senate.   But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work  with you to get most things done.  The tenures -- I was either the chief  deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10  years that didn't have Democrats vote for them.  That's part of the work --  that's how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else  to move forward.  </p><p>So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it  impossible to get your work done because you've lost your own side is not  part of that either.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a  real -- not permanent, but working alliance between President Trump and  congressional Democrats?  And what you say to those members -- folks on the  left who don't trust this president and don't trust making deals with him?  </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, of course, there will  be people on the right and left who will be critical.  But Senator Roy  Blunt and I are good examples of how this can work.  I have joined him and  applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in  the United States on a bipartisan basis.  Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray  joined us.  </p><p>Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other  leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey  assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn't  shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we'll do it  on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President.  That's what American wants.  And the  president said, I'll take it.  </p><p>We did it.  And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another,  respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a  goal.  Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last  two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to  make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we  achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate.   It can be done.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But there are some differences.  I mean, you talked for instance  about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending.  </p><p>And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax  reform.  The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate  tax, Democrats opposed both.  The president talks about paying for tax cuts  based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that.  </p><p>Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences,  fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Chris, there will be differences, but that's what the Senate is  all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the  Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment  process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to  some degree.  That's where you get the best legislation and that's where  you get something the American people can trust.  </p><p>Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to  achieve it.  We proved that with repeal and replace.  That did not achieve  what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with  insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018  midterm elections?  You have the president out on the stump recently with  North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp.  This is somebody who was a vulnerable  Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in  2018.  The president is saying nice things about her.  </p><p>When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his  basic campaign pledges, couldn't this hurt Republicans in 2018?  </p><p>BLUNT:  Well, on the tax front, it's very important we get something done - - increases take-home pay for working families, that we're almost into a  decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home  pay.  A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates  better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where  we should be headed.  </p><p>We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that.  But, you  know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we'd be glad  to work with you as long as you don't do these three things that you think  are important parts of the tax package.  That's not a good way to start.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there  was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight.  People angry about the  acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the  death of a drug -- black drug suspect.  I know everyone opposes the  violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the  shooting and appalled by the verdict.  </p><p>So, what's your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a  lot of people in the African-American community?  </p><p>BLUNT:  Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in  what the chiefs are doing.  I also talked to a number of community leaders  and African-American pastors.  I do think this is a place where we have to  figure out how to come together.  You do have to accept what the judge who  has the obligation to look at this case determined.  </p><p>But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the  community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders  have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson.  This happened before  that happened.  And we just need to continue to watch this.  </p><p>The division in the country whether it's St. Louis or Baltimore is not a  good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both.  We'll stay on top  of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out  in Congress.  Thank you all, gentlemen.  </p><p>Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President Trump's new  search for votes on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's potential  deal to protect DREAMers without getting funding for the border wall?  </p><p>Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your  question on the air.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump reaching across the aisle on tax  reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty  much where they are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax  reform.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: He likes us. He likes me anyway. </p><p>I said, Mr. President, you're much better off if you can sometimes step  right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction  you're boxed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on  a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to President Trump to  deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. </p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt  Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace,  Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of  townhall.com. </p><p>Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he  wasn't doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from  both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what President Trump  is doing here, and will it work? </p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better  dealmaker. I think that's -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the  job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston,  terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual  partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal. </p><p>And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe  we'll do a little more.</p><p>Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their  base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may  be smaller than people would like. But I think it's perfectly reasonable. I  -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because  it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when  they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have  a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base.</p><p>WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what  are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with  Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare  repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said,  on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what  they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there's such  big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with  the Democrats? </p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think you have to put this in  context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan.  With McConnell in particular, there's just not much of a relationship  there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the  president sees that McConnell just can't get it over the finish line,  there's not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there  was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on  the Capitol. </p><p>And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but  Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a  president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with  someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they  are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an  agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he's been hearing from people  like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is  actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like  Trump, who isn't particularly ideological, who doesn't have deep roots to  the conservative movement or Republican ideology. </p><p>WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well,  maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes.</p><p>PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you've seen the  president multiple times when he's had a chance to go to the mat over the  wall and say, I'm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I'm  going to veto it over this wall. He's backed off. And I think that for his  base, that's going to continue to be a frustration, but he's certainly  shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit. </p><p>WALLACE:  We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the  president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of  confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let's put some of  it up.</p><p>Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get  funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he  rally his base? </p><p>And Rick Conner posted this on FaceBook, how do you think amnesty for these  illegals will square with the president's campaign promises to the  contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall  and all? </p><p>Guy, how do you answer them?</p><p>GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's what everyone is trying to figure  out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just  interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure  out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the  contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to  be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the  future. Unclear. </p><p>But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the  gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats  agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration  enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for  something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a  victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40  billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of  fencing. That's a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in  the so-called \"border surge.\" So there's a chance that while the wall might  be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or  framed as a wall or a physical barrier. </p><p>WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it's crazy to ask you what's the  base going to do, but I'm going to ask you, what do you think the reaction  of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on  DACA that includes citizenship and doesn't include a wall as it had been  commonly thought to exist? </p><p>BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio  for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened  the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some  trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But,  overall, there was a sense that they trust President Trump, that they think  that he's three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he's got  their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board  for most of his supporters. So that's what I would guess would be the case,  unless it is egregiously bad. </p><p>WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think  is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the  prospects for a deal on tax reform? </p><p>RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell  you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with  Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership.  You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and  they see this. They say he knows our interests, he's going to do what is  best for us.</p><p>There's a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I  heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What  is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses  of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing  for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you  that. </p><p>For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership  who were saying that they don't understand why he took the wall off the  table to begin with. It's the number one bargaining chip, they said, in  terms of negotiating a deal. If you're going to take it off the table with  Democrats, you should get something for it. So they're going to try to push  him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that  is possible that conservatives could vote for it.</p><p>WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two  senators, they're so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy,  on whether or not it's going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put  in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is  a guess whether or not it's going to happen. </p><p>BADE: Yes, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in  trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift  we're seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to  now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill,  Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn,  they've all been writing a Republican bill and they're about to unveil it. </p><p>Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing  taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and  goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a  tax bill. So there's a fear that he's overstepping right now in terms of  reaching out to Democrats and they're concerned that this is going to  undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what  he wants to do. </p><p>WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker? </p><p>GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this  big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are  going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in  December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the  majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions  Schumer most wanted. And --</p><p>WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can  keep the debt ceiling going till March. </p><p>GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the  majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And  Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn't break -- he couldn't say no. So  we're a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think  the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than  they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that's the way I'd  drive it. I'd say these people are so ideological they'd rather sacrifice  the dreamers. </p><p>WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington. </p><p>All right, panel, we have to take a break here. </p><p>When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley,  powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We'll  bring back the panel to discuss Congress' new scrutiny of big tech. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we're still at the tip of  the iceberg. The fact is, I don't think FaceBook has put the resources, the  time. My understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those  accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after FaceBook admitted  it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to  Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and  Special Counsel Robert Mueller. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see  the end of Washington's hands-off approach to big tech and especially these  huge Internet companies? </p><p>GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the  curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they  can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that  having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying  nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are  the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age,  they have enormous power. And I don't think you, in a free society, you  can't have power that's hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of  billionaires.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy  himself before he went into politics, said, that it's the wild, wild west  there. Now, some people would say that's one of the reasons it succeed. Are  you saying put government clamps on it? </p><p>GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are  small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that  there's some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have  global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in  effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company  and wipe -- I mean they can be anti-conservative, they can be anti-liberal,  they can do all sorts of things, and there's been almost no supervision,  just to surface (ph) the information. </p><p>WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you'd  agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet  companies, like FaceBook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on  Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a  partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet  behemoths? </p><p>BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the  sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now.  Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech  industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia- linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is  oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people's  private information being gathered and what happens if they're hacked. And  so those are all concerns.</p><p>So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington  and they're typically anti-regulation. But it's safe to say that this sort  of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else. </p><p>WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber  hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but  with some guardrails? </p><p>BADE: I think that's the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with  right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow,  that influences everyone's life so much? Look, there's a test case that's  going on right now on Capitol Hill. There's going to be some hearings  coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech  companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet.  Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the  Internet. </p><p>So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is  putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this  is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can't -- if they're  not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason  to regulate, then it's safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power. </p><p>WALLACE: It's funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the  big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in \"The  Wall Street Journal\" that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies  has just skyrocketed in the last few years. </p><p>Julie, where are President Trump and his administration on this? You talk  about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating  FaceBook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation. </p><p>PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So,  look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when  it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which  really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon's and FaceBooks and  presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are  growing strong and are dominating on the global stage. </p><p>Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the  leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his  administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don't think you  can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that.  But he's also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos's role in owning  \"The Washington Post,\" he's taken on Amazon on his Twitter account. </p><p>I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president's  populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and  some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the  same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he  looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration  of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant  like Amazon. </p><p>WALLACE: Yes. There's also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy,  about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don't  have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on main street  does have to pay taxes. </p><p>PACE: And that's when you've see him go after Amazon in particular for.  He's done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be  interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax  reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package. </p><p>WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn't it?</p><p>PACE: Yes (ph).</p><p>WALLACE:  That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because,  Guy, there's another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and  that's growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p>You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope  will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion  discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and  lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild  west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p>BENSON: That's right. So you'll have Democrats, in particular I think,  focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in  Silicon Valley. And then you'll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded  to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla  a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having  traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of  Google. </p><p>Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against  conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having  information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about  that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying,  uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this  country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on  both sides, rather, start to dig in. </p><p>WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich,  because there's no question that these companies have been engines of huge  economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington --  obviously there's a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington  getting more involved in regulation of the Internet? </p><p>BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker  raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith  in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is  very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of  innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn't exist as it does  today if the government's clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one.  And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from  D.C., I'm just not sure that works out well. </p><p>WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker. </p><p>GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department  of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American  history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged  by government. And that's overall been good for protecting our liberty. </p><p>WALLACE: All right. We'll continue this debate. </p><p>This is an important subject and we'll keep talking about it. </p><p>Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The doctor who keeps both the  Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in  pro sports. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream  of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of  derailing those hopes, which brings us to our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine,  people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better. </p><p>WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the  time she's the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she's  the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington  Nationals. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head  doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL? </p><p>WEST: I don't even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my  mind. I -- I never think of myself as different. </p><p>WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose  tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She  examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a  season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle. </p><p>West told us how different injuries are in the two sports. </p><p>WEST: It's over use typically in baseball. We're dealing with a lot of  shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it's a lot of  traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage  quickly. </p><p>WALLACE: That's another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out  of the game. But in football -- </p><p>WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I'm examining the kid, is he going to  play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly. </p><p>WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision.</p><p>WEST: I'm the players' doctor, right? So it's -- I want the best for the  player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don't work for the team, I -- I  want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players' best  interests. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to  doing your job? </p><p>WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and  their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high  regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they  are very trusting, I think. </p><p>WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries,  but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the  field. </p><p>WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he's a  mental fortress. But yet I have another player who's coming to me and  saying, I'm just -- I'm so depressed.  I'm not around my team. I -- and  they're coming to me and they're asking me for help on the mental side. </p><p>WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body. Her mom  noticed. </p><p>WEST: When I was five, she got me a \"Gray's Anatomy\" book for Christmas. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Why?</p><p>WEST: That was my present. I don't know. I just was fascinated by it.</p><p>WALLACE:  Now the big concern is brain injuries, but she says the NFL has  developed a much stricter policy on concussions. </p><p>WEST: I think football's the safest it's ever been. </p><p>WALLACE: Before Washington, West was an assistant team doctor for the  Pittsburgh Steelers and got two Super Bowl rings.
