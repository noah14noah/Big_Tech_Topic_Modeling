Also, the fact that a number of different companies are involved, rather than a single dominant monopolist, makes broader action likely, he suggested. \"It won't surprise me if we see more focus in Brussels, and perhaps even in Washington, on that set of issues and not one thing alone,\" Mr Smith said.</p><p>Changes in the way regulators think about competition are also reshaping the response to tech's market power, he added, with \"new schools of antitrust thinking\" taking hold. That is leading to broader theories of potential harm, not just those to do with limiting competition or pushing up prices.</p><p>\"You can't help but note that the year 2019 is significant in that Berlin and Washington have both embraced a similar approach to some degree, arguing that it is appropriate to consider more of these so-called non-economic, non-price issues - and that's unusual,\" he said.</p><p>The widening interest of the regulators was on display in Washington on Wednesday (AEST), when top US competition regulators answered questions before the Senate judiciary committee. Makan Delrahim, head of the Department of Justice anti-trust division, said allegations of political bias against companies like Google and Facebook were likely to be taken into account in any assessment of their market power.</p><p>Mr Smith took over as Microsoft's top lawyer at the height of its battle with the justice department and the European Commission nearly two decades ago and was instrumental in shaping a response that eventually saw it escape close regulatory scrutiny. The software company rebounded to overtake Apple and become the world's most valuable company again earlier this year, after repositioning its business away from its old PC monopoly.</p><p>In contrast to Microsoft's dominance during the PC era, Mr Smith pointed to new features of today's tech landscape that had drawn more pointed questions. These include the rise of online marketplaces run by the dominant tech platforms, and the dependence of some companies on digital advertising.</p><p>The tech landscape is \"somewhat different today, in that some of the platforms are both platforms and aggregators,\" he said. That includes Apple's App store and Amazon's marketplace for other online sellers. \"Windows, for all its market share and economic position, never had an app store,\" Mr Smith said.</p><p>Acting as both open platform and marketplace had \"strengthened\" their position, making other providers of digital content - and even companies selling physical goods - dependent on \"two-sided markets\" run by the biggest tech companies, he said.</p><p>Fears about the conflicts of interest caused by this dual role have led politicians like Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren to call for a break-up of the big tech companies.</p><p>But Mr Smith said the worries were lessened by the fact that there are a number of rival online venues. \"That means no single platform has the role in technology that perhaps the Windows platform played two decades ago,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7766rcx4b8411rkhriss</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X34-G731-F0J6-J04J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"622\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The announcement said Facebook and 28 partners would form a consortium. The partners include: MasterCard Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc., and Uber Technologies Inc.; among others. </p><p>The new partnership will form under the name Libra Association. The purpose of Libra is to govern the new cryptocurrency.Big Government's PositionPresident Trump took to twitter yesterday to weigh in on the Libra effort. He tweeted, ' I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air' He followed up with, ' If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National and International' Previously, the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell too took a position in on the matter. He told lawmakers that Facebook's plan to build the Libra digital currency could not move forward. His position is that Libra must stop unless it addresses concerns. The listed concerns include privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability. Powell said the Fed is establishing a working group to follow the project. He said the Fed is coordinating with other countries' central banks. Several foreign central banks have also expressed concern about Facebook's digital/crypto currency project.What came beforeBitcoin is the best-known digital/crypto currency. It was created in 2008 as an alternative to currencies controlled by governments and banks. Crypto trading and digital currencies remain largely outside governmental control. The market has also faced allegations of money laundering and terrorist financing. No banks are currently part of the Libra group. JPMorgan Chase ..., the largest U.S. bank by asset value, does plan to launch its own digital/crypto currency product.Conclusion:Perhaps what we are watching is a battle shaping up between Big Tech and the banking industry. The most potentially destabilizing part of the coming confrontation is the Big Tech incursion into government control of money. Big Tech has been helped up to now by Big Government. Control of the money supply takes them clearly into conflict with both banking and Big Government. Get yourself some popcorn. This is going be fun.

Section 230 enabled the explosion of the\u00a0user-created content we now take for granted. The popularity of blogging was made possible by\u00a0digital platforms not having to check each and every user post.<br/>Before Section 230,\u00a0internet\u00a0service providers (ISPs) faced what is known as the moderator's dilemma. Courts had found that the early internet service provider Compuserve was not liable for content posted on its bulletin boards because it did not moderate the content. However, Compuserve's competitor Prodigy wanted to maintain family-friendly boards, and so it moderated content to an extent.<br/>Courts found that this meant Prodigy was liable for content posted by its users and could be sued alongside a given user posting libelous content. The dilemma was whether to accept the possibility of unmoderated content turning a company's boards into a sewer that damaged its\u00a0brand,\u00a0or to accept possibly ruinous liability by trying to stop that.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Protects users, too</emphasis><br/>Crucially, the law doesn't just protect \"big tech.\" As the Electronic Frontier Foundation points out, it protects users\u00a0too. If\u00a0I post to a site something I found online, I'm not liable for posting that content. Any organization with a website that allows user comments or interaction is also protected by Section 230. It's easy to see how this helped the growth of online communities. The moderator's dilemma was solved.<br/>Moreover, because the law allows moderation without liability, site owners are free to decide what kind of content to allow their users to post. When I ran a blog years ago, it felt like a never-ending war against spam commenters, and I'd delete spam as soon as I found it.<br/>That's why most sites developed a form of \"community standards,\" which would often include rules against trolling or flaming other users, and even against posting blatantly offensive content, such as Holocaust denial. Yes, sites could ban users-I had to do it myself a couple of times.<br/>Rules are necessary in online communities to ensure bad speech does not drive out good. Low-value posts drive away people with something to contribute-hence the admonition not to read the comments on certain sites, like YouTube.<br/>Social media platforms have their own, expansive versions of community standards, breach of which can lead to one being blocked from using the site. No one likes to be put in \"Facebook jail,\" but such standards are necessary for the continued sustainability of online platforms.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Virtually impossible</emphasis><br/>The platforms' critics claim that those rules and their enforcement amount to editorial control, meaning that the platforms are acting like publishers and therefore should be liable for their content, as the Court decided in the Prodigy case. Yet Congress passed Section 230 precisely to allow moderation.<br/>In fact, given the scale of the platforms' user base, not to mention the many different languages involved, genuine editorial oversight is virtually impossible given current technology. Moreover, attempts to use technology to proactively enforce community standards have not been successful-attempts to teach algorithms to recognize Islamist terrorist propaganda, for instance, have repeatedly flagged legitimate Arabic news content.<br/>The hope of those who claim to value free speech is that platforms would decide to act like Compuserve and eschew moderation. The potential for damage to the brand is so significant that that is unlikely to happen.<br/>If the platforms were to lose their safe harbor, we would likely see a significant chilling of political speech online. Online platforms would have strong incentives to ban any post that seems remotely controversial or defamatory. This would\u00a0especially be the\u00a0case if government regulators were looking over their shoulder.<br/>The great democratization of political expression unleashed by the internet\u00a0could be reversed. Political opinion would once again become the preserve of newspapers and opinion journals, and millions of political voices would be silenced overnight.<br/>Free speech would be relegated to a few unmoderated boards. All the problems community standards solved would be more rampant than ever.<br/>This is why the current bright line standard for liability should be maintained. Those who call for changing it should be careful what they wish for. They may not like the results.<br/>Originally published at Fox Business.<br/>Image:\u00a0Experts:\u00a0Iain MurrayDate:\u00a0Wednesday, May 22, 2019Source:\u00a0Fox BusinessIssues:\u00a0Antitrust and CompetitionFree SpeechMedia appearance type:\u00a0Op-Eds and ArticlesTeaser:\u00a0After\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and other\u00a0social media\u00a0companies' recent moves to ban\u00a0Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos\u00a0and other extremists some pundits\u00a0are calling for the end of the safe harbor that allows the companies to moderate content, while others are calling for more active regulation of\u00a0big tech\u00a0companies.         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-63408</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRK1-F03R-W437-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"910\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CEI, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Competitive Enterprise Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 22, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The executives running these companies see themselves as the arbiters of public discourse. Those executives use tools to suppress users and politicians they oppose. </p><p>Those tools includeshadowbanning, deplatforming, and demonetization. The tech companies believe social media played a pivotal role in Trump's victory. They are moving aggressively to prevent a repeat of the 2016 election.Voters get itAmericans understand there is a problem. A majority of voters see Big Tech bias as a problem. That would include majorities of both registered Republicans and registered Democrats. The American people, their elected officials, and the enforcement agencies are waking up. The question is how to address the challenge of online censorship. We all know it runs contrary to the founding principles of our nation. This is not a partisan issue. After the first Democratic debate the most searched candidate on Google was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. A federal lawsuit filed by Gabbard's campaign asserts campaign interference. Google immediately suspended her campaign ads. Their service controls more than one-third of all internet advertising. Then they started sending her promotional emails to Gmail spam folders. Gabbard is accusing Google of denying her the 'debate bump.' She feels they stepped in at the most critical moment of her campaign. Do Big Tech companies just want to direct political philosophy? Are they content with controlling which party wins presidential elections? Do they want to determine which candidates the parties nominate? Do you know what Tammany Hall was?Anti-TrustGoogle and Facebook are going to face the antitrust scrutiny. They are corporations that control huge market share. Google control a 90% market share in online search. Facebook controls a 73% market share of social media. The DoJ, the FTC, and the House Judiciary Committee have open probes. Those probes came based on concerns raised under the Obama administration. On Tuesday, however, Big Tech's antitrust problem got a lot bigger. The head of the DoJ's Antitrust Division, confirmed there will be a much broader probe. It will include not just Google and Facebook, but also Amazon and Apple. The probe could lead to some of the tech giants being broken up.Other considerations and actionsA review of antitrust activity is inseparable from free speech issues. One of the greatest problems with monopolies is their 'tendency to interfere with and to dominatepolitics. Ordinary Americans can't just sit back and wait for regulators to solve the problem. New legislation may be considered. It should complement grassroots efforts to combat tech censorship. Should we require Big Tech to reflect the norms of political neutrality? Does Big Tech respect the First Amendment principles in their policies? Should they continue receiving special treatment under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act? This rule grants them extraordinary legal protections that have been expanded by the courts. Silicon Valley is taking notice. They are threatened. To combat the threat Big Tech has assembled one of the most formidable lobbyist armies ever assembled. Their efforts smell of desperation. It is an effort to squelch these threats. They're also funding think-tanks and front groups. The goal is to appeal to conservatives and libertarians by painting the tech companies as plucky defenders of the free market. That worked when few knew of or used the internet. Now, many, if not most people, see Big Tech as the abusive monopolies they have become.Conclusion:No amount of lobbying and disinformation will bury the truth. The Big Tech monopolies are increasingly pushing agendas at odds with the fundamental American freedoms. Americans cherish liberty. Big Tech has begun to fight a war of attrition. Its goal is to control our ability to speak, think and vote freely. That is what hangs in the balance. The post Big Tech Vs. Our Freedom[1] appeared first on Granite Grok[2].

Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd. is said to be offering to sell a stake of about $20 billion in its retail business to Amazon.com Inc., Bloomberg News reported this week. If Ambani succeeds in pulling off such a deal, it would mark another victory for the billionaire, who in recent months has secured $20 billion of investment in his digital unit from marquee names including Facebook Inc. and Google Inc.    The mere possibility of an Amazon investment reveals not only Ambani\u2019s market clout, but also how India\u2019s business climate is changing as Prime Minister Narendra Modi cranks up nationalist rhetoric while the nation hurtles toward the first annual economic contraction in 40 years. Having seen multiple regulatory roadblocks thrown in their way, a tie-up with a powerful Indian ally has never looked more crucial for the world\u2019s biggest internet companies. And no business person carries more heft in India \u2014 known for its complicated bureaucracy and red tape \u2014 than Ambani.

But if you have to you have to,\" said Simons. The FTC is currently investigating Facebook over antitrust concerns. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission has sounded a warning bell, saying he'll break up big tech companies if he has to. FTC chairman Joe Simons told Bloomberg in an interview on Tuesday that breaking up over-dominant tech companies could be an option. \"If you have to, you do it... It's not ideal because it's very messy. But if you have to you have to,\" he said, according to Bloomberg. It's the first major indicator that the FTC is weighing any such action. The regulator is currently investigating Facebook over antitrust concerns[2], and while Simons didn't give any further details, he did mention one of Facebook's most successful acquisitions \u2014 Instagram. The FTC approved Facebook's $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012, in a move that is now considered to have pre-emptively scuppered a potential competitor. Instagram was becoming increasingly popular on mobile among younger users at the time. The FTC also subsequently approved Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014. \"There's a question about what caused Instagram to be as successful as it is,\" said Simons. \"Was it the fact that the seed was already there and it was going to be germinated no matter what or was the seed germinated because Facebook acquired it?\" According to Simons it's for the agency to say \"we made a mistake\" and break Facebook and Instagram up. Read more: Facebook reportedly called off talks to buy Houseparty over fears a deal would attract unwanted antitrust scrutiny[3] Some politicians, including Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren[4], have voiced their support for splitting big companies apart from their acquisitions. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has pushed back[5], saying that separating Facebook from Instagram and WhatsApp will make it harder for those companies to regulate their platforms for harmful content, having been cut off from Facebook's considerable resources. Facebook declined to comment on Simon's remarks when contacted by Business Insider. Both the FTC and the Department of Justice[6] have kicked off major antitrust investigations into big tech. Whereas in the past reports suggested that the two agencies would divvy up the individual companies, Simons told Bloomberg they are dividing labor by conduct. \"It's possible for sure that we could be investigating the same company at the same time but just for different conduct,\" he said. An example he gave was that the FTC could scrutinize Amazon for acquiring a grocer, while the DOJ could simultaneously focus on Amazon acquiring a music-streaming service.NOW WATCH: I cleaned my

nitf:lede=\"true\">The European Union must hold back from making major platforms such as Facebook or Twitter liable for illegal content on their websites, the US big tech lobby urged Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The suggestion came as the European Commission, the EU's vast regulatory arm, is busy drawing up a new set of laws to keep a tighter leash on Silicon Valley, especially when it comes to hate speech and disinformation.</p><p>The planned European Digital Services Act has triggered a lobbying frenzy in the EU's de facto capital, with internet giants worried that Brussels will muzzle its wildly succesful and profitable social platforms.</p><p>Lobbyists representing the likes of Google and Twitter warned in a letter to the commission, seen by AFP on Wednesday, that reversing limited liability would have the perverse effect of increasing hate speech online, with companies turning a blind eye to dangerous content when it occurred.</p><p>\"The law should continue to assign primary liability to those users that act illegally or harm others and limit the liability of online service providers whose services are abused by others,\" wrote Siada El Ramly, director-general of Edima.</p><p>The lobbyist urged the continuation of the so-called \"notice and action regime\" where platforms are only under a legal obligation to delete illegal content when it has been flagged up.</p><p>For nearly two decades EU law has protected internet companies from almost all legal liability for user-generated content on its websites, an immunity that helped fuel social media's success.</p><p>But after a series of major scandals involving horrific terror attacks and Russian meddling in US elections, pressure is on regulators worldwide to hold Facebook, Google's Youtube and Twitter closer to account.</p><p>Asked whether limited liability should be reviewed, the EU Commissioner Thierry Breton told Les Echos newspaper that he would prefer not to, but \"the world has changed\" and that \"platforms must obviously face up to their responsibilities.\"</p><p>\"This can be seen both with the rise of illegal and hateful content and fake news and, more generally, the potential impact of platforms on democracy,\" Breton said.</p><p>Breton, a former tech CEO who handles the sensitive file, added that he had yet to decide on the issue, with a proposal probably months away.</p><p>Europe in recent years has taken the lead on clamping down on US big tech companies, including billions in fines against Google as well an exhaustive data privacy law that has been imitated worldwide.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

That bipartisan backlash poses a threat to the epicenter of the decade-long bull market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon and Apple tumbled on Monday after media reports revealed that US regulators have laid the groundwork for potential antitrust investigations of these dominant tech companies. Those stocks rebounded on Tuesday, though only Apple recovered its losses. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scary headlines, on top of the global trade war, open a Pandora's box of outcomes that investors can't easily quantify. Will the government try to break Big Tech companies up? Will Congress write tough new laws? Or will this all go away with some easily paid fines?</p><p>\"The leaders of this bull market are now under threat,\" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote in a note to clients. \"The US government is going after our most successful companies for being too successful.\"</p><p>But investors would be wise not to panic. </p><p>These are cash-rich companies that can afford to pay even the fattest of fines and go head-to-head with the federal government in a drawn-out legal war. And some analysts are skeptical that regulators would be able to prove an antitrust case.</p><p>\"I wouldn't short these companies. I'd go long on the law firms with antitrust experience. Those are the guys who will get rich on this,\" said Jonathan Macey, a corporate finance and securities law professor at Yale University. </p><p>But that doesn't mean Big Tech will get away unscathed. </p><p>Enough people are angry at them on both sides of the aisle --- the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee is launching its own antitrust investigation of tech --- that there will likely be negative consequences for Big Tech. And the lingering question marks will create an overhang on the stocks for the foreseeable future.</p><p>\"It's a headache --- and it's going to remain a headache,\" said Ian Winer, an advisory board member at investment bank Drexel Hamilton. \"But whatever it is, it's not going to be the end of the world. I don't think you need to sell.\"</p><p>Investors seem to agree with that thinking, as evidenced by the 2% surge in the Nasdaq on Tuesday. </p><p>'DC is playing a risky game'</p><p>What happens next has broad implications for investors. </p><p>Not only have Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple been at the heart of the bull market, but they are embedded in just about every individual investor's portfolios and retirement accounts.</p><p>And given their enormous size --- the big four account for about 11% of the S&amp;P 500's entire value --- their fate is inextricably linked to that of the broader markets. </p><p>\"DC is playing a risky game here,\" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note to clients. \"Do material damage to their stock prices and you risk setting off a broader market selloff at a time when investors are already fretful.\"</p><p>Breaking up tech won't be easy</p><p>History shows that the government has a mixed track record, at best, when it comes to breaking up large corporations.</p><p>While the government successfully sued in 1974 to break up AT&amp;T, that case took eight years to settle. After AT&amp;T was broken up, one of the Baby Bells acquired AT&amp;T and took its former parent company's name. CNN is now owned by AT&amp;T.</p><p>And Microsoft is still standing after a four-year antitrust battle with the Justice Department was settled in 2001. Today, Microsoft is worth more than $900 billion and last year it even briefly reclaimed its title as the world's most valuable company. </p><p>Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, shrugged off the latest iteration of antitrust efforts as \"populist pandering,\" not an existential threat to the companies.</p><p>\"If there are grounds for doing anything, it will turn out mostly to be a fine or a slap on the wrist,\" said Yardeni. \"I don't see the need to break up Facebook, Google or Amazon. How would you do that --- and why?\"</p><p>Facebook, which has been accused of mishandling personal data, would be the most obvious candidate for a breakup because its empire was built through the acquisitions of different platforms: Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. In theory, those purchases could be reversed --- an idea backed by Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and others. </p><p>Still, analysts say it may be difficult for the government to prove that consumers have been harmed badly enough to justify break-ups. </p><p>\"If you tell most people they can't use Google, they'd probably freak out,\" Yardeni said.</p><p>Investing in next-generation technology</p><p>Big Tech has unfathomable resources to fight back against antitrust efforts. Facebook and Alphabet alone are sitting on more than $150 billion in cash combined.</p><p>\"The general counsels of these companies are in touch with legions of lawyers all over the world. The troops are being mustered to wage war,\" said Macey, the Yale professor.</p><p>Wall Street would cheer if tech companies simply had to pay large fines. </p><p>Shares of Facebook, for instance, spiked 6% after announcing in late April that it could pay a fine of up to $5 billion to the Federal Trade Commission. </p><p>\"If these companies came out tomorrow and paid a massive fine --- even 20% of the cash they have --- the stocks would rally,\" said Winer. </p><p>Bigger picture, US regulators don't want to come down too hard on Big Tech because it could stifle innovation at a time when America is facing enormous competition from China. The top six tech and internet companies spent $104 billion last year along on R&amp;D in the United States, according to UBS. They invested heavily in artificial intelligence, machine learning and quantum computing --- next-generation technology that will fuel tomorrow's global economy. </p><p>\"Some regulation is fine,\" Colas wrote, \"but too much could threaten US preeminence in new technologies.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

All four of these stocks are up at least 29% for 2020 and have contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's massive outperformance over the S&amp;P 500 this year. Investors flocked into these names because they believe their business models can not only weather this downturn, but thrive in it. This has led major tech and software stocks to seemingly behave like a Treasury, a dynamic that was apparent throughout this week.  Investors and traders have historically turned to less-risky assets such as U.S. Treasurys to weather market volatility and uncertainty. During the coronavirus pandemic, however, they have turned to unlikely place: tech and software stocks.   Shares of Apple , Netflix , Microsoft , and Amazon are all trading at, or near record highs. All four of these stocks are up at least 29% for 2020 and have contributed to the Nasdaq Composite 's massive outperformance over the S&amp;P 500 this year. The Nasdaq has surged 17% this year while the S&amp;P 500 remains down over 2% in that time period.    Wall Street flocked into these names because they believe their business models can not only weather this downturn, but thrive in it. This has led major tech and software stocks to seemingly behave like a safe haven Treasury bond, a dynamic that was apparent throughout this week.   \"Clearly, the Covid cases going up around the country has gotten people into those software and internet plays,\" said Christian Fromhertz, CEO of Tribeca Trade Group. \"These stocks are clearly the haves and it will stay that way until something changes.\"   The U.S. reported record numbers this week in daily coronavirus increases . On Thursday, more than 63,000 new coronavirus cases were confirmed in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. The country's seven-day average of cases also jumped to more than 53,000 this week.   At the state level, Florida's coronavirus-related hospitalizations hit an all-time high. Nevada rolled back a reopening plan for bars in the state.    This grim data put stocks that would benefit from the economy reopening under pressure this week. American Airlines fell more than 8% week to date and United slid nearly 10%. Gap shares dropped more than 3% in that time period.    Big Tech \u2014 once considered one of the riskiest groups in the stock market \u2014 shined this week. Microsoft climbed about 3% in that time period while Netflix and Amazon popped more than 10% to record levels. Apple also hit an all-time high, jumping about 5% for the week.    These stocks rose alongside the U.S. 10-year Treasury note. The 10-year yield started the week trading around 0.7%, but later fell to trade around 0.6% (yields move inversely to prices).   Investors argue that what makes these companies so attractive during this pandemic is their steady cash flows and recurring revenues at a time when clarity around the corporate earnings landscape is minimal.    \"What these companies have going for them is that whole idea of a strong balance sheet and recurring revenue,\" said Rebecca Felton, senior portfolio manager at Riverfront. \"Recurring revenues, in this type of environment where cyclicals might fade out a bit, is really important.\"   \"It feels right to stick with quality and growth that you think you can count on,\" Felton said.   Microsoft, Netflix and Amazon all have subscription-based services driving recurring revenue on a monthly or annual basis.    Last quarter, Microsoft's Office 365 users grew to more than 39 million from 37.2 million in the previous three-month period. Amazon, meanwhile, has more than 150 million paying Prime users. There are more than 180 million paying Netflix subscribers around the world.    Something else making some of these stocks attractive are high dividend yields relative to U.S. Treasurys.    According to FactSet, Apple and Microsoft currently yield 0.86% per share and 0.96%, respectively. The 10-year Treasury note, meanwhile, has a yield of around 0.6%.   To be sure, stocks are inherently riskier assets than Treasurys as they don't have the backing of the U.S. government. Treasurys also give investors a consistent interest payment until they reach maturity, whereas stock dividends are subject to cuts or suspensions at any moment.    Tech stocks also face mounting regulation risk, which could put them under pressure. Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of investment firm Social Capital, thinks this \u2014 along with the possibility of higher taxes and new product experiences \u2014 make for a bearish case in Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet.    \"Big Tech's long term success is no longer about better products,\" Palihapitiya said in a Friday tweet. \"They are incumbents and their success is now a multi-variate/multi-dimensional problem of competition, anti-trust, tax and regulatory multiplied by EVERY city, state, country and jurisdiction in which the operate.\"   Still, David Spika, president of GuideStone Capital Management, thinks using Big Tech as a safe-haven is prudent given how easy U.S. monetary policy is right now.   The Federal Reserve slashed rates to zero in March as part of an effort to support the economy during the pandemic. The U.S. central bank has also embarked on unprecedented monetary stimulus programs, including buying corporate debt.   \"When the Fed forces interest rates to zero, they're gonna push investors on the risk curve to get income and growth,\" said Spika. \"If I'm going to be forced into equities, which is what the Fed's clearly doing, I'm going to own the equities that I feel the best about and large-cap tech has become a safe-haven play.\"    Time will tell how long this will last and when Big Tech equities return to acting like stocks with individual risks.

At one point he asked Amazon's Jeff Bezos why the company had been compared to a drug dealer.</p><p>This being American politics, there was also - of course - a partisan split.</p><p>Republicans like Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz had a different interpretation of fairness - and it had nothing to do with anti-trust.</p><p>\"I'll just cut straight to the chase. Big Tech's out to get conservatives,\" said Jordan.</p><p>Much of their ire centred around claims of censorship, specifically that Facebook and Google unfairly discriminate against conservatives.</p><p>President Trump has suggested likewise.

Section 230 - which gives social media companies immunity from prosecution for what is published on their platforms - would probably be looked at.</p><p>If the Democrats win, expect more regulation in an attempt to inject more competition into the tech industry.</p><p>In reality though, it's unlikely to be that black and white.</p><p>There are Republicans that have sympathies for some of the anti-competition arguments, for example.</p><p>The accusations around Amazon hurting tens of thousands of small American businesses is a Republican concern as much as a Democrat one.</p><p>There may be bipartisan compromises around anti-competition that are palatable to both sides.</p><p>But it's hard to avoid the conclusion that whoever wins the next election, Big Tech is going to get whacked.

That word \"fairness\" is crucial when it comes to the future regulation of these tech titans. That's because, in the mouths of different lawmakers, fairness means very different things.   \"These companies, as they exist today, have monopoly power... some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated.\"   Those were the closing remarks of David Cicilline, chairman of the House judiciary committee's anti-trust sub-committee.   For him, fairness means not just clipping the wings of Big Tech, but fundamentally restructuring their relationship with Americans.   Cicilline was one of many lawmakers who came out swinging. At one point he asked Amazon's Jeff Bezos why the company had been compared to a drug dealer.   This being American politics, there was also - of course - a partisan split.   Republicans like Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz had a different interpretation of fairness - and it had nothing to do with anti-trust.   \"I'll just cut straight to the chase. Big Tech's out to get conservatives,\" said Jordan.   Much of their ire centred around claims of censorship, specifically that Facebook and Google unfairly discriminate against conservatives.   President Trump has suggested likewise. He's already criticised Twitter and Facebook for removing conservative content and even flagging his own posts and tweets.  US elections  This split makes predicting how the US might try to lasso these tech giants difficult.   Republicans are generally against market regulation, against increasing red tape.   Many Democrats however believe that these companies are acting like cartels - that they're hurting \"mom and pop\" businesses. That tougher legislation will protect consumers.   The sub-committee will publish its recommendations - and then it's down to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.   It's highly unlikely though that anything much will happen before the US elections in November.   As well as the presidential vote, all the seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, as well as about a third of the Senate.   And so we reach a fork in the road for Big Tech in America.   A Republican win would probably see the tech giants scrutinised further over how they police free speech. Section 230 - which gives social media companies immunity from prosecution for what is published on their platforms - would probably be looked at.   If the Democrats win, expect more regulation in an attempt to inject more competition into the tech industry.   In reality though, it's unlikely to be that black and white.   There are Republicans that have sympathies for some of the anti-competition arguments, for example.   The accusations around Amazon hurting tens of thousands of small American businesses is a Republican concern as much as a Democrat one.   There may be bipartisan compromises around anti-competition that are palatable to both sides.   But it's hard to avoid the conclusion that whoever wins the next election, Big Tech is going to get whacked. The question is how and by whom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42721092349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-FV21-F07F-8436-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"605\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>BBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Many blame <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/brexit\"> Brexit</url>. But a silent stalker stalls UK stocks: market structure. Large tech and tech-like stocks have led, highlighting how structural differentials between UK and global markets impact your portfolio strategy now \u2014 and will throughout this ongoing bull market.</p><p>With tech stocks the world\u2019s top-performing sector \u2014 up 33.1 per cent from the beginning of the year to late August \u2014 the UK lags behind quite logically. Tech is 16.7 per cent of the developed world\u2019s market cap. The tech-like communication services sector adds 8.6 per cent more. </p><p>These two sectors comprise just 1.2 per cent and 5.2 per cent of the MSCI UK market cap, respectively. Even Britain\u2019s communication services are telecoms and media \u2014 not very tech-like. Compare that with Europe (5.9 per cent tech and 4.7 per cent communication services) and the US (22.4 per cent tech and 10.4 per cent communication services). </p><p>Unsurprisingly, regions with the highest tech and tech-like weightings enjoy the highest 2019 returns. Up to August 20, the US\u2019s 22.9 per cent led both the world (19.8 per cent) and Europe (14.4 per cent). The UK was the caboose.</p><p>Yes, UK stocks must contend with Brexit. I\u2019ve written here several times about how Brexit uncertainties drag on business. Eventually we\u2019ll get clarity \u2014 a plus no matter how Brexit concludes. But for this bull market\u2019s remainder, shop beyond UK shores.</p><p>Doing so, you\u2019ll see an even larger trend afoot. Bigger is better now. Worldwide, mega-cap stocks (those topping the world\u2019s \u00a3132bn weighted-average market cap) are up 22 per cent from the start of the year to August 20, also leading global markets.</p><p>The mindset of the investor explains why. Smaller stocks usually shine brightest early in bull markets. Bear markets scare away almost everyone but the most steely nerved risk-takers, and the ones eagerly seeking big bargains are likely to bounce the highest. Those stocks are lower quality ones that may have died if economies ended as badly as folks feared at the bottom of the bear market. These risk-seekers then see fat-margin mega-cap, growth-oriented firms as boring. So mega-caps underperform at these moments.</p><p>But the late entry buyers in bull markets aren\u2019t brave hearts. They target huge, high-quality firms, not needles in the stock market\u2019s haystack that may have outsized potential. They want household names, with huge global presence, consistent, relatively reliable earnings growth, survivability and fat gross operating profit margins to finance future growth.</p><p>The biggest, most profitable tech and tech-like names are the centre of this bullseye right now. The overwhelming majority of tech and tech-like behemoths with well-padded margins are in the US, such as the Fang stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, as well as Apple, Microsoft and others.</p><p>To fathom their impact, compare US and European returns. US stocks have soundly beaten European since 2017 began, rising 37.2 per cent in sterling as I type \u2014 easily topping Europe\u2019s 18.6 per cent. But if you remove tech and communication services from US returns, they effectively match Europe\u2019s. Put differently, mega-cap tech and the Fangs constitute essentially all US outperformance over Europe.</p><p>Yes, the UK has some mega-cap stocks. But few have the growth-style qualities, fat gross operating margins and other characteristics that late-stage bull markets crave. The healthcare giants suffer regulatory pressure. Mega-cap energy and financials companies fare better than most of their smaller peers. But raw pricing pressure skewers both categories currently. The FTSE\u2019s 2019 underperformance shows the risks of Britain\u2019s huge blind spot to tech and tech-like giants. So you must go global to reap the market\u2019s full rewards.</p><p>That means your tech exposure must come mostly from the US, with a hair from Europe and Asia. The relevant companies aren\u2019t exciting start-ups. But they dominate high-growth areas like cloud computing. </p><p>Companies of all sizes, across nearly all industries, are investing in cloud-based storage. The growth of consumer-facing mobile computing is fuelling huge demand for mobile devices, wireless networking equipment and cutting-edge semiconductors. Ditto for related services like mobile payments, advertising and streaming content. 5G wireless, in its infancy, will drive further growth. Mega-cap firms\u2019 clout and economies of scale help keep costs low, preserving the fat gross operating profit margins that relatively timid late-stage marginal buyers seek out.</p><p>Don\u2019t just target tech, of course. If you put about one-quarter in big tech and roughly 10 per cent in tech-like communication services stocks, your portfolio should shine. Fold in big UK healthcare or energy names. Just always remember that whatever the sector, you need the biggest names with the fattest gross margins and cash-rich balance sheets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ken Fisher is the founder and executive chairman of Fisher Investments and chairman and director of Fisher Investments Europe.

He continued: \"We expect you to have regard to the possible harm to communities.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is not a bad analogy in the light of the extraordinary list of charges against Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon and Apple and others: exposing young people to online grooming, sexting, cyberbullying, pornography and harassment; destroying entire industries without replacing the taxation; exploiting labour; encouraging eating disorders and self-harm; enabling political extremism and corruption; accelerating the atomisation of society; and promoting fake news.</p><p>Nevertheless a better analogy was hinted at by my colleague Hugo Rifkind, who, in a recent review of Jaron Lanier's Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now, wrote that the book was \"far too rich to be the social media version of Allen Carr'sEasy Way To Stop Smoking\". The timescales are different, big tech having emerged in recent decades and already facing heavy regulation, whereas the gap between the discovery and regulation of tobacco spanned centuries, but I have been feeling for some time now that our tech groups are the tobacco companies of the 21st century.</p><p>Indeed if you spend a morning going through the chronology on the website for Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) you will find endless parallels, not least that both tech and tobacco were initially embraced as cures for the problems they were eventually found to cause. Let's face it we all signed up to Facebook and bought smartphones because we thought they would make it easier to stay in touch with those we love but it is obvious now that technology is making us more isolated, just as tobacco was originally adopted as a health cure, with Monardes, a doctor in 16th-century Seville, listing 36 maladies that he believed could be cured by tobacco, from toothache to worms, halitosis and even cancer.</p><p>Which brings us to another parallel: despite the enthusiasm of initial adoption, both tobacco and tech have had vocal critics from the beginning. Old media, in the form of newspapers, clinical professionals, ministers and Jaron Lanier, are leading the fight against tech even as adoption grows, just as King James I of England was banging on in 1604 about how smoking is a \"custome lothesome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs and, in the black and stinking fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrible stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless\".</p><p>Parallel three: the argument against tobacco and web groups initially gained moral traction in relation to children. If you want to get people to listen to warnings about tech then tell them that senior staff at Google are sending their children to digital-free Waldorf schools, or that two big investors have urged Apple to help to curb smartphone addiction among children. The argument against tobacco similarly first began to take proper hold in relation to kids, with the 1908 Children's Act banning the sale of tobacco to children under 16 and the tobacco industry agreeing in 1986 to spend \u00a31 million a year on publicity saying that children under 16 must not be sold cigarettes.</p><p>I could go on with the parallels: withdrawal clinics were established decades before formal regulation of tobacco, with the first health authority smoking withdrawal clinic being established in Salford in 1958, just as web addiction treatment centres are currently proliferating across the world; under pressure, the tobacco companies started voluntarily offering warnings on their products, just as Apple has promised that new versions of its mobile operating system will help its customers to manage the time they spend using apps and playing games; tech is currently engaged in lobbying on a huge scale, just as tobacco was throughout the 20th century. The more interesting question, however, is what we can expect to happen if the analogy is sustained.</p><p>I reckon we can expect individuals to have more legal success than governments in the early stages of the fightback, with tech equivalents of the 64-year-old smoker dying of lung cancer who was awarded $3 billion in punitive damages against Philip Morris in 2001. We can also expect the kind of lobbying scandals that led to academics withdrawing from Nottingham University in protest when it announced in 2000 that it had accepted \u00a33.8 million from British American Tobacco. There will be awareness campaigns and action weeks against tech use and a social divide will become apparent, with the middle classes withdrawing from tech more quickly than the working classes, just as a 1971 report from the Royal College of Physicians found \"a clear socioeconomic divide in cessation\", with people in the \"professional classes\" giving up smoking while people in the manual and unwaged groups were not.</p><p>Think I am overstating the case? I was worrying that I might be when I read that the World Health Organisation had included \"gaming disorder\", \"characterised by behaviours such as impaired control of time spent playing video games and prioritisation of gaming above other activities\", in its draft diagnostic manual and now I am more convinced than ever that big tech will end up like big tobacco: heavily regulated around the world, taxed aggressively to pay for the health and societal problems they have caused, bearing names that do not reveal what they do and staffed by highly paid individuals who are sheepish and occasionally even haunted by what they do.</p><p>                     Sathnam Sanghera is a journalist and author.

He continued: \"We expect you to have regard to the possible harm to communities.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is not a bad analogy in the light of the extraordinary list of charges against Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon and Apple and others: exposing young people to online grooming, sexting, cyberbullying, pornography and harassment; destroying entire industries without replacing the taxation; exploiting labour; encouraging eating disorders and self-harm; enabling political extremism and corruption; accelerating the atomisation of society; and promoting fake news.</p><p>Nevertheless a better analogy was hinted at by my colleague Hugo Rifkind, who, in a recent review of Jaron Lanier's Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now, wrote that the book was \"far too rich to be the social media version of Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking\". The timescales are different, big tech having emerged in recent decades and already facing heavy regulation, whereas the gap between the discovery and regulation of tobacco spanned centuries, but I have been feeling for some time now that our tech groups are the tobacco companies of the 21st century.</p><p>Indeed if you spend a morning going through the chronology on the website for Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) you will find endless parallels, not least that both tech and tobacco were initially embraced as cures for the problems they were eventually found to cause. Let's face it we all signed up to Facebook and bought smartphones because we thought they would make it easier to stay in touch with those we love but it is obvious now that technology is making us more isolated, just as tobacco was originally adopted as a health cure, with Monardes, a doctor in 16th-century Seville, listing 36 maladies that he believed could be cured by tobacco, from toothache to worms, halitosis and even cancer.</p><p>Which brings us to another parallel: despite the enthusiasm of initial adoption, both tobacco and tech have had vocal critics from the beginning. Old media, in the form of newspapers, clinical professionals, ministers and Jaron Lanier, are leading the fight against tech even as adoption grows, just as King James I of England was banging on in 1604 about how smoking is a \"custome lothesome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs and, in the black and stinking fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrible stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless\".</p><p>Parallel three: the argument against tobacco and web groups initially gained moral traction in relation to children. If you want to get people to listen to warnings about tech then tell them that senior staff at Google are sending their children to digital-free Waldorf schools, or that two big investors have urged Apple to help to curb smartphone addiction among children. The argument against tobacco similarly first began to take proper hold in relation to kids, with the 1908 Children's Act banning the sale of tobacco to children under 16 and the tobacco industry agreeing in 1986 to spend \u00a31 million a year on publicity saying that children under 16 must not be sold cigarettes.</p><p>I could go on with the parallels: withdrawal clinics were established decades before formal regulation of tobacco, with the first health authority smoking withdrawal clinic being established in Salford in 1958, just as web addiction treatment centres are currently proliferating across the world; under pressure, the tobacco companies started voluntarily offering warnings on their products, just as Apple has promised that new versions of its mobile operating system will help its customers to manage the time they spend using apps and playing games; tech is currently engaged in lobbying on a huge scale, just as tobacco was throughout the 20th century. The more interesting question, however, is what we can expect to happen if the analogy is sustained.</p><p>I reckon we can expect individuals to have more legal success than governments in the early stages of the fightback, with tech equivalents of the 64-year-old smoker dying of lung cancer who was awarded $3 billion in punitive damages against Philip Morris in 2001. We can also expect the kind of lobbying scandals that led to academics withdrawing from Nottingham University in protest when it announced in 2000 that it had accepted \u00a33.8 million from British American Tobacco. There will be awareness campaigns and action weeks against tech use and a social divide will become apparent, with the middle classes withdrawing from tech more quickly than the working classes, just as a 1971 report from the Royal College of Physicians found \"a clear socioeconomic divide in cessation\", with people in the \"professional classes\" giving up smoking while people in the manual and unwaged groups were not.</p><p>Think I am overstating the case? I was worrying that I might be when I read that the World Health Organisation had included \"gaming disorder\", \"characterised by behaviours such as impaired control of time spent playing video games and prioritisation of gaming above other activities\", in its draft diagnostic manual and now I am more convinced than ever that big tech will end up like big tobacco: heavily regulated around the world, taxed aggressively to pay for the health and societal problems they have caused, bearing names that do not reveal what they do and staffed by highly paid individuals who are sheepish and occasionally even haunted by what they do.</p><p>Sathnam Sanghera is a journalist and author.

Just this week Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook chief executive, came to Brussels on a charm offensive only to receive a frosty reception from high-ranking officials who want the social media company to do more to police content on its platform.</p><p>Ms Vestager has fined Google billions of euros over anti-competitive behaviour while Apple and Amazon are also appealing against record fines in the EU courts. The actions prompted Donald Trump, the US president, to brand Ms Vestager \u201cthe tax lady\u201d and accuse her of hating the US \u201cperhaps worse than any person I\u2019ve ever met\u201d.</p><p>Last summer Ms Vestager opened an investigation into Amazon\u2019s data-gathering practices from small retailers on its platform and the tech giant\u2019s dual role as a marketplace and as a seller of its own brands.</p><p>Separately, the commission has accused Google of promoting its own shopping search engine at the expense of smaller rivals in a case being contested in the EU courts.\u00a0</p><p>Observers highlighted some of the difficulties facing the commission, including how to define what kinds of data should be shareable and who bears any legal liability. New rules may also see a potential clash with privacy regulators, who have been taking steps to lock down personal data.</p><p>Facebook said it was broadly in favour of data sharing, both by the user and between businesses, but added it needed more clarity around the rules, including how personal data is defined, for its own legal certainty and to explain to its user community.\u00a0</p><p>Amazon and Google declined to comment.\u00a0</p><p>Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl, director-general of DigitalEurope, a tech lobbying group, said: \u201cWe are concerned that attempts to make data sharing mandatory could undermine innovation. If we want to encourage more data sharing we need to instil a culture of partnership between businesses.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-a5c7b640526c11ea8841482eed0038b1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7T-9TS1-JB77-K3D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><timeReceived>3:23 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The video has been \"liked\" almost 900,000 times.</p><p>Tech companies working with WHO have also made falsehoods harder to find in searches or newsfeeds.</p><p>However, the volume of misinformation pouring daily onto various platforms means this is often a reactive rather than proactive exercise.</p><p>Facebook's third-party fact checker, Agence France-Presse, has now debunked 89 misleading claims in English, including the false idea that COVID-19 is man-made or that taking vitamin D supplements can reduce the risk of contracting the virus.</p><p>Facebook, which normally has a policy of de-prioritising content that is shown to be false rather than removing it altogether, has in the case of COVID-19 actively removed false claims debunked by WHO or other credible health authorities that could also cause harm to people who believe them.</p><p>\"We're focusing on claims where, if someone relies on the information, it makes them more likely to get sick or not get treatment. This includes claims related to false cures or prevention methods - like drinking bleach cures the coronavirus - or claims that discourage treatment or create confusion about health resources that are available,\" a Facebook spokesperson said.</p><p>\"We're also prohibiting exploitative tactics in ads. We're banning ads related to coronavirus promoting products that create a sense of urgency to sell things or guarantee a cure or absolute prevention.\"</p><p>Facebook said its approach to dealing with coronavirus misinformation was threefold.</p><p>First, the company is limiting misinformation and harmful content. Second, it is providing correct information to users. Third, it is sharing aggregated and anonymised mobility data and high-resolution population density maps to help researchers at Harvard University's School of Public Health, Chapman University and National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan inform their forecasting models.</p><p>Michael Cignarale, an American DJ and marketer based in Shanghai, told The Australian Financial Review that Chinese social media sites like WeChat and Weibo had been helpful for residents in finding out up-to-date information, particularly on the rules and regulations in place in different regions.</p><p>\"Social media has been really helpful here. The big difference between the West and China, and other social media active countries, is that China only really has one or two ubiquitous platforms,\" Mr Cignarale said.</p><p>Chinese social media platforms were making QR (quick response) codes for each person that gave them feedback about where they had been and if they had been to infected areas. This information can affect whether or not they can then enter into certain places, like shopping malls or offices.</p><p>\"People are using this as a tool to prove their health, which again, is really hard to do without that ubiquitous technology - if we are looking at the 'positive' side of this use of social media,\" Mr Cignarale said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520247831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBP-9591-JBJ7-N1MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"722\"/><timeReceived>05:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Apple also turned sharply lower after Reuters reported the Department of Justice was considering a probe into the iPhone maker. Reports of new regulatory plans involving Facebook and Alphabet weighed on the group. Visit Markets Insider's homepage for more stories[4].Technology stocks fell under intense pressure on Monday after The Wall Street Journal[5] reported regulatory developments surrounding Facebook[6] and Google's parent company, Alphabet[7], \u2014 slamming the sector. </p><p>Facebook plunged by as much as 9% to a three-month low and was the worst-performing name in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. Alphabet and Amazon tumbled 7% and 5%, respectively, and were also among the biggest decliners in the index. The Federal Trade Commission will oversee[8] any antitrust probe into whether Facebook's practices hurt competition in the digital market, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday afternoon, citing a person familiar with the matter. Read more: The FTC will reportedly have oversight over a potential Facebook probe, and it could signal a tidal wave of tech antitrust action[9] Meanwhile, the outlet reported[10] late Friday, citing people familiar with the matter, that the Department of Justice was preparing an investigation of Alphabet's Google unit over antitrust concerns. Apple[11] shares turned sharply negative, too, after Reuters reported[12] the US Department of Justice had jurisdiction over a potential antitrust probe into the iPhone maker, citing two sources. The potential probe would be part of a \"broader review of technology companies,\" Reuters reported. The reported probes into how the technology giants impact competition online come as politicians weigh the implications of \"breaking up\" companies like Facebook and Alphabet. Sen. Elizabeth Warren[13] of Massachusetts, the Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, in March proposed a plan to break up US-based technology giants including Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Warren's regulatory plan would roll back some technology giants' acquisitions, like Facebook's WhatsApp and Instagram deals, Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition, and Google's Waze deal. The Invesco QQQ[14] exchange-traded fund, which tracks the Nasdaq 100's performance, fell 2% Monday.

Con la excepci\u00f3n de Microsoft, que ya vivi\u00f3 sus choques con las autoridades reguladoras[2] hace casi veinte a\u00f1os y que ahora parece quedarse completamente al margen[3], las grandes empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas se encuentran bajo la lupa, y se vern sin duda afectadas en m\u00faltiples aspectos de su negocio[4]. Qu ha desencadenado este afn regulatorio[5]? En primer lugar, la evidencia de que esas compa\u00f1as han resultado ser espantosamente malas a la hora de autorregularse[6]. Una detrs de otra, las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas han ido demostrando un nivel de irresponsabilidad demencial, capaz de poner en riesgo ya no a sus usuarios o a sus competidores, sino de resquebrajar los aspectos ms bsicos y fundacionales de la sociedad, como la privacidad[7] o la mismsima democracia[8]. Lo que se le viene ahora encima a estas compa\u00f1as es una acci\u00f3n inminente, no partidista, y ejecutada al mximo nivel: los fiscales generales de varios estados, tanto republicanos como dem\u00f3cratas[9], han iniciado investigaciones sobre estas compa\u00f1as. En la picota, mayoritariamente, cuestiones como la gesti\u00f3n de sus plataformas o las estrategias que han utilizado para imponerse a la competencia: c\u00f3mo Apple manipula su App Store para posicionar sus aplicaciones sobre otras[10] o ejercer un control omnmodo[11], c\u00f3mo Google hace lo mismo con sus resultados de b\u00fasqueda para monopolizar progresivamente el trfico en la web[12], c\u00f3mo Facebook se dedic\u00f3 a adquirir todo aquello que podra eventualmente llegar a hacerle sombra o permiti\u00f3 usos completamente irresponsables de su plataforma, o c\u00f3mo Amazon cre\u00f3 cientos de marcas propias de todo tipo de productos y las posicion\u00f3 por encima de las de las compa\u00f1as que intentaban vender en su tienda. </p><p>C\u00f3mo enfocar un proceso de regulaci\u00f3n[13] que puede ser, en algunos casos, enormemente complejo[14]? Hablamos de reconstruir el panorama regulador que en su momento destroz\u00f3 Robert Bork durante la administraci\u00f3n Reagan[15], cuando neutraliz\u00f3 completamente la legislaci\u00f3n antimonopolio y propici\u00f3 un entorno caracterizado por el todo vale que nos ha llevado a donde ahora estamos, y para ello habr que poner en marcha medidas para separar la gesti\u00f3n de las plataformas de los intereses de sus due\u00f1os, posiblemente[16] que obligar a retrotraer determinadas operaciones de adquisici\u00f3n, que buscar nuevos mecanismos de control y supervisi\u00f3n[17], que crear nuevos impuestos[18] o evitar los agujeros que tenan los anteriores, o incluso que forzar la apertura de los datos[19] o incluso de los algoritmos de funcionamiento de determinadas funciones que se consideran centrales y estratgicas[20] para algunas compa\u00f1as. Estamos hablando de reescribir las reglas del juego para la economa de los datos[21], para una economa que ya se haba reescrito a s misma, y que estaba llevando a la sociedad a una situaci\u00f3n cada vez ms insostenible[22]. Debemos confiar en la regulaci\u00f3n como poci\u00f3n mgica que solucione todos los problemas? No, en absoluto. La capacidad y la habilidad de los reguladores ha sido, hist\u00f3ricamente, muy torpe y limitada, y los polticos norteamericanos ya han demostrado sobradamente que, salvo honrosas excepciones, carecen de los conocimientos necesarios para regular algo que no entienden en absoluto. A d\u00f3nde nos llevar este proceso regulatorio? Es difcil saberlo. Pero eso no quita que resultase fundamental hacer al menos un intento de regular algo que haba demostrado estar completamente fuera de control.

A party that once stood for free trade has a president who loves tariffs. A party that championed free enterprise has a president out to punish companies he doesn't like. A party that stood for the rule of law has a president who attacks his own Justice Department.</p><p>And now this. A party that has long preached limited government, free expression and deregulation now has an administration pondering a politically motivated investigation of social media intended to justify a new wave of regulations.</p><p>Without question, social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as well as Google, the web's dominant search engine, have amassed great power in recent years and have had an almost unimaginable impact on politics and culture.</p><p>Facebook, a company founded in a dorm room 14 years ago, has recently been hiring linguists, programmers and artificial intelligence experts all around the world to keep its platform from becoming a medium of violence and spreader of lies.</p><p>Facebook is being used as a propaganda vehicle for both sides in a Libyan civil war and has been accused of aiding the cause of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Closer to home, it was used by the Russian government to spread misinformation leading up to the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Twitter has long been the social media weapon of choice for conspiracy theorists and provocateurs such as Alex Jones. Jones is a peddler of lies, most notably that the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 was a hoax. He also likes to wrap himself in constitutionalism, arguing that his First Amendment right to peddle sickening fantasies requires tech companies to provide an audience.</p><p>One by one, social media companies have come to the conclusion they have no obligation to amplify his voice and that, as a matter of pure self-interest, they should not. Last week, Twitter became the last major company to ban or greatly limit him from its platform.</p><p>Enter Big Government: GOP edition.</p><p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced he would convene a meeting with states to discuss ways that social media companies stifle free expression. This comes after some Republican members of Congress and the president complained that tech companies were stifling conservative voices.</p><p>We can think of nothing more repulsive to the values of the Constitution, or antithetical to Republican beliefs, than a government inquiry into the role of media in disseminating speech.</p><p>Do social media companies stifle some legitimate speech? Almost certainly they do. But if people have a beef with that, they should take it up with the various companies, not run to the government.</p><p>What they will find is that such tech companies restrict speech in a limited number of instances to protect the quality of their product, and thus to make more money.

These \u2018superstar\u2019 firms have largely benefitted from the economic fallout of the crisis, as more people rely on their technology to work and shop from home. However, their increasing dominance is raising concerns about the top-heavy composition of the US equity market and the sustainability of the tech rally.    Here, five charts demonstrate the FAMAGs\u2019 growing size and influence.   1. How Big Tech is propping up stock market returns   With Apple briefly becoming the first US company to be valued at US$2 trillion, more investors are turning their attention towards the impact of the tech sector on market returns.    As at 15 September, the S&amp;P 500 was up 7% this year, while the FAMAGs were collectively up 44%.    If we exclude the tech giants, the index return drops to -2%. In other words, US equities would be 9% lower this year without the FAMAGs (or 11% when measured at their peak on 2 September). This is how important these firms have become.   US equities would be 9% lower this year without the FAMAGs (1)    Past performance is not a guide to future performance and may not be repeated. Source: Refinitiv Datastream and Schroders. Data to 15 September 2020. Notes: FAMAG is a market-cap weighted index of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet (Google).      The US market is increasingly concentrated     One reason why these firms have become so influential is because they are the most heavily weighted stocks in the index.    Investors\u2019 rush into tech this year has propelled the weight of the FAMAGs in the S&amp;P 500 Index to 24%, more than double their weight from five years ago.   The FAMAGs capture 24% of the total US equity market value   Source: Refinitiv Datastream and Schroders. Data to 15 September 2020.    This means that the performance of the FAMAGs will clearly impact the performance of the overall market more than a small cap company will.    To illustrate this, let\u2019s suppose hypothetically that the FAMAGs collectively fell by 10%. That would mean that all remaining 455 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 would need to increase by at least 3.2% just for the whole index level to stay the same.     Unprecedented dominance of a single sector     The five largest members of the S&amp;P 500 are now all from the tech sector. The last time the US equity market was as concentrated as this was back in the late 1960s. So it is not unusual for the market to be concentrated in a handful of stocks (see table). Although the extent of concentration at present is greater than normal, what is more unusual is for the top five stocks to be all from the same sector \u2013 tech.    This lack of sector diversification should not be taken lightly. Any pullback in tech sentiment can have an outsized impact on overall market moves, as was recently the case.   Top five stocks rarely all come from the same sector   Largest US stocks by market capitalisation    Source: Refinitiv Datastream, S&amp;PDow Jones and Schroders. Notes: weight based on S&amp;P 500 as at start of year, except for 2020 as at 15 September 2020. Green shading denotes companies from tech sector.     Big Tech\u2019s dominance reflects their profits   So are stock market valuations ringing alarm bells? This is the question that confronted investors at the height of the dotcom bubble in 1999 before it burst.    However, comparisons between the 1999 dotcom and today are often oversimplified.  They often ignore the fact that many of the fast-growing internet companies back then were not generating significant profits or cash flows.    In contrast, the current tech giants are highly profitable. They account for 15% of trailing 12-month S&amp;P 500 earnings and an even higher proportion of forecast earnings, e.g. 20% of projected 2023 earnings. When benchmarked against their market cap weight of 23%, which reflects all future earnings, their valuations no longer look as extreme.   FAMAGs generate 20% of projected 2023 S&amp;P 500 earnings    Forecasts included should not be replied upon and are not guaranteed.   Source: Refinitiv Datastream and Schroders. Data to 15 September 2020.     Big Tech upped political presence to protect business interests     Faced with the threat of regulatory action to limit their market dominance, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet\u2019s Google are spending millions of dollars each year trying to influence regulators and politicians on policy issues ranging from data privacy to taxes.    For example, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics, Amazon and Facebook spent a record $17 million each in 2019. This was more than any other US company. This is not just a tech phenomenon, however. Academic studies show that corporate lobbying has been a key explanation for the decline in competition across numerous US industries.    In a recent Bloomberg interview, the chairman of the US House Antitrust panel, which is leading investigations into Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet\u2019s Google, stated that these firms were abusing their market power to maintain their industry dominance and was critical of the government\u2019s track record on policing anti-competitive behaviour, such as Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram.   Big Tech has increased its lobbying expenditure in recent years      Source: Centre for Responsive Politics and Schroders. Data to 30 June 2020. Although not under any active antitrust scrutiny, Microsoft is included for comparison purposes.    Investors should stay on guard if decisive regulatory action is taken against the tech giants. Given their high benchmark weights, it could drag returns for the overall US market lower if confidence in them deteriorates for any reason. The closer a portfolio\u2019s weights are to the benchmark, the bigger this risk. Passive strategies are most exposed.    Big tech has grown ever more influential, whether through index concentration, stock price performance, earnings generation, and money spent lobbying.    At a minimum, investors should at least be aware of the risk they are running in a portfolio, whether they are comfortable running those risks, and ideally, whether they are being rewarded for taking those risks.    Sean Markowicz is global strategist at Schroders .

Shares were down as much as 40 percent from their peak at one point in the year.</p><p>Facebook boosted revenues and profits during the year and managed to increase its user base to more than 2.2 billion although growth appears to have stalled in North America and Europe.</p><p>In 2019, Facebook is likely to see further scrutiny with US lawmakers mulling privacy regulations -- potentially impacting how Facebook monetizes its user data with its sophisticated advertising technology -- following new rules in the European Union.\"Costs are still likely to rise much more quickly than revenues as Facebook is having to recruit humans to police its content because its AI (artificial intelligence) is not up to the job,\" said Richard Windsor said, an analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog.</p><p>- Microsoft: steady in the cloud -Microsoft has been the steadiest of the major tech firms of late and has been jockeying with Amazon for the title of the world's most valuable company in recent weeks.While Microsoft has stepped back from many consumer offerings including the smartphone business, it has leveraged its strength with business customers to bolster its cloud computing platform known as Azure.</p><p>\"People are now seeing Microsoft as a growth company,\" said analyst Jack Gold of J. Gold Associates.</p><p>- Amazon: limits on growth? -Amazon's seemingly unstoppable growth has been one of the main stories in technology in recent years as it expands into groceries, robotics, artificial intelligence, streaming media and more.But Amazon's value has dropped some 20 percent since it peaked at $1 trillion last year.</p><p>\"Amazon is really multiple companies,\" said Gold, noting that its highly profitable cloud computing segment has enabled Amazon to invest in ecommerce and media.Amazon claims some 100 million subscribers to its Prime service, giving it a consistent revenue stream.</p><p> But in the US market, Amazon may have trouble growing that base further, with an estimated 60 percent of US households already members.One new segment that appears promising for Amazon is advertising, according to some analysts who point out that its customer relationships could help it challenge the online ad \"duopoly\" of Google and Facebook.</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos -- now facing divorce proceedings -- has been known for favoring investment over profits and will likely continue that, according to Gold.- Alphabet/Google: coping with regulators -As the dominant player in online advertising, Google remains the profit engine for its parent firm Alphabet, which has ventured into autonomous vehicles, life sciences and other fields.</p><p>But Google is a key target of \"techlash\" with probes in Europe on monopoly abuse in search, advertising its Android mobile ecosystem, and could be impacted by proposed privacy rules in the United States.Gold argued that Google is unlikely to be hurt by tougher regulations and may even be helped because smaller rivals would face relatively higher costs of compliance.</p><p>\"Google has huge scale and when you have that scale and you need to implement something it's less costly on a per user basis,\" Gold said.While Google will face higher costs, he said, \"the financial impact is relatively trivial.</p><p>\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG27012019027028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V96-DG31-JCH9-G1K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 27, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Apple reports its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday, with Facebook and Microsoft on deck a day later, followed by Amazon on Thursday. Google parent Alphabet rounds out group with its update on February 4.  The results come after a roller-coaster period with drops of more than 20 percent in the value or Apple and Amazon, which have lost their trillion- dollar status, and with Facebook and Google seeing increased pressure to deal with concerns on privacy and data protection.  Here are some of the challenges facing the major technology firms:  \u2013 Apple: another reinvention?</p><p> \u2013  Apple, facing sluggish growth in the global smartphone market, has been pushing harder in services but still relies on the iPhone for the lion\u2019s share of revenue and profit.  For the upcoming results, Apple will no longer detail the exact number of iPhones sold in the quarter, leaving analysts to guess the mix of devices based on revenues.  Apple delivered a stunning admission earlier this month that iPhone sales and overall revenues would be below most forecasts, citing economic weakness in China and trade frictions between Washington and Beijing.  \u201cThe mobile market is reaching saturation, and so is the smartphone market,\u201d says Benedict Evans of the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, in a recent blog post.  \u201cThis is not \u2018the fall of Apple\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s just the shift of smartphones to boring maturity, as we look for what\u2019s next.\u201d  Analysts will be looking at growth in services such as Apple Music and Apple Pay, and what might be coming for a Netflix-rival streaming television service from the Cupertino company.  \u2013 Facebook: safety first \u2013  2018 was a horrific year for Facebook, marked by a series of scandals over privacy and concerns that the leading social network had been manipulated by foreign interests for political purposes. Shares were down as much as 40 percent from their peak at one point in the year.  Facebook boosted revenues and profits during the year and managed to increase its user base to more than 2.2 billion although growth appears to have stalled in North America and Europe.  In 2019, Facebook is likely to see further scrutiny with US lawmakers mulling privacy regulations \u2014 potentially impacting how Facebook monetizes its user data with its sophisticated advertising technology \u2014 following new rules in the European Union.  \u201cCosts are still likely to rise much more quickly than revenues as Facebook is having to recruit humans to police its content because its AI (artificial intelligence) is not up to the job,\u201d said Richard Windsor said, an analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog.  \u2013 Microsoft: steady in the cloud \u2013  Microsoft has been the steadiest of the major tech firms of late and has been jockeying with Amazon for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company in recent weeks.  While Microsoft has stepped back from many consumer offerings including the smartphone business, it has leveraged its strength with business customers to bolster its cloud computing platform known as Azure.  \u201cPeople are now seeing Microsoft as a growth company,\u201d said analyst Jack Gold of J. Gold Associates. \u2013 Amazon: limits on growth? \u2013  Amazon\u2019s seemingly unstoppable growth has been one of the main stories in technology in recent years as it expands into groceries, robotics, artificial intelligence, streaming media and more.  But Amazon\u2019s value has dropped some 20 percent since it peaked at $1 trillion last year.  \u201cAmazon is really multiple companies,\u201d said Gold, noting that its highly profitable cloud computing segment has enabled Amazon to invest in ecommerce and media.  Amazon claims some 100 million subscribers to its Prime service, giving it a consistent revenue stream. But in the US market, Amazon may have trouble growing that base further, with an estimated 60 percent of US households already members.  One new segment that appears promising for Amazon is advertising, according to some analysts who point out that its customer relationships could help it challenge the online ad \u201cduopoly\u201d of Google and Facebook.  Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 now facing divorce proceedings \u2014 has been known for favoring investment over profits and will likely continue that, according to Gold.  \u2013 Alphabet/Google: coping with regulators \u2013  As the dominant player in online advertising, Google remains the profit engine for its parent firm Alphabet, which has ventured into autonomous vehicles, life sciences and other fields.  But Google is a key target of \u201ctechlash\u201d with probes in Europe on monopoly abuse in search, advertising its Android mobile ecosystem, and could be impacted by proposed privacy rules in the United States.  Gold argued that Google is unlikely to be hurt by tougher regulations and may even be helped because smaller rivals would face relatively higher costs of compliance.  \u201cGoogle has huge scale and when you have that scale and you need to implement something it\u2019s less costly on a per user basis,\u201d Gold said.  While Google will face higher costs, he said, \u201cthe financial impact is relatively trivial.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGGOVN-RLPMN779329520190128</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGGOVN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9C-3PD1-J9XT-P4GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bangladesh Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"504\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 28, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(PRWEB) July 31, 2020</p><p>In a congressional group hearing on Wednesday, the CEOs of tech giants Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook joined together to answer questions about their companies' competitive tactics and strategies - \"monopoly power.\" Following this testimony, the big tech companies reported earnings late Thursday afternoon.</p><p>The earnings report comes at an interesting time for the big four tech giants, as they have remained the subject of the government antitrust investigation for over a year now. According to a CNN Business article, Wednesday's hearing was the largest hearing since Microsoft's Bill Gates went to Washington in 1988.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos admitted during a hearing that he cannot guarantee no one has ever successfully violated the company's policy on preventing Amazon employees from accessing seller data. This comes in wake of a Wall Street Journal report earlier this year that found employees accessing the data to help Amazon develop competitive products under their own brand. Prior to that, Amazon had stated to Congress that it does not access sales data to assist in-house product development.</p><p>Both Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet's CEOs were asked questions on whether their platforms are biased. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded to questions about 2012 internal emails he sent about buying Instagram because he saw them as a threat at the time. Google CEO Sundar Pichai denied Representative David Cicilline allegations that Google's search algorithm consistently prioritizes its own sites.</p><p>As for Apple CEO Tim Cook, he was let off \"easy.\" He was only asked a few questions about whether Apple favors certain developers on its App Store. While many have complained about Apple's developers, there were hardly any questions on the App Store's guidelines and requirements for developers.</p><p>Despite this, Congress itself won't be able to do much more than regulate the members of Big Tech. With no \"return to normal\" yet in sight and the current state of consumer behavior heavily geared towards digital services, the big four were predicted to continue growing and dominating the market.</p><p>\"Even with the day-to-day uncertainty in our current world, the big four tech giants keep making sure that businesses are in a position to fulfill the demands of millions of consumers,\" said Zach Hoffman, the CEO of Exults Digital Marketing.</p><p>Amazon's domination of the global eCommerce industry appeared to have no signs of slowing down, as the company reported Q2 earnings on Thursday that massively out-performed expectations.</p><p>The multinational tech behemoth reported $10.30 earnings-per-share on revenues of nearly $88.9 billion, surpassing analysts' $81.56 billion revenue estimates. Amazon's Q2 2019 reported a $63.4 billion revenue, representing a 44%+ growth clip from last year.</p><p>Amazon--along with others in the eCommerce industry--has seen much of their success from the previous quarter carry over into Q2. While responses to the ongoing pandemic continue to vary across the globe, the concepts of shelter-in-place and work-from-home remain prevalent among a majority of consumers, fueling the market for online shopping.</p><p>For the third fiscal quarter of 2020, Apple's $2.58 earnings-per-share on revenues of $59.7 billion beat analysts' expectations of $52.6 billion of revenue with earnings-per-share of $2.07.</p><p>The California-based tech giant, Google Alphabet Inc., reported $10.13 earnings-per-share on revenues of nearly $38.3 billion. Analysts estimated $37.34 billion, slightly beating sales expectations amidst the pandemic. However, revenue was down by 2% from $38.94 billion in the 2019 Q2 earnings report. For the first time ever, Google reported a decline in year-over-year quarterly sales.</p><p>Despite many businesses pausing ads on Facebook in protest, Facebook reported a $1.80 earnings-per-share on revenues of nearly $18.7 billion, surpassing analysts' estimated $17.4 billion revenue. Facebook's revenue increased compared to the $17.74 billion in the 2020 Q1 earnings report.</p><p>The reported fruition of the tech's big four comes as no surprise to Exults, an agency specializing in digital marketing, including Google Ads and Facebook Ads' marketing platforms.</p><p>Read the full story at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prweb.com/releases/big_week_for_the_big_four_tech_companies_congressional_hearing_latest_quarterly_earnings/prweb17298036.htm\">https://www.prweb.com/releases/big_week_for_the_big_four_tech_companies_congressional_hearing_latest_quarterly_earnings/prweb17298036.htm</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-631161745</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 631161745</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HB-R491-JCBJ-K3X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"731\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Vocus PRW Holdings LLC</copyright><publicationName>PRWeb Newswire</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Cable Television Systems</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, general</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cable television broadcasting industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cable television broadcasting industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer software industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>High technology industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>High technology industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Investigations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Software industry</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Legal issues &amp;

According to aCNN Business article, Wednesday's hearing was the largest hearing since Microsoft's Bill Gates went to Washington in 1988.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos admitted during a hearing that he cannot guarantee no one has ever successfully violated the company's policy on preventing Amazon employees from accessing seller data. This comes in wake of aWall Street Journalreport earlier this year that found employees accessing the data to help Amazon develop competitive products under their own brand. Prior to that, Amazon had stated to Congress that it does not access sales data to assist in-house product development.</p><p>Both Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet's CEOs were asked questions on whether their platforms are biased. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded to questions about 2012 internal emails he sent about buying Instagram because he saw them as a threat at the time. Google CEO Sundar Pichai denied Representative David Cicilline allegations that Google's search algorithm consistently prioritizes its own sites.</p><p>As for Apple CEO Tim Cook, he was let off \"easy.\" He was only asked a few questions about whether Apple favors certain developers on its App Store. While many have complained about Apple's developers, there were hardly any questions on the App Store's guidelines and requirements for developers.</p><p>Despite this, Congress itself won't be able to do much more than regulate the members of Big Tech. With no \"return to normal\" yet in sight and the current state of consumer behavior heavily geared towards digital services, the big four were predicted to continue growing and dominating the market.</p><p>\"Even with the day-to-day uncertainty in our current world, the big four tech giants keep making sure that businesses are in a position to fulfill the demands of millions of consumers,\" said Zach Hoffman, the CEO of Exults Digital Marketing.</p><p>Amazon's domination of the global eCommerce industry appeared to have no signs of slowing down, as the company reported Q2 earnings on Thursday that massively out-performed expectations.</p><p>The multinational tech behemoth reported $10.30 earnings-per-share on revenues of nearly $88.9 billion, surpassing analysts' $81.56 billion revenue estimates. Amazon's Q2 2019 reported a $63.4 billion revenue, representing a 44%+ growth clip from last year.</p><p>Amazon\u2014along with others in the eCommerce industry\u2014has seen much of their success from the previous quarter carry over into Q2. While responses to the ongoing pandemic continue to vary across the globe, the concepts of shelter-in-place and work-from-home remain prevalent among a majority of consumers, fueling the market for online shopping.</p><p>For the third fiscal quarter of 2020, Apple's $2.58 earnings-per-share on revenues of $59.7 billion beat analysts' expectations of $52.6 billion of revenue with earnings-per-share of $2.07.</p><p>The California-based tech giant, Google Alphabet Inc., reported $10.13 earnings-per-share on revenues of nearly $38.3 billion. Analysts estimated $37.34 billion, slightly beating sales expectations amidst the pandemic. However, revenue was down by 2% from $38.94 billion in the 2019 Q2 earnings report. For the first time ever, Google reported a decline in year-over-year quarterly sales.</p><p>Despite many businesses pausing ads on Facebook in protest, Facebook reported a $1.80 earnings-per-share on revenues of nearly $18.7 billion, surpassing analysts' estimated $17.4 billion revenue. Facebook's revenue increased compared to the $17.74 billion in the 2020 Q1 earnings report.</p><p>The reported fruition of the tech's big four comes as no surprise toExults, an agency specializing in digital marketing, including Google Ads and Facebook Ads' marketing platforms.</p><p>SOURCE Exults Digital Marketing Agency</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=UN80086&amp;Transmission_Id=202007311650PR_NEWS_USPR_____UN80086&amp;DateId=20200731\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-UN8008620200731</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GJ-B011-JB72-14JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><timeReceived>4:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, July 23rd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the nose on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tesla's earnings in question this morning. The stock is soaring pre-market after beating expectations with earnings. However, my sources are telling me exclusively that the numbers were boosted by skipping rent payments. More on my exclusive story coming up this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S.-China tensions are rising. The FBI says China is harboring a fugitive at its San Francisco consulate. We have the very latest on this ongoing story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More help for Americans likely on the way. Republicans expected to announce a trillion dollar program today as the clock ticks down to end the extra unemployment benefits.</p><p>Unrest in America deepens. Portland rocked by violent protests once again overnight. President Trump is trying to bring safety and security back to America's cities, announcing a surge in federal law enforcement.</p><p>And Twitter is soaring in the pre-market. The social media giant announcing its highest ever increase in daily users, but it also reported advertising revenue declined 23 percent.</p><p>Markets are higher this morning. Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading. Take a look, Dow futures right now with a gain of 83 points. The Nasdaq is up 71, and the S&amp;P 500 up 9.25. This on top of hopes of a new stimulus plan. Optimism over a coronavirus vaccine fueled gains yesterday.</p><p>At 4:00 on Wall Street, the DowIndustrials were up 165, the Nasdaq was up 25 and the S&amp;P was up 18 points.</p><p>Play ball. It is baseball's opening day. Games are going to be played without fans in attendance.</p><p>Plus, it is day four of our weeklong look at Instagram stars. Later this hour, an account that is blowing up online, gaining popularity with destructive art.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, a new coronavirus relief bill clears a major hurdle. Senate Republicans reportedly set to release their $1 trillion plan today after reaching a tentative agreement with the White House. The bill includes $16 billion for testing, $105 billion to help reopen schools, money for protective equipment, like masks and gowns, and another round of stimulus checks. One key sticking point among Republicans, President Trump's push for a payroll tax cut. The extra $600 in jobless benefits runs out just days from now on the 31st.</p><p>Well, the unrest in America deepens. President Trump announces his administration is sending more federal agents to several U.S. cities to stop a growing outbreak of violence. It is called Operation LeGend, named for a four-year-old boy who was shot and killed while he slept in his Kansas City, Missouri, home last month. The program now expanding to places like Chicago and Albuquerque.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The effort to shut down policing in their own communities has led to a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders and heinous crimes of violence. This bloodshed must end. This blood shed will end.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Portland has filed a temporary restraining order against federal agents already in the city. It's accusing them of detaining protesters without probable cause.</p><p>New York City is threatening to do the same, to file a similar suit if agents are sent to New York.</p><p>In FBI is accusing China of harboring a fugitive at its San Francisco consulate. The biology researcher at the University of California-Davis now charged with lying about her links to the Chinese military.</p><p>Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is demanding the closure of China's consulate in Huston, Texas, to take place tomorrow. This comes after workers there reportedly burned secret documents in the consulate's courtyard. Local reports saw the fires as they burned them.</p><p>Now to the coronavirus crisis. Three Midwestern states are now issuing mandatory mask orders. Residents of Indiana, Minnesota and Ohio will be required to cover-up while inside any public or business building. Washington, D.C., also reinforcing its mask policy. Mayor Muriel Bowser signing an executive order which would impose a fine of up to $1,000 for those not wearing a mask in required spots.</p><p>And it is opening day today, finally. Major League Baseball begins its 60 game season tonight, leading off with the defending World Series champion Washington Nationals against the New York Yankees, followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers facing off against the rival San Francisco Giants. There will be no fans and -- in the audience and all players will be wearing masks. The league now reportedly discussing plans to expand the playoff field from 10 to 16.</p><p>Once football returns, prepare to mask up at NFL games as well. A spokesperson confirming the league's mask policy on Twitter, saying that all fans are required to cover their faces at games this upcoming season.</p><p>Well, the biggest SPAC ever. The record-breaking special purpose acquisition company raising four billion dollars via its IPO debuted yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. Pershing Square Capital Management will also commitment $1.3 billion to this SPAC, bringing total funding to as much as $7 billion to take a potential unicorn public.</p><p>Joining me right now is Pershing Square Capital Management CEO and Portfolio Manager Bill Ackman.</p><p>Bill, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>BILL ACKMAN, CEO AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PERSHING SQUARE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: It's nice to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations to you. Great performance on you're IPO. Tell us about this approach and whether or not you identified the company you'd like to take public as part of this?</p><p>ACKMAN: Sure. So basically what a SPAC is, it's a -- the most simplest IPO in the world. We've raised a tool of cash and our plan is to issue stock from this company and acquire a business where our shareholders end up owning a minority interest in the business. And that's a way to go public in a much more efficient, low risk process.</p><p>And because we can do a transaction almost overnight, that enables us to negotiate an attractive price for our investors. And that's the basic plan.</p><p>In terms of targets, we want to buy a very large company at $10 billion, $15 billion, $20 billion, $25 billion high quality growth company. And, interestingly, today, there are more such businesses that are private companies than ever before in history. And big part of that is the growth in private equity, growth in venture capital, family owned businesses that have grown in significant size.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know you've said that you're not looking for energy companies that are bankrupt but will certainly look at businesses that will survive the pandemic.</p><p>ACKMAN: Do you have a sense of what industry you are -- you're looking toward in terms of what that company is?</p><p>ACKMAN: Yes. Energy is really not our thing. We -- we don't like businesses that are exposed to commodity price risk. So we're looking for what we call the super durable growth company, a business that can grow at a relatively high rate for a very longing period of time, but in very high barriers to entry. It's difficult to compete with. And we're looking for the great, you know, long term hold and a business that can compound its value at a high right over a very long periods of time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where do you see the growth right now, Bill? Obviously, this shutdown has been really troublesome for a lot of industries. Some companies within those industries won't make it out of this, like -- a couple of restaurants and leisure companies.</p><p>Where would you find growth right now in terms of industries in this economy?</p><p>ACKMAN: So in the short term I totally agree. I mean we're actually big investors in the restaurant industry, a big shareholder of Starbucks, a big shareholder of Restaurant Brands, a big shareholder of Chipotle. You know, so we -- and we're also a large shareholder of Hiltons. We do think each of those businesses, it's still a growth company, but not, you know, the next six, 12 months are going to be a challenging period for companies in that industry.</p><p>But our time horizon is much longer. We're looking -- the value of business is it's -- the president value to cash you can take out of that business over its life. And so I do view the pandemic, as troubling and difficult as it is and, you know, obviously everyone wants to go back to a normal existence, I do view it as ultimately temporary in the concept of the life of a strong company, a business that has a balance sheet to withstand this challenging period.</p><p>Now, on the other hand, if you're a smaller restaurant or you've got a company with a lot of debt, you know, this is a life-threatening experience for -- for any business in those conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Bill, what changes because we all remember your infamous interview on another network where you said hell is coming --</p><p>ACKMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you were tweeting at the president saying you've got to shut this economy down completely for 30 days.</p><p>ACKMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now you are saying this is temporary, and so many industries are going to get out of it. So, what changed?</p><p>ACKMAN: Nothing changed at all. In fact, that other network took a 15 second excerpt of a 28 minute interview and played it incessantly for days and scared a lot of people. And actually my message was a -- what the message (INAUDIBLE) point, you know, what I said was, we do need to do a hard shutdown, everything other than essential services, for 30 days. And if we do that nationwide and reopen the company carefully, we can minimize the damage to the economy, we can go back to a normal life more quickly, although it will be a life wearing masks until such time as we have, you know, therapeutic drugs that can make this no worse with an flu, or, you know, a vaccine. And that was the message I delivered. Unfortunately, the message was -- it got more of a media reaction by taking a 15 second snippet and, you know, really scaring people. And I really -- what I presented was a what I would call a fork in the road and, as I said in my interview that day, I am buying stocks like Hilton, I'm buying stocks like Starbucks, I'm buying stocks like Restaurant Brands. And it -- that -- that day, for the people who listened to me, that was the low point for Hilton, for Starbucks, for Restaurant Brands, if you actually pull up a chart.</p><p>And so I'm a long-term optimist. I think we're going to have a middling (ph) economy for the next, you know, period here. And, you know, I think it's great for the president's, you know, out talking about and wearing a mask. I think it sent an important message. You know, no one likes wearing a mask, but it's better than the alternative. The alternative is, you know, things get out of control and -- and we've seen that happen in -- in some big part of the economy, in Texas, California, Florida.</p><p>And so we've -- I think we're going to have to just be -- you know, solve the social distancing rules, wash our hands, wear masks, and then (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>The other good news I'll tell you is that businesses are adapting. You know, restaurants are figuring out how to operate, you know, not at the same kind of level they had before. You know, a lot more outdoor dining, a lot more delivery services. You've seen this actually in New York. I was talking to (INAUDIBLE), who's one of the great, you know, chefs in New York. He's got restaurants, you know, the upper end, all the way down to more modest restaurants, and they are adapting. They're figuring out how to operate. And so ingenuity, you know, very American, you know, part of our culture, if you will. And I think ingenuity ultimately will save us. But it's got to be a very challenging period, at least until we get a vaccine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, no, I think you make a lot of good points and there are some industries that are actually seeing their businesses deepen in this. This digital transformation, obviously, gets even more penetrated in all of this.</p><p>I want to go through the economy and ask you where you think the structural change will be.</p><p>Let's take a short break. Bill, stay with us. We are talking with Bill Ackman this morning after a big IPO in a special purpose deal yesterday. We're going to talk more about that when we come right back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>Then, stimulus in focus. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow will join me coming up as well.</p><p>Stay with us. More of Bill Ackman when we come right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back.</p><p>We are back with Bill Ackman talking about his special purpose acquisition company and what's happening in markets this morning.</p><p>Bill, we were just talking about your comments and you were on the verge of tears, but I want to give you a chance to explain yourself because a week later it was revealed that after you were so negative, hell is coming, you made this huge bet, this short bet against the credit markets and you actually netted $2.6 billion on at $27 million investment and people are saying, well, wait a minute, he came out publicly and said how honorable everything was. Was that in order to make you money?</p><p>ACKMAN: Actually not. Actually, we made the 2.6 billion prior -- six days prior to my coming on CNBC. And, actually, I gave a message of optimism. I don't think you're going to replay the 28 minute segment. But if you do, actually, I've got a -- you know, Tucker did a piece about this. I spoke to him subsequently. And I think if you talk to him now he would understand exactly what transpired.</p><p>We did opposite. Actually, we made a -- we did hedge our portfolio. We hedged our portfolio to protect our investors, which is our fiduciary obligations. We didn't sell our stocks, actually. That enabled us to benefit from a recovery. And then, after we made a profit, we took the proceeds of the profit and we invested it in stocks. And we were, you know, put in, you know, we're at 3.3 billion more long the market by the time I came on the TV on March 18th. So that's actually what happened.</p><p>And I've been -- you know, I'm long-term bullish on the country and my view was, as long as you start shutting down the country, the market will recover. And what happened the day after my appearance on CNBC, California shut down and then the next day New York shut down and then every state in the country effectively --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ACKMAN: Or almost every state went through a shutdown process. And that's why the markets have recovered. And the reason why the markets haven't gone further is because, you know, the reopening has not gone well. You know, states have reopened a little too quickly and that's going to temper economic activity. And so, you know, it's a delicate balance. You know, we can't keep the economy shut forever.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ACKMAN: That's not a good idea. You just have to reopen in a way that's sensible and careful that we don't keep spreading infections. When you spread an infection, it doesn't matter what the government says, people are going to stay home. And if they stay home, they're not going to spend money and the economy's going to falter and more people are going to staying out of work.</p><p>And so I'm a huge -- you know, I want the -- you know, life to come back to normal. And if the consequence is we have to wear a mask, for a temporary period of time, it's the right thing for the country. And it -- and, by the way, so my -- you know, I know that narrative is one that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we're -- we're --</p><p>ACKMAN: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we're all feeling the same way. I -- I agree with you. I mean this is -- we are living with this now.</p><p>Are you surprised to have these soaring market valuations, especially for big tech and -- and health care in an environment where we are in this shutdown? I mean look at Amazon adding $116 billion to its market cap in a single day earlier this week. Look at Tesla.</p><p>What do you make of these moves in an environment where you don't have any foot traffic, Bill?</p><p>ACKMAN: Yes, look, I -- what's interesting -- I mean Amazon is a certification point. There are certain businesses that are actually huge beneficiaries of this crisis, right? You don't have foot traffic, so you order from home. And a lot of people in the last four months would never use Amazon before have become customers. And once you become a customer, it's actually pretty good -- you know, it's a great service and -- and, you know, so I think there's -- you know, the unfortunate thing is, it's a very big differentiation between the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and real life, right? You know the -- there isn't a stock market index of small business. You know, there isn't an index of the corner grocery store. There isn't an index of the local restaurant. If there were a market index, it would still be down 80 percent.</p><p>And so what's happening is the more dominant, well-capitalized companies, like Amazon, the more technologically enabled business, you know, Starbucks, we're a big shareholder, it's a -- you know, they have a great contact list, you know, digital ordering system and they have good deals with the delivery companies, they have a huge advantage over the small -- the small guy. And so I think we can't -- if you're a Wall Street person, you're staying home and you look at the screen and you say, OK, everything's fine, but it is not a fair reflection of what's going on in America. There are a lot of people suffering right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And -- and if you don't have a delivery mechanism at the company, whether you're food or, you know, apparel, whatever it is, you're going to get left behind because, you're right, that's the mode of shopping and spending money right now.</p><p>I want to get your take on Tesla, Bill, because the stock is soaring in the pre-market. It's up 280 percent this year. The company did report a fourth quarter of profits, meaning that it possibly could be eligible for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500. But my sources are telling me that part of the -- the boost there in earnings was because the company has deferred rent payments.</p><p>ACKMAN: You know, the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: My sources say that Elon Musk tried to defer rent in at least -- in several of his properties and one New York landlord said, no, no, no, we cannot defer, but he did it anyway and he only paid half of the rent, $700,000 a month, Bill, for four month.</p><p>ACKMAN: Yes. So, first of all, I actually have a point of view on that. I think companies with, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars in market caps should not be deferring the payment of rent. You know, landlords, you know, their -- their mortgage have to be paid on time, you know, so, you know, yes, if you're a small business you can't afford to pay rent. That's where you are. If you're Tesla, you can.</p><p>Now, from an accounting standpoint, I don't think your sources are correct. Even if you were to defer rent from a GAAP profitability point of view, which is what the S&amp;P will look at, you know, in terms of whether a company's eligible for inclusion in an index, even if you don't pay the rent, you have to expense it from a GAAP perspective, and that -- that wouldn't enable Tesla to make, you know, the threshold (ph).</p><p>Look, I think -- I do think Tesla is a great company. I bought a Tesla SUV Model X recently. You know, it's a great car. It's a, you know, very differentiated car. You know, whether the valuation is correct here or not, you know, I don't know. I've not, you know, I've not done the work on Tesla. You know, the market's obviously expecting them to take enormous market share. But they very well may do so because their cars are, you know, becoming much more ubiquitous, but they've sill -- you know, they're a tiny percentage of the market and they have a better quality -- better product than -- than many alternatives.</p><p>On this new pickup, I think, is going to go, you know, extremely, extremely well. And, you know, Tesla -- you know, the auto -- the big auto companies are so far behind. So it's not crazy to me --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ACKMAN: That the company -- its stock is going up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I --</p><p>ACKMAN: I just don't know whether today's valuation is a reasonable reflection of a, you know, ultimately how much cash the business will generate over time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you say the sources are not right, he didn't pay the rent. So, that we know.</p><p>ACKMAN: No, no, no, I don't know -- I don't know about them not paying the rent. I -- I -- what I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What -- what are you saying, in other words, the speculation that it is because he was going to join the S&amp;P 500? What are you saying?</p><p>ACKMAN: No, what I'm saying is the way -- I'm a, you know, an accounting person also and even if you're -- if you're a company that has a rent expense, whether you pay it or not --</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>ACKMAN: It comes out of the profits of the company. You know, GAAP accounting --</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>ACKMAN: You know, simply because you defer the payment --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ACKMAN: It's not going to increase your profit. So that part is the part I disagree with. Whether he paid --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Self-censorship in America as many on both sides of the aisle debate and discuss the 2020 presidential election, a new survey from the Cato Institute finds 26 percent of Americans hold police beliefs they're afraid to express fearing that they may offend others. The survey also finds Republicans are more cautious than Democrats about expressing their views. The Cato Institute says self-censorship has risen during the Trump administration.</p><p>These are interesting numbers. And, Dagen, I think this may explain some of the polls out there.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: If you voted for Trump you're going to get called a Nazi or a racist or even worse than that, particularly if you work within a progressive company. People are afraid of losing their jobs. That's where we are in this nation and it's disgraceful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, it's because of the mobs, Gianno. The mobs will come at you if they don't -- if they don't agree with you.</p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And just to see this poll shows that it favors Trump in November because the only political things that are unpopular are those that favor Trump. So you should feel very happy about what we're seeing here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, a quick break, and then we've got the initial jobless claims after this break. We want to get that economic data coming up. It could move markets.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, July 23rd.</p><p>We are breaking news in moments. Another look at the impact the coronavirus is having on jobs and the economy when initial jobless claims will be released in about 15 seconds.</p><p>Economists are expecting another 1.3 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week. Since the lockdowns began in mid-March, over 51 million people have filed for unemployment claims.</p><p>Ahead of the numbers this morning, futures are higher. Dow futures right now at the highs of the morning, up 82 points, the Nasdaq futures up 68, and the S&amp;P futures right now up 7.75 points.</p><p>We are looking at money moving to stocks because of better-than-expected earnings partly and also some optimism over a vaccine. We told you yesterday about the deal that HHS has done with Pfizer where they will have 100 million doses of a vaccine.</p><p>Let's get right to Jackie DeAngelis. She's got the initial jobless claims numbers right now.</p><p>Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Maria.</p><p>Initial jobless claims for the week ended July 18th, 1.416 million. That is higher than the 1.3 million that was expected and higher than the prior week's 1.3 million as well. It does break the 15 week stretch of declines we had been seeing. The peak, of course, 6.9 million at the end of March. And as you mentioned, more than 52 million people now have filed jobless claims.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, these numbers are not good.</p><p>Thank you so much, Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>The market has not moved much on numbers.</p><p>Mark Tepper, your reaction?</p><p>MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Yes, I mean it's disappointing that we're still so high when it comes to initial jobless claims. I mean the economy is supposed to be in rebound mode, but at the same point in time, a lot of these governors are starting to scale back their reopenings. So, I mean, that could be causing some of these issues.</p><p>But -- but, nonetheless, it's still high. I mean when we're talking -- any -- any time we're over a million, nowadays, I mean back in the day it was, you know, a few hundred thousand. But any time we're over a million it's a problem.</p><p>I mean I guess the silver lining here is continuing claims have come down a little bit. So, you know, it does look like we -- we do have some people going back to work. Whether or not they are going to be permanent placements and they're permanently going back to work, that's another story and we need to look a little deeper at that. But it is disappointing that initial jobless claims remain so high.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we are looking at a market that I guess is getting used to this at this point, Dagen. You've got the Dow up this morning 74 points. Not a major reaction. It was -- yes, it was worse than expected, but my -- not by much. These are sort of in the neighborhood of what we were looking for.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The continuing claims. These are people who are -- have -- who are still on unemployment, came in below expectations, 16.197. Again, still really high, but that is below the estimate of nearly 17.1 million.</p><p>Since the coronavirus shutdowns, roughly one-third of the American labor force has had to file unemployment benefits at any time.</p><p>But this market is also reacting to a Congress that is going to act with more stimulus money, maybe a trillion dollars. Step up with -- certainly extending all or some of the extra $600 per week in unemployment benefits, but also more aid to individuals, maybe more checks. So the government, the White House, they're standing by at the ready to support this economy that has yet to reopen yet. But by the end of this year, we likely will have a virus or -- not virus, a vaccine or vaccines ready, and through regulatory approval. So there's a lot of optimism because of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, joining me right now to talk more about this is National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow.</p><p>Larry, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Thank you, Maria. Appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want -- I want to get your reaction to these jobless claims this morning. The last time we spoke you said that you were going to -- you and your team were going to reassess where we are because initially, you were looking for a 20 percent second half in terms of growth.</p><p>Where are we today, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, it's still a 20 percent second half, still on the V-shaped recovery camp (ph). The jobless claims today, yes, initial claims off a bit. The four week average, smooth average, which is what people tend to look at, continues to decline, I don't know, the (ph) 15 or 16 straight months. Continuing claims, which may be more important for unemployment, actually fell a huge 1.1 million. So I don't see any breaking of the downward trend for unemployment and the upper trend for job creation. We're -- we're reasonably optimistic about July.</p><p>I do want to say, though, in general, when you look at the whole panoply of economic series and data, you've basically got a housing boom going on. There's an automobile boom. Both sales and production going on. Manufacturing is surging from the ISM reports, as you can see, including the regional Federal Reserve Bank reports. And that's a pretty good mix. Retail sales are very strong and business applications are strong.</p><p>I know we have an issue here, which we've talked about, and it's hard to predict but the southwest problems, the flare-ups of the virus in the southwest are still difficult. There are some modest signs of improvement. For example, Arizona has flattened out considerably. Still trouble in Texas and California. And I will acknowledge, large trouble in the Miami-Dade County, Florida, area.</p><p>But all that said, I don't see any evidence yet -- maybe there will be a moderation of the numbers in July, but I don't see any evidence of economic harm. I'm just looking at these key sectors that are booming. I would add to that, by the way, inventories at rock-bottom. So I still think we're in a self-sustaining recovery.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We're -- we're looking at a market that is given up stuff - - some -- much of the rally this morning, struggling to hold on to gains on the heels of these numbers. And you're looking at Washington, the White House, yourself included, obviously, with Congress trying to come up with new ideas for the next coronavirus relief program.</p><p>What about these unemployed Americans, the unemployment benefits expiring next week, Larry? Republican aides say that a two-month extension of the unemployment aid expansion is being considered. Do you want to see that?</p><p>KUDLOW: No. The White House is not there yet. The president's not there yet. We know there's expiration. We suggest that we make a deal as promptly as possible. We do not wish to extend the unemployment benefits of the $600 federal plus-up, simply because basic economics show that if the benefits are significantly higher than the wages, people are not going to go back to work and we don't want to pay them not to work, we want to get them back to work. In fact, the mantra that we are talking with Senator Mitch McConnell and the leadership is, you know, kids and jobs, kids and jobs.</p><p>Now we have decided and agreed to a significant boost in the education funding. Half of it on a per pupil basis, half of it going to safety reopening measures because we very, very much want schools to reopen, which is healthier and safer for the kids in school according to a number of experts.</p><p>We would like to change unemployment to roughly a cap of 70 percent of wages. And on top of that, we have incentives. We're going to put a reemployment bonus or tax credit on of a significant amount.</p><p>And, don't forget, the president still supports a payroll tax cut, a payroll tax holiday, which would plus up after tax wages by roughly 7.5 percent. That's an inducement to come back to work. If you tax employment less, you'll get more employment. And that's the goal here, kids and jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Larry, what about doing middle of the ground in terms of the unemployment benefits? Are you considering half of that number, $300, or some form of the unemployment benefit to extend, but not the full 600?</p><p>KUDLOW: What I -- I'm not going to negotiate this on air, much as I might like to, you and I could probably solve this in a nanosecond. But we're -- we're not -- we're not going to negotiate this morning.</p><p>I will add to this, though. I mean I think we're going to come to agreement, frankly, and we'll see if the Democrats want to abide by that agreement. I think that's coming. I'm always the optimist.</p><p>I will add, liability protection, you know, for small businesses, for schools, for hospitals, for health care and so forth, that's a key element of this package. I don't know why Democrats are opposed to it. It makes a lot of sense. We don't want the trial bar to block economic recovery and folks going back to work or folks, you know, kids going back to school. So that's another key part of the program. Senator McConnell insists on it and President Trump wholly agrees.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, let -- let me ask you about -- about growth and where it comes from, Larry. I know some industries are going to see real structural change. What do you think will be the growth industries that will take us out of that, will -- that will lead to that 20 percent second half?</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, you know, not being an expert in all those matters, but I -- I would suggest this. Pharmaceuticals, medicines, therapies, vaccines, and technology. Biotechnology is going to be one. You know, right now -- I was at the virus task force meeting yesterday afternoon for Vice President Pence and his group. They're increasingly optimistic about vaccines. And in at least one case, at least one case, there's, I think, three leading cases, at least one of them's going into phase three testing. There may be another one, I'm not sure. I'm not an expert there. But we're really moving at warp speed. Nobody's ever seen development of a new vaccine at this speed.</p><p>And I think, you know, in terms of future industries, Maria, whether it's therapies, medicines, vaccines and related matters, all kinds of equipment and so forth, hospital equipment and improvements, I think that's going to be a very great -- I mean it has -- always has been. America has the number one pharmaceutical biotech by far.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: So I think that's going to be there.</p><p>And I think all things technology, you know, that's what the stock market's been telling you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: You've got this gigantic, what, we're up 45 percent from the lows of last March. I think the S&amp;P -- I know the Nasdaq is already in -- in plus column for year-to-date. So I like tech and biotech. You know, that's where I think the future goes. But -- but, but, but, let me just add, because of our trade deals, particularly the USMCA, but also the China trade deals, I believe manufacturing is going to have a tremendous comeback. I think we've already seen that in some of the numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: And I think our great farming sector, our agriculture sector, is going to show a big comeback. So, I'm optimistic about the American economy, low taxes, deregulation, fair and reciprocal trade deals, energy independence. The president will build on those successes that he had for three and a half years into his second term and I think it's going to be a booster for the entire economy. I'm looking for a strong second half and a good 2021.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And -- and -- Larry -- Larry, you -- you mentioned the -- the money being considered in terms -- in terms of this next relief package. I know the president has talked a lot about testing. There is going to be money allocated for testing, correct? And -- and let me ask you, if you're not getting to some of the things that you want to get to in this package, will there be a fifth relief package?</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, that's a very good point. And, you know, I don't want to forecast the legislative process, but I think if it turns out -- look, the -- the target here, as you know, is about a trillion dollars. If that is insufficient for some reason, all right, perhaps the -- the pandemic continues to flare up, we -- we're going to put in more PPP money, payroll protection Monday for small businesses, I think you probably know. But we can come back and pass additional funding. I mean we've set up a terrific infrastructure for that between the SBA and the Treasury and the Federal Reserve and other agencies. So we -- we can get that done if we need to get it done.</p><p>But let me just stay, my mantra here is just so darn important. If you want the economy to reopen, if you want kids to go back to school, if you want folks to go back to work and create new employment, new jobs, and lower the unemployment rate, the five major -- the four major points, Maria, masking, distancing, testing, and good, clean hygiene, all right? It's so simple to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: You've heard the president say this in his recent press conferences. Everybody is on board. Masking, distancing, testing and good personal hygiene will keep the virus down, allow folks to go back to work - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: Allow kids to go back to school. That is the key. We are going to keep up our pro-market supply-side economic policies to liberate business and reward success. That's the president's pledge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Larry, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLOW: Thanks, Maria. Appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Larry Kudlow. Have a great day, sir. Thank you very much, Larry.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Finding beauty in destruction. Visual arts Jan Erichsen is make things like balloon popping, pasta smashing and much more into an art form. He took something he did for fun in his art studio and turned it into a widely particular Instagram account.</p><p>Joining me right now is visual artist and balloon destroyer Jan Erichsen.</p><p>Jan, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>JAN HAKON ERICHSEN, VISUAL ARTIST: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: And congratulations for turning this into a business.</p><p>How did you first start doing these videos? What -- tell me about how you got started.</p><p>ERICHSEN: As you said, it was just for fun in the beginning. It was just me fooling around in my studio, really, and then I just decided to post them online just to share with a few friends I had on my Instagram account. So it's just like a hundred followers at the time. Then it just started escalating from there. So, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very, very cool.</p><p>And you have been able to expand your brand. How do you make money from this page?</p><p>ERICHSEN: I mean it's not that big of a business, but I do collaboration with brands and sometimes they use my videos for their advertisements and like that then and then I make money. And then also I do -- like custom radios for customers sometimes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you've transitioned from displaying your art in galleries to doing it all on social media, right?</p><p>ERICHSEN: Yes. I rarely do gallery shows now. Before I just did gallery shoes and radio festivals and that was all I did. And then after I started posting online, it was a lot more rewarding just to -- to do that, because I get so many views and so much response. I mean when we have gallery shows, people almost don't talk to you because like, you know, some people come up and say good show but you don't really get any response. And then maybe like half a year till next time. But now I get an outlet for my art every day on social media and such much more rewarding experience.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very cool. So tell me how it's done. How -- how tough is it to get the -- the products to put the art together? Walk us through the process of how you -- how you've done it.</p><p>ERICHSEN: I mean I used to just use every day materials that they -- you can just get at your local supermarket, like balloons and spaghetti and things like that. And I usually just start with the materials. I -- one day I'll decide I want to do -- work with balloons and then I just start thinking, OK, what can I do with a balloons today that I haven't done before and then decide on some object to story the -- and then it just kind of escalates from there. And when I had one idea, usually I -- it feeds over to another video. So it kind of -- I don't have to think that much about it, I just have to work and keep on doing it and then kind of ideas come by themselves. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Amazing, really. Such entrepreneurialism and -- and creativity.</p><p>Jan, thank you. Thanks for being here. Congrats on being an Instagram star.</p><p>Jan Erichsen joining us there.</p><p>ERICHSEN: Yes, thank you. Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A quick break.</p><p>One university might be going -- and to you.</p><p>One university might be going a little too far. The public school that's requiring a specific class to be taken before students can graduate. It is causing quite the controversy.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>California State University is now requiring its students to take courses on ethnic studies and social justice in order to graduate. The board of trustee approved the proposal yesterday saying that students now have to take three units worth of classes on race and other social issues. It will start in the 2021-2022 school year.</p><p>Your reaction, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not uncommon for some schools to require certain coursework. At Wake Forest, I was required to get my diploma to study religion. I studied Hebrew. And I will point out that California law actually requires state officials to complete an ethics training course within the first six months of being hired. This is -- given the movement in the country, this isn't that surprising.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark Tepper?</p><p>TEPPER: Yes, so, likewise, I had to do this 20 years ago at John Carroll University. We had to take at least one course on either Asian or African studies to graduate. I've never seen this at a state school though. Do I think this requirement is going to make the world a measurably better place? No, I don't. You know, quite frankly, I'm just not one who believes that forcing people to do things works very well. I think you end up with a lot of resentment, noncompliance and people end up revolting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But then again they get the exposure to it, Gianno. What do you think?</p><p>Gianno Caldwell?</p><p>All right, we -- we are -- we are waiting on -- on --</p><p>TEPPER (ph): Yes, so -- so, yes, I mean they -- you know they definitely --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead, Gianno.</p><p>Go ahead, Mark.</p><p>TEPPER: All right, yes, so, that -- I forget -- I forget what your question is. But, look, I mean this right now, this is kind of right in the wheelhouse of what a lot of people's criticisms are with regards to colleges, college tuition, all that stuff. I mean colleges force to you take so many classes that you don't need to keep you there for four years and then -- then students are racking up these large tuition bills, they're trying to get all of the taxpayers to pay those tuition bills off for them, you know? And even recently, President Trump, he recently signed an executive order favoring experience all of a sudden over education. So, look, I think the shift is happening with regard to colleges.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right.</p><p>Gianno, you with us?</p><p>All right, we'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, we will hear from Gianno Caldwell.</p><p>More MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, welcome back.</p><p>We are expecting a decline at the start of trading now. Things have completely reversed course on the heels of those jobless claims. Dow Industrials poised to (ph) open down about 40 points.</p><p>Thanks to this great panel, Dagen McDowell, Mark Tepper, Gianno Caldwell. Great to see you all.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great to see you.</p><p>CALDWELL: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And have a great day everybody. Seize the day.</p><p>Varney &amp; Co. begins right now.

In fact the secret is out. <person><nameText>Bill Ackman </nameText></person>refusing to back down from his billion dollar bet against Herbalife. He's even paying insiders millions to dish some dirt. Two tech giants in two big reports. The burning questions Facebook and Apple finally need to answer as they announce their latest results. And some new voices in the fight against Keystone. We're live from the capital as so-called cowboy and Indian activists march on D.C. Because even when they say it's not it is always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the heels of the bid to buy Allergan, activist investor <person><nameText>Bill Ackman </nameText></person>is heeding the headlines again. A new report. So the hedge fund titan is agreeing to spend up to $3.6 million to an Herbalife whistleblower. Here to discuss all that, Charlie Gasparino, James Freeman of \"Wall Street Journal\" and Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management. We couldn't stop talking about it even before the show started. He is skating very close to the line here on a number of different bets. Let's talk about Herbalife first. I mean what do you think about paying this whistle-blower?</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: You know, he has a rationale for it, which I saw in the ABC News piece, Brian Ross and another gentleman from ABC News wrote the story. It is online. The rationale that it's, you know, perfectly OK to pay for whistleblower's legal costs and whatever.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean it was - they are going to pay him $250,000 a year for lost work due to whistleblowing, even though he is working, I guess, in a laundromat. So far he's made $80,000. He denied that in the past. But he said, technically he hadn't received the funds yet, so he wasn't lying.</p><p>GASPARINO: I want to say this. As someone who has covered these sort of stories, whistleblowers and hedge funds and, you know activist investors, I've never seen people pay off people like this before. This - unless I'm missing something.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: And why do they have to? I mean .</p><p>GASPARINO: I agree.</p><p>FREEMAN: If this is such an obvious pyramid scheme, why does Ackman have to spend all the money on lawyering and lobbying and PR to convince people? Federal regulators have information on this company for a long time now. Why this constant campaign?</p><p>GASPARINO: And it's not like ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Really is a pyramid.</p><p>GASPARINO: And it's not like.</p><p>FREEMAN: That's what I'm saying - it's not, but it's out there.</p><p>GASPARINO: But it's not - and it's not like Bernie Madoff, well, as you see. People keep saying this might be like Bernie Madoff when people looked at him. Bernie Madoff was barely in the news when this stuff was going on.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: There were a few investigations. This guy is in the news every day.</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: And this one investors are looking at all the time. Because, you know, they say it is not a level playing field. They say that is rigged. You know, these types of stories, you know, shine a spotlight. Wait a second, average investor is not doing these types of things. And look, they call it a gray area, but I think it kind of pushes .</p><p>GASPARINO: What you're talking about is how he invested in Allergan, which we were first to report yesterday.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: You look at CNBC today. That is all they're talking about.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not familiar with that channel.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right. Not either.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GASPARINO: But I know - I can't help it. It is in the newsroom. And - but what is interesting is the notion that <person><nameText>Bill Ackman </nameText></person>can go, be told by a partner..</p><p>FRANCIS: You are talking about Allergan?</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah, the Allergan. By Valiant that he was going to make a bid for Allergan. Join me in this bid. Go in undercover, buy options, so it's not seen by anybody. The market doesn't notice. And low and behold, guess what happens? They put the bid in, the market goes up and you make a lot of money. Now, does this violate insider trading laws? No. But if you want to know what gets people mad, more than high frequency trading, this looks pretty - this is a perfect example of why the playing field is unlevel ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: By the way - completely illegal.</p><p>MAHONEY: How he got the information? You know, it was (INAUDIBLE) flying over his head and drop the note on him and told him this is going on?</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>MAHONEY: You know, individual investors don't get their uncle and tell them this is going on. So .</p><p>FRANCIS: And it's interesting - it's interesting that Ackman wears the cap of I'm the activist investor. So, out there for the little guy. You know, I represent the voice of a little guy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAHONEY: There are current investors in those funds.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's what activist investors have been saying. But that is not really what it is about. He is the super investor who has the inside track on all the information. And he is part of the problem that we've seen such an unleveled playing field. Some would say, do you agree with that? Do you guys agree with that?</p><p>FREEMAN: Two very different situations. On the Herbalife thing I think Ackman's paying a lot of money to gin up federal investigations - and it smells pretty bad. With this situation, when, you know, Valiant and Allergan, I see nothing wrong here. I mean I think it - federal judges, if you look at - as they're deliberating now in Manhattan about what is the limit of insider trading .</p><p>GASPARINO: I would say this.</p><p>FREEMAN: Their questions are suggesting this is not insider trading.</p><p>GASPARINO: I would say - I would say this. I'm against the insider trading laws. I think we should throw them just - right off the bat.</p><p>FREEMAN: All right.</p><p>GASPARINO: That said, if you are going to have them, this is just how rich people can keep getting rich. There is no way the average guy in the street is ever going to get a tip from Valiant, oh, go buy some stock and join me and buying three options and you let's - and you can make a lot of money.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is not going to happen.</p><p>MAHONEY: Look, it is not illegal, the way we look at it. But it is not morally or ethically the way to do business. And that's kind of what's coming back, and that's why - I was looking out there.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's about - yeah, and it's about the rich getting richer, which is why people are shying away from the stock market. And it's a shame because stock prices are up 175 percent from the bottom. And it is an opportunity for the average person to make money, but they are scared .</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, the average person - better prices.</p><p>FRANCIS: Hang on. More to discuss after this. Don't move. Don't move.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Moving on now to Amazon. The online retail giant has a new licensing agreement with HBO. Prime members can now get subscription access to content like \"The Sopranos\" and \"Girls.\" Shareholders, however, not loving this so far. You don't like - Let's go to James Romelli down at the CME. James, what do you think about this? How is it trading?</p><p>JAMES ROMELLI: Right. You know, this is a groundbreaking deal in terms of HBO is not going to be offered on Amazon's prime subscription service. And this is first time it is being offered on any streaming subscription based service. However, it's not a very big deal for Amazon. And if we look at the stock price today, it is down around $5. So, it is clear that investors really are not excited over this deal. I think if we take a look at this it's really more of a negative for companies like Netflix than it is a positive for a company like Amazon.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>ROMELLI: It does show that they are going to be willing to go out there and acquire premium content. They have much deeper pockets than Netflix. They're a much larger company. And Netflix does not want them in this space. It shows they're serious about growing that part of their business and they are going to be aggressive about it.</p><p>FRANCIS: James, real quick, before you go - what's the feel in the market today? I'm looking at a Dow, that's down 14 points.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right. So, we are looking at a market that's down run 14 points. Most of the moves are higher this week. We're on very thin volume. We're still trading pretty thinly holiday week. I say earnings have been pretty good. I think the markets going ahead higher into the end of the week. And I think next week, once the traders are back from holiday we really see a sustained move higher on volume.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, James, thanks so much. Soon, a new report shows that America no longer has the world's wealthiest middle class. That honor now goes to Canada. We can thank the small growth in the U.S. middle incomes compared to other nations. There are still some good news for the red, white and blue, with recent gains to high-end households the U.S. continues to rein as the world's richest large country. Let's bring the panel back. The divide just grows wider.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah, and I would say, one reason why it is, is kind of what we were going to get into before.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO: You know - you know, (INAUDIBLE) and all these regulators scaring people out of the stock market, saying, oh, it is rig, high frequency trading, insider trading. Do you realize all you had to do is buy an S&amp;P 500 index, put $1,000 in and that, in 2009 when they started easing, when they started printing money? But you make a lot of money. I mean markets are not rigged if you play it safe and not try to compete with these big guys on insider (INAUDIBLE). I think, you know, they should just legalize insider information. Legalize high frequency trading. And guess what? Small investors should buy index funds.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you guys agree with that idea?</p><p>MAHONEY: It's - insider trading? No, I think you need to have insider trading rules. And again, it's hard to define what those rules are going to be.</p><p>GASPARINO: That's why we shouldn't have them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MAHONEY: Yeah, I mean, look. This is the market for small investors also. Look, this is the market is like the energizer bunny, right? It keeps going and going and going. Interest rates are low. Earnings have been pretty good the last couple of years. So, if you kind of stay the course .</p><p>FRANCIS: But that's what that stat tells you. I mean that middle income folks are falling further and further behind. That the policies we've seen over the past five years have done nothing but enrich the one percent.</p><p>GASPARINO: Well, that's another story.</p><p>MAHONEY: That's another story.</p><p>FREEMAN: We want to get more of those middle income people to become capitalists. To raise their incomes to the point where they can own stocks, where they can benefit. Now, how do you do that? You notice Canada on that list has been very friendly, much more than the United States to energy production in its west.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: We have an energy boom pretty much despite Washington.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: Welders making over $200,000 a year in some cases in Ohio. And we ought to be encouraging that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Real quick, before we go, Ken, do you agree with the idea that the policies of the past five years have done nothing but made the divide bigger?</p><p>MAHONEY: I think so. The unintended consequences of Obamacare, we are seeing how wage stagnation, you know, hiring of employees.</p><p>FRANCIS: And the Fed juicing the stock market as the number one .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: Melissa, think of it this way, if you have manufacture jobs going overseas, blue-collar jobs overseas, why not do Keystone pipeline? Why not do fracking? Those are blue color ..</p><p>FRANCIS: We have some folks that are going to come up with.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, tech heavyweights take center stage. The market holding its breath for Facebook an Apple earnings. We have got the answer to all of your burning questions coming up.</p><p>And we haven't seen this much cooperation since the first Thanksgiving. Cowboys and Indians teaming up to stop the Keystone pipeline. We are live at the protests. Teepees tents and bonfires included.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it is on Wall Street or Main Street here is who is making and losing money today. Anyone with a piece of Netflix. The stock sinking today following news of Amazon's content deal with HBO. Shares are down more than five percent right now. That is bad news for CEO Reed Hastings. He has nearly 2 1/2 million shares. So he is less $48 million today. That hurts. And speaking of the Amazon, someone over there is losing even more money. CEO Jeff Bezos. His net worth has taken a real dive this year, already losing more than 6 billion bucks. Out of all the people on the planet Earth, Bezos is second only to Carlos Slim who's lost around $6.5 billion so far in 2014. What a rough year. You know, I'm sure they're both crying in their Benjamins. But you know who is about to save a whole lot of money on cheap and vast fashion? All of us here in the U.S. Highmart (ph), which is one of Europe's most successful clothing chains is landing on our shores. It's going to challenge other retailers with these rock-bottom prices. It has even been known to offer a pair of jeans for less than ten bucks. I bet they don't shrink. The first store will open in Boston within a year.</p><p>All right, anticipation is rising for Apple and Facebook earnings after the bell today. Stocks are slipping. So can this report ease investor fears and answer the burning questions? Adam Lashinsky, is \"Fortune\" magazine senior editor at large and the Fox News contributor, Ari Zoldan is Quantum Network CEO and Lance Ulanoff, is Mashable editor-at-large. Adam, I don't think I have ever seen you in person. You have legs.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ADAM LASHINSKY, FORTUNE MAGAZINE SENIOR EDITOR-AT-LARGE: I hope so.</p><p>FRANCIS: I've always seen you on the remote. Yes. I will start with you since you're in town. For Apple you want to know when and not what. When will they release their next major category? What category do you think it is?</p><p>LASHINSKY: Well .</p><p>FRANCIS: You just don't care? You just want to know when it's going to happen.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Right. It's - to me as an investor, as somebody watching company, it doesn't matter what it is. It could be a television. It could be the whole living room. It could be, you know, it can't be a watch. That's not enough. The point is they need something of the magnitude of the IPod, the iPhone and the iPad for this company to take the next leap forward. Anything else is gravy.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you want them to say when.</p><p>LASHINSKY: I want them to.</p><p>FRANCIS: Because I mean this is the question.</p><p>LASHINSKY: By the way they won't today.</p><p>FRANCIS: They are not going to do it. They are not going to do it. They don't care what you want. All right.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Oh, no that's for sure.</p><p>FRANCIS: On Apple, you want to know what other markets are on their radar besides China. Why?</p><p>ARI ZOLDAN, QUANTUM NETWORKS &amp; CEO: Right. China was - I mean they have done a great job in China. I would imagine right now if I were to take a guess it's probably going to be Latin America.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Just, you know, looking at the demographic and the numbers and the size of it - I mean it's an extraordinary market for Apple to break into.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you agree with that, Lance? You're shaking your head.</p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, MASHABLE EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Oh, yeah. I mean it's sort of like we forget about these other parts of the world, like Brazil, this vibrant social media community, these products there, and services that we don't even know about in the U.S. So, of course you want to go in their place. And that means they are connected and they want to hear.</p><p>LASHINSKY: And by the way, Apple has said quite a bit about that. Their growth outside of the United States and Europe is much faster than it is .</p><p>ZOLDAN: And there is lot of brand loyalty - there's a lot of brand loyal to also within the Latin American market.</p><p>FRANCIS: Lance, for Apple, you want to know, I mean they're hesitating on the wearables front. What is behind that? Should they get into that? What is your question with that?</p><p>ULANOFF: You know, Apple is smart about products. They are going carefully. They are going when they're ready and I think they are looking around now and I don't know if they're getting cold feet. Obviously, Nike just laid off a bunch of people work in their wearable division. I'm looking at everybody's wrist here and I don't see any wearable devices.</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>ULANOFF: And, by the way, that is not unusual. And I think Apple is, you know, they sometimes like to lead, but they are really - they are not quite getting it, right, all the people they've hired, all the designers, all the help - I think they're still working on it. I'm waiting for a signal today that tells us what might happen over the next few months.</p><p>FRANCIS: They could be the one to revolutionize that space if they get into it. Because there has been so many of those little fit wristlets and you see people wear them. Just love them .</p><p>ZOLDAN: But they're not leaders anymore. But Melissa - but they're not leaders anymore. You know.</p><p>FRANCIS: Apple is?</p><p>ZOLDAN: Yeah, Apple is .</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>ZOLDAN: Apple is not leaders anymore.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Let me just correct you on that.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Not anymore.</p><p>LASHINSKY: The interesting thing on this - they never have been. They didn't have the first music player. They didn't have the first smartphone. And they didn't have the .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ULANOFF: But they did have one's market share. But they did have market share and they did have a brand followings. Right? Isn't that really what we want to talk about? It's not that they are leaders. They're innovators.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ZOLDAN: Makes total sense they have not (INAUDIBLE) the wearables yet.</p><p>ULANOFF: Exactly. They will wait for everybody to fall over on themselves.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let's move on to Facebook. Adam, you want to know when Sheryl Sandberg is leaving.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean we've see all the signals. It seems like with the whole lean in launch - it feels like a political campaign.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: It does. She sold a lot of stock.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: It feels like she has kind of done that and is on her way out.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Sure. So, Sheryl Sandberg is a natural politician.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>LASHINSKY: If you listen to her five minutes you know that. So, you see this public profile. Yes, it feels like her work is done there and someone else could do her job. And furthermore, that she has other things that she would like to do. So yes, I think it is important eventually that Facebook say, what is the schedule for Sheryl?</p><p>FRANCIS: You're shaking your head. You agree with that?</p><p>ULANOFF: Yeah, yeah, I think so. I mean I read her whole book. I think, you know, she has got a lot on her mind. She wants to lead women in particular and but I don't think she will jump right into political office. I think she'll work for some - maybe she'll work for an administration first.</p><p>FRANCIS: You think? I don't know. I mean there's been talk about her running for Barbara Boxer's seat, running in California. She has such a strong base there. You don't think ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ZOLDAN: I think she will. She's on the whole Facebook.</p><p>FRANCIS: She's - yeah.</p><p>ZOLDAN: She's been there done that. That's for her I think is a natural.</p><p>ULANOFF: You'll have to answer that full disparity question in Silicon Valley.</p><p>FRANCIS: And one last question, Lance. You want to know on Facebook, how important is that that consumers realize that WhatsApp are Facebook products. WhatsApp and Instagram. Why is that important? Why is that the answer you need?</p><p>ULANOFF: Well, I just think that what surprised a little bit is how Facebook has not sort of sucked them all the way in and rebranded them.</p><p>FRANCIS: Maybe because it's - Facebook is not cool anymore and WhatsApp is?</p><p>ULANOFF: Well, I think there is part of that. But it's also being smart. The way they look at the business going forward, is a number of satellite businesses. They want to be a conglomerate. They want to be more like a unilever. And so, Facebook becomes the hub and all these other products live outside of each other.</p><p>FRANCIS: You guys are so smart. We are going to leave it there. Thanks to all three of you.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, the very local issue that has international celebs crying out loud. Horses have long been a mainstay in New York Central Park. We're going to show you this very green innovation that could be coming to your town too.</p><p>Plus, big tech names are taking over New York. Some on Wall Street are starting, to get very nervous. Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Wireless carrier AT&amp;T narrowly beating first-quarter earnings, really dropping today. Let's go to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It's a name that we've been watching so closely today, Melissa. It is been the big loser on the Dow Jones industrial average. Right now it is down 3.6 percent for AT&amp;T at 34.99. It has been ticking down some of the names in the telecom sector, including Verizon, CenturyLink, Windstream as well as Frontier communication. You've had several of the analysts putting their comments out. And JPMorgan, for example, cut their price target to $34 from 35. They have a neutral rating. So, they did come out with their numbers. They've raised their full-year revenue growth forecast. AT&amp;T, to at least four percent from three percent. But the big picture here, is that the overall numbers from AT&amp;T were disappointing to Wall Street. And as a result we're seeing that name to the downside. Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nicole, thanks so much. So, one of New York City's most popular attractions may be heading back to the stables. The idea of retiring Central Park's horse-drawn carriages, has drawn both the ire and the praise of many of celebrities since Mayor Bill de Blasio voiced that idea. It includes Liam Neeson, Alec Baldwin, singer Pink and former mayor Michael Bloomberg, all on different sides. No one company - now one company is trotting along with a very unique innovation, an all-electric vintage automobile. It is classy and green enough to replace the beloved horses they believe.</p><p>Joining us now is Creative Workshop owner Jason Wenig. So walk me through this. Mayor Bill de Blasio reached out to you about this?</p><p>JASON WENIG, CREATIVE WORKSHOP OWNER: No. Several years ago, Niclass (ph). It is the group that's on the forefront of this change approached me asking me what I would do about the idea of replacing the carriages. And that is how the whole thing started.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, what are the carriages like? Walk me through it.</p><p>WENIG: Well, the carriages represent a time pretty much turn of the century, 1900, 1910, when the idea of the automobile ignited the world's fascination with this idea. So, it's an homage to that period of time, to that type of car. And the idea would be the hope to ignite the same type of passions that brought us to this day and age to have love affair with the car.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm reading, though, the price tag is between $150,000 and $175,000?</p><p>WENIG: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't think as a taxpayer in the city, I can afford that.</p><p>WENIG: Well, these are privately owned and operated. So, we are working really hard to get the price to a really good point. I don't consider this to be a moneymaker for the first cars we are building for the city. But you know.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, privately owned and operated you are going to try and get the taxi company to own that and put it out there? Or who is the owner?</p><p>WENIG: Well, the owner would be any company that would want to run this - business. The individual carriage operators or a consortium that would come together to buy these units.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, as you work though the numbers, how much would they have to charge per ride in order to make their money back?</p><p>WENIG: Well, I believe that the manner, in which they charge clients now would be the same way that they charge clients for these rides. These rides would be able to go through the city where the carriages wouldn't be. So, you have to understand, that the opportunity to own one of these vehicles to replace the carriages is something that they have to make a decision for.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>WENIG: And we're just trying our best to make something that is powerful enough so that will entice people to get on these rides, to further the interests of the city, to be nostalgic and to carry on this tradition going forward. It is, you know, there is a lot of people who come through Central Park.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. They want to do this.</p><p>WENIG: People want to do this.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, and I mean I don't know if they will be as receptive to things that don't have horses. I've shocked by how the celebrities have really come out, on, you know, Liam Neeson so upset that the horses are going away. Alec Baldwin is so upset that the horses are still there. I mean it seems like celebrities have other things to spend their time on, maybe not. Anyway, thank you for coming on.</p><p>WENIG: Yeah, it's remarkable how much passion is behind this, but we're doing our best to try to create a solution for everybody.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jason, and we appreciate that. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>WENIG: Thank you so much.</p><p>FRANCIS: Cool innovation. Coming up, Silicon Valley taking some heat. David Einhorn talking tough about tech. We're going to tell you why he thinks you should get out and do it now.</p><p>And speaking of heat, a Keystone protest that is absolutely on fire. We've got cowboys and Indians, protesting. Oh my. \"Piles of Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Over to the markets, we are seeing red across the board. Right now, Mark Newton is down for New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>MARK NEWTON: Great to be back.</p><p>FRANCIS: Mark, what's driving the trade right now?</p><p>NEWTON: You know, it's interesting, we are seeing a little bit of a stall out after six straight up days. Lot of the NASDAQ names. NASDAQ has been particularly weak, and really even on this little bounce we've seen, the NASDAQ is underperformed substantially. We're still down about four percent from the highs. So, it's a lot of these high momentum names started to turn back down. You are seeing Netflix weakness, some weakness incurred Green Mountain coffee roasters. Also, a couple of the biotechs are pulling back as well.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>NEWTON: One thing to notice, though, is that industrials have moved back to new high territory. The XLI is set to make a new daily high close today above 53.15. So, that's interesting. And we've continued to see a lot of strength in the industrials.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, I've heard a lot of people say today that they're looking at the tech earnings that are coming out today and this week for direction going forward. They want to hear from Apple and Facebook. It's a very big deal in terms of how they look at the economy. Do you agree with that?</p><p>NEWTON: I do. I think it's tough to pinpoint a few names. The group as a whole is starting to stabilize a little bit, which gives me a little bit more confidence. When I look at charts of techs versus the S&amp;P we seem to be holding and stabilizing. So that should be good. Stocks like Apple have been range bound for four months. So I think investors really want to see signs of this stocks getting back up and breaking out for what the future is protect.</p><p>FRANCIS: Thank you, Mark. Appreciate your time.</p><p>NEWTON: My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: So we love our protests on the show. You know that, this week in Washington, D.C., multiple events are being held to push for the rejection of the Keystone pipeline. We are live with two of those voices at the National Mall in D.C. Joining me is Bold Nebraska Director Jane Kleib, and a member of the Lower Sioux Nation, Dallas Goldtooth. Dallas, first of all, I love your name. What is your message when you are down there?</p><p>DALLAS GOLDTOOTH, LOWER SIOUX DAKOTA NATION MEMBER: Our message is to stand in solidarity with as a native people with ranches, cowboys, farmers, land owners, non-native against the Keystone XL pipeline in its development in all forms, and also to address its source in the tar sense. We stand in solidarity. All folks who don't want to see the dirty oil go through their land, through their country and to protect our air, our water, the land, and to protect our treaty rights as indigenous peoples, I think that's really the purpose what's going on.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jane, when you have folks are marching through as cowboys and Indians and pitching teepees, do people take the cause seriously or does it get you the attention that you wanted?</p><p>JANE KLEIB, BOLD NEBRASKA DIRECTOR: Yyes, no, we're absolutely getting the attention that we wanted, and we have Americans who are visiting our nation's capital coming in asking questions about what we are doing? And we explain to them about how this tar sands pipeline is coming through America and risks property rights. So our farmers and ranchers don't like the fact that a foreign oil corporation is going to use eminent domain to take their land away. It's been a great learning experience for not only the tribes and farmers and ranchers, but for Americans who ask those questions.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dallas, let me ask you, what is the reception like from people? Because, you know, according to the latest \"Washington Post\" poll, 65 percent of Americans approve of and want the pipeline, it's only 22 percent that don't.</p><p>GOLDTOOTH: It's a question about information and knowledge, once you start learning about the pipeline and learning what it's going to do to the land. Learning the effects of the individuals and communities that are directly impacted, to me it seems a no-brainer how ridiculous it is. I mean, the eminent domain question is a huge issue, folks on both sides whether Democrat or Republican can join together on the idea of land being taken away for a greater good which is not going to serve them.</p><p>Not going to serve America. It's going to serve outside interests. Talk about job creation, a strip mall will create more sustainable jobs than a pipeline, and I'm not advocating a strip mall, I'm saying that it's foolish to believe that it's anything, but dangerous and destructive to our land and our livelihoods.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jane, sustainable energy brings more jobs and brings more manufacturing. Cheap energy isn't good for our economy?</p><p>KLEIB: Well, this isn't -- well, this is not cheap energy, this is actually dirty energy and it's bad for not only climate change but risks our water supply. This pipeline is crossing over 2,000 family wells in the state of Nebraska. If the tar sand spill happens in the well, that family's well is done. In some areas they have only one choice to get a well.</p><p>FRANCIS: They've already changed the route. Is there any way this pipeline could go through that could make you happier. You don't want it at all under any circumstance?</p><p>KLEIB: Yes, they altered the route a little bit it. But still crosses the sand hill, the State Department confirmed that. That's yet another reason in how Trans Canada --</p><p>FRANCIS: Is there any route that would make you happy?</p><p>KLEIB: We wanted it around the sand hills and aquifer, many folks did. Now that we know about tar sands and the destruction it's doing to other communities in Michigan and Arkansas where spills have happened, we don't want tar sands at all.</p><p>FRANCIS: So there is no route that would be OK with you. I'm trying to clarify your position.</p><p>KLEIB: No, ma'am.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, Jane, Dallas, thanks to both of you. James, what's your reaction?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They spent six years to find an environmental case against this. They couldn't find it. Oil is going to get burned whether it's going through Keystone or somewhere else.</p><p>FRANCIS: What about the well water she is talking about?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Again, this is an exhaustive review. If there is an environmental case to be made, the Obama administration has plenty of green staffers who would be eager to make the case.</p><p>FRANCIS: They put it off a after the midterms and while the majority of Americans want it, it feels like it's never going to happen at this point?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the fear. The industry is working to get around it, building a lot of rail terminals, finding other ways to move the oil, but the tragedy is for the middle class workers talking about. Terry O'Sullivan --</p><p>FRANCIS: What about her argument though that none of the oil is coming here? We're not going to see the benefit of it no matter what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, it is coming here. That's what rail lines are doing, moving the oil south, and not just from Canada but from the back in shale, North Dakota, it is going down to refiners on the gulf coast. So this is a completely symbolic issue that oil is going to be burned, it's only a question of where, and do we get the benefit as Americans?</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, Wall Street starting to feel a little unsettled as tech moves onto its turf. How finance could be replaced as New York's main growth engine. Don't move. At the end of the day, it's all about MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief. New home sales unexpectedly plunged last month by 14.5 percent to their lowest levels since July of 2013. It was also the steepest monthly decline since that time as well. Some economists say weather and rising mortgage rates may have played a role.</p><p>Toyota retaining its top position in global vehicle sales in the first quarter outselling both GM and Volkswagen. The Japanese automaker set itself a new record with nearly 2.6 million cars. GM came in second with 2.4 million.</p><p>And consumer goods maker Procter &amp; Gamble reporting a 5 percent increase in profit. That is due to a surge in sales for its home care products with consumers buying more Tide laundry detergent, in my house, and Duracell batteries also up. That is from the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Silicon Valley is starting to take over Wall Street's turf and experiencing some of the backlash that comes along with the territory. Techs threatening to replace the banking industry as the growth engine of New York, but will increased criticism prove a stumbling block for these internet giants. Here to discuss, Jo Ling Kent, James Freeman is back. We also have Jonathan Hoenig of Capitalistpig.com. He is a Fox News contributor.</p><p>Jonathan since you're not here. I'll give you first crack. Bringing the jobs, taking over the real estate, but now they are starting to get the backlash talking about the 1 percent, we're talking about salaries, it's starting for tech. What do you think?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know technology, Melissa, isn't taking over finance. Technology really is finance. Gone are the days when you have the individual specialists organizations or floor traders at major exchanges, technology is driving finance. It's not surprising to see more and more tech companies relocating, jobs office space to Manhattan, the financial capital of the world. Those who decry it are shooting themselves in the foot. That's what you want companies to create jobs fit well for New Yorkers and for the whole country.</p><p>FRANCIS: That is so classic. So Google is coming to New York. They are looking to gobble up 600,000 square feet of Manhattan, 80 percent expansion for the company instead of people focusing on the 3,000 employees that are going to be hired, immediately there is talk how they're going to drive up Brent New York. The exact same way they've driven up rent in California. What do you think of the backlash?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": They are crazy. This is good. The people can now get jobs at Google. Finance is going down, if you look at the housing bubble, the financial bubble, the U.S. probably did have too many people and too much money in the financial industry. This is probably a natural move back.</p><p>FRANCIS: At the same time, Jo, fair is fair, if you look at the salaries that have been given away in tech land. They don't get the same criticism until now. Jeff Ubben made the comparison between Silicon Valley and Wall Street yesterday saying Jamie Dimon gets hauled over the coals in New York. For his 20 million bucks, but Eric Schmidt presides over four board meetings and gets paid $100 million,\" you don't hear boo.</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS: That's true. There isn't necessarily --</p><p>FRANCIS: That is an outrage.</p><p>KENT: We haven't seen a tech CEO really have a bad fall or have a major crisis in the same way that Wall Street has been perceived. And I think that is still possible to happen. Their reputation still very much on the line. So I think if you look especially, I just finished reading a book called young money and it's all about young bankers.</p><p>FRANCIS: Good book?</p><p>KENT: It is good. You should read it. It's about reputation and tech has an opportunity, if this is a bubble, to acquire --</p><p>FREEMAN: Difference in tech land, they're not paying with our money as taxpayers. They are backed by us and they are backed by us --</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonathan, they create cool products that we like and with banks we don't appreciate the fact if it weren't for them, we wouldn't have credit cards?</p><p>HOENIG: Exactly right, Melissa, total misunderstanding what financiers create for the economy. We respect technology stars because we can hold an iPhone, use a computer and say I understand this company made this product. But to your point people are ignorant as to the value that hedge funds, investment banks, bracket banks, the whole financial class brings. They don't only create the credit cards, they create the jobs and the capitalists that move the economy forward.</p><p>KENT: It's very difficult to define what the value is of Facebook or your iPhone. It's very easy to inflate that, thus the huge numbers.</p><p>FRANCIS: We got to move on. Tech giants battling detractors on all fronts the past few days, Green Light Capital CEO David Einhorn sounding alarm on dangerous bubble and shorting high-flying tech stocks. He writes there is a clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years. What is uncertainty is how much further the bubble can expand and what might pop. The Nasdaq is down 5.1 percent since March 5th when it hit highest point 14 years ago. Guys, what do you think? This letter is news that broke on the show yesterday. You had a chance to drill down more on it. What is he saying?</p><p>KENT: He basically says the valuations of these companies is no longer traditional. They are no longer looking at actual numbers and based on a lot of --</p><p>FRANCIS: So it sounds like a lost bubble.</p><p>KENT: But if you look at high-flying stocks. They've come down. The best performers in 2013, we are talking about Trip Advisor, Netflix, Tesla, all of these great stocks and look at them now, they've come down. Somewhere in a bear market already. Some analysts I'm talking to who don't agree with Einhorn are seeing a pullback. This is not necessarily a bubble.</p><p>FRANCIS: James, what do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN: I'm not sure we should be picking on tech. If you want to survey the landscape for bubbles, given what the Federal Reserve has done, pumping money into the economy, a lot of asset classes. Junk bonds.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonathan, what do you think?</p><p>HOENIG: I don't see. I don't see bubble, Melissa. In 2000, the p/e on the S&amp;P 500 was 40. It's nowhere near that today. Certain stocks are expensive, but the market itself is not in a bubble. Transports are at an all-time high.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, thanks to all of you. Good discussion. Heading into the last hour of trading, we have our very own Liz Claman joining us. Liz, what do you have coming up on your big show today?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Well, I can't believe that panel of guests. You guys have the best people. All of you guys are my buddies. So great to see everybody. We have a lot coming up, but remember there is a major widely held company that came out with numbers today, and the numbers were so good they have probably irked an activist investor trying to make Dow chemical break up.</p><p>Andrew Liveris is the CEO and chairman and president, the stock moving higher on news that it beat on the bottom line. And we've got the CEO and chairman to talk about why he just feels that this company is being run in the exact correct way. They are shedding assets, which is something that Daniel Lobe of third point, the activist investor has agitated them to do, but he's got a very big man on his side, Warren Buffett. We have him live. Plus we are watching the market. Very tentative at the moment. See you then.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow, huge guest list, look forward to that. Great job.</p><p>All right, coming up, millions of Americans know all about the horrors of foreclosure. Our next guest refused to let it get the better of her. You have to listen about how she fought it every inch of the way and got herself a movie deal in the process. All to keep her home. You can never have too much money or too much gumption.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Investors banking on the stock shares of Bank of New York Mellon shooting up at this hour. Nicole Petallides is standing by at the New York Stock Exchange. What are the reports that are driving this higher?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS: Well, you are seeing right now that's a two-day chart. You see instant pop here over the last hour or so. Bank of New York Mellon now up 2.7 percent. There are reports that they are considering a sale of the corporate trust unit. Now if they were to do this possible sale, people speculate that this could account for about $2.5 billion.</p><p>One person has been reporting that Goldman Sachs may be helping them with this, Fox Business spoke with Bank of New York Mellon. The spokesman told Fox Business that they are declining to comment on speculation.</p><p>In the meantime, this could be good news for shareholders as money could be returned to the shareholders, but you see the stock getting a big pop on the idea of this report that they could sell off the corporate trust unit.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nicole Petallides, thank you so much. It's time for spare change, this story takes the cake. Faced with losing her house, Angela Logan baked her way out of foreclosure using grandmother's apple cake recipe. She has a thriving bakery and a teaming movie about her experience.</p><p>Angela Logan joins me now. We wanted to do your story because it is such a celebration of the American spirit. You found yourself in this situation more than 2 million Americans found themselves in. Losing your house. Instead of giving up, you said what could I do to change the situation? How did you get to this?</p><p>ANGELA LOGAN, MORTGAGE APPLE CAKES: Well, I decided that I wanted to bake 100 cakes in 10 days to help myself save my home and asked my friends and neighbors buy to save my home. I had to go to the bottom to reach out for something else. There was nowhere else to go, I had to reach for whatever I had and my cake is what I had.</p><p>FRANCIS: So did you know you were able to sell all them? You are looking at a situation where you can't make your mortgage payment so you have to invest in ingredients. It was a risk?</p><p>LOGAN: I need three months of mortgage payments, $2500 each and I knew I had ten days to get it. I put a circle in the middle much the piece of paper and said how many people do I have to buy the cakes? I reached out to friends that worked for organizations I volunteer and asked those people first to help me save my home by buying a cake.</p><p>FRANCIS: What was the difference between going to someone and asking them to buy your cake versus saying can you lend me money or give me money?</p><p>LOGAN: That's select charity, I guess, I think that a lot of people were having a difficult time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>LOGAN: I did not feel like I wanted to ask somebody for something. I wanted to work for it in a way, and I had no job. So buying a cake which was of extraordinary quality, cream cheese frosting.</p><p>FRANCIS: Because 40 is a lot for a cake. The media picked up on the story. At one point you had too much demand, you couldn't bake fast enough. What's the end to the story? Do you have the house?</p><p>LOGAN: I do. It was a miracle the company shipped the cakes for me. Now we have the same situation, the movie comes out, a lot of demand. We're all set for national shipping.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's great. Your web site, how can people buy a cake if they want to?</p><p>LOGAN: At <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.maccakes.com\">www.maccakes.com</url> and see the movie tonight on Up TV at uptv.com.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, terrific. Good for you, Angela. Thanks so much and congratulations. Bosses beware, ever get the feeling some of your team are talking behind you? Turns out millions of workers wouldn't trust employers if their lives depended on it. It is costing businesses in a lot of ways. You can never have too much money. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: A new study from the American Psychological Association says only half of workers think their employers are honest with them. Not only does this make for lousy morale and hurting productivity. James Freeman and Jo Ling Kent are back with me as well. Twenty four percent don't trust their company, 32 percent say their employer is not honest with them. What do you think is the age we live in, our employers are spying on us, get used to it.</p><p>KENT: Well, if you're going to have technology in the office. If you're going to operate on a work computer, it should be assumed in good faith pretty much your information is publicly for the company. That comes with the territory.</p><p>FRANCIS: They also -- 62 percent say they are treated fairly. So by definition almost 40 percent do not think they are treated fairly. Less than half are happy with their professional growth. Just an unhappiness at work is what I am hearing.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't see it that way. I mean, it's a job after and the fact that over 60 percent, I guess I'm looking at the glass as 60 percent full. I have to tell you, expectations were set very low because I worked living off your tax dollars for the federal government for several years so this has kind of been a dream of transparency, openness and honesty.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think there is 100 percent happiness within this building. It speaks to a little bit how the stock market has gone up, corporate profits have increased, wages have lagged, people feel like in general maybe they are not getting their piece of the pie, real quick.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't think the numbers are that bad. It is a workplace, some people will be dissatisfied. Most of them aren't.</p><p>KENT: Over the things or small things. Maybe the water cooler or their benefits or e-mails accessed.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think they want more money. We always want more money. Maybe they are just unhappy people. Thanks to both of you. That is all we have for now. I hope you are making money and you're happy at work today. \"COUNTDOWN\" with Liz Claman starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC.

In fact the secret is out. <person><nameText>Bill Ackman </nameText></person>refusing to back down from his billion dollar bet against Herbalife. He's even paying insiders millions to dish some dirt. Two tech giants in two big reports. The burning questions Facebook and Apple finally need to answer as they announce their latest results. And some new voices in the fight against Keystone. We're live from the capital as so-called cowboy and Indian activists march on D.C. Because even when they say it's not it is always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the heels of the bid to buy Allergan, activist investor <person><nameText>Bill Ackman </nameText></person>is heeding the headlines again. A new report. So the hedge fund titan is agreeing to spend up to $3.6 million to an Herbalife whistleblower. Here to discuss all that, Charlie Gasparino, James Freeman of \"Wall Street Journal\" and Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management. We couldn't stop talking about it even before the show started. He is skating very close to the line here on a number of different bets. Let's talk about Herbalife first. I mean what do you think about paying this whistle-blower?</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: You know, he has a rationale for it, which I saw in the ABC News piece, Brian Ross and another gentleman from ABC News wrote the story. It is online. The rationale that it's, you know, perfectly OK to pay for whistleblower's legal costs and whatever.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean it was - they are going to pay him $250,000 a year for lost work due to whistleblowing, even though he is working, I guess, in a laundromat. So far he's made $80,000. He denied that in the past. But he said, technically he hadn't received the funds yet, so he wasn't lying.</p><p>GASPARINO: I want to say this. As someone who has covered these sort of stories, whistleblowers and hedge funds and, you know activist investors, I've never seen people pay off people like this before. This - unless I'm missing something.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: And why do they have to? I mean .</p><p>GASPARINO: I agree.</p><p>FREEMAN: If this is such an obvious pyramid scheme, why does Ackman have to spend all the money on lawyering and lobbying and PR to convince people? Federal regulators have information on this company for a long time now. Why this constant campaign?</p><p>GASPARINO: And it's not like ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Really is a pyramid.</p><p>GASPARINO: And it's not like.</p><p>FREEMAN: That's what I'm saying - it's not, but it's out there.</p><p>GASPARINO: But it's not - and it's not like Bernie Madoff, well, as you see. People keep saying this might be like Bernie Madoff when people looked at him. Bernie Madoff was barely in the news when this stuff was going on.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: There were a few investigations. This guy is in the news every day.</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: And this one investors are looking at all the time. Because, you know, they say it is not a level playing field. They say that is rigged. You know, these types of stories, you know, shine a spotlight. Wait a second, average investor is not doing these types of things. And look, they call it a gray area, but I think it kind of pushes .</p><p>GASPARINO: What you're talking about is how he invested in Allergan, which we were first to report yesterday.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: You look at CNBC today. That is all they're talking about.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not familiar with that channel.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right. Not either.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GASPARINO: But I know - I can't help it. It is in the newsroom. And - but what is interesting is the notion that <person><nameText>Bill Ackman </nameText></person>can go, be told by a partner..</p><p>FRANCIS: You are talking about Allergan?</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah, the Allergan. By Valiant that he was going to make a bid for Allergan. Join me in this bid. Go in undercover, buy options, so it's not seen by anybody. The market doesn't notice. And low and behold, guess what happens? They put the bid in, the market goes up and you make a lot of money. Now, does this violate insider trading laws? No. But if you want to know what gets people mad, more than high frequency trading, this looks pretty - this is a perfect example of why the playing field is unlevel ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: By the way - completely illegal.</p><p>MAHONEY: How he got the information? You know, it was (INAUDIBLE) flying over his head and drop the note on him and told him this is going on?</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>MAHONEY: You know, individual investors don't get their uncle and tell them this is going on. So .</p><p>FRANCIS: And it's interesting - it's interesting that Ackman wears the cap of I'm the activist investor. So, out there for the little guy. You know, I represent the voice of a little guy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAHONEY: There are current investors in those funds.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's what activist investors have been saying. But that is not really what it is about. He is the super investor who has the inside track on all the information. And he is part of the problem that we've seen such an unleveled playing field. Some would say, do you agree with that? Do you guys agree with that?</p><p>FREEMAN: Two very different situations. On the Herbalife thing I think Ackman's paying a lot of money to gin up federal investigations - and it smells pretty bad. With this situation, when, you know, Valiant and Allergan, I see nothing wrong here. I mean I think it - federal judges, if you look at - as they're deliberating now in Manhattan about what is the limit of insider trading .</p><p>GASPARINO: I would say this.</p><p>FREEMAN: Their questions are suggesting this is not insider trading.</p><p>GASPARINO: I would say - I would say this. I'm against the insider trading laws. I think we should throw them just - right off the bat.</p><p>FREEMAN: All right.</p><p>GASPARINO: That said, if you are going to have them, this is just how rich people can keep getting rich. There is no way the average guy in the street is ever going to get a tip from Valiant, oh, go buy some stock and join me and buying three options and you let's - and you can make a lot of money.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is not going to happen.</p><p>MAHONEY: Look, it is not illegal, the way we look at it. But it is not morally or ethically the way to do business. And that's kind of what's coming back, and that's why - I was looking out there.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's about - yeah, and it's about the rich getting richer, which is why people are shying away from the stock market. And it's a shame because stock prices are up 175 percent from the bottom. And it is an opportunity for the average person to make money, but they are scared .</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, the average person - better prices.</p><p>FRANCIS: Hang on. More to discuss after this. Don't move. Don't move.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Moving on now to Amazon. The online retail giant has a new licensing agreement with HBO. Prime members can now get subscription access to content like \"The Sopranos\" and \"Girls.\" Shareholders, however, not loving this so far. You don't like - Let's go to James Romelli down at the CME. James, what do you think about this? How is it trading?</p><p>JAMES ROMELLI: Right. You know, this is a groundbreaking deal in terms of HBO is not going to be offered on Amazon's prime subscription service. And this is first time it is being offered on any streaming subscription based service. However, it's not a very big deal for Amazon. And if we look at the stock price today, it is down around $5. So, it is clear that investors really are not excited over this deal. I think if we take a look at this it's really more of a negative for companies like Netflix than it is a positive for a company like Amazon.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>ROMELLI: It does show that they are going to be willing to go out there and acquire premium content. They have much deeper pockets than Netflix. They're a much larger company. And Netflix does not want them in this space. It shows they're serious about growing that part of their business and they are going to be aggressive about it.</p><p>FRANCIS: James, real quick, before you go - what's the feel in the market today? I'm looking at a Dow, that's down 14 points.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right. So, we are looking at a market that's down run 14 points. Most of the moves are higher this week. We're on very thin volume. We're still trading pretty thinly holiday week. I say earnings have been pretty good. I think the markets going ahead higher into the end of the week. And I think next week, once the traders are back from holiday we really see a sustained move higher on volume.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, James, thanks so much. Soon, a new report shows that America no longer has the world's wealthiest middle class. That honor now goes to Canada. We can thank the small growth in the U.S. middle incomes compared to other nations. There are still some good news for the red, white and blue, with recent gains to high-end households the U.S. continues to rein as the world's richest large country. Let's bring the panel back. The divide just grows wider.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah, and I would say, one reason why it is, is kind of what we were going to get into before.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO: You know - you know, (INAUDIBLE) and all these regulators scaring people out of the stock market, saying, oh, it is rig, high frequency trading, insider trading. Do you realize all you had to do is buy an S&amp;P 500 index, put $1,000 in and that, in 2009 when they started easing, when they started printing money? But you make a lot of money. I mean markets are not rigged if you play it safe and not try to compete with these big guys on insider (INAUDIBLE). I think, you know, they should just legalize insider information. Legalize high frequency trading. And guess what? Small investors should buy index funds.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you guys agree with that idea?</p><p>MAHONEY: It's - insider trading? No, I think you need to have insider trading rules. And again, it's hard to define what those rules are going to be.</p><p>GASPARINO: That's why we shouldn't have them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MAHONEY: Yeah, I mean, look. This is the market for small investors also. Look, this is the market is like the energizer bunny, right? It keeps going and going and going. Interest rates are low. Earnings have been pretty good the last couple of years. So, if you kind of stay the course .</p><p>FRANCIS: But that's what that stat tells you. I mean that middle income folks are falling further and further behind. That the policies we've seen over the past five years have done nothing but enrich the one percent.</p><p>GASPARINO: Well, that's another story.</p><p>MAHONEY: That's another story.</p><p>FREEMAN: We want to get more of those middle income people to become capitalists. To raise their incomes to the point where they can own stocks, where they can benefit. Now, how do you do that? You notice Canada on that list has been very friendly, much more than the United States to energy production in its west.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: We have an energy boom pretty much despite Washington.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: Welders making over $200,000 a year in some cases in Ohio. And we ought to be encouraging that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Real quick, before we go, Ken, do you agree with the idea that the policies of the past five years have done nothing but made the divide bigger?</p><p>MAHONEY: I think so. The unintended consequences of Obamacare, we are seeing how wage stagnation, you know, hiring of employees.</p><p>FRANCIS: And the Fed juicing the stock market as the number one .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: Melissa, think of it this way, if you have manufacture jobs going overseas, blue-collar jobs overseas, why not do Keystone pipeline? Why not do fracking? Those are blue color ..</p><p>FRANCIS: We have some folks that are going to come up with.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, tech heavyweights take center stage. The market holding its breath for Facebook an Apple earnings. We have got the answer to all of your burning questions coming up.</p><p>And we haven't seen this much cooperation since the first Thanksgiving. Cowboys and Indians teaming up to stop the Keystone pipeline. We are live at the protests. Teepees tents and bonfires included.</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it is on Wall Street or Main Street here is who is making and losing money today. Anyone with a piece of Netflix. The stock sinking today following news of Amazon's content deal with HBO. Shares are down more than five percent right now. That is bad news for CEO Reed Hastings. He has nearly 2 1/2 million shares. So he is less $48 million today. That hurts. And speaking of the Amazon, someone over there is losing even more money. CEO Jeff Bezos. His net worth has taken a real dive this year, already losing more than 6 billion bucks. Out of all the people on the planet Earth, Bezos is second only to Carlos Slim who's lost around $6.5 billion so far in 2014. What a rough year. You know, I'm sure they're both crying in their Benjamins. But you know who is about to save a whole lot of money on cheap and vast fashion? All of us here in the U.S. Highmart (ph), which is one of Europe's most successful clothing chains is landing on our shores. It's going to challenge other retailers with these rock-bottom prices. It has even been known to offer a pair of jeans for less than ten bucks. I bet they don't shrink. The first store will open in Boston within a year.</p><p>All right, anticipation is rising for Apple and Facebook earnings after the bell today. Stocks are slipping. So can this report ease investor fears and answer the burning questions? Adam Lashinsky, is \"Fortune\" magazine senior editor at large and the Fox News contributor, Ari Zoldan is Quantum Network CEO and Lance Ulanoff, is Mashable editor-at-large. Adam, I don't think I have ever seen you in person. You have legs.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ADAM LASHINSKY, FORTUNE MAGAZINE SENIOR EDITOR-AT-LARGE: I hope so.</p><p>FRANCIS: I've always seen you on the remote. Yes. I will start with you since you're in town. For Apple you want to know when and not what. When will they release their next major category? What category do you think it is?</p><p>LASHINSKY: Well .</p><p>FRANCIS: You just don't care? You just want to know when it's going to happen.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Right. It's - to me as an investor, as somebody watching company, it doesn't matter what it is. It could be a television. It could be the whole living room. It could be, you know, it can't be a watch. That's not enough. The point is they need something of the magnitude of the IPod, the iPhone and the iPad for this company to take the next leap forward. Anything else is gravy.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you want them to say when.</p><p>LASHINSKY: I want them to.</p><p>FRANCIS: Because I mean this is the question.</p><p>LASHINSKY: By the way they won't today.</p><p>FRANCIS: They are not going to do it. They are not going to do it. They don't care what you want. All right.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Oh, no that's for sure.</p><p>FRANCIS: On Apple, you want to know what other markets are on their radar besides China. Why?</p><p>ARI ZOLDAN, QUANTUM NETWORKS &amp; CEO: Right. China was - I mean they have done a great job in China. I would imagine right now if I were to take a guess it's probably going to be Latin America.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Just, you know, looking at the demographic and the numbers and the size of it - I mean it's an extraordinary market for Apple to break into.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you agree with that, Lance? You're shaking your head.</p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, MASHABLE EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Oh, yeah. I mean it's sort of like we forget about these other parts of the world, like Brazil, this vibrant social media community, these products there, and services that we don't even know about in the U.S. So, of course you want to go in their place. And that means they are connected and they want to hear.</p><p>LASHINSKY: And by the way, Apple has said quite a bit about that. Their growth outside of the United States and Europe is much faster than it is .</p><p>ZOLDAN: And there is lot of brand loyalty - there's a lot of brand loyal to also within the Latin American market.</p><p>FRANCIS: Lance, for Apple, you want to know, I mean they're hesitating on the wearables front. What is behind that? Should they get into that? What is your question with that?</p><p>ULANOFF: You know, Apple is smart about products. They are going carefully. They are going when they're ready and I think they are looking around now and I don't know if they're getting cold feet. Obviously, Nike just laid off a bunch of people work in their wearable division. I'm looking at everybody's wrist here and I don't see any wearable devices.</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>ULANOFF: And, by the way, that is not unusual. And I think Apple is, you know, they sometimes like to lead, but they are really - they are not quite getting it, right, all the people they've hired, all the designers, all the help - I think they're still working on it. I'm waiting for a signal today that tells us what might happen over the next few months.</p><p>FRANCIS: They could be the one to revolutionize that space if they get into it. Because there has been so many of those little fit wristlets and you see people wear them. Just love them .</p><p>ZOLDAN: But they're not leaders anymore. But Melissa - but they're not leaders anymore. You know.</p><p>FRANCIS: Apple is?</p><p>ZOLDAN: Yeah, Apple is .</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>ZOLDAN: Apple is not leaders anymore.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Let me just correct you on that.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Not anymore.</p><p>LASHINSKY: The interesting thing on this - they never have been. They didn't have the first music player. They didn't have the first smartphone. And they didn't have the .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ULANOFF: But they did have one's market share. But they did have market share and they did have a brand followings. Right? Isn't that really what we want to talk about? It's not that they are leaders. They're innovators.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ZOLDAN: Makes total sense they have not (INAUDIBLE) the wearables yet.</p><p>ULANOFF: Exactly. They will wait for everybody to fall over on themselves.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let's move on to Facebook. Adam, you want to know when Sheryl Sandberg is leaving.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean we've see all the signals. It seems like with the whole lean in launch - it feels like a political campaign.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: It does. She sold a lot of stock.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: It feels like she has kind of done that and is on her way out.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Sure. So, Sheryl Sandberg is a natural politician.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>LASHINSKY: If you listen to her five minutes you know that. So, you see this public profile. Yes, it feels like her work is done there and someone else could do her job. And furthermore, that she has other things that she would like to do. So yes, I think it is important eventually that Facebook say, what is the schedule for Sheryl?</p><p>FRANCIS: You're shaking your head. You agree with that?</p><p>ULANOFF: Yeah, yeah, I think so. I mean I read her whole book. I think, you know, she has got a lot on her mind. She wants to lead women in particular and but I don't think she will jump right into political office. I think she'll work for some - maybe she'll work for an administration first.</p><p>FRANCIS: You think? I don't know. I mean there's been talk about her running for Barbara Boxer's seat, running in California. She has such a strong base there. You don't think ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ZOLDAN: I think she will. She's on the whole Facebook.</p><p>FRANCIS: She's - yeah.</p><p>ZOLDAN: She's been there done that. That's for her I think is a natural.</p><p>ULANOFF: You'll have to answer that full disparity question in Silicon Valley.</p><p>FRANCIS: And one last question, Lance. You want to know on Facebook, how important is that that consumers realize that WhatsApp are Facebook products. WhatsApp and Instagram. Why is that important? Why is that the answer you need?</p><p>ULANOFF: Well, I just think that what surprised a little bit is how Facebook has not sort of sucked them all the way in and rebranded them.</p><p>FRANCIS: Maybe because it's - Facebook is not cool anymore and WhatsApp is?</p><p>ULANOFF: Well, I think there is part of that. But it's also being smart. The way they look at the business going forward, is a number of satellite businesses. They want to be a conglomerate. They want to be more like a unilever. And so, Facebook becomes the hub and all these other products live outside of each other.</p><p>FRANCIS: You guys are so smart. We are going to leave it there. Thanks to all three of you.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, the very local issue that has international celebs crying out loud. Horses have long been a mainstay in New York Central Park. We're going to show you this very green innovation that could be coming to your town too.</p><p>Plus, big tech names are taking over New York. Some on Wall Street are starting, to get very nervous. Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>FRANCIS: Wireless carrier AT&amp;T narrowly beating first-quarter earnings, really dropping today. Let's go to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It's a name that we've been watching so closely today, Melissa. It is been the big loser on the Dow Jones industrial average. Right now it is down 3.6 percent for AT&amp;T at 34.99. It has been ticking down some of the names in the telecom sector, including Verizon, CenturyLink, Windstream as well as Frontier communication. You've had several of the analysts putting their comments out. And JPMorgan, for example, cut their price target to $34 from 35. They have a neutral rating. So, they did come out with their numbers. They've raised their full-year revenue growth forecast. AT&amp;T, to at least four percent from three percent. But the big picture here, is that the overall numbers from AT&amp;T were disappointing to Wall Street. And as a result we're seeing that name to the downside. Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nicole, thanks so much. So, one of New York City's most popular attractions may be heading back to the stables. The idea of retiring Central Park's horse-drawn carriages, has drawn both the ire and the praise of many of celebrities since Mayor Bill de Blasio voiced that idea. It includes Liam Neeson, Alec Baldwin, singer Pink and former mayor Michael Bloomberg, all on different sides. No one company - now one company is trotting along with a very unique innovation, an all-electric vintage automobile. It is classy and green enough to replace the beloved horses they believe.</p><p>Joining us now is Creative Workshop owner Jason Wenig. So walk me through this. Mayor Bill de Blasio reached out to you about this?</p><p>JASON WENIG, CREATIVE WORKSHOP OWNER: No. Several years ago, Niclass (ph). It is the group that's on the forefront of this change approached me asking me what I would do about the idea of replacing the carriages. And that is how the whole thing started.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, what are the carriages like? Walk me through it.</p><p>WENIG: Well, the carriages represent a time pretty much turn of the century, 1900, 1910, when the idea of the automobile ignited the world's fascination with this idea. So, it's an homage to that period of time, to that type of car. And the idea would be the hope to ignite the same type of passions that brought us to this day and age to have love affair with the car.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm reading, though, the price tag is between $150,000 and $175,000?</p><p>WENIG: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't think as a taxpayer in the city, I can afford that.</p><p>WENIG: Well, these are privately owned and operated. So, we are working really hard to get the price to a really good point. I don't consider this to be a moneymaker for the first cars we are building for the city. But you know.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, privately owned and operated you are going to try and get the taxi company to own that and put it out there? Or who is the owner?</p><p>WENIG: Well, the owner would be any company that would want to run this - business. The individual carriage operators or a consortium that would come together to buy these units.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, as you work though the numbers, how much would they have to charge per ride in order to make their money back?</p><p>WENIG: Well, I believe that the manner, in which they charge clients now would be the same way that they charge clients for these rides. These rides would be able to go through the city where the carriages wouldn't be. So, you have to understand, that the opportunity to own one of these vehicles to replace the carriages is something that they have to make a decision for.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>WENIG: And we're just trying our best to make something that is powerful enough so that will entice people to get on these rides, to further the interests of the city, to be nostalgic and to carry on this tradition going forward. It is, you know, there is a lot of people who come through Central Park.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. They want to do this.</p><p>WENIG: People want to do this.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, and I mean I don't know if they will be as receptive to things that don't have horses. I've shocked by how the celebrities have really come out, on, you know, Liam Neeson so upset that the horses are going away. Alec Baldwin is so upset that the horses are still there. I mean it seems like celebrities have other things to spend their time on, maybe not. Anyway, thank you for coming on.</p><p>WENIG: Yeah, it's remarkable how much passion is behind this, but we're doing our best to try to create a solution for everybody.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jason, and we appreciate that. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>WENIG: Thank you so much.</p><p>FRANCIS: Cool innovation. Coming up, Silicon Valley taking some heat. David Einhorn talking tough about tech. We're going to tell you why he thinks you should get out and do it now.</p><p>And speaking of heat, a Keystone protest that is absolutely on fire. We've got cowboys and Indians, protesting. Oh my. \"Piles of Money\" coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Over to the markets, we are seeing red across the board. Right now, Mark Newton is down for New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>MARK NEWTON: Great to be back.</p><p>FRANCIS: Mark, what's driving the trade right now?</p><p>NEWTON: You know, it's interesting, we are seeing a little bit of a stall out after six straight up days. Lot of the NASDAQ names. NASDAQ has been particularly weak, and really even on this little bounce we've seen, the NASDAQ is underperformed substantially. We're still down about four percent from the highs. So, it's a lot of these high momentum names started to turn back down. You are seeing Netflix weakness, some weakness incurred Green Mountain coffee roasters. Also, a couple of the biotechs are pulling back as well.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>NEWTON: One thing to notice, though, is that industrials have moved back to new high territory. The XLI is set to make a new daily high close today above 53.15. So, that's interesting. And we've continued to see a lot of strength in the industrials.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, I've heard a lot of people say today that they're looking at the tech earnings that are coming out today and this week for direction going forward. They want to hear from Apple and Facebook. It's a very big deal in terms of how they look at the economy. Do you agree with that?</p><p>NEWTON: I do. I think it's tough to pinpoint a few names. The group as a whole is starting to stabilize a little bit, which gives me a little bit more confidence. When I look at charts of techs versus the S&amp;P we seem to be holding and stabilizing. So that should be good. Stocks like Apple have been range bound for four months. So I think investors really want to see signs of this stocks getting back up and breaking out for what the future is protect.</p><p>FRANCIS: Thank you, Mark. Appreciate your time.</p><p>NEWTON: My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: So we love our protests on the show. You know that, this week in Washington, D.C., multiple events are being held to push for the rejection of the Keystone pipeline. We are live with two of those voices at the National Mall in D.C. Joining me is Bold Nebraska Director Jane Kleib, and a member of the Lower Sioux Nation, Dallas Goldtooth. Dallas, first of all, I love your name. What is your message when you are down there?</p><p>DALLAS GOLDTOOTH, LOWER SIOUX DAKOTA NATION MEMBER: Our message is to stand in solidarity with as a native people with ranches, cowboys, farmers, land owners, non-native against the Keystone XL pipeline in its development in all forms, and also to address its source in the tar sense. We stand in solidarity. All folks who don't want to see the dirty oil go through their land, through their country and to protect our air, our water, the land, and to protect our treaty rights as indigenous peoples, I think that's really the purpose what's going on.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jane, when you have folks are marching through as cowboys and Indians and pitching teepees, do people take the cause seriously or does it get you the attention that you wanted?</p><p>JANE KLEIB, BOLD NEBRASKA DIRECTOR: Yyes, no, we're absolutely getting the attention that we wanted, and we have Americans who are visiting our nation's capital coming in asking questions about what we are doing? And we explain to them about how this tar sands pipeline is coming through America and risks property rights. So our farmers and ranchers don't like the fact that a foreign oil corporation is going to use eminent domain to take their land away. It's been a great learning experience for not only the tribes and farmers and ranchers, but for Americans who ask those questions.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dallas, let me ask you, what is the reception like from people? Because, you know, according to the latest \"Washington Post\" poll, 65 percent of Americans approve of and want the pipeline, it's only 22 percent that don't.</p><p>GOLDTOOTH: It's a question about information and knowledge, once you start learning about the pipeline and learning what it's going to do to the land. Learning the effects of the individuals and communities that are directly impacted, to me it seems a no-brainer how ridiculous it is. I mean, the eminent domain question is a huge issue, folks on both sides whether Democrat or Republican can join together on the idea of land being taken away for a greater good which is not going to serve them.</p><p>Not going to serve America. It's going to serve outside interests. Talk about job creation, a strip mall will create more sustainable jobs than a pipeline, and I'm not advocating a strip mall, I'm saying that it's foolish to believe that it's anything, but dangerous and destructive to our land and our livelihoods.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jane, sustainable energy brings more jobs and brings more manufacturing. Cheap energy isn't good for our economy?</p><p>KLEIB: Well, this isn't -- well, this is not cheap energy, this is actually dirty energy and it's bad for not only climate change but risks our water supply. This pipeline is crossing over 2,000 family wells in the state of Nebraska. If the tar sand spill happens in the well, that family's well is done. In some areas they have only one choice to get a well.</p><p>FRANCIS: They've already changed the route. Is there any way this pipeline could go through that could make you happier. You don't want it at all under any circumstance?</p><p>KLEIB: Yes, they altered the route a little bit it. But still crosses the sand hill, the State Department confirmed that. That's yet another reason in how Trans Canada --</p><p>FRANCIS: Is there any route that would make you happy?</p><p>KLEIB: We wanted it around the sand hills and aquifer, many folks did. Now that we know about tar sands and the destruction it's doing to other communities in Michigan and Arkansas where spills have happened, we don't want tar sands at all.</p><p>FRANCIS: So there is no route that would be OK with you. I'm trying to clarify your position.</p><p>KLEIB: No, ma'am.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, Jane, Dallas, thanks to both of you. James, what's your reaction?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They spent six years to find an environmental case against this. They couldn't find it. Oil is going to get burned whether it's going through Keystone or somewhere else.</p><p>FRANCIS: What about the well water she is talking about?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Again, this is an exhaustive review. If there is an environmental case to be made, the Obama administration has plenty of green staffers who would be eager to make the case.</p><p>FRANCIS: They put it off a after the midterms and while the majority of Americans want it, it feels like it's never going to happen at this point?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the fear. The industry is working to get around it, building a lot of rail terminals, finding other ways to move the oil, but the tragedy is for the middle class workers talking about. Terry O'Sullivan --</p><p>FRANCIS: What about her argument though that none of the oil is coming here? We're not going to see the benefit of it no matter what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, it is coming here. That's what rail lines are doing, moving the oil south, and not just from Canada but from the back in shale, North Dakota, it is going down to refiners on the gulf coast. So this is a completely symbolic issue that oil is going to be burned, it's only a question of where, and do we get the benefit as Americans?</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, Wall Street starting to feel a little unsettled as tech moves onto its turf. How finance could be replaced as New York's main growth engine. Don't move. At the end of the day, it's all about MONEY.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief. New home sales unexpectedly plunged last month by 14.5 percent to their lowest levels since July of 2013. It was also the steepest monthly decline since that time as well. Some economists say weather and rising mortgage rates may have played a role.</p><p>Toyota retaining its top position in global vehicle sales in the first quarter outselling both GM and Volkswagen. The Japanese automaker set itself a new record with nearly 2.6 million cars. GM came in second with 2.4 million.</p><p>And consumer goods maker Procter &amp; Gamble reporting a 5 percent increase in profit. That is due to a surge in sales for its home care products with consumers buying more Tide laundry detergent, in my house, and Duracell batteries also up. That is from the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>FRANCIS: Silicon Valley is starting to take over Wall Street's turf and experiencing some of the backlash that comes along with the territory. Techs threatening to replace the banking industry as the growth engine of New York, but will increased criticism prove a stumbling block for these internet giants. Here to discuss, Jo Ling Kent, James Freeman is back. We also have Jonathan Hoenig of Capitalistpig.com. He is a Fox News contributor.</p><p>Jonathan since you're not here. I'll give you first crack. Bringing the jobs, taking over the real estate, but now they are starting to get the backlash talking about the 1 percent, we're talking about salaries, it's starting for tech. What do you think?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know technology, Melissa, isn't taking over finance. Technology really is finance. Gone are the days when you have the individual specialists organizations or floor traders at major exchanges, technology is driving finance. It's not surprising to see more and more tech companies relocating, jobs office space to Manhattan, the financial capital of the world. Those who decry it are shooting themselves in the foot. That's what you want companies to create jobs fit well for New Yorkers and for the whole country.</p><p>FRANCIS: That is so classic. So Google is coming to New York. They are looking to gobble up 600,000 square feet of Manhattan, 80 percent expansion for the company instead of people focusing on the 3,000 employees that are going to be hired, immediately there is talk how they're going to drive up Brent New York. The exact same way they've driven up rent in California. What do you think of the backlash?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": They are crazy. This is good. The people can now get jobs at Google. Finance is going down, if you look at the housing bubble, the financial bubble, the U.S. probably did have too many people and too much money in the financial industry. This is probably a natural move back.</p><p>FRANCIS: At the same time, Jo, fair is fair, if you look at the salaries that have been given away in tech land. They don't get the same criticism until now. Jeff Ubben made the comparison between Silicon Valley and Wall Street yesterday saying Jamie Dimon gets hauled over the coals in New York. For his 20 million bucks, but Eric Schmidt presides over four board meetings and gets paid $100 million,\" you don't hear boo.</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS: That's true. There isn't necessarily --</p><p>FRANCIS: That is an outrage.</p><p>KENT: We haven't seen a tech CEO really have a bad fall or have a major crisis in the same way that Wall Street has been perceived. And I think that is still possible to happen. Their reputation still very much on the line. So I think if you look especially, I just finished reading a book called young money and it's all about young bankers.</p><p>FRANCIS: Good book?</p><p>KENT: It is good. You should read it. It's about reputation and tech has an opportunity, if this is a bubble, to acquire --</p><p>FREEMAN: Difference in tech land, they're not paying with our money as taxpayers. They are backed by us and they are backed by us --</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonathan, they create cool products that we like and with banks we don't appreciate the fact if it weren't for them, we wouldn't have credit cards?</p><p>HOENIG: Exactly right, Melissa, total misunderstanding what financiers create for the economy. We respect technology stars because we can hold an iPhone, use a computer and say I understand this company made this product. But to your point people are ignorant as to the value that hedge funds, investment banks, bracket banks, the whole financial class brings. They don't only create the credit cards, they create the jobs and the capitalists that move the economy forward.</p><p>KENT: It's very difficult to define what the value is of Facebook or your iPhone. It's very easy to inflate that, thus the huge numbers.</p><p>FRANCIS: We got to move on. Tech giants battling detractors on all fronts the past few days, Green Light Capital CEO David Einhorn sounding alarm on dangerous bubble and shorting high-flying tech stocks. He writes there is a clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years. What is uncertainty is how much further the bubble can expand and what might pop. The Nasdaq is down 5.1 percent since March 5th when it hit highest point 14 years ago. Guys, what do you think? This letter is news that broke on the show yesterday. You had a chance to drill down more on it. What is he saying?</p><p>KENT: He basically says the valuations of these companies is no longer traditional. They are no longer looking at actual numbers and based on a lot of --</p><p>FRANCIS: So it sounds like a lost bubble.</p><p>KENT: But if you look at high-flying stocks. They've come down. The best performers in 2013, we are talking about Trip Advisor, Netflix, Tesla, all of these great stocks and look at them now, they've come down. Somewhere in a bear market already. Some analysts I'm talking to who don't agree with Einhorn are seeing a pullback. This is not necessarily a bubble.</p><p>FRANCIS: James, what do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN: I'm not sure we should be picking on tech. If you want to survey the landscape for bubbles, given what the Federal Reserve has done, pumping money into the economy, a lot of asset classes. Junk bonds.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonathan, what do you think?</p><p>HOENIG: I don't see. I don't see bubble, Melissa. In 2000, the p/e on the S&amp;P 500 was 40. It's nowhere near that today. Certain stocks are expensive, but the market itself is not in a bubble. Transports are at an all-time high.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, thanks to all of you. Good discussion. Heading into the last hour of trading, we have our very own Liz Claman joining us. Liz, what do you have coming up on your big show today?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Well, I can't believe that panel of guests. You guys have the best people. All of you guys are my buddies. So great to see everybody. We have a lot coming up, but remember there is a major widely held company that came out with numbers today, and the numbers were so good they have probably irked an activist investor trying to make Dow chemical break up.</p><p>Andrew Liveris is the CEO and chairman and president, the stock moving higher on news that it beat on the bottom line. And we've got the CEO and chairman to talk about why he just feels that this company is being run in the exact correct way. They are shedding assets, which is something that Daniel Lobe of third point, the activist investor has agitated them to do, but he's got a very big man on his side, Warren Buffett. We have him live. Plus we are watching the market. Very tentative at the moment. See you then.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow, huge guest list, look forward to that. Great job.</p><p>All right, coming up, millions of Americans know all about the horrors of foreclosure. Our next guest refused to let it get the better of her. You have to listen about how she fought it every inch of the way and got herself a movie deal in the process. All to keep her home. You can never have too much money or too much gumption.</p><p>FRANCIS: Investors banking on the stock shares of Bank of New York Mellon shooting up at this hour. Nicole Petallides is standing by at the New York Stock Exchange. What are the reports that are driving this higher?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS: Well, you are seeing right now that's a two-day chart. You see instant pop here over the last hour or so. Bank of New York Mellon now up 2.7 percent. There are reports that they are considering a sale of the corporate trust unit. Now if they were to do this possible sale, people speculate that this could account for about $2.5 billion.</p><p>One person has been reporting that Goldman Sachs may be helping them with this, Fox Business spoke with Bank of New York Mellon. The spokesman told Fox Business that they are declining to comment on speculation.</p><p>In the meantime, this could be good news for shareholders as money could be returned to the shareholders, but you see the stock getting a big pop on the idea of this report that they could sell off the corporate trust unit.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nicole Petallides, thank you so much. It's time for spare change, this story takes the cake. Faced with losing her house, Angela Logan baked her way out of foreclosure using grandmother's apple cake recipe. She has a thriving bakery and a teaming movie about her experience.</p><p>Angela Logan joins me now. We wanted to do your story because it is such a celebration of the American spirit. You found yourself in this situation more than 2 million Americans found themselves in. Losing your house. Instead of giving up, you said what could I do to change the situation? How did you get to this?</p><p>ANGELA LOGAN, MORTGAGE APPLE CAKES: Well, I decided that I wanted to bake 100 cakes in 10 days to help myself save my home and asked my friends and neighbors buy to save my home. I had to go to the bottom to reach out for something else. There was nowhere else to go, I had to reach for whatever I had and my cake is what I had.</p><p>FRANCIS: So did you know you were able to sell all them? You are looking at a situation where you can't make your mortgage payment so you have to invest in ingredients. It was a risk?</p><p>LOGAN: I need three months of mortgage payments, $2500 each and I knew I had ten days to get it. I put a circle in the middle much the piece of paper and said how many people do I have to buy the cakes? I reached out to friends that worked for organizations I volunteer and asked those people first to help me save my home by buying a cake.</p><p>FRANCIS: What was the difference between going to someone and asking them to buy your cake versus saying can you lend me money or give me money?</p><p>LOGAN: That's select charity, I guess, I think that a lot of people were having a difficult time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>LOGAN: I did not feel like I wanted to ask somebody for something. I wanted to work for it in a way, and I had no job. So buying a cake which was of extraordinary quality, cream cheese frosting.</p><p>FRANCIS: Because 40 is a lot for a cake. The media picked up on the story. At one point you had too much demand, you couldn't bake fast enough. What's the end to the story? Do you have the house?</p><p>LOGAN: I do. It was a miracle the company shipped the cakes for me. Now we have the same situation, the movie comes out, a lot of demand. We're all set for national shipping.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's great. Your web site, how can people buy a cake if they want to?</p><p>LOGAN: At <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.maccakes.com\">www.maccakes.com</url> and see the movie tonight on Up TV at uptv.com.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, terrific. Good for you, Angela. Thanks so much and congratulations. Bosses beware, ever get the feeling some of your team are talking behind you? Turns out millions of workers wouldn't trust employers if their lives depended on it. It is costing businesses in a lot of ways. You can never have too much money. We'll be right back.</p><p>FRANCIS: A new study from the American Psychological Association says only half of workers think their employers are honest with them. Not only does this make for lousy morale and hurting productivity. James Freeman and Jo Ling Kent are back with me as well. Twenty four percent don't trust their company, 32 percent say their employer is not honest with them. What do you think is the age we live in, our employers are spying on us, get used to it.</p><p>KENT: Well, if you're going to have technology in the office. If you're going to operate on a work computer, it should be assumed in good faith pretty much your information is publicly for the company. That comes with the territory.</p><p>FRANCIS: They also -- 62 percent say they are treated fairly. So by definition almost 40 percent do not think they are treated fairly. Less than half are happy with their professional growth. Just an unhappiness at work is what I am hearing.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't see it that way. I mean, it's a job after and the fact that over 60 percent, I guess I'm looking at the glass as 60 percent full. I have to tell you, expectations were set very low because I worked living off your tax dollars for the federal government for several years so this has kind of been a dream of transparency, openness and honesty.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think there is 100 percent happiness within this building. It speaks to a little bit how the stock market has gone up, corporate profits have increased, wages have lagged, people feel like in general maybe they are not getting their piece of the pie, real quick.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't think the numbers are that bad. It is a workplace, some people will be dissatisfied. Most of them aren't.</p><p>KENT: Over the things or small things. Maybe the water cooler or their benefits or e-mails accessed.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think they want more money. We always want more money. Maybe they are just unhappy people. Thanks to both of you. That is all we have for now. I hope you are making money and you're happy at work today. \"COUNTDOWN\" with Liz Claman starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONEY-2014042301cb230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C26-KCN1-DXH2-63KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7747\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MONEY</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>April 23, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002EAL</classCode><className>ALLERGAN INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Insider Trading</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDBERkVGMDg2MTMzNEY3MEIyRjYwMkU0NTNFNjA1RTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTdGQjhCNTVDOTg4NDREODk3NzZFRkMxMjk1MDY2QUE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>New York Stock Exchange</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTA5NzZFOEE4NUFGNDk0NjgzQzhEMEExMjU2RUNDMjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA4MDk2MDE2NTVGNDFCRDgxODBDMzc5NDgwOTczRTU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Rules &amp; Regulations</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUI0NDBGNkJGNkE3NDlGRjg3REVBQzA4M0U5M0E2RDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTA5NzZFOEE4NUFGNDk0NjgzQzhEMEExMjU2RUNDMjc</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Stock Exchanges</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1CF</classCode><className>WHISTLEBLOWERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N525910EE</classCode><className>HEDGE FUNDS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkY2N0Y5NDExMUY3NEE0NEJERkNDM0ZCNzIxRUU3OTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEZBNjUwRkEwQjJGNDgzQzlEMzMyNEE1RDAyOTY4RkE</classCode><className>Hedge Funds</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>PE000DKJJ</classCode><className>BILL ACKMAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

In fact the  secret is out.  Bill Ackman refusing to back down from his billion dollar  bet against Herbalife.  He's even paying insiders millions to dish some  dirt.  Two tech giants in two big reports.  The burning questions Facebook  and Apple finally need to answer as they announce their latest results.   And some new voices in the fight against Keystone.  We're live from the  capital as so-called cowboy and Indian activists march on D.C.  Because  even when they say it's not it is always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the heels of the bid to buy Allergan, activist investor Bill Ackman is  heeding the headlines again.  A new report.  So the hedge fund titan is  agreeing to spend up to $3.6 million to an Herbalife whistleblower.  Here  to discuss all that, Charlie Gasparino, James Freeman of \"Wall Street  Journal\" and Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management.  We couldn't stop  talking about it even before the show started.  He is skating very close to  the line here on a number of different bets.  Let's talk about Herbalife  first.  I mean what do you think about paying this whistle-blower? </p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  You know, he has a  rationale for it, which I saw in the ABC News piece, Brian Ross and another  gentleman from ABC News wrote the story.  It is online.  The rationale that  it's, you know, perfectly OK to pay for whistleblower's legal costs and  whatever.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean it was - they are going to pay him $250,000 a year for  lost work due to whistleblowing, even though he is working, I guess, in a  laundromat.  So far he's made $80,000.  He denied that in the past.  But he  said, technically he hadn't received the funds yet, so he wasn't lying. </p><p>GASPARINO:  I want to say this.  As someone who has covered these sort of  stories, whistleblowers and hedge funds and, you know activist investors,  I've never seen people pay off people like this before.  This - unless I'm  missing something.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  And why do they have to?  I mean .</p><p>GASPARINO:  I agree.</p><p>FREEMAN:  If this is such an obvious pyramid scheme, why does Ackman have  to spend all the money on lawyering and lobbying and PR to convince people?   Federal regulators have information on this company for a long time now.   Why this constant campaign?</p><p>GASPARINO:  And it's not like ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Really is a pyramid.</p><p>GASPARINO:  And it's not like.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's what I'm saying - it's not, but it's out there.</p><p>GASPARINO:  But it's not - and it's not like Bernie Madoff, well, as you  see.  People keep saying this might be like Bernie Madoff when people  looked at him.  Bernie Madoff was barely in the news when this stuff was  going on.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  There were a few investigations.  This guy is in the news every  day.</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT:  And this one investors are looking  at all the time.  Because, you know, they say it is not a level playing  field.  They say that is rigged.  You know, these types of stories, you  know, shine a spotlight.  Wait a second, average investor is not doing  these types of things.  And look, they call it a gray area, but I think it  kind of pushes .</p><p>GASPARINO:  What you're talking about is how he invested in Allergan, which  we were first to report yesterday.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right. </p><p>GASPARINO:  You look at CNBC today.  That is all they're talking about.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Not familiar with that channel.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.  Not either.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GASPARINO:  But I know - I can't help it.  It is in the newsroom.  And -  but what is interesting is the notion that Bill Ackman can go, be told by a  partner..</p><p>FRANCIS:  You are talking about Allergan?</p><p>GASPARINO:  Yeah, the Allergan.  By Valiant that he was going to make a bid  for Allergan.  Join me in this bid.  Go in undercover, buy options, so it's  not seen by anybody.  The market doesn't notice.  And low and behold, guess  what happens?  They put the bid in, the market goes up and you make a lot  of money.  Now, does this violate insider trading laws?  No.  But if you  want to know what gets people mad, more than high frequency trading, this  looks pretty - this is a perfect example of why the playing field is  unlevel ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO:  By the way - completely illegal.</p><p>MAHONEY:  How he got the information?  You know, it was (INAUDIBLE) flying  over his head and drop the note on him and told him this is going on? </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>MAHONEY:  You know, individual investors don't get their uncle and tell  them this is going on.  So .</p><p>FRANCIS:  And it's interesting - it's interesting that Ackman wears the cap  of I'm the activist investor.  So, out there for the little guy.  You know,  I represent the voice of a little guy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAHONEY:  There are current investors in those funds.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's what activist investors have been saying.  But that is not  really what it is about.  He is the super investor who has the inside track  on all the information.  And he is part of the problem that we've seen such  an unleveled playing field.  Some would say, do you agree with that?  Do  you guys agree with that? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Two very different situations.  On the Herbalife thing I think  Ackman's paying a lot of money to gin up federal investigations - and it  smells pretty bad.  With this situation, when, you know, Valiant and  Allergan, I see nothing wrong here.  I mean I think it - federal judges, if  you look at - as they're deliberating now in Manhattan about what is the  limit of insider trading .</p><p>GASPARINO:  I would say this. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Their questions are suggesting this is not insider trading.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I would say - I would say this.  I'm against the insider  trading laws.  I think we should throw them just - right off the bat.</p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  That said, if you are going to have them, this is just how rich  people can keep getting rich.  There is no way the average guy in the  street is ever going to get a tip from Valiant, oh, go buy some stock and  join me and buying three options and you let's - and you can make a lot of  money.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It is not going to happen.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Look, it is not illegal, the way we look at it.  But it is not  morally or ethically the way to do business.  And that's kind of what's  coming back, and that's why - I was looking out there.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's about - yeah, and it's about the rich getting richer, which  is why people are shying away from the stock market.  And it's a shame  because stock prices are up 175 percent from the bottom.  And it is an  opportunity for the average person to make money, but they are scared .</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, the average person - better prices.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Hang on.  More to discuss after this.  Don't move.  Don't move.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Moving on now to Amazon.  The online retail giant has a new  licensing agreement with HBO.  Prime members can now get subscription  access to content like \"The Sopranos\" and \"Girls.\"  Shareholders, however,  not loving this so far.  You don't like - Let's go to James Romelli down at  the CME.  James, what do you think about this?  How is it trading?</p><p>JAMES ROMELLI:  Right.  You know, this is a groundbreaking deal in terms of  HBO is not going to be offered on Amazon's prime subscription service.  And  this is first time it is being offered on any streaming subscription based  service.  However, it's not a very big deal for Amazon.  And if we look at  the stock price today, it is down around $5.  So, it is clear that  investors really are not excited over this deal.  I think if we take a look  at this it's really more of a negative for companies like Netflix than it  is a positive for a company like Amazon.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>ROMELLI:  It does show that they are going to be willing to go out there  and acquire premium content.  They have much deeper pockets than Netflix.   They're a much larger company.  And Netflix does not want them in this  space.  It shows they're serious about growing that part of their business  and they are going to be aggressive about it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  James, real quick, before you go - what's the feel in the market  today?  I'm looking at a Dow, that's down 14 points.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  So, we are looking at a market that's down run 14 points.   Most of the moves are higher this week.  We're on very thin volume.  We're  still trading pretty thinly holiday week.  I say earnings have been pretty  good.  I think the markets going ahead higher into the end of the week.   And I think next week, once the traders are back from holiday we really see  a sustained move higher on volume.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, James, thanks so much.  Soon, a new report shows that  America no longer has the world's wealthiest middle class.  That honor now  goes to Canada.  We can thank the small growth in the U.S. middle incomes  compared to other nations.  There are still some good news for the red,  white and blue, with recent gains to high-end households the U.S. continues  to rein as the world's richest large country.  Let's bring the panel back.   The divide just grows wider.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Yeah, and I would say, one reason why it is, is kind of what we  were going to get into before.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO:  You know  - you know, (INAUDIBLE) and all these regulators  scaring people out of the stock market, saying, oh, it is rig, high  frequency trading, insider trading.  Do you realize all you had to do is  buy an S&amp;P 500 index, put $1,000 in and that, in 2009 when they started  easing, when they started printing money?  But you make a lot of money.  I  mean markets are not rigged if you play it safe and not try to compete with  these big guys on insider (INAUDIBLE).  I think, you know, they should just  legalize insider information.  Legalize high frequency trading.  And guess  what?  Small investors should buy index funds.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you guys agree with that idea?</p><p>MAHONEY:  It's - insider trading?  No, I think you need to have insider  trading rules.  And again, it's hard to define what those rules are going  to be.</p><p>GASPARINO:  That's why we shouldn't have them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MAHONEY:  Yeah, I mean, look.  This is the market for small investors also.   Look, this is the market is like the energizer bunny, right?  It keeps  going and going and going.  Interest rates are low.  Earnings have been  pretty good the last couple of years.  So, if you kind of stay the course .</p><p>FRANCIS:  But that's what that stat tells you.  I mean that middle income  folks are falling further and further behind.  That the policies we've seen  over the past five years have done nothing but enrich the one percent.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  Well, that's another story.</p><p>MAHONEY:  That's another story.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We want to get more of those middle income people to become  capitalists.  To raise their incomes to the point where they can own  stocks, where they can benefit.  Now, how do you do that? You notice Canada  on that list has been very friendly, much more than the United States to  energy production in its west. </p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We have an energy boom pretty much despite Washington.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  Welders making over $200,000 a year in some cases in Ohio.  And  we ought to be encouraging that. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Real quick, before we go, Ken, do you agree with the idea that  the policies of the past five years have done nothing but made the divide  bigger?</p><p>MAHONEY:  I think so.  The unintended consequences of Obamacare, we are  seeing how wage stagnation, you know, hiring of employees. </p><p>FRANCIS:  And the Fed juicing the stock market as the number one .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO:  Melissa, think of it this way, if you have manufacture jobs  going overseas, blue-collar jobs overseas, why not do Keystone pipeline?   Why not do fracking?  Those are blue color ..</p><p>FRANCIS:  We have some folks that are going to come up with.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Coming up, tech heavyweights take center stage.  The market  holding its breath for Facebook an Apple earnings.  We have got the answer  to all of your burning questions coming up.  </p><p>And we haven't seen this much cooperation since the first Thanksgiving.   Cowboys and Indians teaming up to stop the Keystone pipeline.  We are live  at the protests.  Teepees tents and bonfires included.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Whether it is on Wall Street or Main Street here is who is making  and losing money today.  Anyone with a piece of Netflix.  The stock sinking  today following news of Amazon's content deal with HBO.  Shares are down  more than five percent right now.  That is bad news for CEO Reed Hastings.   He has nearly 2 1/2 million shares.  So he is less $48 million today.  That  hurts.  And speaking of the Amazon, someone over there is losing even more  money.  CEO Jeff Bezos.  His net worth has taken a real dive this year,  already losing more than 6 billion bucks.  Out of all the people on the  planet Earth, Bezos is second only to Carlos Slim who's lost around $6.5  billion so far in 2014.  What a rough year.  You know, I'm sure they're  both crying in their Benjamins.  But you know who is about to save a whole  lot of money on cheap and vast fashion?  All of us here in the U.S.   Highmart (ph), which is one of Europe's most successful clothing chains is  landing on our shores.  It's going to challenge other retailers with these  rock-bottom prices.  It has even been known to offer a pair of jeans for  less than ten bucks.  I bet they don't shrink.  The first store will open  in Boston within a year.  </p><p>All right, anticipation is rising for Apple and Facebook earnings after the  bell today.  Stocks are slipping.  So can this report ease investor fears  and answer the burning questions?  Adam Lashinsky, is \"Fortune\" magazine  senior editor at large and the Fox News contributor, Ari Zoldan is Quantum  Network CEO and Lance Ulanoff, is Mashable editor-at-large. Adam, I don't  think I have ever seen you in person.  You have legs.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ADAM LASHINSKY, FORTUNE MAGAZINE SENIOR EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  I hope so.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I've always seen you on the remote.  Yes.  I will start with you  since you're in town.  For Apple you want to know when and not what.  When  will they release their next major category?  What category do you think it  is?</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Well .</p><p>FRANCIS:  You just don't care?  You just want to know when it's going to  happen. </p><p>LASHINSKY:  Right.  It's - to me as an investor, as somebody watching  company, it doesn't matter what it is.  It could be a television.  It could  be the whole living room.  It could be, you know, it can't be a watch.   That's not enough.  The point is they need something of the magnitude of  the IPod, the iPhone and the iPad for this company to take the next leap  forward.  Anything else is gravy.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, you want them to say when.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  I want them to.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Because I mean this is the question.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  By the way they won't today.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They are not going to do it.  They are not going to do it.  They  don't care what you want.   All right.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Oh, no that's for sure. </p><p>FRANCIS:  On Apple, you want to know what other markets are on their radar  besides China.  Why?</p><p>ARI ZOLDAN, QUANTUM NETWORKS &amp; CEO:  Right.  China was - I mean they have  done a great job in China.  I would imagine right now if I were to take a  guess it's probably going to be Latin America.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN:  Just, you know, looking at the demographic and the numbers and the  size of it - I mean it's an extraordinary market for Apple to break into.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you agree with that, Lance?  You're shaking your head. </p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, MASHABLE EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  Oh, yeah.  I mean it's sort of  like we forget about these other parts of the world, like Brazil, this  vibrant social media community, these products there, and services that we  don't even know about in the U.S.  So, of course you want to go in their  place.  And that means they are connected and they want to hear.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  And by the way, Apple has said quite a bit about that.  Their  growth outside of the United States and Europe is much faster than it is .</p><p>ZOLDAN:  And there is lot of brand loyalty - there's a lot of brand loyal  to also within the Latin American market. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Lance, for Apple, you want to know, I mean they're hesitating on  the wearables front.  What is behind that?  Should they get into that?   What is your question with that?</p><p>ULANOFF:  You know, Apple is smart about products.  They are going  carefully.  They are going when they're ready and I think they are looking  around now and I don't know if they're getting cold feet.  Obviously, Nike  just laid off a bunch of people work in their wearable division.  I'm  looking at everybody's wrist here and I don't see any wearable devices.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No.</p><p>ULANOFF:  And, by the way, that is not unusual.  And I think Apple is, you  know, they sometimes like to lead, but they are really - they are not quite  getting it, right, all the people they've hired, all the designers, all the  help - I think they're still working on it.  I'm waiting for a signal today  that tells us what might happen over the next few months.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They could be the one to revolutionize that space if they get  into it.  Because there has been so many of those little fit wristlets and  you see people wear them.  Just love them .</p><p>ZOLDAN:  But they're not leaders anymore.  But Melissa - but they're not  leaders anymore.  You know.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Apple is?</p><p>ZOLDAN:  Yeah, Apple is .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Really? </p><p>ZOLDAN:  Apple is not leaders anymore.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Let me just correct you on that.</p><p>ZOLDAN:  Not anymore.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  The interesting thing on this - they never have been.  They  didn't have the first music player.  They didn't have the first smartphone.   And they didn't have the .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ULANOFF:  But they did have one's market share.  But they did have market  share and they did have a brand followings.  Right?  Isn't that really what  we want to talk about?  It's not that they are leaders.  They're  innovators.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ZOLDAN:  Makes total sense they have not (INAUDIBLE) the wearables yet.</p><p>ULANOFF:  Exactly.  They will wait for everybody to fall over on  themselves.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Let's move on to Facebook.  Adam, you want to know when Sheryl  Sandberg is leaving.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean we've see all the signals.  It seems like with the whole  lean in launch - it feels like a political campaign.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It does.  She sold a lot of stock.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It feels like she has kind of done that and is on her way out.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Sure.  So, Sheryl Sandberg is a natural politician. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  If you listen to her five minutes you know that.  So, you see  this public profile.  Yes, it feels like her work is done there and someone  else could do her job.  And furthermore, that she has other things that she  would like to do.  So yes, I think it is important eventually that Facebook  say, what is the schedule for Sheryl?</p><p>FRANCIS:  You're shaking your head.  You agree with that?</p><p>ULANOFF:  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  I mean I read her whole book.  I think,  you know, she has got a lot on her mind.  She wants to lead women in  particular and but I don't think she will jump right into political office.   I think she'll work for some - maybe she'll work for an administration  first.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You think?  I don't know.  I mean there's been talk about her  running for Barbara Boxer's seat, running in California.  She has such a  strong base there.  You don't think ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ZOLDAN:  I think she will.  She's on the whole Facebook.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  She's - yeah.</p><p>ZOLDAN:  She's been there done that.  That's for her I think is a natural.</p><p>ULANOFF:  You'll have to answer that full disparity question in Silicon  Valley.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And one last question, Lance.  You want to know on Facebook, how  important is that that consumers realize that WhatsApp are Facebook  products.  WhatsApp and Instagram.  Why is that important?  Why is that the  answer you need? </p><p>ULANOFF:  Well, I just think that what surprised a little bit is how  Facebook has not sort of sucked them all the way in and rebranded them.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Maybe because it's - Facebook is not cool anymore and WhatsApp  is?</p><p>ULANOFF:  Well, I think there is part of that.  But it's also being smart.   The way they look at the business going forward, is a number of satellite  businesses.  They want to be a conglomerate.  They want to be more like a  unilever.  And so, Facebook becomes the hub and all these other products  live outside of each other.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You guys are so smart.  We are going to leave it there.  Thanks  to all three of you.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Coming up, the very local issue that has international celebs  crying out loud.  Horses have long been a mainstay in New York Central  Park.  We're going to show you this very green innovation that could be  coming to your town too.  </p><p>Plus, big tech names are taking over New York.  Some on Wall Street are  starting, to get very nervous.  Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wireless carrier AT&amp;T narrowly beating first-quarter earnings,  really dropping today.  Let's go to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Nicole.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  It's a name that we've been  watching so closely today, Melissa.  It is been the big loser on the Dow  Jones industrial average.  Right now it is down 3.6 percent for AT&amp;T at  34.99.  It has been ticking down some of the names in the telecom sector,  including Verizon, CenturyLink, Windstream as well as Frontier  communication.  You've had several of the analysts putting their comments  out.  And JPMorgan, for example, cut their price target to $34 from 35.   They have a neutral rating.  So, they did come out with their numbers.   They've raised their full-year revenue growth forecast.  AT&amp;T, to at least  four percent from three percent.  But the big picture here, is that the  overall numbers from AT&amp;T were disappointing to Wall Street.  And as a  result we're seeing that name to the downside.  Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Nicole, thanks so much.  So, one of New York City's most popular  attractions may be heading back to the stables.  The idea of retiring  Central Park's horse-drawn carriages, has drawn both the ire and the praise  of many of celebrities since Mayor Bill de Blasio voiced that idea.  It  includes Liam Neeson, Alec Baldwin, singer Pink and former mayor Michael  Bloomberg, all on different sides.  No one company - now one company is  trotting along with a very unique innovation, an all-electric vintage  automobile.  It is classy and green enough to replace the beloved horses  they believe.</p><p>Joining us now is Creative Workshop owner Jason Wenig.  So walk me through  this.  Mayor Bill de Blasio reached out to you about this?</p><p>JASON WENIG, CREATIVE WORKSHOP OWNER:  No.  Several years ago, Niclass  (ph).  It is the group that's on the forefront of this change approached me  asking me what I would do about the idea of replacing the carriages.  And  that is how the whole thing started. </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, what are the carriages like?  Walk me through it.</p><p>WENIG:  Well, the carriages represent a time pretty much turn of the  century, 1900, 1910, when the idea of the automobile ignited the world's  fascination with this idea.  So, it's an homage to that period of time, to  that type of car.  And the idea would be the hope to ignite the same type  of passions that brought us to this day and age to have love affair with  the car.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm reading, though, the price tag is between $150,000 and  $175,000?</p><p>WENIG:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't think as a taxpayer in the city, I can afford that.  </p><p>WENIG:  Well, these are privately owned and operated.  So, we are working  really hard to get the price to a really good point.  I don't consider this  to be a moneymaker for the first cars we are building for the city.  But  you know.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, privately owned and operated you are going to try and get the  taxi company to own that and put it out there?  Or who is the owner?</p><p>WENIG:  Well, the owner would be any company that would want to run this -  business.  The individual carriage operators or a consortium that would  come together to buy these units.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, as you work though the numbers, how much would they have to  charge per ride in order to make their money back?</p><p>WENIG:  Well, I believe that the manner, in which they charge clients now  would be the same way that they charge clients for these rides.  These  rides would be able to go through the city where the carriages wouldn't be.   So, you have to understand, that the opportunity to own one of these  vehicles to replace the carriages is something that they have to make a  decision for.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>WENIG:  And we're just trying our best to make something that is powerful  enough so that will entice people to get on these rides, to further the  interests of the city, to be nostalgic and to carry on this tradition going  forward.  It is, you know, there is a lot of people who come through  Central Park.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  They want to do this.</p><p>WENIG:  People want to do this.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, and I mean I don't know if they will be as receptive to  things that don't have horses.  I've shocked by how the celebrities have  really come out, on, you know, Liam Neeson so upset that the horses are  going away.  Alec Baldwin is so upset that the horses are still there.  I  mean it seems like celebrities have other things to spend their time on,  maybe not.  Anyway, thank you for coming on.</p><p>WENIG:  Yeah, it's remarkable how much passion is behind this, but we're  doing our best to try to create a solution for everybody.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jason, and we appreciate that.  Thanks for coming on.</p><p>WENIG:  Thank you so much.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Cool innovation.  Coming up, Silicon Valley taking some heat.   David Einhorn talking tough about tech.  We're going to tell you why he  thinks you should get out and do it now.</p><p>And speaking of heat, a Keystone protest that is absolutely on fire.  We've  got cowboys and Indians, protesting.  Oh my.  \"Piles of Money\" coming up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Over to the markets, we are seeing red across the board.  Right  now, Mark Newton is down for New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>MARK NEWTON:  Great to be back.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Mark, what's driving the trade right now?</p><p>NEWTON:  You know, it's interesting, we are seeing a little bit of a stall  out after six straight up days.  Lot of the NASDAQ names.  NASDAQ has been  particularly weak, and really even on this little bounce we've seen, the  NASDAQ is underperformed substantially.  We're still down about four  percent from the highs.  So, it's a lot of these high momentum names  started to turn back down.  You are seeing Netflix weakness, some weakness  incurred Green Mountain coffee roasters.  Also, a couple of the biotechs  are pulling back as well.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>NEWTON:  One thing to notice, though, is that industrials have moved back  to new high territory.  The XLI is set to make a new daily high close today  above 53.15.  So, that's interesting.  And we've continued to see a lot of  strength in the industrials.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes, I've heard a lot of people say today that they're looking at  the tech earnings that are coming out today and this week for direction  going forward.  They want to hear from Apple and Facebook.  It's a very big  deal in terms of how they look at the economy.  Do you agree with that?</p><p>NEWTON:  I do.  I think it's tough to pinpoint a few names.  The group as a  whole is starting to stabilize a little bit, which gives me a little bit  more confidence.  When I look at charts of techs versus the S&amp;P we seem to  be holding and stabilizing.  So that should be good.  Stocks like Apple  have been range bound for four months.  So I think investors really want to  see signs of this stocks getting back up and breaking out for what the  future is protect.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Thank you, Mark.  Appreciate your time.</p><p>NEWTON:  My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So we love our protests on the show.  You know that, this week in  Washington, D.C., multiple events are being held to push for the rejection  of the Keystone pipeline.  We are live with two of those voices at the  National Mall in D.C.  Joining me is Bold Nebraska Director Jane Kleib, and  a member of the Lower Sioux Nation, Dallas Goldtooth.  Dallas, first of  all, I love your name.  What is your message when you are down there?</p><p>DALLAS GOLDTOOTH, LOWER SIOUX DAKOTA NATION MEMBER:  Our message is to  stand in solidarity with as a native people with ranches, cowboys, farmers,  land owners, non-native against the Keystone XL pipeline in its development  in all forms, and also to address its source in the tar sense.  We stand in  solidarity.  All folks who don't want to see the dirty oil go through their  land, through their country and to protect our air, our water, the land,  and to protect our treaty rights as indigenous peoples, I think that's  really the purpose what's going on.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jane, when you have folks are marching through as cowboys and  Indians and pitching teepees, do people take the cause seriously or does it  get you the attention that you wanted?</p><p>JANE KLEIB, BOLD NEBRASKA DIRECTOR:  Yyes, no, we're absolutely getting the  attention that we wanted, and we have Americans who are visiting our  nation's capital coming in asking questions about what we are doing?  And  we explain to them about how this tar sands pipeline is coming through  America and risks property rights.  So our farmers and ranchers don't like  the fact that a foreign oil corporation is going to use eminent domain to  take their land away.  It's been a great learning experience for not only  the tribes and farmers and ranchers, but for Americans who ask those  questions.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Dallas, let me ask you, what is the reception like from people?   Because, you know, according to the latest \"Washington Post\" poll, 65  percent of Americans approve of and want the pipeline, it's only 22 percent  that don't.</p><p>GOLDTOOTH:  It's a question about information and knowledge, once you start  learning about the pipeline and learning what it's going to do to the land.   Learning the effects of the individuals and communities that are directly  impacted, to me it seems a no-brainer how ridiculous it is.  I mean, the  eminent domain question is a huge issue, folks on both sides whether  Democrat or Republican can join together on the idea of land being taken  away for a greater good which is not going to serve them.</p><p>Not going to serve America.  It's going to serve outside interests.   Talk about job creation, a strip mall will create more sustainable jobs  than a pipeline, and I'm not advocating a strip mall, I'm saying that it's  foolish to believe that it's anything, but dangerous and destructive to our  land and our livelihoods.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jane, sustainable energy brings more jobs and brings more  manufacturing.  Cheap energy isn't good for our economy?</p><p>KLEIB:  Well, this isn't -- well, this is not cheap energy, this is  actually dirty energy and it's bad for not only climate change but risks  our water supply.  This pipeline is crossing over 2,000 family wells in the  state of Nebraska.  If the tar sand spill happens in the well, that  family's well is done.  In some areas they have only one choice to get a  well.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They've already changed the route.  Is there any way this  pipeline could go through that could make you happier.  You don't want it  at all under any circumstance?</p><p>KLEIB:  Yes, they altered the route a little bit it.  But still crosses the  sand hill, the State Department confirmed that.  That's yet another reason  in how Trans Canada -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Is there any route that would make you happy?</p><p>KLEIB:  We wanted it around the sand hills and aquifer, many folks did.   Now that we know about tar sands and the destruction it's doing to other  communities in Michigan and Arkansas where spills have happened, we don't  want tar sands at all.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So there is no route that would be OK with you.  I'm trying to  clarify your position.</p><p>KLEIB:  No, ma'am.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, Jane, Dallas, thanks to both of you.  James, what's  your reaction?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They spent six years to find an environmental case  against this.  They couldn't find it.  Oil is going to get burned whether  it's going through Keystone or somewhere else.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What about the well water she is talking about?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Again, this is an exhaustive review.  If there is an  environmental case to be made, the Obama administration has plenty of green  staffers who would be eager to make the case.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They put it off a after the midterms and while the majority of  Americans want it, it feels like it's never going to happen at this point?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is the fear.  The industry is working to get  around it, building a lot of rail terminals, finding other ways to move the  oil, but the tragedy is for the middle class workers talking about.  Terry  O'Sullivan -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  What about her argument though that none of the oil is coming  here?  We're not going to see the benefit of it no matter what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, it is coming here.  That's what rail lines are  doing, moving the oil south, and not just from Canada but from the back in  shale, North Dakota, it is going down to refiners on the gulf coast.  So  this is a completely symbolic issue that oil is going to be burned, it's  only a question of where, and do we get the benefit as Americans?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Coming up, Wall Street starting to feel a little unsettled as  tech moves onto its turf.  How finance could be replaced as New York's main  growth engine.  Don't move.  At the end of the day, it's all about MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief.  New home sales  unexpectedly plunged last month by 14.5 percent to their lowest levels  since July of 2013.  It was also the steepest monthly decline since that  time as well.  Some economists say weather and rising mortgage rates may  have played a role.</p><p>Toyota retaining its top position in global vehicle sales in the  first quarter outselling both GM and Volkswagen.  The Japanese automaker  set itself a new record with nearly 2.6 million cars.  GM came in second  with 2.4 million.</p><p>And consumer goods maker Procter &amp; Gamble reporting a 5 percent  increase in profit.  That is due to a surge in sales for its home care  products with consumers buying more Tide laundry detergent, in my house,  and Duracell batteries also up.  That is from the Fox Business Network,  giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Silicon Valley is starting to take over Wall Street's turf and  experiencing some of the backlash that comes along with the territory.   Techs threatening to replace the banking industry as the growth engine of  New York, but will increased criticism prove a stumbling block for these  internet giants.  Here to discuss, Jo Ling Kent, James Freeman is back.  We  also have Jonathan Hoenig of Capitalistpig.com.  He is a Fox News  contributor.</p><p>Jonathan since you're not here.  I'll give you first crack.   Bringing the jobs, taking over the real estate, but now they are starting  to get the backlash talking about the 1 percent, we're talking about  salaries, it's starting for tech.  What do you think?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, you know technology, Melissa,  isn't taking over finance.  Technology really is finance.  Gone are the  days when you have the individual specialists organizations or floor  traders at major exchanges, technology is driving finance.  It's not  surprising to see more and more tech companies relocating, jobs office  space to Manhattan, the financial capital of the world.  Those who decry it  are shooting themselves in the foot.  That's what you want companies to  create jobs fit well for New Yorkers and for the whole country.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That is so classic.  So Google is coming to New York.  They are  looking to gobble up 600,000 square feet of Manhattan, 80 percent expansion  for the company instead of people focusing on the 3,000 employees that are  going to be hired, immediately there is talk how they're going to drive up  Brent New York.  The exact same way they've driven up rent in California.   What do you think of the backlash?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  They are crazy.  This is good.   The people can now get jobs at Google.  Finance is going down, if you look  at the housing bubble, the financial bubble, the U.S. probably did have too  many people and too much money in the financial industry.  This is probably  a natural move back.</p><p>FRANCIS:  At the same time, Jo, fair is fair, if you look at the salaries  that have been given away in tech land.  They don't get the same criticism  until now.  Jeff Ubben made the comparison between Silicon Valley and Wall  Street yesterday saying Jamie Dimon gets hauled over the coals in New York.   For his 20 million bucks, but Eric Schmidt presides over four board  meetings and gets paid $100 million,\" you don't hear boo.</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS:  That's true.  There isn't necessarily -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  That is an outrage.</p><p>KENT:  We haven't seen a tech CEO really have a bad fall or have a major  crisis in the same way that Wall Street has been perceived.  And I think  that is still possible to happen.  Their reputation still very much on the  line.  So I think if you look especially, I just finished reading a book  called young money and it's all about young bankers.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Good book?</p><p>KENT:  It is good.  You should read it.  It's about reputation and tech has  an opportunity, if this is a bubble, to acquire -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Difference in tech land, they're not paying with our money as  taxpayers.  They are backed by us and they are backed by us -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Jonathan, they create cool products that we like and with banks  we don't appreciate the fact if it weren't for them, we wouldn't have  credit cards?</p><p>HOENIG:  Exactly right, Melissa, total misunderstanding what financiers  create for the economy.  We respect technology stars because we can hold an  iPhone, use a computer and say I understand this company made this product.   But to your point people are ignorant as to the value that hedge funds,  investment banks, bracket banks, the whole financial class brings.  They  don't only create the credit cards, they create the jobs and the  capitalists that move the economy forward.</p><p>KENT:  It's very difficult to define what the value is of Facebook or your  iPhone.  It's very easy to inflate that, thus the huge numbers.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We got to move on.  Tech giants battling detractors on all fronts  the past few days, Green Light Capital CEO David Einhorn sounding alarm on  dangerous bubble and shorting high-flying tech stocks.  He writes there is  a clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15  years.  What is uncertainty is how much further the bubble can expand and  what might pop.  The Nasdaq is down 5.1 percent since March 5th when it hit  highest point 14 years ago.  Guys, what do you think?  This letter is news  that broke on the show yesterday.  You had a chance to drill down more on  it.  What is he saying?</p><p>KENT:  He basically says the valuations of these companies is no longer  traditional.  They are no longer looking at actual numbers and based on a  lot of -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  So it sounds like a lost bubble.</p><p>KENT:  But if you look at high-flying stocks.  They've come down.  The best  performers in 2013, we are talking about Trip Advisor, Netflix, Tesla, all  of these great stocks and look at them now, they've come down.  Somewhere  in a bear market already.  Some analysts I'm talking to who don't agree  with Einhorn are seeing a pullback.  This is not necessarily a bubble.</p><p>FRANCIS:  James, what do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm not sure we should be picking on tech.  If you want to survey  the landscape for bubbles, given what the Federal Reserve has done, pumping  money into the economy, a lot of asset classes.  Junk bonds.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jonathan, what do you think?</p><p>HOENIG:  I don't see.  I don't see bubble, Melissa.  In 2000, the p/e on  the S&amp;P 500 was 40.  It's nowhere near that today.  Certain stocks are  expensive, but the market itself is not in a bubble.  Transports are at an  all-time high.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, thanks to all of you.  Good discussion.  Heading into the  last hour of trading, we have our very own Liz Claman joining us.  Liz,  what do you have coming up on your big show today?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Well, I can't believe that panel of guests.  You  guys have the best people.  All of you guys are my buddies.  So great to  see everybody.  We have a lot coming up, but remember there is a major  widely held company that came out with numbers today, and the numbers were  so good they have probably irked an activist investor trying to make Dow  chemical break up.</p><p>Andrew Liveris is the CEO and chairman and president, the stock  moving higher on news that it beat on the bottom line.  And we've got the  CEO and chairman to talk about why he just feels that this company is being  run in the exact correct way.  They are shedding assets, which is something  that Daniel Lobe of third point, the activist investor has agitated them to  do, but he's got a very big man on his side, Warren Buffett.  We have him  live.  Plus we are watching the market.  Very tentative at the moment.  See  you then.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow, huge guest list, look forward to that.  Great job.</p><p>All right, coming up, millions of Americans know all about the  horrors of foreclosure.  Our next guest refused to let it get the better of  her.  You have to listen about how she fought it every inch of the way and  got herself a movie deal in the process.  All to keep her home.  You can  never have too much money or too much gumption.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Investors banking on the stock shares of Bank of New York Mellon  shooting up at this hour.  Nicole Petallides is standing by at the New York  Stock Exchange.  What are the reports that are driving this higher?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS:  Well, you are seeing right now that's a  two-day chart.  You see instant pop here over the last hour or so.  Bank of  New York Mellon now up 2.7 percent.  There are reports that they are  considering a sale of the corporate trust unit.  Now if they were to do  this possible sale, people speculate that this could account for about $2.5  billion.</p><p>One person has been reporting that Goldman Sachs may be helping them  with this, Fox Business spoke with Bank of New York Mellon.  The spokesman  told Fox Business that they are declining to comment on speculation.</p><p>In the meantime, this could be good news for shareholders as money  could be returned to the shareholders, but you see the stock getting a big  pop on the idea of this report that they could sell off the corporate trust  unit.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.  It's time for spare  change, this story takes the cake.  Faced with losing her house, Angela  Logan baked her way out of foreclosure using grandmother's apple cake  recipe.  She has a thriving bakery and a teaming movie about her  experience.</p><p>Angela Logan joins me now.  We wanted to do your story because it is  such a celebration of the American spirit.  You found yourself in this  situation more than 2 million Americans found themselves in.  Losing your  house.  Instead of giving up, you said what could I do to change the  situation?  How did you get to this?</p><p>ANGELA LOGAN, MORTGAGE APPLE CAKES:  Well, I decided that I wanted to bake  100 cakes in 10 days to help myself save my home and asked my friends and  neighbors buy to save my home.   I had to go to the bottom to reach out for  something else.  There was nowhere else to go, I had to reach for whatever  I had and my cake is what I had.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So did you know you were able to sell all them?  You are looking  at a situation where you can't make your mortgage payment so you have to  invest in ingredients.  It was a risk? </p><p>LOGAN:  I need three months of mortgage payments, $2500 each and I knew I  had ten days to get it.  I put a circle in the middle much the piece of  paper and said how many people do I have to buy the cakes?  I reached out  to friends that worked for organizations I volunteer and asked those people  first to help me save my home by buying a cake.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What was the difference between going to someone and asking them  to buy your cake versus saying can you lend me money or give me money?</p><p>LOGAN:  That's select charity, I guess, I think that a lot of people were  having a difficult time.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>LOGAN:  I did not feel like I wanted to ask somebody for something.  I  wanted to work for it in a way, and I had no job.  So buying a cake which  was of extraordinary quality, cream cheese frosting.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Because 40 is a lot for a cake.  The media picked up on the  story.  At one point you had too much demand, you couldn't bake fast  enough.  What's the end to the story?  Do you have the house?</p><p>LOGAN:  I do.  It was a miracle the company shipped the cakes for me.  Now  we have the same situation, the movie comes out, a lot of demand.  We're  all set for national shipping.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's great.  Your web site, how can people buy a cake if they  want to?</p><p>LOGAN:  At <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.maccakes.com\">www.maccakes.com</url> and see the movie tonight on Up TV at uptv.com.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, terrific.  Good for you, Angela.  Thanks so much and  congratulations.  Bosses beware, ever get the feeling some of your team are  talking behind you?  Turns out millions of workers wouldn't trust employers  if their lives depended on it.  It is costing businesses in a lot of ways.   You can never have too much money.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  A new study from the American Psychological Association says only  half of workers think their employers are honest with them.  Not only does  this make for lousy morale and hurting productivity.  James Freeman and Jo  Ling Kent are back with me as well.  Twenty four percent don't trust their  company, 32 percent say their employer is not honest with them.  What do  you think is the age we live in, our employers are spying on us, get used  to it.</p><p>KENT:  Well, if you're going to have technology in the office.  If you're  going to operate on a work computer, it should be assumed in good faith  pretty much your information is publicly for the company.  That comes with  the territory.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They also -- 62 percent say they are treated fairly.  So by  definition almost 40 percent do not think they are treated fairly.  Less  than half are happy with their professional growth.  Just an unhappiness at  work is what I am hearing.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't see it that way.  I mean, it's a job after and the fact  that over 60 percent, I guess I'm looking at the glass as 60 percent full.   I have to tell you, expectations were set very low because I worked living  off your tax dollars for the federal government for several years so this  has kind of been a dream of transparency, openness and honesty.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I think there is 100 percent happiness within this building.  It  speaks to a little bit how the stock market has gone up, corporate profits  have increased, wages have lagged, people feel like in general maybe they  are not getting their piece of the pie, real quick.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think the numbers are that bad.  It is a workplace, some  people will be dissatisfied.  Most of them aren't.</p><p>KENT:  Over the things or small things.  Maybe the water cooler or their  benefits or e-mails accessed.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I think they want more money.  We always want more money.  Maybe  they are just unhappy people.  Thanks to both of you.  That is all we have  for now.  I hope you are making money and you're happy at work today.   \"COUNTDOWN\" with Liz Claman starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC.

In fact the secret is out. <person><nameText>Bill Ackman </nameText></person>refusing to back down from his billion dollar bet against Herbalife. He's even paying insiders millions to dish some dirt. Two tech giants in two big reports. The burning questions Facebook and Apple finally need to answer as they announce their latest results. And some new voices in the fight against Keystone. We're live from the capital as so-called cowboy and Indian activists march on D.C. Because even when they say it's not it is always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the heels of the bid to buy Allergan, activist investor <person><nameText>Bill Ackman </nameText></person>is heeding the headlines again. A new report. So the hedge fund titan is agreeing to spend up to $3.6 million to an Herbalife whistleblower. Here to discuss all that, Charlie Gasparino, James Freeman of \"Wall Street Journal\" and Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management. We couldn't stop talking about it even before the show started. He is skating very close to the line here on a number of different bets. Let's talk about Herbalife first. I mean what do you think about paying this whistle-blower?</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: You know, he has a rationale for it, which I saw in the ABC News piece, Brian Ross and another gentleman from ABC News wrote the story. It is online. The rationale that it's, you know, perfectly OK to pay for whistleblower's legal costs and whatever.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean it was - they are going to pay him $250,000 a year for lost work due to whistleblowing, even though he is working, I guess, in a laundromat. So far he's made $80,000. He denied that in the past. But he said, technically he hadn't received the funds yet, so he wasn't lying.</p><p>GASPARINO: I want to say this. As someone who has covered these sort of stories, whistleblowers and hedge funds and, you know activist investors, I've never seen people pay off people like this before. This - unless I'm missing something.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: And why do they have to? I mean .</p><p>GASPARINO: I agree.</p><p>FREEMAN: If this is such an obvious pyramid scheme, why does Ackman have to spend all the money on lawyering and lobbying and PR to convince people? Federal regulators have information on this company for a long time now. Why this constant campaign?</p><p>GASPARINO: And it's not like ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Really is a pyramid.</p><p>GASPARINO: And it's not like.</p><p>FREEMAN: That's what I'm saying - it's not, but it's out there.</p><p>GASPARINO: But it's not - and it's not like Bernie Madoff, well, as you see. People keep saying this might be like Bernie Madoff when people looked at him. Bernie Madoff was barely in the news when this stuff was going on.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: There were a few investigations. This guy is in the news every day.</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: And this one investors are looking at all the time. Because, you know, they say it is not a level playing field. They say that is rigged. You know, these types of stories, you know, shine a spotlight. Wait a second, average investor is not doing these types of things. And look, they call it a gray area, but I think it kind of pushes .</p><p>GASPARINO: What you're talking about is how he invested in Allergan, which we were first to report yesterday.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: You look at CNBC today. That is all they're talking about.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not familiar with that channel.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right. Not either.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GASPARINO: But I know - I can't help it. It is in the newsroom. And - but what is interesting is the notion that <person><nameText>Bill Ackman </nameText></person>can go, be told by a partner..</p><p>FRANCIS: You are talking about Allergan?</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah, the Allergan. By Valiant that he was going to make a bid for Allergan. Join me in this bid. Go in undercover, buy options, so it's not seen by anybody. The market doesn't notice. And low and behold, guess what happens? They put the bid in, the market goes up and you make a lot of money. Now, does this violate insider trading laws? No. But if you want to know what gets people mad, more than high frequency trading, this looks pretty - this is a perfect example of why the playing field is unlevel ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: By the way - completely illegal.</p><p>MAHONEY: How he got the information? You know, it was (INAUDIBLE) flying over his head and drop the note on him and told him this is going on?</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>MAHONEY: You know, individual investors don't get their uncle and tell them this is going on. So .</p><p>FRANCIS: And it's interesting - it's interesting that Ackman wears the cap of I'm the activist investor. So, out there for the little guy. You know, I represent the voice of a little guy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAHONEY: There are current investors in those funds.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's what activist investors have been saying. But that is not really what it is about. He is the super investor who has the inside track on all the information. And he is part of the problem that we've seen such an unleveled playing field. Some would say, do you agree with that? Do you guys agree with that?</p><p>FREEMAN: Two very different situations. On the Herbalife thing I think Ackman's paying a lot of money to gin up federal investigations - and it smells pretty bad. With this situation, when, you know, Valiant and Allergan, I see nothing wrong here. I mean I think it - federal judges, if you look at - as they're deliberating now in Manhattan about what is the limit of insider trading .</p><p>GASPARINO: I would say this.</p><p>FREEMAN: Their questions are suggesting this is not insider trading.</p><p>GASPARINO: I would say - I would say this. I'm against the insider trading laws. I think we should throw them just - right off the bat.</p><p>FREEMAN: All right.</p><p>GASPARINO: That said, if you are going to have them, this is just how rich people can keep getting rich. There is no way the average guy in the street is ever going to get a tip from Valiant, oh, go buy some stock and join me and buying three options and you let's - and you can make a lot of money.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is not going to happen.</p><p>MAHONEY: Look, it is not illegal, the way we look at it. But it is not morally or ethically the way to do business. And that's kind of what's coming back, and that's why - I was looking out there.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's about - yeah, and it's about the rich getting richer, which is why people are shying away from the stock market. And it's a shame because stock prices are up 175 percent from the bottom. And it is an opportunity for the average person to make money, but they are scared .</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, the average person - better prices.</p><p>FRANCIS: Hang on. More to discuss after this. Don't move. Don't move.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Moving on now to Amazon. The online retail giant has a new licensing agreement with HBO. Prime members can now get subscription access to content like \"The Sopranos\" and \"Girls.\" Shareholders, however, not loving this so far. You don't like - Let's go to James Romelli down at the CME. James, what do you think about this? How is it trading?</p><p>JAMES ROMELLI: Right. You know, this is a groundbreaking deal in terms of HBO is not going to be offered on Amazon's prime subscription service. And this is first time it is being offered on any streaming subscription based service. However, it's not a very big deal for Amazon. And if we look at the stock price today, it is down around $5. So, it is clear that investors really are not excited over this deal. I think if we take a look at this it's really more of a negative for companies like Netflix than it is a positive for a company like Amazon.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>ROMELLI: It does show that they are going to be willing to go out there and acquire premium content. They have much deeper pockets than Netflix. They're a much larger company. And Netflix does not want them in this space. It shows they're serious about growing that part of their business and they are going to be aggressive about it.</p><p>FRANCIS: James, real quick, before you go - what's the feel in the market today? I'm looking at a Dow, that's down 14 points.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right. So, we are looking at a market that's down run 14 points. Most of the moves are higher this week. We're on very thin volume. We're still trading pretty thinly holiday week. I say earnings have been pretty good. I think the markets going ahead higher into the end of the week. And I think next week, once the traders are back from holiday we really see a sustained move higher on volume.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, James, thanks so much. Soon, a new report shows that America no longer has the world's wealthiest middle class. That honor now goes to Canada. We can thank the small growth in the U.S. middle incomes compared to other nations. There are still some good news for the red, white and blue, with recent gains to high-end households the U.S. continues to rein as the world's richest large country. Let's bring the panel back. The divide just grows wider.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah, and I would say, one reason why it is, is kind of what we were going to get into before.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO: You know - you know, (INAUDIBLE) and all these regulators scaring people out of the stock market, saying, oh, it is rig, high frequency trading, insider trading. Do you realize all you had to do is buy an S&amp;P 500 index, put $1,000 in and that, in 2009 when they started easing, when they started printing money? But you make a lot of money. I mean markets are not rigged if you play it safe and not try to compete with these big guys on insider (INAUDIBLE). I think, you know, they should just legalize insider information. Legalize high frequency trading. And guess what? Small investors should buy index funds.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you guys agree with that idea?</p><p>MAHONEY: It's - insider trading? No, I think you need to have insider trading rules. And again, it's hard to define what those rules are going to be.</p><p>GASPARINO: That's why we shouldn't have them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MAHONEY: Yeah, I mean, look. This is the market for small investors also. Look, this is the market is like the energizer bunny, right? It keeps going and going and going. Interest rates are low. Earnings have been pretty good the last couple of years. So, if you kind of stay the course .</p><p>FRANCIS: But that's what that stat tells you. I mean that middle income folks are falling further and further behind. That the policies we've seen over the past five years have done nothing but enrich the one percent.</p><p>GASPARINO: Well, that's another story.</p><p>MAHONEY: That's another story.</p><p>FREEMAN: We want to get more of those middle income people to become capitalists. To raise their incomes to the point where they can own stocks, where they can benefit. Now, how do you do that? You notice Canada on that list has been very friendly, much more than the United States to energy production in its west.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: We have an energy boom pretty much despite Washington.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: Welders making over $200,000 a year in some cases in Ohio. And we ought to be encouraging that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Real quick, before we go, Ken, do you agree with the idea that the policies of the past five years have done nothing but made the divide bigger?</p><p>MAHONEY: I think so. The unintended consequences of Obamacare, we are seeing how wage stagnation, you know, hiring of employees.</p><p>FRANCIS: And the Fed juicing the stock market as the number one .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: Melissa, think of it this way, if you have manufacture jobs going overseas, blue-collar jobs overseas, why not do Keystone pipeline? Why not do fracking? Those are blue color ..</p><p>FRANCIS: We have some folks that are going to come up with.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, tech heavyweights take center stage. The market holding its breath for Facebook an Apple earnings. We have got the answer to all of your burning questions coming up.</p><p>And we haven't seen this much cooperation since the first Thanksgiving. Cowboys and Indians teaming up to stop the Keystone pipeline. We are live at the protests. Teepees tents and bonfires included.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it is on Wall Street or Main Street here is who is making and losing money today. Anyone with a piece of Netflix. The stock sinking today following news of Amazon's content deal with HBO. Shares are down more than five percent right now. That is bad news for CEO Reed Hastings. He has nearly 2 1/2 million shares. So he is less $48 million today. That hurts. And speaking of the Amazon, someone over there is losing even more money. CEO Jeff Bezos. His net worth has taken a real dive this year, already losing more than 6 billion bucks. Out of all the people on the planet Earth, Bezos is second only to Carlos Slim who's lost around $6.5 billion so far in 2014. What a rough year. You know, I'm sure they're both crying in their Benjamins. But you know who is about to save a whole lot of money on cheap and vast fashion? All of us here in the U.S. Highmart (ph), which is one of Europe's most successful clothing chains is landing on our shores. It's going to challenge other retailers with these rock-bottom prices. It has even been known to offer a pair of jeans for less than ten bucks. I bet they don't shrink. The first store will open in Boston within a year.</p><p>All right, anticipation is rising for Apple and Facebook earnings after the bell today. Stocks are slipping. So can this report ease investor fears and answer the burning questions? Adam Lashinsky, is \"Fortune\" magazine senior editor at large and the Fox News contributor, Ari Zoldan is Quantum Network CEO and Lance Ulanoff, is Mashable editor-at-large. Adam, I don't think I have ever seen you in person. You have legs.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ADAM LASHINSKY, FORTUNE MAGAZINE SENIOR EDITOR-AT-LARGE: I hope so.</p><p>FRANCIS: I've always seen you on the remote. Yes. I will start with you since you're in town. For Apple you want to know when and not what. When will they release their next major category? What category do you think it is?</p><p>LASHINSKY: Well .</p><p>FRANCIS: You just don't care? You just want to know when it's going to happen.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Right. It's - to me as an investor, as somebody watching company, it doesn't matter what it is. It could be a television. It could be the whole living room. It could be, you know, it can't be a watch. That's not enough. The point is they need something of the magnitude of the IPod, the iPhone and the iPad for this company to take the next leap forward. Anything else is gravy.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you want them to say when.</p><p>LASHINSKY: I want them to.</p><p>FRANCIS: Because I mean this is the question.</p><p>LASHINSKY: By the way they won't today.</p><p>FRANCIS: They are not going to do it. They are not going to do it. They don't care what you want. All right.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Oh, no that's for sure.</p><p>FRANCIS: On Apple, you want to know what other markets are on their radar besides China. Why?</p><p>ARI ZOLDAN, QUANTUM NETWORKS &amp; CEO: Right. China was - I mean they have done a great job in China. I would imagine right now if I were to take a guess it's probably going to be Latin America.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Just, you know, looking at the demographic and the numbers and the size of it - I mean it's an extraordinary market for Apple to break into.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you agree with that, Lance? You're shaking your head.</p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, MASHABLE EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Oh, yeah. I mean it's sort of like we forget about these other parts of the world, like Brazil, this vibrant social media community, these products there, and services that we don't even know about in the U.S. So, of course you want to go in their place. And that means they are connected and they want to hear.</p><p>LASHINSKY: And by the way, Apple has said quite a bit about that. Their growth outside of the United States and Europe is much faster than it is .</p><p>ZOLDAN: And there is lot of brand loyalty - there's a lot of brand loyal to also within the Latin American market.</p><p>FRANCIS: Lance, for Apple, you want to know, I mean they're hesitating on the wearables front. What is behind that? Should they get into that? What is your question with that?</p><p>ULANOFF: You know, Apple is smart about products. They are going carefully. They are going when they're ready and I think they are looking around now and I don't know if they're getting cold feet. Obviously, Nike just laid off a bunch of people work in their wearable division. I'm looking at everybody's wrist here and I don't see any wearable devices.</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>ULANOFF: And, by the way, that is not unusual. And I think Apple is, you know, they sometimes like to lead, but they are really - they are not quite getting it, right, all the people they've hired, all the designers, all the help - I think they're still working on it. I'm waiting for a signal today that tells us what might happen over the next few months.</p><p>FRANCIS: They could be the one to revolutionize that space if they get into it. Because there has been so many of those little fit wristlets and you see people wear them. Just love them .</p><p>ZOLDAN: But they're not leaders anymore. But Melissa - but they're not leaders anymore. You know.</p><p>FRANCIS: Apple is?</p><p>ZOLDAN: Yeah, Apple is .</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>ZOLDAN: Apple is not leaders anymore.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Let me just correct you on that.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Not anymore.</p><p>LASHINSKY: The interesting thing on this - they never have been. They didn't have the first music player. They didn't have the first smartphone. And they didn't have the .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ULANOFF: But they did have one's market share. But they did have market share and they did have a brand followings. Right? Isn't that really what we want to talk about? It's not that they are leaders. They're innovators.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ZOLDAN: Makes total sense they have not (INAUDIBLE) the wearables yet.</p><p>ULANOFF: Exactly. They will wait for everybody to fall over on themselves.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let's move on to Facebook. Adam, you want to know when Sheryl Sandberg is leaving.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean we've see all the signals. It seems like with the whole lean in launch - it feels like a political campaign.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: It does. She sold a lot of stock.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: It feels like she has kind of done that and is on her way out.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Sure. So, Sheryl Sandberg is a natural politician.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>LASHINSKY: If you listen to her five minutes you know that. So, you see this public profile. Yes, it feels like her work is done there and someone else could do her job. And furthermore, that she has other things that she would like to do. So yes, I think it is important eventually that Facebook say, what is the schedule for Sheryl?</p><p>FRANCIS: You're shaking your head. You agree with that?</p><p>ULANOFF: Yeah, yeah, I think so. I mean I read her whole book. I think, you know, she has got a lot on her mind. She wants to lead women in particular and but I don't think she will jump right into political office. I think she'll work for some - maybe she'll work for an administration first.</p><p>FRANCIS: You think? I don't know. I mean there's been talk about her running for Barbara Boxer's seat, running in California. She has such a strong base there. You don't think ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ZOLDAN: I think she will. She's on the whole Facebook.</p><p>FRANCIS: She's - yeah.</p><p>ZOLDAN: She's been there done that. That's for her I think is a natural.</p><p>ULANOFF: You'll have to answer that full disparity question in Silicon Valley.</p><p>FRANCIS: And one last question, Lance. You want to know on Facebook, how important is that that consumers realize that WhatsApp are Facebook products. WhatsApp and Instagram. Why is that important? Why is that the answer you need?</p><p>ULANOFF: Well, I just think that what surprised a little bit is how Facebook has not sort of sucked them all the way in and rebranded them.</p><p>FRANCIS: Maybe because it's - Facebook is not cool anymore and WhatsApp is?</p><p>ULANOFF: Well, I think there is part of that. But it's also being smart. The way they look at the business going forward, is a number of satellite businesses. They want to be a conglomerate. They want to be more like a unilever. And so, Facebook becomes the hub and all these other products live outside of each other.</p><p>FRANCIS: You guys are so smart. We are going to leave it there. Thanks to all three of you.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, the very local issue that has international celebs crying out loud. Horses have long been a mainstay in New York Central Park. We're going to show you this very green innovation that could be coming to your town too.</p><p>Plus, big tech names are taking over New York. Some on Wall Street are starting, to get very nervous. Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Wireless carrier AT&amp;T narrowly beating first-quarter earnings, really dropping today. Let's go to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It's a name that we've been watching so closely today, Melissa. It is been the big loser on the Dow Jones industrial average. Right now it is down 3.6 percent for AT&amp;T at 34.99. It has been ticking down some of the names in the telecom sector, including Verizon, CenturyLink, Windstream as well as Frontier communication. You've had several of the analysts putting their comments out. And JPMorgan, for example, cut their price target to $34 from 35. They have a neutral rating. So, they did come out with their numbers. They've raised their full-year revenue growth forecast. AT&amp;T, to at least four percent from three percent. But the big picture here, is that the overall numbers from AT&amp;T were disappointing to Wall Street. And as a result we're seeing that name to the downside. Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nicole, thanks so much. So, one of New York City's most popular attractions may be heading back to the stables. The idea of retiring Central Park's horse-drawn carriages, has drawn both the ire and the praise of many of celebrities since Mayor Bill de Blasio voiced that idea. It includes Liam Neeson, Alec Baldwin, singer Pink and former mayor Michael Bloomberg, all on different sides. No one company - now one company is trotting along with a very unique innovation, an all-electric vintage automobile. It is classy and green enough to replace the beloved horses they believe.</p><p>Joining us now is Creative Workshop owner Jason Wenig. So walk me through this. Mayor Bill de Blasio reached out to you about this?</p><p>JASON WENIG, CREATIVE WORKSHOP OWNER: No. Several years ago, Niclass (ph). It is the group that's on the forefront of this change approached me asking me what I would do about the idea of replacing the carriages. And that is how the whole thing started.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, what are the carriages like? Walk me through it.</p><p>WENIG: Well, the carriages represent a time pretty much turn of the century, 1900, 1910, when the idea of the automobile ignited the world's fascination with this idea. So, it's an homage to that period of time, to that type of car. And the idea would be the hope to ignite the same type of passions that brought us to this day and age to have love affair with the car.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm reading, though, the price tag is between $150,000 and $175,000?</p><p>WENIG: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't think as a taxpayer in the city, I can afford that.</p><p>WENIG: Well, these are privately owned and operated. So, we are working really hard to get the price to a really good point. I don't consider this to be a moneymaker for the first cars we are building for the city. But you know.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, privately owned and operated you are going to try and get the taxi company to own that and put it out there? Or who is the owner?</p><p>WENIG: Well, the owner would be any company that would want to run this - business. The individual carriage operators or a consortium that would come together to buy these units.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, as you work though the numbers, how much would they have to charge per ride in order to make their money back?</p><p>WENIG: Well, I believe that the manner, in which they charge clients now would be the same way that they charge clients for these rides. These rides would be able to go through the city where the carriages wouldn't be. So, you have to understand, that the opportunity to own one of these vehicles to replace the carriages is something that they have to make a decision for.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>WENIG: And we're just trying our best to make something that is powerful enough so that will entice people to get on these rides, to further the interests of the city, to be nostalgic and to carry on this tradition going forward. It is, you know, there is a lot of people who come through Central Park.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. They want to do this.</p><p>WENIG: People want to do this.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, and I mean I don't know if they will be as receptive to things that don't have horses. I've shocked by how the celebrities have really come out, on, you know, Liam Neeson so upset that the horses are going away. Alec Baldwin is so upset that the horses are still there. I mean it seems like celebrities have other things to spend their time on, maybe not. Anyway, thank you for coming on.</p><p>WENIG: Yeah, it's remarkable how much passion is behind this, but we're doing our best to try to create a solution for everybody.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jason, and we appreciate that. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>WENIG: Thank you so much.</p><p>FRANCIS: Cool innovation. Coming up, Silicon Valley taking some heat. David Einhorn talking tough about tech. We're going to tell you why he thinks you should get out and do it now.</p><p>And speaking of heat, a Keystone protest that is absolutely on fire. We've got cowboys and Indians, protesting. Oh my. \"Piles of Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Over to the markets, we are seeing red across the board. Right now, Mark Newton is down for New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>MARK NEWTON: Great to be back.</p><p>FRANCIS: Mark, what's driving the trade right now?</p><p>NEWTON: You know, it's interesting, we are seeing a little bit of a stall out after six straight up days. Lot of the NASDAQ names. NASDAQ has been particularly weak, and really even on this little bounce we've seen, the NASDAQ is underperformed substantially. We're still down about four percent from the highs. So, it's a lot of these high momentum names started to turn back down. You are seeing Netflix weakness, some weakness incurred Green Mountain coffee roasters. Also, a couple of the biotechs are pulling back as well.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>NEWTON: One thing to notice, though, is that industrials have moved back to new high territory. The XLI is set to make a new daily high close today above 53.15. So, that's interesting. And we've continued to see a lot of strength in the industrials.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, I've heard a lot of people say today that they're looking at the tech earnings that are coming out today and this week for direction going forward. They want to hear from Apple and Facebook. It's a very big deal in terms of how they look at the economy. Do you agree with that?</p><p>NEWTON: I do. I think it's tough to pinpoint a few names. The group as a whole is starting to stabilize a little bit, which gives me a little bit more confidence. When I look at charts of techs versus the S&amp;P we seem to be holding and stabilizing. So that should be good. Stocks like Apple have been range bound for four months. So I think investors really want to see signs of this stocks getting back up and breaking out for what the future is protect.</p><p>FRANCIS: Thank you, Mark. Appreciate your time.</p><p>NEWTON: My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: So we love our protests on the show. You know that, this week in Washington, D.C., multiple events are being held to push for the rejection of the Keystone pipeline. We are live with two of those voices at the National Mall in D.C. Joining me is Bold Nebraska Director Jane Kleib, and a member of the Lower Sioux Nation, Dallas Goldtooth. Dallas, first of all, I love your name. What is your message when you are down there?</p><p>DALLAS GOLDTOOTH, LOWER SIOUX DAKOTA NATION MEMBER: Our message is to stand in solidarity with as a native people with ranches, cowboys, farmers, land owners, non-native against the Keystone XL pipeline in its development in all forms, and also to address its source in the tar sense. We stand in solidarity. All folks who don't want to see the dirty oil go through their land, through their country and to protect our air, our water, the land, and to protect our treaty rights as indigenous peoples, I think that's really the purpose what's going on.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jane, when you have folks are marching through as cowboys and Indians and pitching teepees, do people take the cause seriously or does it get you the attention that you wanted?</p><p>JANE KLEIB, BOLD NEBRASKA DIRECTOR: Yyes, no, we're absolutely getting the attention that we wanted, and we have Americans who are visiting our nation's capital coming in asking questions about what we are doing? And we explain to them about how this tar sands pipeline is coming through America and risks property rights. So our farmers and ranchers don't like the fact that a foreign oil corporation is going to use eminent domain to take their land away. It's been a great learning experience for not only the tribes and farmers and ranchers, but for Americans who ask those questions.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dallas, let me ask you, what is the reception like from people? Because, you know, according to the latest \"Washington Post\" poll, 65 percent of Americans approve of and want the pipeline, it's only 22 percent that don't.</p><p>GOLDTOOTH: It's a question about information and knowledge, once you start learning about the pipeline and learning what it's going to do to the land. Learning the effects of the individuals and communities that are directly impacted, to me it seems a no-brainer how ridiculous it is. I mean, the eminent domain question is a huge issue, folks on both sides whether Democrat or Republican can join together on the idea of land being taken away for a greater good which is not going to serve them.</p><p>Not going to serve America. It's going to serve outside interests. Talk about job creation, a strip mall will create more sustainable jobs than a pipeline, and I'm not advocating a strip mall, I'm saying that it's foolish to believe that it's anything, but dangerous and destructive to our land and our livelihoods.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jane, sustainable energy brings more jobs and brings more manufacturing. Cheap energy isn't good for our economy?</p><p>KLEIB: Well, this isn't -- well, this is not cheap energy, this is actually dirty energy and it's bad for not only climate change but risks our water supply. This pipeline is crossing over 2,000 family wells in the state of Nebraska. If the tar sand spill happens in the well, that family's well is done. In some areas they have only one choice to get a well.</p><p>FRANCIS: They've already changed the route. Is there any way this pipeline could go through that could make you happier. You don't want it at all under any circumstance?</p><p>KLEIB: Yes, they altered the route a little bit it. But still crosses the sand hill, the State Department confirmed that. That's yet another reason in how Trans Canada --</p><p>FRANCIS: Is there any route that would make you happy?</p><p>KLEIB: We wanted it around the sand hills and aquifer, many folks did. Now that we know about tar sands and the destruction it's doing to other communities in Michigan and Arkansas where spills have happened, we don't want tar sands at all.</p><p>FRANCIS: So there is no route that would be OK with you. I'm trying to clarify your position.</p><p>KLEIB: No, ma'am.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, Jane, Dallas, thanks to both of you. James, what's your reaction?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They spent six years to find an environmental case against this. They couldn't find it. Oil is going to get burned whether it's going through Keystone or somewhere else.</p><p>FRANCIS: What about the well water she is talking about?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Again, this is an exhaustive review. If there is an environmental case to be made, the Obama administration has plenty of green staffers who would be eager to make the case.</p><p>FRANCIS: They put it off a after the midterms and while the majority of Americans want it, it feels like it's never going to happen at this point?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the fear. The industry is working to get around it, building a lot of rail terminals, finding other ways to move the oil, but the tragedy is for the middle class workers talking about. Terry O'Sullivan --</p><p>FRANCIS: What about her argument though that none of the oil is coming here? We're not going to see the benefit of it no matter what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, it is coming here. That's what rail lines are doing, moving the oil south, and not just from Canada but from the back in shale, North Dakota, it is going down to refiners on the gulf coast. So this is a completely symbolic issue that oil is going to be burned, it's only a question of where, and do we get the benefit as Americans?</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, Wall Street starting to feel a little unsettled as tech moves onto its turf. How finance could be replaced as New York's main growth engine. Don't move. At the end of the day, it's all about MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief. New home sales unexpectedly plunged last month by 14.5 percent to their lowest levels since July of 2013. It was also the steepest monthly decline since that time as well. Some economists say weather and rising mortgage rates may have played a role.</p><p>Toyota retaining its top position in global vehicle sales in the first quarter outselling both GM and Volkswagen. The Japanese automaker set itself a new record with nearly 2.6 million cars. GM came in second with 2.4 million.</p><p>And consumer goods maker Procter &amp; Gamble reporting a 5 percent increase in profit. That is due to a surge in sales for its home care products with consumers buying more Tide laundry detergent, in my house, and Duracell batteries also up. That is from the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Silicon Valley is starting to take over Wall Street's turf and experiencing some of the backlash that comes along with the territory. Techs threatening to replace the banking industry as the growth engine of New York, but will increased criticism prove a stumbling block for these internet giants. Here to discuss, Jo Ling Kent, James Freeman is back. We also have Jonathan Hoenig of Capitalistpig.com. He is a Fox News contributor.</p><p>Jonathan since you're not here. I'll give you first crack. Bringing the jobs, taking over the real estate, but now they are starting to get the backlash talking about the 1 percent, we're talking about salaries, it's starting for tech. What do you think?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know technology, Melissa, isn't taking over finance. Technology really is finance. Gone are the days when you have the individual specialists organizations or floor traders at major exchanges, technology is driving finance. It's not surprising to see more and more tech companies relocating, jobs office space to Manhattan, the financial capital of the world. Those who decry it are shooting themselves in the foot. That's what you want companies to create jobs fit well for New Yorkers and for the whole country.</p><p>FRANCIS: That is so classic. So Google is coming to New York. They are looking to gobble up 600,000 square feet of Manhattan, 80 percent expansion for the company instead of people focusing on the 3,000 employees that are going to be hired, immediately there is talk how they're going to drive up Brent New York. The exact same way they've driven up rent in California. What do you think of the backlash?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": They are crazy. This is good. The people can now get jobs at Google. Finance is going down, if you look at the housing bubble, the financial bubble, the U.S. probably did have too many people and too much money in the financial industry. This is probably a natural move back.</p><p>FRANCIS: At the same time, Jo, fair is fair, if you look at the salaries that have been given away in tech land. They don't get the same criticism until now. Jeff Ubben made the comparison between Silicon Valley and Wall Street yesterday saying Jamie Dimon gets hauled over the coals in New York. For his 20 million bucks, but Eric Schmidt presides over four board meetings and gets paid $100 million,\" you don't hear boo.</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS: That's true. There isn't necessarily --</p><p>FRANCIS: That is an outrage.</p><p>KENT: We haven't seen a tech CEO really have a bad fall or have a major crisis in the same way that Wall Street has been perceived. And I think that is still possible to happen. Their reputation still very much on the line. So I think if you look especially, I just finished reading a book called young money and it's all about young bankers.</p><p>FRANCIS: Good book?</p><p>KENT: It is good. You should read it. It's about reputation and tech has an opportunity, if this is a bubble, to acquire --</p><p>FREEMAN: Difference in tech land, they're not paying with our money as taxpayers. They are backed by us and they are backed by us --</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonathan, they create cool products that we like and with banks we don't appreciate the fact if it weren't for them, we wouldn't have credit cards?</p><p>HOENIG: Exactly right, Melissa, total misunderstanding what financiers create for the economy. We respect technology stars because we can hold an iPhone, use a computer and say I understand this company made this product. But to your point people are ignorant as to the value that hedge funds, investment banks, bracket banks, the whole financial class brings. They don't only create the credit cards, they create the jobs and the capitalists that move the economy forward.</p><p>KENT: It's very difficult to define what the value is of Facebook or your iPhone. It's very easy to inflate that, thus the huge numbers.</p><p>FRANCIS: We got to move on. Tech giants battling detractors on all fronts the past few days, Green Light Capital CEO David Einhorn sounding alarm on dangerous bubble and shorting high-flying tech stocks. He writes there is a clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years. What is uncertainty is how much further the bubble can expand and what might pop. The Nasdaq is down 5.1 percent since March 5th when it hit highest point 14 years ago. Guys, what do you think? This letter is news that broke on the show yesterday. You had a chance to drill down more on it. What is he saying?</p><p>KENT: He basically says the valuations of these companies is no longer traditional. They are no longer looking at actual numbers and based on a lot of --</p><p>FRANCIS: So it sounds like a lost bubble.</p><p>KENT: But if you look at high-flying stocks. They've come down. The best performers in 2013, we are talking about Trip Advisor, Netflix, Tesla, all of these great stocks and look at them now, they've come down. Somewhere in a bear market already. Some analysts I'm talking to who don't agree with Einhorn are seeing a pullback. This is not necessarily a bubble.</p><p>FRANCIS: James, what do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN: I'm not sure we should be picking on tech. If you want to survey the landscape for bubbles, given what the Federal Reserve has done, pumping money into the economy, a lot of asset classes. Junk bonds.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonathan, what do you think?</p><p>HOENIG: I don't see. I don't see bubble, Melissa. In 2000, the p/e on the S&amp;P 500 was 40. It's nowhere near that today. Certain stocks are expensive, but the market itself is not in a bubble. Transports are at an all-time high.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, thanks to all of you. Good discussion. Heading into the last hour of trading, we have our very own Liz Claman joining us. Liz, what do you have coming up on your big show today?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Well, I can't believe that panel of guests. You guys have the best people. All of you guys are my buddies. So great to see everybody. We have a lot coming up, but remember there is a major widely held company that came out with numbers today, and the numbers were so good they have probably irked an activist investor trying to make Dow chemical break up.</p><p>Andrew Liveris is the CEO and chairman and president, the stock moving higher on news that it beat on the bottom line. And we've got the CEO and chairman to talk about why he just feels that this company is being run in the exact correct way. They are shedding assets, which is something that Daniel Lobe of third point, the activist investor has agitated them to do, but he's got a very big man on his side, Warren Buffett. We have him live. Plus we are watching the market. Very tentative at the moment. See you then.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow, huge guest list, look forward to that. Great job.</p><p>All right, coming up, millions of Americans know all about the horrors of foreclosure. Our next guest refused to let it get the better of her. You have to listen about how she fought it every inch of the way and got herself a movie deal in the process. All to keep her home. You can never have too much money or too much gumption.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Investors banking on the stock shares of Bank of New York Mellon shooting up at this hour. Nicole Petallides is standing by at the New York Stock Exchange. What are the reports that are driving this higher?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS: Well, you are seeing right now that's a two-day chart. You see instant pop here over the last hour or so. Bank of New York Mellon now up 2.7 percent. There are reports that they are considering a sale of the corporate trust unit. Now if they were to do this possible sale, people speculate that this could account for about $2.5 billion.</p><p>One person has been reporting that Goldman Sachs may be helping them with this, Fox Business spoke with Bank of New York Mellon. The spokesman told Fox Business that they are declining to comment on speculation.</p><p>In the meantime, this could be good news for shareholders as money could be returned to the shareholders, but you see the stock getting a big pop on the idea of this report that they could sell off the corporate trust unit.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nicole Petallides, thank you so much. It's time for spare change, this story takes the cake. Faced with losing her house, Angela Logan baked her way out of foreclosure using grandmother's apple cake recipe. She has a thriving bakery and a teaming movie about her experience.</p><p>Angela Logan joins me now. We wanted to do your story because it is such a celebration of the American spirit. You found yourself in this situation more than 2 million Americans found themselves in. Losing your house. Instead of giving up, you said what could I do to change the situation? How did you get to this?</p><p>ANGELA LOGAN, MORTGAGE APPLE CAKES: Well, I decided that I wanted to bake 100 cakes in 10 days to help myself save my home and asked my friends and neighbors buy to save my home. I had to go to the bottom to reach out for something else. There was nowhere else to go, I had to reach for whatever I had and my cake is what I had.</p><p>FRANCIS: So did you know you were able to sell all them? You are looking at a situation where you can't make your mortgage payment so you have to invest in ingredients. It was a risk?</p><p>LOGAN: I need three months of mortgage payments, $2500 each and I knew I had ten days to get it. I put a circle in the middle much the piece of paper and said how many people do I have to buy the cakes? I reached out to friends that worked for organizations I volunteer and asked those people first to help me save my home by buying a cake.</p><p>FRANCIS: What was the difference between going to someone and asking them to buy your cake versus saying can you lend me money or give me money?</p><p>LOGAN: That's select charity, I guess, I think that a lot of people were having a difficult time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>LOGAN: I did not feel like I wanted to ask somebody for something. I wanted to work for it in a way, and I had no job. So buying a cake which was of extraordinary quality, cream cheese frosting.</p><p>FRANCIS: Because 40 is a lot for a cake. The media picked up on the story. At one point you had too much demand, you couldn't bake fast enough. What's the end to the story? Do you have the house?</p><p>LOGAN: I do. It was a miracle the company shipped the cakes for me. Now we have the same situation, the movie comes out, a lot of demand. We're all set for national shipping.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's great. Your web site, how can people buy a cake if they want to?</p><p>LOGAN: At <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.maccakes.com\">www.maccakes.com</url> and see the movie tonight on Up TV at uptv.com.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, terrific. Good for you, Angela. Thanks so much and congratulations. Bosses beware, ever get the feeling some of your team are talking behind you? Turns out millions of workers wouldn't trust employers if their lives depended on it. It is costing businesses in a lot of ways. You can never have too much money. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: A new study from the American Psychological Association says only half of workers think their employers are honest with them. Not only does this make for lousy morale and hurting productivity. James Freeman and Jo Ling Kent are back with me as well. Twenty four percent don't trust their company, 32 percent say their employer is not honest with them. What do you think is the age we live in, our employers are spying on us, get used to it.</p><p>KENT: Well, if you're going to have technology in the office. If you're going to operate on a work computer, it should be assumed in good faith pretty much your information is publicly for the company. That comes with the territory.</p><p>FRANCIS: They also -- 62 percent say they are treated fairly. So by definition almost 40 percent do not think they are treated fairly. Less than half are happy with their professional growth. Just an unhappiness at work is what I am hearing.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't see it that way. I mean, it's a job after and the fact that over 60 percent, I guess I'm looking at the glass as 60 percent full. I have to tell you, expectations were set very low because I worked living off your tax dollars for the federal government for several years so this has kind of been a dream of transparency, openness and honesty.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think there is 100 percent happiness within this building. It speaks to a little bit how the stock market has gone up, corporate profits have increased, wages have lagged, people feel like in general maybe they are not getting their piece of the pie, real quick.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't think the numbers are that bad. It is a workplace, some people will be dissatisfied. Most of them aren't.</p><p>KENT: Over the things or small things. Maybe the water cooler or their benefits or e-mails accessed.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think they want more money. We always want more money. Maybe they are just unhappy people. Thanks to both of you. That is all we have for now. I hope you are making money and you're happy at work today. \"COUNTDOWN\" with Liz Claman starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC.

In fact the  secret is out.  Bill Ackman refusing to back down from his billion dollar  bet against Herbalife.  He's even paying insiders millions to dish some  dirt.  Two tech giants in two big reports.  The burning questions Facebook  and Apple finally need to answer as they announce their latest results.   And some new voices in the fight against Keystone.  We're live from the  capital as so-called cowboy and Indian activists march on D.C.  Because  even when they say it's not it is always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the heels of the bid to buy Allergan, activist investor Bill Ackman is  heeding the headlines again.  A new report.  So the hedge fund titan is  agreeing to spend up to $3.6 million to an Herbalife whistleblower.  Here  to discuss all that, Charlie Gasparino, James Freeman of \"Wall Street  Journal\" and Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management.  We couldn't stop  talking about it even before the show started.  He is skating very close to  the line here on a number of different bets.  Let's talk about Herbalife  first.  I mean what do you think about paying this whistle-blower? </p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  You know, he has a  rationale for it, which I saw in the ABC News piece, Brian Ross and another  gentleman from ABC News wrote the story.  It is online.  The rationale that  it's, you know, perfectly OK to pay for whistleblower's legal costs and  whatever.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean it was - they are going to pay him $250,000 a year for  lost work due to whistleblowing, even though he is working, I guess, in a  laundromat.  So far he's made $80,000.  He denied that in the past.  But he  said, technically he hadn't received the funds yet, so he wasn't lying. </p><p>GASPARINO:  I want to say this.  As someone who has covered these sort of  stories, whistleblowers and hedge funds and, you know activist investors,  I've never seen people pay off people like this before.  This - unless I'm  missing something.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  And why do they have to?  I mean .</p><p>GASPARINO:  I agree.</p><p>FREEMAN:  If this is such an obvious pyramid scheme, why does Ackman have  to spend all the money on lawyering and lobbying and PR to convince people?   Federal regulators have information on this company for a long time now.   Why this constant campaign?</p><p>GASPARINO:  And it's not like ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Really is a pyramid.</p><p>GASPARINO:  And it's not like.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's what I'm saying - it's not, but it's out there.</p><p>GASPARINO:  But it's not - and it's not like Bernie Madoff, well, as you  see.  People keep saying this might be like Bernie Madoff when people  looked at him.  Bernie Madoff was barely in the news when this stuff was  going on.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  There were a few investigations.  This guy is in the news every  day.</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT:  And this one investors are looking  at all the time.  Because, you know, they say it is not a level playing  field.  They say that is rigged.  You know, these types of stories, you  know, shine a spotlight.  Wait a second, average investor is not doing  these types of things.  And look, they call it a gray area, but I think it  kind of pushes .</p><p>GASPARINO:  What you're talking about is how he invested in Allergan, which  we were first to report yesterday.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right. </p><p>GASPARINO:  You look at CNBC today.  That is all they're talking about.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Not familiar with that channel.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.  Not either.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GASPARINO:  But I know - I can't help it.  It is in the newsroom.  And -  but what is interesting is the notion that Bill Ackman can go, be told by a  partner..</p><p>FRANCIS:  You are talking about Allergan?</p><p>GASPARINO:  Yeah, the Allergan.  By Valiant that he was going to make a bid  for Allergan.  Join me in this bid.  Go in undercover, buy options, so it's  not seen by anybody.  The market doesn't notice.  And low and behold, guess  what happens?  They put the bid in, the market goes up and you make a lot  of money.  Now, does this violate insider trading laws?  No.  But if you  want to know what gets people mad, more than high frequency trading, this  looks pretty - this is a perfect example of why the playing field is  unlevel ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO:  By the way - completely illegal.</p><p>MAHONEY:  How he got the information?  You know, it was (INAUDIBLE) flying  over his head and drop the note on him and told him this is going on? </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>MAHONEY:  You know, individual investors don't get their uncle and tell  them this is going on.  So .</p><p>FRANCIS:  And it's interesting - it's interesting that Ackman wears the cap  of I'm the activist investor.  So, out there for the little guy.  You know,  I represent the voice of a little guy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAHONEY:  There are current investors in those funds.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's what activist investors have been saying.  But that is not  really what it is about.  He is the super investor who has the inside track  on all the information.  And he is part of the problem that we've seen such  an unleveled playing field.  Some would say, do you agree with that?  Do  you guys agree with that? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Two very different situations.  On the Herbalife thing I think  Ackman's paying a lot of money to gin up federal investigations - and it  smells pretty bad.  With this situation, when, you know, Valiant and  Allergan, I see nothing wrong here.  I mean I think it - federal judges, if  you look at - as they're deliberating now in Manhattan about what is the  limit of insider trading .</p><p>GASPARINO:  I would say this. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Their questions are suggesting this is not insider trading.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I would say - I would say this.  I'm against the insider  trading laws.  I think we should throw them just - right off the bat.</p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  That said, if you are going to have them, this is just how rich  people can keep getting rich.  There is no way the average guy in the  street is ever going to get a tip from Valiant, oh, go buy some stock and  join me and buying three options and you let's - and you can make a lot of  money.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It is not going to happen.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Look, it is not illegal, the way we look at it.  But it is not  morally or ethically the way to do business.  And that's kind of what's  coming back, and that's why - I was looking out there.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's about - yeah, and it's about the rich getting richer, which  is why people are shying away from the stock market.  And it's a shame  because stock prices are up 175 percent from the bottom.  And it is an  opportunity for the average person to make money, but they are scared .</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, the average person - better prices.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Hang on.  More to discuss after this.  Don't move.  Don't move.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Moving on now to Amazon.  The online retail giant has a new  licensing agreement with HBO.  Prime members can now get subscription  access to content like \"The Sopranos\" and \"Girls.\"  Shareholders, however,  not loving this so far.  You don't like - Let's go to James Romelli down at  the CME.  James, what do you think about this?  How is it trading?</p><p>JAMES ROMELLI:  Right.  You know, this is a groundbreaking deal in terms of  HBO is not going to be offered on Amazon's prime subscription service.  And  this is first time it is being offered on any streaming subscription based  service.  However, it's not a very big deal for Amazon.  And if we look at  the stock price today, it is down around $5.  So, it is clear that  investors really are not excited over this deal.  I think if we take a look  at this it's really more of a negative for companies like Netflix than it  is a positive for a company like Amazon.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>ROMELLI:  It does show that they are going to be willing to go out there  and acquire premium content.  They have much deeper pockets than Netflix.   They're a much larger company.  And Netflix does not want them in this  space.  It shows they're serious about growing that part of their business  and they are going to be aggressive about it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  James, real quick, before you go - what's the feel in the market  today?  I'm looking at a Dow, that's down 14 points.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  So, we are looking at a market that's down run 14 points.   Most of the moves are higher this week.  We're on very thin volume.  We're  still trading pretty thinly holiday week.  I say earnings have been pretty  good.  I think the markets going ahead higher into the end of the week.   And I think next week, once the traders are back from holiday we really see  a sustained move higher on volume.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, James, thanks so much.  Soon, a new report shows that  America no longer has the world's wealthiest middle class.  That honor now  goes to Canada.  We can thank the small growth in the U.S. middle incomes  compared to other nations.  There are still some good news for the red,  white and blue, with recent gains to high-end households the U.S. continues  to rein as the world's richest large country.  Let's bring the panel back.   The divide just grows wider.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Yeah, and I would say, one reason why it is, is kind of what we  were going to get into before.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO:  You know  - you know, (INAUDIBLE) and all these regulators  scaring people out of the stock market, saying, oh, it is rig, high  frequency trading, insider trading.  Do you realize all you had to do is  buy an S&amp;P 500 index, put $1,000 in and that, in 2009 when they started  easing, when they started printing money?  But you make a lot of money.  I  mean markets are not rigged if you play it safe and not try to compete with  these big guys on insider (INAUDIBLE).  I think, you know, they should just  legalize insider information.  Legalize high frequency trading.  And guess  what?  Small investors should buy index funds.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you guys agree with that idea?</p><p>MAHONEY:  It's - insider trading?  No, I think you need to have insider  trading rules.  And again, it's hard to define what those rules are going  to be.</p><p>GASPARINO:  That's why we shouldn't have them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MAHONEY:  Yeah, I mean, look.  This is the market for small investors also.   Look, this is the market is like the energizer bunny, right?  It keeps  going and going and going.  Interest rates are low.  Earnings have been  pretty good the last couple of years.  So, if you kind of stay the course .</p><p>FRANCIS:  But that's what that stat tells you.  I mean that middle income  folks are falling further and further behind.  That the policies we've seen  over the past five years have done nothing but enrich the one percent.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  Well, that's another story.</p><p>MAHONEY:  That's another story.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We want to get more of those middle income people to become  capitalists.  To raise their incomes to the point where they can own  stocks, where they can benefit.  Now, how do you do that? You notice Canada  on that list has been very friendly, much more than the United States to  energy production in its west. </p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We have an energy boom pretty much despite Washington.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  Welders making over $200,000 a year in some cases in Ohio.  And  we ought to be encouraging that. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Real quick, before we go, Ken, do you agree with the idea that  the policies of the past five years have done nothing but made the divide  bigger?</p><p>MAHONEY:  I think so.  The unintended consequences of Obamacare, we are  seeing how wage stagnation, you know, hiring of employees. </p><p>FRANCIS:  And the Fed juicing the stock market as the number one .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO:  Melissa, think of it this way, if you have manufacture jobs  going overseas, blue-collar jobs overseas, why not do Keystone pipeline?   Why not do fracking?  Those are blue color ..</p><p>FRANCIS:  We have some folks that are going to come up with.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Coming up, tech heavyweights take center stage.  The market  holding its breath for Facebook an Apple earnings.  We have got the answer  to all of your burning questions coming up.  </p><p>And we haven't seen this much cooperation since the first Thanksgiving.   Cowboys and Indians teaming up to stop the Keystone pipeline.  We are live  at the protests.  Teepees tents and bonfires included.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Whether it is on Wall Street or Main Street here is who is making  and losing money today.  Anyone with a piece of Netflix.  The stock sinking  today following news of Amazon's content deal with HBO.  Shares are down  more than five percent right now.  That is bad news for CEO Reed Hastings.   He has nearly 2 1/2 million shares.  So he is less $48 million today.  That  hurts.  And speaking of the Amazon, someone over there is losing even more  money.  CEO Jeff Bezos.  His net worth has taken a real dive this year,  already losing more than 6 billion bucks.  Out of all the people on the  planet Earth, Bezos is second only to Carlos Slim who's lost around $6.5  billion so far in 2014.  What a rough year.  You know, I'm sure they're  both crying in their Benjamins.  But you know who is about to save a whole  lot of money on cheap and vast fashion?  All of us here in the U.S.   Highmart (ph), which is one of Europe's most successful clothing chains is  landing on our shores.  It's going to challenge other retailers with these  rock-bottom prices.  It has even been known to offer a pair of jeans for  less than ten bucks.  I bet they don't shrink.  The first store will open  in Boston within a year.  </p><p>All right, anticipation is rising for Apple and Facebook earnings after the  bell today.  Stocks are slipping.  So can this report ease investor fears  and answer the burning questions?  Adam Lashinsky, is \"Fortune\" magazine  senior editor at large and the Fox News contributor, Ari Zoldan is Quantum  Network CEO and Lance Ulanoff, is Mashable editor-at-large. Adam, I don't  think I have ever seen you in person.  You have legs.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ADAM LASHINSKY, FORTUNE MAGAZINE SENIOR EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  I hope so.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I've always seen you on the remote.  Yes.  I will start with you  since you're in town.  For Apple you want to know when and not what.  When  will they release their next major category?  What category do you think it  is?</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Well .</p><p>FRANCIS:  You just don't care?  You just want to know when it's going to  happen. </p><p>LASHINSKY:  Right.  It's - to me as an investor, as somebody watching  company, it doesn't matter what it is.  It could be a television.  It could  be the whole living room.  It could be, you know, it can't be a watch.   That's not enough.  The point is they need something of the magnitude of  the IPod, the iPhone and the iPad for this company to take the next leap  forward.  Anything else is gravy.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, you want them to say when.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  I want them to.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Because I mean this is the question.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  By the way they won't today.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They are not going to do it.  They are not going to do it.  They  don't care what you want.   All right.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Oh, no that's for sure. </p><p>FRANCIS:  On Apple, you want to know what other markets are on their radar  besides China.  Why?</p><p>ARI ZOLDAN, QUANTUM NETWORKS &amp; CEO:  Right.  China was - I mean they have  done a great job in China.  I would imagine right now if I were to take a  guess it's probably going to be Latin America.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN:  Just, you know, looking at the demographic and the numbers and the  size of it - I mean it's an extraordinary market for Apple to break into.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you agree with that, Lance?  You're shaking your head. </p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, MASHABLE EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  Oh, yeah.  I mean it's sort of  like we forget about these other parts of the world, like Brazil, this  vibrant social media community, these products there, and services that we  don't even know about in the U.S.  So, of course you want to go in their  place.  And that means they are connected and they want to hear.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  And by the way, Apple has said quite a bit about that.  Their  growth outside of the United States and Europe is much faster than it is .</p><p>ZOLDAN:  And there is lot of brand loyalty - there's a lot of brand loyal  to also within the Latin American market. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Lance, for Apple, you want to know, I mean they're hesitating on  the wearables front.  What is behind that?  Should they get into that?   What is your question with that?</p><p>ULANOFF:  You know, Apple is smart about products.  They are going  carefully.  They are going when they're ready and I think they are looking  around now and I don't know if they're getting cold feet.  Obviously, Nike  just laid off a bunch of people work in their wearable division.  I'm  looking at everybody's wrist here and I don't see any wearable devices.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No.</p><p>ULANOFF:  And, by the way, that is not unusual.  And I think Apple is, you  know, they sometimes like to lead, but they are really - they are not quite  getting it, right, all the people they've hired, all the designers, all the  help - I think they're still working on it.  I'm waiting for a signal today  that tells us what might happen over the next few months.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They could be the one to revolutionize that space if they get  into it.  Because there has been so many of those little fit wristlets and  you see people wear them.  Just love them .</p><p>ZOLDAN:  But they're not leaders anymore.  But Melissa - but they're not  leaders anymore.  You know.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Apple is?</p><p>ZOLDAN:  Yeah, Apple is .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Really? </p><p>ZOLDAN:  Apple is not leaders anymore.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Let me just correct you on that.</p><p>ZOLDAN:  Not anymore.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  The interesting thing on this - they never have been.  They  didn't have the first music player.  They didn't have the first smartphone.   And they didn't have the .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ULANOFF:  But they did have one's market share.  But they did have market  share and they did have a brand followings.  Right?  Isn't that really what  we want to talk about?  It's not that they are leaders.  They're  innovators.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ZOLDAN:  Makes total sense they have not (INAUDIBLE) the wearables yet.</p><p>ULANOFF:  Exactly.  They will wait for everybody to fall over on  themselves.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Let's move on to Facebook.  Adam, you want to know when Sheryl  Sandberg is leaving.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean we've see all the signals.  It seems like with the whole  lean in launch - it feels like a political campaign.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It does.  She sold a lot of stock.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It feels like she has kind of done that and is on her way out.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Sure.  So, Sheryl Sandberg is a natural politician. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  If you listen to her five minutes you know that.  So, you see  this public profile.  Yes, it feels like her work is done there and someone  else could do her job.  And furthermore, that she has other things that she  would like to do.  So yes, I think it is important eventually that Facebook  say, what is the schedule for Sheryl?</p><p>FRANCIS:  You're shaking your head.  You agree with that?</p><p>ULANOFF:  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  I mean I read her whole book.  I think,  you know, she has got a lot on her mind.  She wants to lead women in  particular and but I don't think she will jump right into political office.   I think she'll work for some - maybe she'll work for an administration  first.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You think?  I don't know.  I mean there's been talk about her  running for Barbara Boxer's seat, running in California.  She has such a  strong base there.  You don't think ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ZOLDAN:  I think she will.  She's on the whole Facebook.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  She's - yeah.</p><p>ZOLDAN:  She's been there done that.  That's for her I think is a natural.</p><p>ULANOFF:  You'll have to answer that full disparity question in Silicon  Valley.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And one last question, Lance.  You want to know on Facebook, how  important is that that consumers realize that WhatsApp are Facebook  products.  WhatsApp and Instagram.  Why is that important?  Why is that the  answer you need? </p><p>ULANOFF:  Well, I just think that what surprised a little bit is how  Facebook has not sort of sucked them all the way in and rebranded them.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Maybe because it's - Facebook is not cool anymore and WhatsApp  is?</p><p>ULANOFF:  Well, I think there is part of that.  But it's also being smart.   The way they look at the business going forward, is a number of satellite  businesses.  They want to be a conglomerate.  They want to be more like a  unilever.  And so, Facebook becomes the hub and all these other products  live outside of each other.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You guys are so smart.  We are going to leave it there.  Thanks  to all three of you.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Coming up, the very local issue that has international celebs  crying out loud.  Horses have long been a mainstay in New York Central  Park.  We're going to show you this very green innovation that could be  coming to your town too.  </p><p>Plus, big tech names are taking over New York.  Some on Wall Street are  starting, to get very nervous.  Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wireless carrier AT&amp;T narrowly beating first-quarter earnings,  really dropping today.  Let's go to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Nicole.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  It's a name that we've been  watching so closely today, Melissa.  It is been the big loser on the Dow  Jones industrial average.  Right now it is down 3.6 percent for AT&amp;T at  34.99.  It has been ticking down some of the names in the telecom sector,  including Verizon, CenturyLink, Windstream as well as Frontier  communication.  You've had several of the analysts putting their comments  out.  And JPMorgan, for example, cut their price target to $34 from 35.   They have a neutral rating.  So, they did come out with their numbers.   They've raised their full-year revenue growth forecast.  AT&amp;T, to at least  four percent from three percent.  But the big picture here, is that the  overall numbers from AT&amp;T were disappointing to Wall Street.  And as a  result we're seeing that name to the downside.  Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Nicole, thanks so much.  So, one of New York City's most popular  attractions may be heading back to the stables.  The idea of retiring  Central Park's horse-drawn carriages, has drawn both the ire and the praise  of many of celebrities since Mayor Bill de Blasio voiced that idea.  It  includes Liam Neeson, Alec Baldwin, singer Pink and former mayor Michael  Bloomberg, all on different sides.  No one company - now one company is  trotting along with a very unique innovation, an all-electric vintage  automobile.  It is classy and green enough to replace the beloved horses  they believe.</p><p>Joining us now is Creative Workshop owner Jason Wenig.  So walk me through  this.  Mayor Bill de Blasio reached out to you about this?</p><p>JASON WENIG, CREATIVE WORKSHOP OWNER:  No.  Several years ago, Niclass  (ph).  It is the group that's on the forefront of this change approached me  asking me what I would do about the idea of replacing the carriages.  And  that is how the whole thing started. </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, what are the carriages like?  Walk me through it.</p><p>WENIG:  Well, the carriages represent a time pretty much turn of the  century, 1900, 1910, when the idea of the automobile ignited the world's  fascination with this idea.  So, it's an homage to that period of time, to  that type of car.  And the idea would be the hope to ignite the same type  of passions that brought us to this day and age to have love affair with  the car.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm reading, though, the price tag is between $150,000 and  $175,000?</p><p>WENIG:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't think as a taxpayer in the city, I can afford that.  </p><p>WENIG:  Well, these are privately owned and operated.  So, we are working  really hard to get the price to a really good point.  I don't consider this  to be a moneymaker for the first cars we are building for the city.  But  you know.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, privately owned and operated you are going to try and get the  taxi company to own that and put it out there?  Or who is the owner?</p><p>WENIG:  Well, the owner would be any company that would want to run this -  business.  The individual carriage operators or a consortium that would  come together to buy these units.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, as you work though the numbers, how much would they have to  charge per ride in order to make their money back?</p><p>WENIG:  Well, I believe that the manner, in which they charge clients now  would be the same way that they charge clients for these rides.  These  rides would be able to go through the city where the carriages wouldn't be.   So, you have to understand, that the opportunity to own one of these  vehicles to replace the carriages is something that they have to make a  decision for.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>WENIG:  And we're just trying our best to make something that is powerful  enough so that will entice people to get on these rides, to further the  interests of the city, to be nostalgic and to carry on this tradition going  forward.  It is, you know, there is a lot of people who come through  Central Park.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  They want to do this.</p><p>WENIG:  People want to do this.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, and I mean I don't know if they will be as receptive to  things that don't have horses.  I've shocked by how the celebrities have  really come out, on, you know, Liam Neeson so upset that the horses are  going away.  Alec Baldwin is so upset that the horses are still there.  I  mean it seems like celebrities have other things to spend their time on,  maybe not.  Anyway, thank you for coming on.</p><p>WENIG:  Yeah, it's remarkable how much passion is behind this, but we're  doing our best to try to create a solution for everybody.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jason, and we appreciate that.  Thanks for coming on.</p><p>WENIG:  Thank you so much.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Cool innovation.  Coming up, Silicon Valley taking some heat.   David Einhorn talking tough about tech.  We're going to tell you why he  thinks you should get out and do it now.</p><p>And speaking of heat, a Keystone protest that is absolutely on fire.  We've  got cowboys and Indians, protesting.  Oh my.  \"Piles of Money\" coming up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Over to the markets, we are seeing red across the board.  Right  now, Mark Newton is down for New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>MARK NEWTON:  Great to be back.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Mark, what's driving the trade right now?</p><p>NEWTON:  You know, it's interesting, we are seeing a little bit of a stall  out after six straight up days.  Lot of the NASDAQ names.  NASDAQ has been  particularly weak, and really even on this little bounce we've seen, the  NASDAQ is underperformed substantially.  We're still down about four  percent from the highs.  So, it's a lot of these high momentum names  started to turn back down.  You are seeing Netflix weakness, some weakness  incurred Green Mountain coffee roasters.  Also, a couple of the biotechs  are pulling back as well.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>NEWTON:  One thing to notice, though, is that industrials have moved back  to new high territory.  The XLI is set to make a new daily high close today  above 53.15.  So, that's interesting.  And we've continued to see a lot of  strength in the industrials.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes, I've heard a lot of people say today that they're looking at  the tech earnings that are coming out today and this week for direction  going forward.  They want to hear from Apple and Facebook.  It's a very big  deal in terms of how they look at the economy.  Do you agree with that?</p><p>NEWTON:  I do.  I think it's tough to pinpoint a few names.  The group as a  whole is starting to stabilize a little bit, which gives me a little bit  more confidence.  When I look at charts of techs versus the S&amp;P we seem to  be holding and stabilizing.  So that should be good.  Stocks like Apple  have been range bound for four months.  So I think investors really want to  see signs of this stocks getting back up and breaking out for what the  future is protect.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Thank you, Mark.  Appreciate your time.</p><p>NEWTON:  My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So we love our protests on the show.  You know that, this week in  Washington, D.C., multiple events are being held to push for the rejection  of the Keystone pipeline.  We are live with two of those voices at the  National Mall in D.C.  Joining me is Bold Nebraska Director Jane Kleib, and  a member of the Lower Sioux Nation, Dallas Goldtooth.  Dallas, first of  all, I love your name.  What is your message when you are down there?</p><p>DALLAS GOLDTOOTH, LOWER SIOUX DAKOTA NATION MEMBER:  Our message is to  stand in solidarity with as a native people with ranches, cowboys, farmers,  land owners, non-native against the Keystone XL pipeline in its development  in all forms, and also to address its source in the tar sense.  We stand in  solidarity.  All folks who don't want to see the dirty oil go through their  land, through their country and to protect our air, our water, the land,  and to protect our treaty rights as indigenous peoples, I think that's  really the purpose what's going on.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jane, when you have folks are marching through as cowboys and  Indians and pitching teepees, do people take the cause seriously or does it  get you the attention that you wanted?</p><p>JANE KLEIB, BOLD NEBRASKA DIRECTOR:  Yyes, no, we're absolutely getting the  attention that we wanted, and we have Americans who are visiting our  nation's capital coming in asking questions about what we are doing?  And  we explain to them about how this tar sands pipeline is coming through  America and risks property rights.  So our farmers and ranchers don't like  the fact that a foreign oil corporation is going to use eminent domain to  take their land away.  It's been a great learning experience for not only  the tribes and farmers and ranchers, but for Americans who ask those  questions.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Dallas, let me ask you, what is the reception like from people?   Because, you know, according to the latest \"Washington Post\" poll, 65  percent of Americans approve of and want the pipeline, it's only 22 percent  that don't.</p><p>GOLDTOOTH:  It's a question about information and knowledge, once you start  learning about the pipeline and learning what it's going to do to the land.   Learning the effects of the individuals and communities that are directly  impacted, to me it seems a no-brainer how ridiculous it is.  I mean, the  eminent domain question is a huge issue, folks on both sides whether  Democrat or Republican can join together on the idea of land being taken  away for a greater good which is not going to serve them.</p><p>Not going to serve America.  It's going to serve outside interests.   Talk about job creation, a strip mall will create more sustainable jobs  than a pipeline, and I'm not advocating a strip mall, I'm saying that it's  foolish to believe that it's anything, but dangerous and destructive to our  land and our livelihoods.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jane, sustainable energy brings more jobs and brings more  manufacturing.  Cheap energy isn't good for our economy?</p><p>KLEIB:  Well, this isn't -- well, this is not cheap energy, this is  actually dirty energy and it's bad for not only climate change but risks  our water supply.  This pipeline is crossing over 2,000 family wells in the  state of Nebraska.  If the tar sand spill happens in the well, that  family's well is done.  In some areas they have only one choice to get a  well.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They've already changed the route.  Is there any way this  pipeline could go through that could make you happier.  You don't want it  at all under any circumstance?</p><p>KLEIB:  Yes, they altered the route a little bit it.  But still crosses the  sand hill, the State Department confirmed that.  That's yet another reason  in how Trans Canada -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Is there any route that would make you happy?</p><p>KLEIB:  We wanted it around the sand hills and aquifer, many folks did.   Now that we know about tar sands and the destruction it's doing to other  communities in Michigan and Arkansas where spills have happened, we don't  want tar sands at all.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So there is no route that would be OK with you.  I'm trying to  clarify your position.</p><p>KLEIB:  No, ma'am.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, Jane, Dallas, thanks to both of you.  James, what's  your reaction?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They spent six years to find an environmental case  against this.  They couldn't find it.  Oil is going to get burned whether  it's going through Keystone or somewhere else.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What about the well water she is talking about?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Again, this is an exhaustive review.  If there is an  environmental case to be made, the Obama administration has plenty of green  staffers who would be eager to make the case.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They put it off a after the midterms and while the majority of  Americans want it, it feels like it's never going to happen at this point?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is the fear.  The industry is working to get  around it, building a lot of rail terminals, finding other ways to move the  oil, but the tragedy is for the middle class workers talking about.  Terry  O'Sullivan -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  What about her argument though that none of the oil is coming  here?  We're not going to see the benefit of it no matter what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, it is coming here.  That's what rail lines are  doing, moving the oil south, and not just from Canada but from the back in  shale, North Dakota, it is going down to refiners on the gulf coast.  So  this is a completely symbolic issue that oil is going to be burned, it's  only a question of where, and do we get the benefit as Americans?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Coming up, Wall Street starting to feel a little unsettled as  tech moves onto its turf.  How finance could be replaced as New York's main  growth engine.  Don't move.  At the end of the day, it's all about MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief.  New home sales  unexpectedly plunged last month by 14.5 percent to their lowest levels  since July of 2013.  It was also the steepest monthly decline since that  time as well.  Some economists say weather and rising mortgage rates may  have played a role.</p><p>Toyota retaining its top position in global vehicle sales in the  first quarter outselling both GM and Volkswagen.  The Japanese automaker  set itself a new record with nearly 2.6 million cars.  GM came in second  with 2.4 million.</p><p>And consumer goods maker Procter &amp; Gamble reporting a 5 percent  increase in profit.  That is due to a surge in sales for its home care  products with consumers buying more Tide laundry detergent, in my house,  and Duracell batteries also up.  That is from the Fox Business Network,  giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Silicon Valley is starting to take over Wall Street's turf and  experiencing some of the backlash that comes along with the territory.   Techs threatening to replace the banking industry as the growth engine of  New York, but will increased criticism prove a stumbling block for these  internet giants.  Here to discuss, Jo Ling Kent, James Freeman is back.  We  also have Jonathan Hoenig of Capitalistpig.com.  He is a Fox News  contributor.</p><p>Jonathan since you're not here.  I'll give you first crack.   Bringing the jobs, taking over the real estate, but now they are starting  to get the backlash talking about the 1 percent, we're talking about  salaries, it's starting for tech.  What do you think?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, you know technology, Melissa,  isn't taking over finance.  Technology really is finance.  Gone are the  days when you have the individual specialists organizations or floor  traders at major exchanges, technology is driving finance.  It's not  surprising to see more and more tech companies relocating, jobs office  space to Manhattan, the financial capital of the world.  Those who decry it  are shooting themselves in the foot.  That's what you want companies to  create jobs fit well for New Yorkers and for the whole country.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That is so classic.  So Google is coming to New York.  They are  looking to gobble up 600,000 square feet of Manhattan, 80 percent expansion  for the company instead of people focusing on the 3,000 employees that are  going to be hired, immediately there is talk how they're going to drive up  Brent New York.  The exact same way they've driven up rent in California.   What do you think of the backlash?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  They are crazy.  This is good.   The people can now get jobs at Google.  Finance is going down, if you look  at the housing bubble, the financial bubble, the U.S. probably did have too  many people and too much money in the financial industry.  This is probably  a natural move back.</p><p>FRANCIS:  At the same time, Jo, fair is fair, if you look at the salaries  that have been given away in tech land.  They don't get the same criticism  until now.  Jeff Ubben made the comparison between Silicon Valley and Wall  Street yesterday saying Jamie Dimon gets hauled over the coals in New York.   For his 20 million bucks, but Eric Schmidt presides over four board  meetings and gets paid $100 million,\" you don't hear boo.</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS:  That's true.  There isn't necessarily -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  That is an outrage.</p><p>KENT:  We haven't seen a tech CEO really have a bad fall or have a major  crisis in the same way that Wall Street has been perceived.  And I think  that is still possible to happen.  Their reputation still very much on the  line.  So I think if you look especially, I just finished reading a book  called young money and it's all about young bankers.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Good book?</p><p>KENT:  It is good.  You should read it.  It's about reputation and tech has  an opportunity, if this is a bubble, to acquire -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Difference in tech land, they're not paying with our money as  taxpayers.  They are backed by us and they are backed by us -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Jonathan, they create cool products that we like and with banks  we don't appreciate the fact if it weren't for them, we wouldn't have  credit cards?</p><p>HOENIG:  Exactly right, Melissa, total misunderstanding what financiers  create for the economy.  We respect technology stars because we can hold an  iPhone, use a computer and say I understand this company made this product.   But to your point people are ignorant as to the value that hedge funds,  investment banks, bracket banks, the whole financial class brings.  They  don't only create the credit cards, they create the jobs and the  capitalists that move the economy forward.</p><p>KENT:  It's very difficult to define what the value is of Facebook or your  iPhone.  It's very easy to inflate that, thus the huge numbers.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We got to move on.  Tech giants battling detractors on all fronts  the past few days, Green Light Capital CEO David Einhorn sounding alarm on  dangerous bubble and shorting high-flying tech stocks.  He writes there is  a clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15  years.  What is uncertainty is how much further the bubble can expand and  what might pop.  The Nasdaq is down 5.1 percent since March 5th when it hit  highest point 14 years ago.  Guys, what do you think?  This letter is news  that broke on the show yesterday.  You had a chance to drill down more on  it.  What is he saying?</p><p>KENT:  He basically says the valuations of these companies is no longer  traditional.  They are no longer looking at actual numbers and based on a  lot of -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  So it sounds like a lost bubble.</p><p>KENT:  But if you look at high-flying stocks.  They've come down.  The best  performers in 2013, we are talking about Trip Advisor, Netflix, Tesla, all  of these great stocks and look at them now, they've come down.  Somewhere  in a bear market already.  Some analysts I'm talking to who don't agree  with Einhorn are seeing a pullback.  This is not necessarily a bubble.</p><p>FRANCIS:  James, what do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm not sure we should be picking on tech.  If you want to survey  the landscape for bubbles, given what the Federal Reserve has done, pumping  money into the economy, a lot of asset classes.  Junk bonds.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jonathan, what do you think?</p><p>HOENIG:  I don't see.  I don't see bubble, Melissa.  In 2000, the p/e on  the S&amp;P 500 was 40.  It's nowhere near that today.  Certain stocks are  expensive, but the market itself is not in a bubble.  Transports are at an  all-time high.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, thanks to all of you.  Good discussion.  Heading into the  last hour of trading, we have our very own Liz Claman joining us.  Liz,  what do you have coming up on your big show today?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Well, I can't believe that panel of guests.  You  guys have the best people.  All of you guys are my buddies.  So great to  see everybody.  We have a lot coming up, but remember there is a major  widely held company that came out with numbers today, and the numbers were  so good they have probably irked an activist investor trying to make Dow  chemical break up.</p><p>Andrew Liveris is the CEO and chairman and president, the stock  moving higher on news that it beat on the bottom line.  And we've got the  CEO and chairman to talk about why he just feels that this company is being  run in the exact correct way.  They are shedding assets, which is something  that Daniel Lobe of third point, the activist investor has agitated them to  do, but he's got a very big man on his side, Warren Buffett.  We have him  live.  Plus we are watching the market.  Very tentative at the moment.  See  you then.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow, huge guest list, look forward to that.  Great job.</p><p>All right, coming up, millions of Americans know all about the  horrors of foreclosure.  Our next guest refused to let it get the better of  her.  You have to listen about how she fought it every inch of the way and  got herself a movie deal in the process.  All to keep her home.  You can  never have too much money or too much gumption.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Investors banking on the stock shares of Bank of New York Mellon  shooting up at this hour.  Nicole Petallides is standing by at the New York  Stock Exchange.  What are the reports that are driving this higher?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS:  Well, you are seeing right now that's a  two-day chart.  You see instant pop here over the last hour or so.  Bank of  New York Mellon now up 2.7 percent.  There are reports that they are  considering a sale of the corporate trust unit.  Now if they were to do  this possible sale, people speculate that this could account for about $2.5  billion.</p><p>One person has been reporting that Goldman Sachs may be helping them  with this, Fox Business spoke with Bank of New York Mellon.  The spokesman  told Fox Business that they are declining to comment on speculation.</p><p>In the meantime, this could be good news for shareholders as money  could be returned to the shareholders, but you see the stock getting a big  pop on the idea of this report that they could sell off the corporate trust  unit.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.  It's time for spare  change, this story takes the cake.  Faced with losing her house, Angela  Logan baked her way out of foreclosure using grandmother's apple cake  recipe.  She has a thriving bakery and a teaming movie about her  experience.</p><p>Angela Logan joins me now.  We wanted to do your story because it is  such a celebration of the American spirit.  You found yourself in this  situation more than 2 million Americans found themselves in.  Losing your  house.  Instead of giving up, you said what could I do to change the  situation?  How did you get to this?</p><p>ANGELA LOGAN, MORTGAGE APPLE CAKES:  Well, I decided that I wanted to bake  100 cakes in 10 days to help myself save my home and asked my friends and  neighbors buy to save my home.   I had to go to the bottom to reach out for  something else.  There was nowhere else to go, I had to reach for whatever  I had and my cake is what I had.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So did you know you were able to sell all them?  You are looking  at a situation where you can't make your mortgage payment so you have to  invest in ingredients.  It was a risk? </p><p>LOGAN:  I need three months of mortgage payments, $2500 each and I knew I  had ten days to get it.  I put a circle in the middle much the piece of  paper and said how many people do I have to buy the cakes?  I reached out  to friends that worked for organizations I volunteer and asked those people  first to help me save my home by buying a cake.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What was the difference between going to someone and asking them  to buy your cake versus saying can you lend me money or give me money?</p><p>LOGAN:  That's select charity, I guess, I think that a lot of people were  having a difficult time.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>LOGAN:  I did not feel like I wanted to ask somebody for something.  I  wanted to work for it in a way, and I had no job.  So buying a cake which  was of extraordinary quality, cream cheese frosting.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Because 40 is a lot for a cake.  The media picked up on the  story.  At one point you had too much demand, you couldn't bake fast  enough.  What's the end to the story?  Do you have the house?</p><p>LOGAN:  I do.  It was a miracle the company shipped the cakes for me.  Now  we have the same situation, the movie comes out, a lot of demand.  We're  all set for national shipping.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's great.  Your web site, how can people buy a cake if they  want to?</p><p>LOGAN:  At <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.maccakes.com\">www.maccakes.com</url> and see the movie tonight on Up TV at uptv.com.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, terrific.  Good for you, Angela.  Thanks so much and  congratulations.  Bosses beware, ever get the feeling some of your team are  talking behind you?  Turns out millions of workers wouldn't trust employers  if their lives depended on it.  It is costing businesses in a lot of ways.   You can never have too much money.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  A new study from the American Psychological Association says only  half of workers think their employers are honest with them.  Not only does  this make for lousy morale and hurting productivity.  James Freeman and Jo  Ling Kent are back with me as well.  Twenty four percent don't trust their  company, 32 percent say their employer is not honest with them.  What do  you think is the age we live in, our employers are spying on us, get used  to it.</p><p>KENT:  Well, if you're going to have technology in the office.  If you're  going to operate on a work computer, it should be assumed in good faith  pretty much your information is publicly for the company.  That comes with  the territory.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They also -- 62 percent say they are treated fairly.  So by  definition almost 40 percent do not think they are treated fairly.  Less  than half are happy with their professional growth.  Just an unhappiness at  work is what I am hearing.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't see it that way.  I mean, it's a job after and the fact  that over 60 percent, I guess I'm looking at the glass as 60 percent full.   I have to tell you, expectations were set very low because I worked living  off your tax dollars for the federal government for several years so this  has kind of been a dream of transparency, openness and honesty.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I think there is 100 percent happiness within this building.  It  speaks to a little bit how the stock market has gone up, corporate profits  have increased, wages have lagged, people feel like in general maybe they  are not getting their piece of the pie, real quick.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think the numbers are that bad.  It is a workplace, some  people will be dissatisfied.  Most of them aren't.</p><p>KENT:  Over the things or small things.  Maybe the water cooler or their  benefits or e-mails accessed.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I think they want more money.  We always want more money.  Maybe  they are just unhappy people.  Thanks to both of you.  That is all we have  for now.  I hope you are making money and you're happy at work today.   \"COUNTDOWN\" with Liz Claman starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC.

Leave it to Bill Barr \u2014 who in a better world would instead star in a live-action remake of Droopy Dog \u2014 to take all that hard work and piss it away.                         Per reporting in the New York Times , \u201cJustice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Alphabet [\u2026] to wrap up their work by the end of September.\u201d These lawyers apparently viewed the new, abrupt deadline \u2014 against an enormously powerful company with nearly unlimited resources to throw at a comprehensive legal defence \u2014 as \u201carbitrary.\u201d       In all likeliness it\u2019s anything but arbitrary. As we near the general election in November, the Trump camp is looking for a win to hang its hat on. We\u2019ve already seen the president decide \u2014 seemingly mid-interview with Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan \u2014 to cut the number of troops deployed in Afghanistan by half , and likewise claim during his keynote speech at the RNC that he will release a covid-19 vaccine. Not coincidentally, both of these miraculous claims are projected (by Trump and seemingly only Trump) to come to fruition around November. Breaking up Google, which is increasingly a source of ire for Republicans and Democrats (albeit for wildly different reasons) appears to be a gambit by Barr to find that win \u2014 or at least the appearance of one.   We\u2019ve reached out to Google and the Department of Justice for comment and will update if we hear back.       As mentioned, the DOJ isn\u2019t the only game in town where fining, regulating, or otherwise frustrating Google\u2019s market dominance is concerned. A coalition of 50 state attorneys general is also probing the company, while the FTC, the House\u2019s Antitrust Subcommittee , and the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee have ongoing investigations more broadly into the practices of big tech. All have been gathering evidence for a year or more, which is what makes Barr\u2019s hastiness particularly egregious. Per the Times:   Some lawyers in the department worry that Mr. Barr\u2019s determination to bring a complaint this month could weaken their case and ultimately strengthen Google\u2019s hand, according to interviews with 15 lawyers who worked on the case or were briefed on the department\u2019s strategy [\u2026] Many career staff members in the antitrust division, including more than a dozen who were hired during the Trump administration, considered the evidence solid that Google\u2019s search and advertising businesses violated antitrust law. But some told associates that Mr. Barr was forcing them to come up with \u201chalf-baked\u201d cases so he could unveil a complaint by Sept. 30.    As is the case with most would-be totalitarians , the appearance of strength for Trump is often pursued at the expense of actually wielding power effectively. If true, Barr\u2019s reported plan to jump the gun on a Google antitrust case is a prime example. By looking the part and going after Google now, he would be likely to undermine the other existing cases against the company. If, say, Google manages to dodge claims by the DOJ of a monopoly on web search advertising (of which it controls more than 90% of the market), that becomes precedent the FTC or House needs to overcome to prove said monopoly exists.   Regulating big tech \u2014 and regulating it in a smart and comprehensive way \u2014 would be a steep uphill climb in the best of political climates. Leave it to Trump and his lackeys to carve that hill into a sheer cliff face and slather it in grease. Maybe someone else will clean it up.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42993895304</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RW-YK91-F07F-830W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Gizmodo Australia</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>BER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>DUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>MUN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>NYS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

It's abundantly clear by now that Barr's DOJ has been eager to weaponize antitrust to go after companies Trumpland is politically opposed to (like the legal cannabis sector[2]), while turning a blind eye[3] to every monopolistic whim of his BFFs in the telecom sector. The DOJ's petty lawsuit against California automakers[4] also made it clear there's no real intellectual consistency being applied at the Trump DOJ when it comes to antitrust. Now reports indicate that Barr has been expediting the DOJ \"antitrust inquiry\" into Google[5], in a transparent bid to get his \"crackdown of big tech\" into the headlines during the election cycle:\"In an unusual move, Mr. Barr placed the investigation under Jeffrey A. Rosen, the deputy attorney general, whose office would not typically oversee an antitrust case. </p><p>Mr. Barr and Mr. Delrahim also disagreed on how to approach the investigation, and Mr. Barr had told aides that the antitrust division had been asleep at the switch for decades, particularly in scrutinizing the technology industry.\"Context here matters. As the net neutrality fracas made abundantly clear, Google has long been the nemesis of the telecom sector, which has been clamoring for greater scrutiny of \"big tech\"[6] while successfully convincing the Trump administration to neuter pretty much all oversight of telecom monopolies[7]. Barr, a former Verizon lawyer, has eagerly rubber stamped numerous telecom consolidation efforts with less than zero interest in hard data, most notably the job and competition eroding merger between T-Mobile and Sprint. Despite an ocean of data showing that deal would reduce competition, harm sector pay, kill overall jobs, and result in higher prices, T-Mobile did everything in its power to kiss the Trump administration's ass[8] to gain merger approval. As a result, DOJ antitrust boss Makan Delrahim not only approved the deal without listening to experts, but used his personal phone and email accounts[9] to help lobby the deal to approval. That is what \"antitrust enforcement\" looks like at Donald Trump and Bill Barr's DOJ. It's just cronyism dressed up as serious adult policy. Now, apparently, we're to believe that Barr genuinely cares about \"big tech\" monopolies. The speed at which Barr is moving to shovel the inquiry into the spotlight for election season fodder has apparently upset many staffers at the DOJ, who say the rush has eroded the integrity of the investigation:\"Many career staff members in the antitrust division, including more than a dozen who were hired during the Trump administration, considered the evidence solid that Google's search and advertising businesses violated antitrust law. But some told associates that Mr. Barr was forcing them to come up with 'half-baked' cases so he could unveil a complaint by Sept. 30, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. Some lawyers who felt they needed more time laid out their concerns in the memo and left the case; about 20 lawyers remain on the team.\"Confirming what we all knew: The imminent antitrust case against Google from the Barr DOJ will be a political hit job. 'Some [career staff at DOJ] told associates that Mr. Barr was forcing them to come up with 'half-baked' cases so he could unveil a complaint by Sept. 30' pic.twitter.com/135phfuSFj[10] \u2014 Alec (@AlecStapp) September 3, 2020[11]There are clearly several goals here for Billy Barr. The first is to get the false[12] \"Conservatives are being unfairly targeted\" victimization complex in headlines ahead of the election. The second is to gain leverage over companies like Google as they ponder cracking down on Trump disinformation during an election season. The third is to aid telecom giants and folks like Rupert Murdoch[13] that have long coveted Silicon Valley's advertising revenue. None of these motivations have anything to do with a genuine \"antitrust inquiry,\" but we're going to spend the next month or two watching experts and journalists, who should know better, pretend otherwise. Some economists have pointed out that Barr's quest to use antitrust to police viewpoint diversity not only isn't particularly legally sound, it (like so much in Trumpland) flies in the face of everything Conservatives claimed they believed in over the last thirty years. For example, there was decades of right wing histrionics about the \"fairness doctrine\" -- a concern that's suddenly and mysteriously absent as Barr attempts to mutilate antitrust to support his quest to police \"viewpoint diversity\": The irony here is that conservatives (under Reagan) revoked the FCC's fairness doctrine, arguing it wasn't a legitimate public policy objective, but Barr wants to use the antitrust laws to enforce viewpoint diversity. Is it happy hour yet? pic.twitter .com/zEdBcKQe62[14]; \u2014 Hal Singer (@HalSinger) September 3, 2020[15]Google engages in plenty of dodgy behavior that requires intelligent, adult antitrust and regulatory scrutiny. But Iran Contra cover upper[16] Billy Barr, fresh off endless bouts of sycophancy, obvious falsehoods, and antitrust abuse, is probably the last guy capable of doing so with even a modicum of integrity.

One of the benefits of living for a while is you get to see how the story ends. It sometimes is a little depressing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you are over 40, you probably remember Robert Reich. He was Bill Clinton's Labor Secretary. He was a liberal among moderators in that administration, but a thoughtful and engaging person. His views weren't mainstream, but he certainly wasn't stupid or a hater.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, that was all before Trump. Like a lot of people in our ruling class, Robert Reich is now a completely different person. Just the other day, Reich wrote that the entire Trump presidency ought to be annulled. Not just ended prematurely, that's no longer radical enough, but erased from history, forgotten by decree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America must reset to the first Monday in November 2016 like none of it ever happened. We have to retroactively Photoshop an awful lot of pictures. But according to Reich, it's the only remedy.</p><p>Reality isn't tolerable, it should be banned. Reich was dead serious apparently. Keep in mind that 20 years ago, people considered him impressive. Some still do, which tells you a lot about the state of our intellectual leaders.</p><p>People still defend John Brennan too, even after he revealed on television that there's something seriously wrong with him. Officials who run the CIA ought to be sober and reasonable and even-tempered.</p><p>It's too powerful a job, with too little oversight, and too little accountability for a wacko. That would be dangerous for the country. And yet, over the weekend, there was Brennan once again charging a political opponent with a death penalty offense on the basis of zero evidence. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've been having a hell of a time here on this show trying to get my guest to say the word treason. I think the President is guilty of that and you used terms like that. You said, after Helsinki, it was nothing short of treasonous, which sounds to me like treasonous.</p><p>JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Treasonous is defined as a betrayal of trust, as well as aiding and abetting the enemy, and so that was the word that came to my mind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Things are accelerating fast. Trump is a racist, became Trump as a traitor, which has now become Trump as a non-person who must be erased from our collective memory. The Left is officially out of epithets. All that's left is physical harm. Who will be the first to call for that; it feels inevitable at this point.</p><p>Mark Stein is an author and columnist, and he joins us tonight. So what do you make of annulling the Trump presidency? Mark?</p><p>MARK STEYN, CONSERVATIVE CANADIAN AUTHOR AND POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think this is rather like the famous episode of Dallas, where after they wrote off an entire season as not having gone anywhere, and Pam Ewing stepped into the shower and there was Bobby Ewing who was supposed to be dead restored to life.</p><p>And Robert Reich seems to basically be proposing the same solution here, that Robert Reich will step into the shower and there will be President Hillary Clinton magnificently, which I hope that's not a bit too vivid for you, actually, as I was halfway through that image.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>It got a bit too vivid for me.</p><p>CARLSON: It's pretty vivid.</p><p>STEYN: But that does actually reflect the level of denial here. If you recall, going back to November 2016, we heard all this stuff about, \"Oh you know, America is unique in having the peaceful transfer of power,\" which I don't quite accept.</p><p>I mean generally speaking, when they get a new Prime Minister in Denmark, they don't throw the old one off the Parliament building or anything. There are other countries that have peaceful transfers of power.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>What's interesting here is that actually they can't accept that, and the denialism, which back a year-and-a-half ago, was just like with fake Newsweek covers showing the rightful President is now extending to former cabinet secretaries--</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>STEYN: --actually arguing for the erasure of the historical record and sort of resetting things to year zero. And actually that is harmful to the so- called peaceful transfer of power. And in that sense, Reich should be ashamed of himself.</p><p>CARLSON: So but that's kind of the key. Here you have a, not just some pundit on CNN or whatever, but here you have the former cabinet secretary and a well-regarded one, I mean I know him and he is a legitimately smart guy, and then a former CIA Director who is not a legitimately smart guy, but still a former CIA director.</p><p>I mean these are the pillars of the establishment. What is it macro question about Trump that drives the ruling class to say things like this, irrational things, crazy things?</p><p>STEYN: Well, I think there is a general presumption that it's not just that he won, but that he shouldn't have won.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: And therefore, because he shouldn't have won, he cannot really have won, and that's why you have to have this - basically, this dance of speculation.</p><p>Now, the treason accusation I think is actually - for a start, treason is giving aid and comfort to the enemy and actually Russia isn't the enemy at the moment. In fact, it was President Obama who mocked the very idea that Russia was even a sort of geopolitical rival of any kind.</p><p>So, we're not at war with Russia. The idea that that is actually possible of rising to the level of treason is faintly absurd. But I think it's the need to delegitimize. And a couple of cycles ago, that just meant mocking the other guy as being stupid and being unworthy of it, and all the rest of it. But it's actually gone on to something far more dangerous, which is actually delegitimizing the entire system.</p><p>When you have these major political figures saying that in effect the peaceful transfer of power is not possible, it can't possibly happen, therefore if it does happen, it's illegitimate, it's not so much this or that President that they are delegitimizing, but actually the very possibility of civilized self-government by free people.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, exactly.</p><p>So if the supposed adults on the left, Reich and Brennan and many others, are talking themselves into this frenzy, where each round becomes more extreme than last, how long before someone convinces himself that we need to storm the White -- we need to take action, like physical action here?</p><p>STEYN: Well, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: That's the terminus of this, right? How could it not be?</p><p>STEYN: Well, that's what makes this at some level ridiculous. I mean, for Bill Maher, just before that bit with Brennan, said that this was the third biggest crisis in the Republic -- in America's history.</p><p>The Revolutionary War and then the Civil War, and now this. Well, what are you doing about it, Bill? Yes, you're having another decaf Macchiato and finding another Canadian singer-songwriter to date. You're not pledging your life, your fortune, and your sacred honor, are you?</p><p>By the way, speaking of treason, if he is dating another Canadian singer- songwriter, that's like George Washington dating a United Empire Loyalist at the time of the Revolutionary War. So, he's not even serious about what he's saying, and that's what makes it decadent.</p><p>If even this is, as Bill Maher says, the third great crisis in American history or it's just something you guys are talking about over you're Sauvignon blanc for a giggle, but if they're not serious about it, they shouldn't be saying it, because somebody will take it seriously and that's the real danger.</p><p>CARLSON: Meanwhile, the middle class dies and nobody cares.</p><p>Mark Steyn, thank you very much for that. Great to see you.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So is it legal, is it even possible to annul a presidency? Julian Epstein is a Democrat and former counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, he joins us now.</p><p>So, Julian, I have noticed that the Left has become more than anything a religious movement and the use of the term annulment kind of proves it. If the presidency were annulled, as Reich suggests, would heretics who persist on acknowledging that Trump was once President, would they be punished?</p><p>JULIAN EPSTEIN, FORMER CHIEF DEMOCRATIC COUNSEL TO HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: It's a funny way to put the question. I don't think annulment is a serious argument, I don't think we're at the threshold of impeachment yet.</p><p>I think there is a tendency going on with Democrats right now, as there was during `98 Clinton impeachment for people in the opposition party to scream loud--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>EPSTEIN: --and to try to get an attention and to scream kind of louder than the other, because it helps with clicks on websites and it helps get them on television. But I don't think it's a serious argument.</p><p>CARLSON: But it's a different-</p><p>EPSTEIN: I think--</p><p>CARLSON: You and I had many debates during the impeachment--</p><p>EPSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: So we've known each other, and there were people who were claiming that Bill Clinton murdered someone at Mena airfield--</p><p>EPSTEIN: Precisely.</p><p>CARLSON: --you know, there was a lot of that stuff.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Vince Foster.</p><p>CARLSON: For sure.</p><p>But it wasn't called from former cabinet secretary level.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Dan Burton, Chairman of Congressional Committee.</p><p>CARLSON: I know you had a member of Congress who had all kinds of theories, but he was embarrassed to those theories. And when confronted with music, \"Oh I didn't really think that.\" Here you have pillars of the Democratic establishment saying on television things that are so far out in extreme, I'm not even sure how to respond to them.</p><p>Does that make you uncomfortable?</p><p>EPSTEIN: I don't know if he's a pillar of the Democratic establishment. I think he was a Labor Secretary under Clinton and I think he's a very good economist. I think he's a sharp thinker as an economist.</p><p>He is not a lawyer and I don't think he's a legal scholar, and I think he'd probably do better staying away from that. I think there were plenty of Republican members of Congress that said very extremist things during Clinton impeachment.</p><p>So, I think it happens on both sides. It's a natural thing that occurs when they are in the middle of this.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think anybody accused Bill Clinton of treason. So, here you have--</p><p>EPSTEIN: People accused Bill Clinton of murder.</p><p>CARLSON: But not in public. I mean they sort of whispered about it, but you didn't have for example a former head of the CIA. Does it bother you actually that John Brennan, who was complimented by Republicans by the way when he first got in, I'll concede that.</p><p>But he was the head of the CIA and now he's accusing a political opponent of a death-penalty offense with no evidence. Does it bother you that he ran the most powerful intelligence agency in the world?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, I think what Brennan was referring to, and people use treason in different ways, people sometimes use treason in a legal sense and sometimes people use treason in a more vernacular sense, and I think what Brennan was talking about was Trump continually cozying with Putin, who I think most Republicans would agree is an enemy of the United States. He's certainly an opponent of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I wouldn't agree on that. I don't know, if I would agree with that, I mean certainly - he's certainly no more bloodthirsty than lots of Middle Eastern tyrants.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I think if you look at what he's done with the airliners, I think if you were raised in Crimea and Syria, I don't think he's a guy that's looking up for US interests.</p><p>CARLSON: No, of course he's not looking out for US interest, and he would undermine US interests, so would a lot of the tyrants.</p><p>EPSTEIN: That's the point. So, look, I think you can go back and forth. We could go back, as we did in `98 and you can go back, you can find extremists on both sides who will say things that again I think are designed to get attention, get on television, get clickbait for the things- -</p><p>CARLSON: Sure, but then you also -- and what you're saying is absolutely right. But you also have people like, I don't know, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who on this show accused me of carrying water for Putin, because I had sincere questions about the evidence of collusion.</p><p>So you do have a kind of different level of extremism, I would argue, but it leads to this question, which is, if Trump is guilty of these crimes that virtually everyone on the Left alleges, then why are we just saying out loud there's an impeachment coming? Why are Democrats ashamed of that?</p><p>EPSTEIN: As to the question of extremism, there's a lot of extremism going on, on both sides, and I hope as a thoughtful guy that you are that you would denounce it, the extremism that's occurring on the Right. I denounce the extremism that's occurring on the Left.</p><p>I think the Robert Reich article was ridiculous. That's the first point.</p><p>The second point is, not everybody in the Left is saying Trump is guilty of crimes. I don't think there's proof yet that Trump is guilty of crimes. I think the question on campaign finance, as we were discussing before we came on air, I don't think that reaches an impeachable offense and I think it's questionable as whether it reaches a legal offense because of the ambiguity of the campaign finance laws.</p><p>We can talk about that more--</p><p>CARLSON: No, of course I agree.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I think the question on collusion rests entirely on whether Trump had advanced knowledge of any illegal activity that was connected to Russian hacking. That has not been proven yet. So, this Democrat is not alleging a crime as it involves Donald Trump.</p><p>CARLSON: But you know as well as I the pressure, and the polls bear this out, the pressure from Democratic voters to impeach, if Democrats retake the house, will be so overwhelming that what Speaker could look at the people who just put him or her in that position and say, \"You know, we're not impeaching.\" Can they resist--</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well I was going to say, one of the reasons that I think there's so much pressure around these investigations is how badly the Trump White House has handled the Russian investigation matter.</p><p>It looks at every turn that they are trying to cover up crimes, whether it is the firing, the threatened firings, the promises of pardons, would be all of the flipping of the witnesses, the accountant has flipped on the President, his attorney has flipped on the President, campaign manager, the poor way and--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: Julian, is looking guilty the same as being guilty?</p><p>EPSTEIN: No it's not. No, Tucker, not in a legal world, but in a political way, you know as well as I do, that the actions of this White House have looked guilty from the beginning, have made them look guilty. It doesn't mean that they're guilty in a legal sense, but it has been handled horribly.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Now, the Democrats, where the Democrats ought to be and what I would argue and I've spoken to Democrats on the Hill, is they should not be coming to legal conclusions or conclusions about impeachment of this.</p><p>CARLSON: But can they resist impeachment?</p><p>EPSTEIN: What they should be--</p><p>CARLSON: Can they -- their voters want it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: If you are smart - well, this is the problem with the polarized politics as we play to the extreme bases. And Republicans do this, I think I would argue more so than Democrats do, but we can disagree about that.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't see that at all.</p><p>EPSTEIN: We can disagree about that. But if Democrats were smart, they would tell the base that we're not going to kind of kowtow to the impulses that may make you feel better emotionally. We're going to do what you and I would probably agree ought to be done here.</p><p>CARLSON: (LAUGHTER)</p><p>EPSTEIN: Listen to the point. Listen to the--</p><p>CARLSON: If you can find one Democratic leader - look, I agree with you, of course.</p><p>EPSTEIN: It's the democratic leadership.</p><p>CARLSON: If you can find one Democratic leader with the huevos to say something like that on television, I'll give you $20.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, I think that's basically what the Democrats are saying, in other words, and what the Democrats ought to be saying, Tucker, is--</p><p>CARLSON: We're almost out of time.</p><p>EPSTEIN: --we are not going to make conclusions about impeachment, we're not going to make conclusions for our prosecution, we want facts to come out, we want to protect the Independent Counsel and all the other investigations that are under way. We should protect the integrity of the investigation--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, then they should tell the truth</p><p>EPSTEIN: --and allow the facts to come out.</p><p>CARLSON: Then they should tell the treason folks to shut up.</p><p>EPSTEIN: All right. And you ought to be there and I ought to be there, and we had to say, let's make a decision--</p><p>CARLSON: I've been saying that since day one totally, it's been two years.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Let's make a decision. Are you for the Republican plan, the Senate Bipartisan Republican plan, that protects the special counsel (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --for running the government and like rescuing the middle class from oblivion, that was the whole point of this.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, what about the Grassley bill that would protect this special account -- special counsel.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh I don't know, I don't think we should have any special counsels of any kind, it's unaccountable to the voters. We have mechanisms.</p><p>EPSTEIN: But now that there is an investigation, do you think the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CARLSON: I just want it to go away and think about what-</p><p>EPSTEIN: (LAUGHTER)</p><p>CARLSON: No, I'm serious, and think about why 70,000 people died of drug ODs last year, there's like real stuff going on.</p><p>EPSTEIN: But you just said that you think the integrity of the investigation ought to be protected with all the facts on the table.</p><p>CARLSON: All right. I think, it's just the whole thing is so stupid, I've run out of patience for it, but that's not why I asked you to come on tonight.</p><p>Julian, thank you very much.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Multiple investigations into Russia's interference in our election still haven't proved that Moscow colluded with Trump. So, how long can an investigation that has turned up no actual evidence continue; that's ahead.</p><p>We also have the latest on the recent news surrounding the death of Senator John McCain and the political furor it touched off in Washington today. Stay tuned.</p><p>Senator John McCain, who passed away this weekend at the age of 81, was a man of florid passions. He loved what he loved and he hated what he hated. High atop his dislike list was Donald Trump.</p><p>McCain despised Trump. Trump for his part despised McCain right back. And to their credit, neither man ever pretended otherwise. McCain attacked Trump almost until his final day. After McCain died, Trump at first could barely bring himself to mourn. He sent a brief tweet and then raised the white house flags too soon for many critics.</p><p>Now, the root of this dispute between Senator McCain and the president is murky; each side has a different story. What's clear though is where the press stands in this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROOKE BALDWIN, HOST, CNN NEWSROOM: To watch the President with President Kenyatta of Kenya twice, you know, not saying anything about this hero, this lion of a man, I'm so -- it's despicable, it's despicable.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The President who repeatedly refused to say anything about a war hero, despite being asked today again and again and again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: How dare he? Well, there's been a lot of this today, almost exclusively from the Left. On one level, it's amusing because these are the very same people of course who called John McCain a racist ten years ago for daring to run against the Anointed One.</p><p>A month before that election in 2008, Congressman John Lewis of Georgia compared John McCain to George Wallace, and then tried to connect him to the 1963 Birmingham church bombings, if you could imagine.</p><p>Fast forward to this weekend, Lewis described McCain probably the most hawkish Senator in American history as, \"A warrior for peace. He will be deeply missed by people all around the world.\" In other words, never mind the racist stuff, it was never personal.</p><p>For the Left, everything is about political expedience, even obituaries. More troubling though, more interesting too, is the claim you've just heard that it's, \"despicable not to mourn Senator McCain in a certain way.\" Not just impolite, but immoral and forbidden.</p><p>When people in authority - people with TV shows for example decide that they can dictate what emotions you're allowed to feel, you should worry. McCain knew that well. He spent five and a half years as a captive in a society just like that, and he spent the rest of his life fighting against it.</p><p>He hated authoritarians above all. John McCain was a complicated person, but a great man. If you really want to honor his memory, you ought to let people make up their own minds about what they think.</p><p>Well, Justice Department official Bruce Ohr played a central role in the Obama administration's targeting and spying on the Trump campaign, feeding information from Christopher Steele to his contacts at the FBI.</p><p>Tomorrow, we're going to learn more because he is set to testify behind closed doors to Congress. Who is Bruce Ohr, the Washington Examiner's Byron York has been covering this story from the very beginning, and as we think one of the most trustworthy sources on it.</p><p>So, Byron, I read The New York Times every day because I'm paid to, and I just read a piece saying that Bruce Ohr was an insignificant figure at the Justice Department. No one ever heard of him, don't pay attention to Bruce Ohr. All of a sudden, he emerges as a central figure in this story. What am I to make?</p><p>BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, it read almost like a defense brief on the eve of his testimony. But Bruce Ohr was the fourth ranking official in the Obama Justice Department.</p><p>And one of the big questions that investigators in Congress have tried to find out about the dossier was how high did knowledge of the dossier go in the Justice Department? Was it a few guys in the FBI, did people above that know--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YORK: --and above that. And so, you've gotten to Bruce Ohr. Now, if the number four knew, did the number three, did the number two know, and did the Attorney General know? That's -- those are probably some of the questions that Ohr will be asked, unfortunately behind closed doors tomorrow.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a little bit striking that you said that the piece about Bruce Ohr in The New York Times read like a defense brief. The story here is not just about President Trump and whatever crimes he's alleged to have committed. The story is about the Obama administration, and whether or not one administration spied on an opposing political campaign using our intel agencies.</p><p>Why wouldn't the press be anxious to know more about that, since it sets a pretty troubling precedent for future administrations?</p><p>YORK: Well, it does. And the whole idea is what was the Obama administration doing with Christopher Steele, that former British spy, who was hired by the Clinton campaign and the DNC to search for dirt in Russia on Donald Trump? What was the Justice Department doing about that?</p><p>And one of the most fascinating aspects of all this, which Ohr will be asked about, is Steele was dying to get negative information about Trump into the press before the election, so it could affect the election. And he was not supposed to talk to the press, but he did.</p><p>CARLSON: By his own admission, by the way, this is not something you're assuming.</p><p>YORK: Correct, and this is known for as a fact. He did it in September and in October of 2016, right before the election. So, the FBI -- this is really, really against the rules for FBI sources. So, they terminated him as a source, but they wanted to keep using him.</p><p>So, what they did in the months after the election, all the way up to at least May of 2017, was have Bruce Ohr to Christopher Steele, and then come back to the FBI and tell the FBI what Steele told him.</p><p>And the FBI, by the way, made what are called 302 reports--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YORK: --which is a write-up notes of interviews. They made them for each one of these things. And we don't know what they are, because the Justice Department will not let Congress have them; they've let some members of Congress read them.</p><p>And all of these are questions that the Congress is going to want to know like, what did Christopher steel tell you.</p><p>CARLSON: And I think the rest of us have a right to know.</p><p>YORK: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: We have a right to trust our government.</p><p>Byron York, great to see you, thank you for that.</p><p>YORK: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, liberals have turned to corporations to censor people they disagree with. That's accelerating quickly. Where will it end? We're going to speak with a knowledgeable source on that next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the Left doesn't like, at least in government. But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.</p><p>The Left have wised up to this. If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it, the social media giants, and they are. So far, the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.</p><p>But, are we smart to think censorship will stop with him? Mark Penn is a former advisor to Bill Clinton, he is a liberal who still believes in the free exchange of ideas, and he joins us tonight. So thank you Mark for coming on.</p><p>So, I'm fascinated by the Alex Jones story, because it was Alex Jones. Almost no conservatives rose to his defense, because the idea was, well Alex Jones, yuck. But it's not really about Alex Jones, is it? It's about the idea that companies can make it impossible for your voice to be heard. Is that a precedent we should be comfortable with?</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISOR TO BILL CLINTON: Well I really think you have to be worried about big tech becoming Big Brother.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PENN: Because this used to be neutral platforms that said we're open to free expression, that's our core value, and now they've said, well not so much. With particularly Facebook hiring 10,000 new sensors on top of another 10,000, and having roving censoring bots looking for content.</p><p>Look, I never read Alex Jones, but here's somebody with millions of followers, publicly accountable for his speech, operating within Supreme Court standards, yanked from the media. That's a surprise to me, that says that these platforms are no longer as open as they presented themselves to be.</p><p>CARLSON: And it's not just him, there are many like him who've been yanked, lesser-known but still, so this has political implications. You ran and managed campaigns for so long, this must have occurred.</p><p>A lot of our political debate takes place on social media platforms, so if they clamp down on one side of the debate, why wouldn't that influence in elections outcome?</p><p>PENN: Well obviously, it could have a big influence on elections, increasingly because where people turn for their news is that they look at the news feeds that are run by the major social media companies. And so, they're more powerful than any TV station, more powerful than Fox.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, they are.</p><p>PENN: Because of the amount of time that people spend, and it's a funnel. So, if you're not at the top, you don't get seen. And so, in the past, they had some neutral ways of doing this. But now they've increasingly applied still more mysterious algorithms plus individual sensors.</p><p>And remember, they are private platforms they say, so they're not actually subject to the First Amendment, unless we get some legislation here that says free speech is an Internet right.</p><p>CARLSON: It's totally meaningless. If I own a toll road, I can't say anyone of a certain race can drive on my toll road. And so they're not actually fully private companies, we have a public interest I would say in keeping them free and open. Why aren't, if you cared about the integrity of our elections, why isn't Congress acting?</p><p>PENN: I don't know why Congress isn't acting. Part of it is because, to stand up to a social media company means you could have five million people on your doorstep the next day. So, I think there's been a lot of intimidation in Congress instead of bipartisan agreement that, hey, we cannot have this kind of regulation of speech where whoever runs one of the big platforms can pick out speech, which speech goes and which piece doesn't.</p><p>Not when they've been exempted from the libel laws, when they've been set up as open platforms, and they now become media companies instead. And that's exactly what's happened. They've become media companies that take ads on the media that they run, and they have editors and algorithms and bots that run it.</p><p>CARLSON: I really believe that ten years from now this segment, what you just said, will be seen as prescient. I mean I think it's a big story that's being ignored by virtually everyone for reasons I don't fully understand. Maybe you're right, it's cowardice, but it shouldn't be.</p><p>Mark Penn, thank you for that.</p><p>PENN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: The Chinese government plans to rank all 1.4 billion of its citizens according to their political reliability. That's pretty great. Up next, details.</p><p>CARLSON: Nearly one out of every five human beings on the planet lives in China; that's almost 1.4 billion people total. To give you some sense of scale, the United States has less than 0.4 billion total. That's a lot of people.</p><p>Now, the Communist Chinese government wants to give every single one of these people a ranking. Chinese officials plan to use technology to collect and analyze people for their new social credit system, which will then allow the government to administer punishment and of course hand out rewards, the carrot and the stick, based on good and bad behavior.</p><p>Political obedience, of course, will be central to this. It's basically naughty and nice, but there's no Santa in this calculation. What does this mean and could it come here? Gordon Chang is author of The Coming Collapse of China and he joins us. Gordon, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>So, is -- I mean this is such a dystopian vision that a government could exert this level of social control over a population this large. It's hard to believe this could happen. Is this actually going to happen?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA: Well, it certainly is happening right now. What we have in China is that there's so many people there, of course, the government wants to control them. And so, what they're doing is they're collecting data. They're collecting data from 600 million cameras that they'll have in place.</p><p>In 2020, they're going to have you know traffic checks, all the rest of it. This is being rolled out and it's being rolled out very quickly. So for instance, you've got people who are not allowed to board planes and trains because their social credit score is far too low.</p><p>CARLSON: So this is the kind of thing, since our ruling class pays such close attention to human rights abuses abroad and we're always worried about Myanmar and what are they doing to journalists in Moscow, I mean this seems like a glaring civil rights violation -- human rights violation. Why do we never hear anything about it from the self-appointed moral watchdogs atop our society?</p><p>CHANG: That's a great question and I actually don't know the answer for it because this is the biggest human rights abuse in the world today. And we have China doing -- putting people basically into internment camps in northwestern China, one million, people this is a crime against humanity. We don't hear about that either. And the thing that we -- I think we will hear about it, is when they roll out this system for foreigners. So we know that the Chinese government is tracking Chinese in the United States; they are actually contacting people in the US. This is just going to get worse and worse until the US government pushes back.</p><p>CARLSON: What about the tech companies, our tech companies, that exert so much social control over our society? Have they issued an unequivocal statement against this, or do we suspect they sympathize with this idea?</p><p>CHANG: I think they probably sympathize because they sold much of the technology to the Chinese that they've used, incorporated into their system. Now of course, the Chinese have been able to improve what they've gotten, but nonetheless they would not be anywhere near their level of perfection if it weren't for US and other Western companies.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, do we send them torture equipment too for political prisoners? I mean, what -- at some point, can a company do something that's so morally repulsive that there's an outcry about it? I mean the idea that American tech companies are abetting this garbage is unbelievable.</p><p>CHANG: It is unbelievable and also, we've got American companies in Shenyang which is that region in northwestern China where you have, you know, the attempt to eradicate the Muslim religion. Well, you know, we have US companies with big operations in Shenyang and you know, they shouldn't be in China anyway. But nonetheless, to be at the site of a human rights violation which is the worst in the world, it just -- it's just indescribable as you put it.</p><p>CARLSON: I'll keep that in mind next time the Google guys want to lecture me about my moral shortcomings. Gordon Chang, thank you very much. Great to see you.</p><p>CHANG: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: A professor, a feminist at an overrated and very expensive Northeastern College, says that \"Women have every right to hate men, all men, because men have done women wrong, all women by all men.\" Obviously demented and yet someone who agrees has been located and will join us next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, here's the non-shocking story of the week. The Chair of the Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Department in Northeastern University feels what she calls legitimate rage against men, all men, and believes that it \"makes sense for women to have rage against a group of people that has systematically abused them,\" she said non grammatically. In The Washington Post Opinions piece, the professor demanded that men stop running for political office, said men shouldn't be in charge of anything anyway after all, she wrote, we have every right to hate you.</p><p>Jason Nichols is a professor at the University of Maryland and he joins us. Professor, great to see.</p><p>JASON NICHOLS, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: Great to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is it that we turn our children over to the care of the least happy, least mentally stable, least impressive people in our society? Is there anyone unhappier than this woman do you think in America?</p><p>NICHOLS: Well, look, I mean first of all, she has the right to say what she.</p><p>CARLSON: For sure she does and I'll defend it.</p><p>NICHOLS: .and she has, you know, these -- we have a big attack on academic freedom. We have to stand up for people to have the right to say certain things, even if we disagree with them now, I think lot of what she is saying is actually.</p><p>CARLSON: If I was taking her class and I took some Women's Studies courses in college because I wanted an easy grade, and they're so dumb. It's not hard as long as you hate yourself.</p><p>NICHOLS: Come to Maryland (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CARLSON: Sure. So, let me be honest, if I stood up and said, you know, I am a man and how dare you attack all men on a collective basis, how do you think I would do in her class?</p><p>NICHOLS: I think you would do fine.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, amazing (ph).</p><p>NICHOLS: The reason being show me her evaluations, are students out there saying Professor Walters, I believe her name is, Professor Walters treated (ph) mystery to me because.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know. The whole system (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>NICHOLS: So they knew, we (ph) getting into high pathetic-ness.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, we are. But if she stood up and said, I dislike any -- fill in the blank some ethnic group, Polynesians. I was mugged by a Polynesian; I hate them. I've every right to hate them. If you're a Polynesian kid, I think you would have a right to say, \"Gee, can I be treated fairly in this class?</p><p>NICHOLS: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: That's a reasonable.</p><p>NICHOLS: But, again that's - again, that's apples and oranges. You know that men are the people who are in power. When we look at Fortune 500 companies, 4.5% of Fortune 500 companies have women CEOs,</p><p>CARLSON: What does that mean (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>NICHOLS: And the women are the majority.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Head of the most powerful country in Europe is a woman. I mean, I guess that the point actually that I would make.</p><p>NICHOLS: And we've never had a female leader.</p><p>CARLSON: .is that you can't -- you can't and you shouldn't ever make collective judgments about people on the basis of things they can't control.</p><p>NICHOLS: Yes. So, but what is the judgment that she's making, she's saying that patriarchy exists, that women are oppressed by men. Those things are true.</p><p>CARLSON: But not all women are oppressed by men; that's a lie. And it's also a sign of mental illness to really believe.</p><p>NICHOLS: So you don't believe that.</p><p>CARLSON: .that every woman is oppressed by every man. That's so demented. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>NICHOLS: So you don't -- no one ever said that every woman was oppressed by every man.</p><p>CARLSON: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>NICHOLS: She's saying that patriarchy is a system that has existed for hundreds of years in which women are suppressed. And again, I can give you many examples not only in our society, but in societies.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. It's very hard for me not to keep on with the invective because she's so dumb that it shocks me she could teach in a college, OK. But, I'll set that aside and ask if you believe that, how can you occupy a paying job in a university that a woman should be sitting in?</p><p>NICHOLS: Well, again, I think that -- I didn't agree with everything (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CARLSON: If you want to fight (ph), look.</p><p>NICHOLS: I think there are ways to fight patriarchy.</p><p>CARLSON: How about resigning? Give your job to woman.</p><p>NICHOLS: .where you don't have to resign and give jobs.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't that be pretty effective?</p><p>NICHOLS: I think one of the effective ways to do it is to recognize and be willing to accept female leadership. That's what she's really saying.</p><p>CARLSON: No, I think what she's really saying is you should resign.</p><p>NICHOLS: I don't think that's what she is saying.</p><p>CARLSON: .if patriarchy is real and give your job to a woman.</p><p>NICHOLS: I don't think that that's what she said and the argument should be systemic. That's where I actually had an issue with the way it was presented.</p><p>CARLSON: Not every man is the same, just like every member of any ethnic group is what I'm saying.</p><p>NICHOLS: But every man needs to recognize women and be open to female leadership which many men are not and that's the problem.</p><p>CARLSON: Women should be open to treating men as individuals and not as a group.</p><p>NICHOLS: Yes, I think that that has happened historically. But right now, we need for men to be open to female leadership.</p><p>CARLSON: OK, when you resign, call me. Professor, good to (ph) see you.</p><p>NICHOLS: Yes, I'll call you for a job.</p><p>CARLSON: Greg Gutfeld thinks our robot overlords are coming and he applauds their arrival. He's here next to explain.</p><p>CARLSON: Science fiction is quickly becoming reality in Russia, not for the first time. One Russian company has unveiled a 13-foot 5-ton bulletproof robot. It can't move yet but the Russians say they expect eventually they'll be able to use its giant claws to perform battlefield tasks and hold weapons.</p><p>Meanwhile in San Francisco, a restaurant is serving robot-made burgers but are today's robot chefs tomorrow's robot overlords? That's the concern. Greg Gutfeld is of course the co-host of The Five, author of The Gutfeld Monologues: Classic Rants from the Five, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>I'm very concerned about our coming robot overlords. Should I?</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, HOST OF THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW AND CO-HOST OF THE FIVE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Embrace it. Number one, what you just saw in Russia is not a robot; it's a car made of wood with arms and legs. That is it.</p><p>CARLSON: That's probably true.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is; it is. It's not going anywhere. There's no video. It's kind of sad. I feel bad for him. Yakov Smirnoff is probably inside that car right now telling jokes. Number two, I'm all for the robots overtaking the world but not in our food service industry, because what's going to happen is you're going to get a whole new organic movement. Organic is natural foods. Now people will have organic restaurants where people will serve it and people will cook it; that will be deemed organic.</p><p>And then there will be a fight between robots and humans and we will lose. And just like on every other planet, Tucker, while there are -- we never hear from other planets because they're all run by robots.</p><p>CARLSON: That - OK. That doesn't actually make me feel better though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, it shouldn't. It should - well, be like me, I'm like Benedict Arnold. I'm a traitor to the robots. I am behind the robot take -- for example, there are studies that show that judges deny or -- deny parole based on their appetite. We don't need to replace chefs; we need to replace judges with robots, and then life would be better.</p><p>By the way, everything when you put a robot before anything, it makes it better. Robot dogs are better, robot answer better, robot Tucker would be better than Tucker, but by a little (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: I feel threatened. I mean I'm with you on the first part. I do welcome our new insect overlords and look forward to seeing their sugar caves. But I don't know why the rest of us sit back passively and allow even the potential for technology to start giving us orders when we're supposed to be in charge of technology?</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, the good news is that we could always unplug them and they all have a battery. But here's the thing, we're not because we're going to come to rely on them the same way we rely on our phones. Essentially, we've already implanted technology into our bodies. It's our phone which is connected to our hand which is now basically an external drive for our brain, right?</p><p>We carry this around. It's got everything we could ever need in the world from, you know, every book you ever want to read. That's your external drive. Robots are just going to take care of us and they're going to be awesome, Tucker. You're going to love it. It's going to be great. But you don't want them to cook your food; you want humans.</p><p>CARLSON: I just read your book and in the acknowledgments, you do not mention the robot who wrote it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. Well, you know what, he's a ghost robot writer. He is a robot ghost.</p><p>CARLSON: That's the beauty of robots; they don't need credit. They don't need credit; now you're winning me over.</p><p>GUTFELD: You don't have to pay them. They don't have bathroom breaks. They don't have smoke breaks. They don't poop. They're perfect; I'm telling you that's why you need robot judges. No emotion, Tucker. What's the worst thing we're seeing right now, emotion replacing thought, right?</p><p>CARLSON: It's true.</p><p>GUTFELD: And so, if you have a robot as a judge, there's no emotion. It's perfect. Robots should be making all of our decisions while we kick back and eat the glorious, glorious food created by loving people.</p><p>CARLSON: That's why I hate robots because they're more impressive than I am.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Gutfeld, also more impressive. Great to see you, thank you.</p><p>GUTFELD: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for us tonight. Sadly, another hour gone. Tune in every night, including tomorrow at 8 PM to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink, which are almost overwhelming right now. You ought to pledge to fight back; that's the only way it will stop. In the meantime, good night from Washington. Guess who's next? Sean Hannity.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, HOST, THE SEAN HANNITY SHOW: I'm waiting.</p><p>CARLSON: Three minutes or seconds early.</p><p>HANNITY: Tucker, good to see you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018082701cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T4K-H0S1-JB20-G1B5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7321\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 27, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Robert Reich</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John McCain</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bruce Ohr</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Suzanna Danuta Walters</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robot</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Treason</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkFENEM0QTc5OTFBNEE2N0JDODU1QzlBNUExMDc0NzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0IzNkEwNUM1QThENDQ2MjkwOEFGRjQxODlBMDJFNzY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

The bill, awaiting <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>signature, was hailed by anti-sex-trafficking groups and law enforcement as an important step in fighting online prostitution of teenagers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senators passed the bill 97 to 2, without amendments, meaning it can be immediately signed into law by the president. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that Trump applauded the passage of the bill, said it was \"an important step forward,\" and that the president looked forward to putting \"an end to this scourge,\" but she did not explicitly say he would sign the bill. Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) were the only \"no\" votes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bill\u00a0would amend the Communications Decency Act, which websites such as Backpage.com have invoked as immunity from criminal and civil actions when victims of online sex trafficking have tried to stop them from hosting ads for male and female sex workers, some of whom are teenagers. The act was passed in 1996, as the Internet was\u00a0just evolving.</p><p>The 1996 measure\u00a0protects website operators from content posted by third parties, so long as the operators have no involvement in the content, and\u00a0it is credited with enabling the Internet to flourish without excessive regulation or legal liability for small start-ups. When young women who had been prostituted on Backpage tried to sue the website, federal appeals courts in Chicago and Boston specifically cited the Communications Decency Act's Section 230 as precluding the women from holding the websites liable.</p><p>Those rulings spurred the move to amend the law. In Chicago, a 16-year-old girl was slain by a customer who had found her on Backpage in 2016. In Washington state, a 15-year-old girl was trafficked on Backpage for more than three months before being rescued. But the mothers of both girls faced uphill legal battles against Backpage, so both mothers gave emotional testimony to Congress in support of amending Section 230 to enable prosecution of the websites themselves.</p><p>\"It is a good day for America,\" said Nacole S., the mother of the Washington girl, whose last name is being withheld to protect the girl's identity. \"The narrow focus of this bill corrects Section 230 and keeps with the original intent of Internet freedom and holds bad actors accountable for trafficking our children. This means everything to our family, and it is the fulfillment of a promise to our daughter to hold those [actors] accountable.\"</p><p>Linda Smith, founder of Shared Hope International, an anti-sex-trafficking group, said she began providing research to Congress in 2007 about online sex trafficking but that the information wasn't taken seriously. \"We were all waking up,\" Smith said. \"Congress is not much different from the rest of the country. People are recognizing that these children are victims of crime and deserve justice. That vote is, I think, historic.\"</p><p>A Senate subcommittee investigated Backpage and found that it was involved in editing prostitution ads on its site to remove references to underage girls, while allowing the ads to stay on the site. A Washington Post investigation last year revealed that Backpage representatives actively solicited ads from prostitutes who advertised on other sites and created ads for them on Backpage. Legislation then launched in the House and Senate to amend Section 230, specifying that it did not indemnify websites from facilitating sex trafficking.</p><p>A hybrid version of those bills emerged from the House, under Rep. Ann Wagner's (R-Mo.) proposed law titled\u00a0\"Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017,\" or \"FOSTA,\" and passed last month. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) championed a similar bill in the Senate and spoke repeatedly on the chamber floor in recent days about the need for it to stop or slow down online sex trafficking.</p><p>Large tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, initially declared their opposition to the bills, saying they would create massive liability for content they simply couldn't monitor. But law enforcement and anti-human trafficking groups waged an effective campaign in support of the bills, and Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg announced her support for the bill, as did other large tech companies.</p><p>\"This is legislation that is overdue in my view,\" Portman said on the floor Wednesday. \"And it's required. The courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that...They welcomed us to pass this legislation to give these families the justice they deserve and to give our prosecutors the ability to go after them.\"</p><p>The key section of \"FOSTA\"\u00a0clarifies that Section 230 shall not impair prosecution of anyone violating federal sex trafficking laws or limit civil lawsuits, and in the sex trafficking law defines \"participation in a venture\" as anyone \"knowingly assisting, supporting or facilitating a violation\" of the law. \"Now,\" said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), \"all the prosecutors in the country can go after anyone who knowingly facilitates sex trafficking online.\"</p><p>Among the sex ads posted on Backpage.com are those for underage boys and girls, authorities and advocacy groups say. The National Association of Attorneys General has described Backpage as a \"hub\" of human trafficking, which involves children or adults who are forced or coerced into prostitution. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said that 73 percent of the 10,000 child sex trafficking reports it receives from the public each year involve ads on Backpage. Recently, Backpage's ads have begun omitting any copy with their offers of adult services, instead showing only photographs of the purported escorts.</p><p>Still, there was opposition to the bill. Wyden, one of the original sponsors of Section 230 in 1996, said the Justice Department already could prosecute Backpage for the violations revealed by the Senate investigation. He said the bill would be a bonanza for trial lawyers, who could sue websites for content they weren't aware of, and \"dismantle the legal framework\u00a0that's given the United States the position it holds as a tech-economy superpower.\" Wyden said big tech companies ultimately supported the bill because \"it rolls up the ladder in the tech world, leaving the established giants alone at the top\" and smaller companies susceptible to punishing lawsuits.</p><p>\"This bill will be something the Senate will deeply regret,\" Wyden said.</p><p>IBM reiterated its support for the bill shortly after the vote, issuing a statement which said it \"looks forward to seeing FOSTA signed quickly into law,\" and that \"those who knowingly help\u00a0sex traffickers\u00a0use the\u00a0internet to commit despicable crimes\u00a0are closer than ever before to being held accountable.</p><p>Some who study or work with sex workers said the bill would not impact the problem of online sex trafficking of minors, and make it harder to find victims. Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco, author of the book \"Hidden in Plain Sight: America's Slaves of the New Millennium,\" said\u00a0\"the justification for this legislation rests on the misleading idea that individual websites facilitate child sex trafficking, when in reality the Internet as whole has brought this practice out of the shadows and proliferated it.\u00a0Once signed into law, FOSTA will likely be used to go after previously vilified websites, like Backpage.com and Craigslist.org, despite the fact that those platforms have been used as\u00a0critical tools\u00a0for law enforcement and facilitate the\u00a0rescues of victims and arrests of offenders. Meanwhile, other websites that are also used by sex traffickers, like Facebook, will continue business as usual.\"</p><p>But others heralded the bill's passage. John M. Simpson of Consumer Watchdog said FOSTA was \"a major step forward not only for families of children who were trafficked, but for everyone who cares about holding tech giants accountable to the rule of law. This is a chink in the teflon of Google and Facebook's shield of immunity,\" and force them to reevaluate their \"duties to police their platforms\"</p><p>Yiota Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said when the bill is enacted, \"not only will it untie the hands of every state Attorney General's office across the country to enter the fight against online sex trafficking, but it will open the door for private attorneys to serve as a voice for individual survivors in civil lawsuits against their online traffickers. \u00a0Most importantly, this bill creates a bright line to root out bad actors online who knowingly participate in the trafficking of children and vulnerable adults while it continues the CDA's protection of online entities that engage in voluntary good faith efforts to remove trafficking and sexually exploitative content online.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-2d0853e98e384dfbba4a7b8ad778b1fc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXM-B871-JB4M-V11T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1487\"/><timeReceived>8:38 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>Communications Decency Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZFRThGRDIyOERDNDRBNzlCRUMzNkNBMDIzRDU5NTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkEyQUE3Q0ZGNTBBNDZBQkI4Qjg5MjlFREFGQjZENDM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., could offer an amendment to keep the Earn It Act from undermining encryption for millions of Americans, encryption advocates said in interviews about Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee markup (see 2006250067). A victims advocate urged the committee to advance the bill, contending government action is the only way to get Big Tech to respond to rampant child exploitation.</p><p>Tech companies are interested only in blocking legislation and regulation, said National Center on Sexual Exploitation General Counsel Benjamin Bull. He urged industry to work with Blumenthal and Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in shaping the bill rather than fighting it. The industry's complacency left Congress no choice, he argued, saying child predators and traffickers run rampant on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.</p><p>Computer and Communications Industry Association President Matt Schruers said the Earn it Act will force companies to weaken industry-standard security and encryption measures. It's also problematic because of its impact on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, allowing the government to manage speech on platforms, he said. The Internet Association cited a recent blog post raising concerns the Earn It Act would allow criminal defendants in child exploitation cases to suppress evidence with Fourth Amendment arguments.</p><p>Blumenthal said he might seek to clarify encryption aspects of the bill. Graham said he wants to keep the encryption debate separate. Fixing the encryption aspects might be possible, but that's not the only issue with the bill, Schruers said. CCIA also opposes a bill from Graham and Republicans that would let police lawfully access encrypted data (see 2006240064). To convenience law enforcement, it would make products and phones less safe, Schruers said: Any time companies are mandated to keep keys under doormats, it's an invitation for bad actors to find those keys.</p><p>There's nothing Blumenthal could do to clarify the Earn It Act to avoid weakening encryption, said New America's Open Technology Institute Senior Policy Analyst Andi Wilson Thompson. OTI doesn't support Graham's encryption bill either, she said: It's impossible to guarantee police access to encrypted communications without harming user security, she said, and the Earn It Act is another effort by DOJ to weaken encryption.</p><p>Access Now opposes both bills, said Legislative Manager Jennifer Brody. Assigning a government commission to decide how Section 230 applies to companies will have a chilling impact on speech and content moderation, she said of the Earn It Act. Brody agreed with the general sentiment of a bill from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., that would direct $5 billion for investigations and resources about online child abuse (see 2005060015).</p><p>The National Center on Sexual Exploitation also supports Wyden's bill, but increasing investigatory resources doesn't solve the whole problem, Bull said. Internet regulation is the only way to resolve child exploitation issues, he said, because Big Tech is unwilling to act. Congress is either going to regulate, or FTC and DOJ enforcers are going to intervene with antitrust cases, he said.</p><p>Legislators need to account for victims of stalking and harassment when revisiting Section 230, said Future of Privacy Forum Vice President-Policy John Verdi. If there's an area of improvement, it starts with individuals who have been victimized, he said. FPF hasn't taken a position on the Earn It Act or Graham's encryption bill.

The Justice Department announced this summer a federal antitrust review into \u201cmarket-leading online platforms,\u201d and the Federal Trade Commission has launched its own investigation into the practices of big tech companies. </p><p>State attorneys general have also undertaken their own efforts to probe the titans of Silicon Valley, who have been accused of having outsized dominance.</p><p>But Gates said tech companies are \u201cbehaving totally legally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing a lot of innovative things,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gates\u2019 Microsoft was embroiled in an antitrust battle with the Justice Department and a coalition of state attorneys general in the late 1990s over allegations it illegally attempted to monopolize the market for internet browsers by bundling its browser, Internet Explorer, with Windows.</p><p>A federal district court ruled against Microsoft in the case and ordered the company be broken up into two, but a federal appeals court overturned the ruling in 2001. Microsoft remains as one company today.</p><p>Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren has been a vocal proponent of breaking up big tech companies and has detailed a plan for how to do so.

Chamando  a Apple e outros gigantes da tecnologia , Gates argumenta que as empresas est\u00e3o convidando a interven\u00e7\u00e3o governamental ao demonstrar a arrog\u00e2ncia, dizendo que precisam ser  cuidadoso que n\u00e3o est\u00e3o tentando pensar que sua vis\u00e3o \u00e9 mais importante do que a vis\u00e3o do governo ou governo capaz de funcionar em algumas \u00e1reas-chave  .</p><p>Quando Axios perguntou a Gates por exemplo, ele disse:  o entusiasmo por tornar as transa\u00e7\u00f5es financeiras an\u00f4nimas e invis\u00edveis, e sua vis\u00e3o de que at\u00e9 mesmo uma comunica\u00e7\u00e3o clara do criminoso assassino em massa nunca deveria estar dispon\u00edvel para o governo . Quando pressionado sobre se Gates significava ser capaz para desbloquear um iPhone, ele respondeu:  N\u00e3o h\u00e1 d\u00favida de habilidade; \u00e9 a quest\u00e3o da vontade  .</p><p>Esta resposta parece referenciar a disputa entre <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/28/11321700/apple-responds-fbi-iphone-hack\">o FBI e a Apple</url> ao obter acesso a um iPhone conectado ao tiroteio de San Bernardino em 2015. Embora o FBI finalmente invadiu o telefone sem a ajuda da Apple, a Apple lutou contra a ag\u00eancia sobre o assunto, prometendo que seria ir ao tribunal para proteger a privacidade do usu\u00e1rio.  Desde o in\u00edcio, n\u00f3s opomos \u00e0 demanda do FBI de que a Apple criasse uma porta traseira no iPhone, porque acredit\u00e1vamos que era errado e criaria um precedente perigoso , afirmou a empresa em um comunicado na \u00e9poca.  A Apple acredita profundamente que as pessoas nos Estados Unidos e em todo o mundo merecem prote\u00e7\u00e3o de dados, seguran\u00e7a e privacidade. Sacrificar um para o outro apenas coloca as pessoas e os pa\u00edses em maior risco  .</p><p>No momento da disputa, Gates disse publicamente que sentia que as preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es da Apple eram infundadas, pois o pedido solicitado apenas era aplicado a um \u00fanico dispositivo e n\u00e3o um acesso generalizado a todos os dispositivos da Apple.  Ningu\u00e9m est\u00e1 falando sobre um backdoor   este \u00e9 um caso espec\u00edfico onde o governo est\u00e1 pedindo acesso \u00e0 informa\u00e7\u00e3o. Eles n\u00e3o est\u00e3o pedindo uma coisa geral, eles est\u00e3o pedindo um caso particular  , Gates disse ao <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3559f46e-d9c5-11e5-98fd-06d75973fe09#axzz40zZPAiDx\">Financial Times</url>   em 2016. Os novos coment\u00e1rios de Gates sobre a  quest\u00e3o da vontade  parecem refor\u00e7ar a conclus\u00e3o de que a Apple tem os meios para invadir um telefone individual, mas escolhe n\u00e3o faz\u00ea-lo.</p><p>A Gates expressou anteriormente sua opini\u00e3o sobre estabelecer um equil\u00edbrio entre o acesso do governo aos dados criptografados, mantendo a seguran\u00e7a e a privacidade dos usu\u00e1rios em uma <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/8/11180738/bill-gates-has-no-real-position-on-apple-vs-fbi\">AMA da Reddit</url> no ano passado.  Talvez eles possam propor um plano geral para encontrar o equil\u00edbrio entre o governo capaz de conhecer as coisas em alguns casos e ter salvaguardas para garantir que esses poderes sejam limitados aos casos apropriados , escreveu Gates.

That experience makes what he has to say all the more interesting. Bill Gates in a recent interview with Bloomberg Television's Erik Schatzke weighs in on the government's recent probe[1] into the practices of big technology companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. </p><p>In a nutshell, Gates said that if a company is behaving badly, the best course of action would be to address the matter directly. 'You should just say, okay, that's a banned behavior.' Splitting a company into two and having two entities doing a bad thing doesn't seem like a solution, he said.Gates added that there is a pretty narrow list of things in which a breakup is the right answer to.[embedded content]Touching on another sensitive topic, taxes, Gates said companies are behaving totally legally and doing a lot of innovative things with regard to how they structure themselves for the purpose of tax breaks. 'People should look if they want to change that going forward, that's the real question.'As for social media, Gates said nobody had a crystal ball and could have known that these platforms would radicalize people or split them into different groups. 'What the solution should be - you know, have us reading a common front page and not being pulled to extremes,' isn't necessarily the responsibility of tech companies. 'Government really needs to talk about what those rules should be,' he said. Instead, 'it's up to society to make sure [that the innovation of big tech companies] don't have negative side effects.'Masthead credit: Bill Gates[2] by Frederic Legrand - COMEO Related Reads  Share this article:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/81939-bill-gates-doesnt-think-breakups-solution-big-tech.html#Share\">https://www.techspot.com/news/81939-bill-gates-doesnt-think-breakups-solution-big-tech.html#Share</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.techspot.com/news/81939-bill-gates-doesnt-think-breakups-solution-big-tech.html...le=Bill%20Gates%20doesn't%20think%20breakups%20are%20the%20solution%20to%20big%20tech's%20problems\">https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.techspot.com/news/81939-bill-gates-doesnt-think-breakups-solution-big-tech.html...le=Bill%20Gates%20doesn't%20think%20breakups%20are%20the%20solution%20to%20big%20tech's%20problems</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/81108-justice-department-wants-take-closer-look-tech-giants.html\">https://www.techspot.com/news/81108-justice-department-wants-take-closer-look-tech-giants.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/paris-france-april-16-2018-bill-1070620838\">https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/paris-france-april-16-2018-bill-1070620838</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TSPT133881156874804356325176100211</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSPT-133881</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2V-XWS1-JCMN-Y4VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><timeReceived>7:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>TechSpot</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 17, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
