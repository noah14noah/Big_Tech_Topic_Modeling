John Thune and Brian Schatz, the respective chairman and ranking member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet. And both senators have made it clear that they see the bill as a needed counterweight to the Judiciary Committee s approach.</p><p>In a press call Wednesday, Schatz said the EARN IT Act s plan to empower a panel of top federal officials to decide whether tech platforms can still enjoy protections from lawsuits sparked by user-posted content is ripe for abuse.</p><p> It is not hard for me to imagine how a group of agency heads could be manipulated for political purposes,  said Schatz.  It s one of the big philosophical distinctions here. What they re proposing makes me very, very nervous. </p><p>Thune was more measured in his criticism, saying there s strong bipartisan support for the outcomes that both bills seek to achieve.  However, there is a stark contrast between the two bills with regard to the mechanisms that are used to achieve the desired outcomes,  the senator, who frequently advocates for  light touch  regulatory approaches, said in a statement to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal.</emphasis></p><p>The PACT Act doesn t exactly let tech companies off easy. It creates a significant obligation for platforms to be transparent in their content-moderation decisions, mandates the creation of a complaints process through which users can contest the flagging or takedown of objectionable posts and accounts, and exempts platforms from claiming immunity under federal civil law. </p><p>But Schatz stressed that unlike other reform efforts which include not only the EARN IT Act, but also the executive order recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/\"> issued </url> by the White House the PACT Act is meant to maintain the basic architecture of Section 230. </p><p> Our approach is a scalpel rather than a jackhammer,  said Schatz.</p><p>A spokesperson for Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker said the senator is still reviewing the legislation. But Thune is Majority Whip and the former chairman of the committee if he wants the bill marked up, there s a very good chance it moves forward. </p><p>Several powerful lawmakers are also at work on the Judiciary Committee s Section 230 reform effort. The EARN IT Act is sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and other serious players, including ranking member Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Richard Blumenthal.</p><p>On Thursday, Graham took affront at the idea that his bill which is <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/705329/senators-fiercely-deny-new-earn-it-act-targets-encryption\"> ostensibly designed </url> to induce the platforms to crack down on child-sex-abuse material found online is too aggressive.  There s nothing  jackhammer  about trying to protect kids from sexual exploitation,  he told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis>. </p><p>Blumenthal suggested that Schatz may ve been talking about the White House executive order rather than the EARN IT Act.  Our approach is narrowly tailored, carefully considered, not the meat-ax approach of Donald Trump,  he told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal </emphasis>on Thursday. </p><p>But the senator also returned fire on the PACT Act.  What troubles me is the lack of any real, effective remedies for the victims,  Blumenthal said, before adding that he hopes to work with the Commerce Committee on any final reform effort.</p><p>Not all of the EARN IT Act s cosponsors agree there s much common ground to be found, however. </p><p> Big tech are the most powerful corporations in the world,  said Sen. Josh Hawley, when asked whether the EARN IT Act and PACT Act could somehow complement one another.  So the idea that they need to be shielded and protected and babied, I think, is really out of touch with reality. </p><p> I d like to see a little bit more concern about the people who don t have the power, as opposed to the people who have all the power,  Hawley told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National </emphasis>Journal on Thursday.  And that s my biggest concern with their approach. </p><p>It s not yet clear what the brewing disagreement between the two committees on Section 230 means for the tech platforms, which were unusually quiet following the PACT Act s release. Amy Murphy, director of federal government affairs at the Internet Association, Silicon Valley s lobbying wing in Washington, said only that the group is  reviewing the bill and looks forward to a constructive conversation with Senators Schatz and Thune. </p><p>Tech platforms aren t usually hesitant to voice their displeasure over efforts to change Section 230. That they re holding their fire for now suggests some, at least, may be mulling whether they can live with the PACT Act if it neutralizes the EARN IT Act, Trump s executive order, or other aggressive reform efforts.</p><p> The big giants might decide to embrace this,  said Eric Goldman, law professor at Santa Clara University and an expert on Section 230.  Facebook s already moving in this direction. They may feel like this is not a huge lift for them, it s a huge lift for their competitors, so it would make sense to embrace it as a way of chilling their competitors . . . it would not surprise me if we see some weird splits on that front. </p><p>Goldman, a strong supporter of Section 230 as it was first constituted in 1996, said the PACT Act is an improvement over the EARN IT Act and other reform efforts. But he scoffed at Schatz s  scalpel  characterization.</p><p> That s garbage,  Goldman said, claiming the bill introduces transparency obligations that run afoul of the First Amendment and suggesting the mandatory complaints process for moderation decisions could be exploited.</p><p> The bill requires a response to user inquiry, and that could be weaponized in a thousand different ways as a concerted effort to drain a company s resources or to overwhelm their staff,  Goldman said.</p><p> [The PACT Act] is not as bad as the others,  said Goldman.  But it s still a terrible bill. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-707832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6072-NWX1-JBNW-34BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The National Journal Group, Inc.

They're going before House and Senate committees on Capitol Hill, and they will be grilled again about what social media companies could have done to stop Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and what they're doing now about Russian propaganda ahead of the midterms. NPR's Tim Mak will be covering the hearing, and he's with us in the studio. Hey, Tim. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM MAK: Hey there. </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN: So as I mentioned, these companies have been in this situation before answering these kinds of questions. In the past, they've been reluctant to say they could have done more to prevent their platforms from being abused. Are they - do you expect them to say something different today? </p><p>TIM MAK: Yeah. I think there's an increasing sense amongst big tech firms that this is a serious problem, that an open society and social media platforms can be actually used against American democracy. Facebook, for example, is expected to emphasize how they're doubling the number of people working on safety and security issues to more than 20,000. And they're going to talk about how they're collaborating with law enforcement increasingly in the months ahead. But there's one firm that's not going to be there at all, and that's Google, which has declined to send founder Larry Page or its CEO to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee today. And in his place, there's going be a little chair there, a little sign - a bit of Washington theater - as there is bipartisan consensus from Republicans and Democrats on this committee that their offer, Google's offer, to send its chief legal officer is insufficient. </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN: I mean, this is really what the central tension has been about, how these companies define themselves, right? Are they just a platform for people to express their views, or do they have a responsibility to curate them? How did they come down on this? </p><p>TIM MAK: Yeah. I mean, Facebook in particular is trying to make a good faith effort towards transparency and addressing some concerns from lawmakers and the public. And a lot of this is driven by the changing nature of the threat and how serious it now appears and has become. There's no sign that this threat is diminishing. In fact, just in the past month, we had Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter all announce that they had discovered and disrupted foreign operations. Iran was revealed to be a new player in worldwide disinformation campaigns. And on top of this, we found that there was a new Russian disinformation campaign and apparent hacking attempts. Big tech firms are really on red alert. </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN: So these threats keep popping up and these companies say that they're equipped to manage them. </p><p>TIM MAK: Well, that's the thing about it. Some of these issues can be addressed by the companies themselves. Some of them can be addressed by regulations that Congress might propose, such as online ad disclosures or things like new sanctions against foreign actors. But a lot of this has to do with people themselves. It's a multidimensional threat. It involves everything from hacking emails to bot networks online to disinformation campaigns to election infrastructure security. And a lot of this can be dealt with folks who are just listening to the radio right now, and that's doing things like securing their emails with multifactor authentication and being super judicious about the kinds of information they view online, whether or not they double check their sources, whether or not they're looking at news sources that have credibility and a long track record of being established. It's a really complicated problem. It involves state governments, big tech firms, Congress and people being responsible themselves. </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN: And us. You're saying it's on us. All right.

They're going before House and Senate committees on Capitol Hill, and they will be grilled again about what social media companies could have done to stop Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and what they're doing now about Russian propaganda ahead of the midterms. NPR's Tim Mak will be covering the hearing, and he's with us in the studio. Hey, Tim.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM MAK:                 Hey there.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 So as I mentioned, these companies have been in this situation before answering these kinds of questions. In the past, they've been reluctant to say they could have done more to prevent their platforms from being abused. Are they - do you expect them to say something different today?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Yeah. I think there's an increasing sense amongst big tech firms that this is a serious problem, that an open society and social media platforms can be actually used against American democracy. Facebook, for example, is expected to emphasize how they're doubling the number of people working on safety and security issues to more than 20,000. And they're going to talk about how they're collaborating with law enforcement increasingly in the months ahead. But there's one firm that's not going to be there at all, and that's Google, which has declined to send founder Larry Page or its CEO to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee today. And in his place, there's going be a little chair there, a little sign - a bit of Washington theater - as there is bipartisan consensus from Republicans and Democrats on this committee that their offer, Google's offer, to send its chief legal officer is insufficient.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 I mean, this is really what the central tension has been about, how these companies define themselves, right? Are they just a platform for people to express their views, or do they have a responsibility to curate them? How did they come down on this?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Yeah. I mean, Facebook in particular is trying to make a good faith effort towards transparency and addressing some concerns from lawmakers and the public. And a lot of this is driven by the changing nature of the threat and how serious it now appears and has become. There's no sign that this threat is diminishing. In fact, just in the past month, we had Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter all announce that they had discovered and disrupted foreign operations. Iran was revealed to be a new player in worldwide disinformation campaigns. And on top of this, we found that there was a new Russian disinformation campaign and apparent hacking attempts. Big tech firms are really on red alert.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 So these threats keep popping up and these companies say that they're equipped to manage them.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Well, that's the thing about it. Some of these issues can be addressed by the companies themselves. Some of them can be addressed by regulations that Congress might propose, such as online ad disclosures or things like new sanctions against foreign actors. But a lot of this has to do with people themselves. It's a multidimensional threat. It involves everything from hacking emails to bot networks online to disinformation campaigns to election infrastructure security. And a lot of this can be dealt with folks who are just listening to the radio right now, and that's doing things like securing their emails with multifactor authentication and being super judicious about the kinds of information they view online, whether or not they double check their sources, whether or not they're looking at news sources that have credibility and a long track record of being established. It's a really complicated problem. It involves state governments, big tech firms, Congress and people being responsible themselves.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 And us. You're saying it's on us. All right. NPR's Tim Mak, thanks so much. We appreciate it.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Thanks a lot.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-201809051004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6B-RPM1-JBJH-33F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 5, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Its advocates say they want to prevent computer hackers from going after the power grid or other vital infrastructure in this country. Maryland Senator <person><nameText>Barbara Mikulski </nameText></person>contends a cyberattack could be worse than the freak storm that hit the nation's capital this summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>BARBARA MIKULSKI</nameText></person>: It took us five days to get the utilities back on because of the utility company. But what happens if our destiny is outside of our control, that the cyberterrorists have turned off the lights in America and we can't turn them back on.</p><p>STEVE INSKEEP: OK. Sounds pretty dire, but lawmakers do not agree what to do about it. Here's NPR's Martin Kaste.</p><p>MARTIN KASTE: Like everything else in Washington these days, cybersecurity is about the familiar argument of big government versus little government.</p><p>PAUL ROSENZWEIG: There's nothing wrong with setting standards. There's everything wrong with thinking that the federal government is the right person to set the standards.</p><p>MARTIN KASTE: Paul Rosenzweig dealt with cybersecurity in the Bush administration. He's wary of the Senate bill because it would allow Homeland Security to codify best security practices for Internet providers, utilities and financial institutions. Rosenzweig says nimble tech companies would find themselves taking direction from a slow-moving bureaucracy.</p><p>PAUL ROSENZWEIG: So we are absolutely guaranteed that the standards we come out with 36 months from now will be addressed to systems that are two generations old.</p><p>MARTIN KASTE: Big tech companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also warn of the cost of government-mandated security measures. So the bill's sponsor, Senator Joe Lieberman, recently agreed to make the standards voluntary. And he says he doesn't understand why the weaker bill is still viewed as burdensome.</p><p>JOE LIEBERMAN: I mean, this is no more regulation of business than local building codes are regulation of business. We regulate building construction so people in the building are safe.</p><p>MARTIN KASTE: But that analogy doesn't work for Jose Nazario, senior manager for security research at Arbor Networks. He says the problem with setting a building code for cybersecurity is that the basic conditions can change overnight.</p><p>JOSE NAZARIO: You know, this is like building a foundation with concrete and the next day finding out that concrete's actually flammable. That's the scenario that you're facing in cybersecurity.</p><p>MARTIN KASTE: Even though minimum security standards wouldn't prevent the next hacking innovation, Nazario says they would push negligent companies to protect themselves from known dangers. Nazario also likes the fact that companies would be able to share suspicious Internet traffic with the government. The idea is earlier detection of threats.</p><p>But that, too, is controversial. Civil liberties groups say it could become a back-door form of surveillance. They especially hate the information-sharing in the House version of the bill passed in the spring. But Sharon Bradford Franklin, of the non-partisan Constitution Project, says the Senate has tightened that up.</p><p>SHARON BRADFORD FRANKLIN: Now the limitations on law enforcement use are much narrower. And really, overall, they're trying to make sure that the bill, as a cybersecurity bill, is focused in on cybersecurity purposes.</p><p>MARTIN KASTE: Still, with the legislation now on the floor of the Senate, civil liberties groups are keeping a wary eye out for amendments that would broaden government access to Internet traffic, in the name of preventing a cyber-9/11.</p><p>Martin Kaste, NPR News.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-201208011005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:567N-0C31-DY2S-N53P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>August 1, 2012 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Crime &amp;

Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \"The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\"</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights</p><p>\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Ranking Member Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights--clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\"</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" said Senator Schatz. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" said Senator Klobuchar. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Senator Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\"</p><p>This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people's online privacy--a challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text</url>.</p><p>A one-pager on the legislation can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager</url>.</p><p>The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security</url>.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation:</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck : \"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information --whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\" Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports : \"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\"</p><p>University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo : \"This legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\"</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology Executive Director Laura Moy : \"For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacy--not just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.\"</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League : \"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership on the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step to ensure accountability from those who hold consumer data and the protection of civil rights in the 21st century. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on this bill as it becomes part of comprehensive privacy rights legislation.\"</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\"</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald: \"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Data Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.\"</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S. PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski : \"This strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\"</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy: \"Research demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\"</p><p>Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers. As Congress has worked to develop privacy legislation, she has repeatedly called for comprehensive privacy protections. She has led the fight to protect and restore net neutrality rules to keep a free and open internet. She has also championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S. economy and pushed federal agencies like the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COS1H611262019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKS-7GR1-JCCP-00WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \u201cThe bill not only codifies privacy as a right \u2014a measure long overdue \u2014but it also recognizes that \u2018rights\u2019 that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\u201d</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers\u2019 data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights</p><p>\u201cIn the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\u201d Ranking Member Cantwell said. \u201cThey should be like your Miranda rights\u2014clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won\u2019t be used to harm them,\u201d said Senator Schatz. \u201cOur bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompanies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\u201d said Senator Klobuchar. \u201cOur legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It\u2019s time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demand for consumers\u2019 personal information today is at an all-time high,\u201d Senator Markey said. \u201cBut while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\u201d</p><p>This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people\u2019s online privacy\u2014a challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE.</p><p>A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE.</p><p>The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation:</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck: \u201cThis bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information \u2014whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right \u2014a measure long overdue \u2014but it also recognizes that \u2018rights\u2019 that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\u201d Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports: \u201cThis is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors\u2019 leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\u201d</p><p>University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo: \u201cThis legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\u201d</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy &amp; Technology Executive Director Laura Moy: 'For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacy\u2014not just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.'</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League: \u201cAfrican Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership on the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step to ensure accountability from those who hold consumer data and the protection of civil rights in the 21st century. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on this bill as it becomes part of comprehensive privacy rights legislation.\u201d</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \u201cIn today\u2019s online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals\u2019 personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\u201d</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald: \u201cThe Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Data Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S \u201d</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski: \u201cThis strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy: \u201cResearch demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\u201d</p><p>Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers. As Congress has worked to develop privacy legislation, she has repeatedly called for comprehensive privacy protections. She has led the fight to protect and restore net neutrality rules to keep a free and open internet. She has also championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S economy and pushed federal agencies like the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2655127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKT-SWG1-JDG9-Y4W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Markey:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New consumer rights guaranteed by strong federal compliance and consumer right to sue</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Data companies with security breaches can be fined</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON, D.C Today U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and fellow senior members Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Ed Markey (D-MA) unveiled comprehensive federal online privacy legislation to establish privacy rights, outlaw harmful and deceptive practices, and improve data security safeguards for the record number of American consumers who now shop or conduct business online.</p><p>With new numbers showing that nearly sixty percent of all holiday spending will be done onlinemaking this the largest online holiday shopping season ever families everywhere want strong action taken to protect their online privacy and data security. Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \"The bill not only codifies privacy as a right a measure long overdue but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\"</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights</p><p>\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Ranking Member Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\"</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" said Senator Schatz. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" said Senator Klobuchar. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Senator Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\"</p><p>This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people's online privacya challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE.</p><p>A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE.</p><p>The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation :</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck: \"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right a measure long overdue but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\" Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports: \"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\"</p><p>University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo: \"This legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\"</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology Executive Director Laura Moy: \"For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacynot just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.\"</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League: \"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership on the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step to ensure accountability from those who hold consumer data and the protection of civil rights in the 21st century. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on this bill as it becomes part of comprehensive privacy rights legislation.\"</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\"</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald : \"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Data Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.\"</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S. PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski: \"This strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\"</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocac y: \"Research demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\"</p><p>Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers.

Edward J. Markey issued the following press release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and fellow senior members Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Ed Markey (D-MA) unveiled comprehensive federal online privacy legislation to establish privacy rights, outlaw harmful and deceptive practices, and improve data security safeguards for the record number of American consumers who now shop or conduct business online.</p><p>With new numbers showing that nearly sixty percent of all holiday spending will be done online-making this the largest online holiday shopping season ever -families everywhere want strong action taken to protect their online privacy and data security. Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \"The bill not only codifies privacy as a right -a measure long overdue -but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\"</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights</p><p>\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Ranking Member Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights-clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\"</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" said Senator Schatz. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" said Senator Klobuchar. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Senator Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\"</p><p>This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people's online privacy-a challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE.</p><p>A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE.</p><p>The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation:</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck: \"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information -whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right -a measure long overdue -but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\" Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports: \"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\"</p><p>University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo: \"This legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\"</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy &amp;#38; Technology Executive Director Laura Moy: \"For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacy-not just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.\"</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League: \"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership on the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step to ensure accountability from those who hold consumer data and the protection of civil rights in the 21st century. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on this bill as it becomes part of comprehensive privacy rights legislation.\"</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\"</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald: \"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Data Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.\"</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S. PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski: \"This strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\"</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy: \"Research demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\"</p><p>Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers. As Congress has worked to develop privacy legislation, she has repeatedly called for comprehensive privacy protections. She has led the fight to protect and restore net neutrality rules to keep a free and open internet. She has also championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S. economy and pushed federal agencies like the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.

Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \"The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\"</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights</p><p>\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Ranking Member Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights--clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\"</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" said Senator Schatz. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" said Senator Klobuchar. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Senator Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\"</p><p>This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people's online privacy--a challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text</url>.</p><p>A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager</url>.</p><p>The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security</url>.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation:</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck: \"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information --whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\" Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports: \"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\"</p><p>University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo: \"This legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\"</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology Executive Director Laura Moy: \"For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacy--not just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.\"</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League: \"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership on the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step to ensure accountability from those who hold consumer data and the protection of civil rights in the 21st century. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on this bill as it becomes part of comprehensive privacy rights legislation.\"</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\"</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald: \"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Data Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.\"</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S. PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski: \"This strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\"</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy: \"Research demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\"</p><p>Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers. As Congress has worked to develop privacy legislation, she has repeatedly called for comprehensive privacy protections. She has led the fight to protect and restore net neutrality rules to keep a free and open internet. She has also championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S. economy and pushed federal agencies like the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senate-democrats-unveil-strong-online-privacy-rights\">https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senate-democrats-unveil-strong-online-privacy-rights</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSMB26936A7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKV-C8K1-JCCP-01ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \"The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\"</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights</p><p>\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Ranking Member Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights--clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\"</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" said Senator Schatz. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" said Senator Klobuchar. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Senator Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\"</p><p>This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people's online privacy--a challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text</url>.</p><p>A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager</url>.</p><p>The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security</url>.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation:</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck: \"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information --whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\" Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports: \"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\"</p><p>University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo: \"This legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\"</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology Executive Director Laura Moy: \"For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacy--not just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.\"</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League: \"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership and on including important protections for civil and human rights in the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step. In the 21st century, privacy legislation must ensure data cannot be used in ways to undermine hard-fought civil rights. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on comprehensive data privacy rights legislation.\"</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\"</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald: \"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.\"</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S. PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski: \"This strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\"</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy: \"Research demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\"</p><p>Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers. As Congress has worked to develop privacy legislation, she has repeatedly called for comprehensive privacy protections. She has led the fight to protect and restore net neutrality rules to keep a free and open internet. She has also championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S. economy and pushed federal agencies like the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2019/11/senate-democrats-unveil-strong-online-privacy-rights\">https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2019/11/senate-democrats-unveil-strong-online-privacy-rights</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSPB26902E5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKV-C8K1-JCCP-01PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

What does it mean to be an independent company in the electricity space? It means that NRG is not a rate-regulated utility and, therefore, does not have captive rate-payers or a guaranteed rate of return on the capital that we invest. We have to earn our customers, and our shareholders - not our customers - bear the risks associated with the power plants we build and other projects that we undertake.</p><p>Our company is also proud to be a leader in acting to address climate change - even in the absence of a comprehensive, federal approach. We have embarked on that effort by establishing science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and making the business decisions that are required to meet those targets in a way that provides consumers with the affordable, reliable and clean electricity they want while generating a return for our shareholders. For our shareholders, and for the general public, we provide granular disclosure of our progress towards meeting those targets. I am pleased to be here today sharing not only what we have done as a company but what we believe the federal government can do to facilitate broader participation - from energy companies and consumers alike - in the actions that are needed to mitigate climate change.</p><p>I. Introduction</p><p>Avoiding the worst consequences of climate change requires massive carbon reductions, and those actions must be at a price that consumers can afford. The American experience is the most impactful, most consistent force for enabling innovation, improving performance and lowering costs for consumers is, in a word, competition. It seems so obvious, but it is important to remind ourselves that clean energy is not exempt from the laws of economics, nor should we expect it to be.</p><p>To move towards an environmentally and economically sustainable future, our electricity markets need to be re-focused in two key ways.</p><p>. First, government needs to stop restricting the right of electricity customers, large and small, to procure the type of energy that aligns with their interests and values. Consumers nationwide want to buy green power. Why do we allow federal and state policies to stand in the way of giving consumers what they want?</p><p>. Second, a competitive clean energy market, open to all forms of carbon-free power, represents the lowest cost solution to meeting government-set carbon objectives. Indeed, wholesale electricity markets - where the objective is lowest cost reliability - utilize government-set reliability targets, and then use the market to achieve those targets in the most affordable way.</p><p>In working to move towards an environmentally and economically sustainable future, there are also a few things that we must avoid. Specifically:</p><p>. Don't redistribute precious tax revenue or ratepayers' hard-earned dollars via subsidies for commercially mature generating technologies;</p><p>. Don't lock consumers into excessively-priced contracts for specific clean energy technologies when lower cost clean energy is available instead;</p><p>. Don't provide corporate welfare to existing power plants that are profitable under the guise of promoting carbon free energy; and</p><p>. Certainly don't make customers buy overpriced energy from specific well-connected companies.</p><p>A better approach is to define the attributes that we are looking for in our energy supply - in addition to reliability - and then incentivize private capital to compete to provide those attributes. Every carbon-free megawatt has the same value to fight climate change. When everyone competes, the lowest-cost resources win. Imagine a competitive, technology-inclusive, market where renewable energy, nuclear, carbon capture, or battery storage projects win because they provide the most green attributes at the lowest price; not because they have the biggest lobbying budgets.</p><p>Unfortunately, the concept of a pro-innovation, competitive energy market is presently under attack. In the absence of leadership from the federal government on these matters, many state governments are falling into the same tired pattern of handing out billions to prop up aging, uncompetitive facilities, or signing consumers up to contracts for expensive, one-off generating technologies. I understand that there are good reasons - at least good political reasons - why lawmakers sometimes support subsidies. Areas where power plants are located want to save the jobs. Owners are glad to use any argument to enable a stream of payments to their shareholders. Environmental groups sign on to bailout legislation because too often they see it as the only viable means of increasing green energy funding. While often well-intentioned, many of these programs lock in inefficient and expensive contracts for the next decade or more, without the benefit of ever having opened them up to competition. And they weaken - perhaps fatally - the competitive wholesale markets that companies like mine depend on, which means more jobs lost and other communities that feel the sting of plant closures.</p><p>As a society, we need a laser-focus on reducing emissions at the lowest possible cost. Subsidies defeat the markets, defeat innovation, and defeat job creation and new investment. Subsidies, in the form of long-term contracts, are not only wasteful, but risk locking customers into bad deals and forestall innovation for, in some cases, half a generation or more. If we fritter away our societal resources by treating green energy spending as corporate welfare or a jobs program, we risk missing out on the maximum carbon reduction possible and even leave ourselves vulnerable to a homegrown version of the 'Yellow Vest' ratepayer revolt. In short, if we are serious about reducing carbon emissions, we should not be paying more for \"boutique\" clean energy when less expensive, but equally clean, options are available.</p><p>Today, the regions of our country with the most competitive electricity markets - where the objective is lowest cost reliability - provide unquestionable benefits, in the form of unparalleled reliability at the lowest possible price. Because of these markets, the cost of the electric energy we all consume, and the price we pay to maintain the capacity is needed to produce it, are the lowest they have been since restructuring. n1 Innovations in turbine technology led directly to more efficient use of natural gas - utilizing less fuel to produce a MWh and emitting less pollutants while doing it. Forced outage rates are down versus pre-competition levels. The cost of renewables and batteries are dropping. And a burgeoning demand response industry accounts for almost 10% of the supply stack in such key markets as PJM. All of these and other innovations were largely driven by the investment of shareholders' \"at-risk\" capital where there was no ability to pass the cost of potential failures along to captive ratepayers.</p><p>Addressing climate change in the power sector is - at this point - more of an economics problem than it is an engineering challenge. Our economic problem is that under the status quo monopolists' top priority will always be to defend their turf by seeking subsidies, including by cynically warning of layoffs. So long as legislators succumb to this political pressure, the innovation and consumer choice that could grow the economy and benefit the environment will be stifled. Fortunately, there are better alternatives.</p><p>II. Defining Climate \"Success\"</p><p>What does success look like in 2030, in terms of technology and utility business model?</p><p>On the grid, technology will have evolved to what we at NRG refer to as the \"Four Product Future\" - renewables, controllable demand, battery storage and fast-ramping natural gas - which combine to form the backbone of an affordable and reliable green grid. n2 In practice, this means that clean energy sources provide the majority of the electrons consumed. Homes, businesses and electric cars possess smart technology that will adjust electricity consumption seamlessly, forming flexible virtual power plants. Massive batteries, capable of storing electricity during times of plentiful sun or wind, inject that stored power back into the grid during times of high energy demand or low production. All while modern, efficient, natural gas power plants stand by to keep the grid humming and balance variability in consumption and production.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the electricity business model will have shifted in equally important ways. An open source platform for buying and selling electricity will exist in place of today's utility energy monopolies. Indeed, nowhere is the need to \"quarantine the monopoly\" more important than in the energy sector. Many have raised concerns about how big tech companies stifle innovation by operating a dominant platform - and then selling products on the very platform they control. This same conundrum permeates today's utility sector. Everywhere in the country, other than Texas, we are forced to sell our products through utility-dominated market platforms. Why should my company develop a new technology or product, spend the money to test and develop that product, if utility monopolies are then allowed to sell identical products on the platforms they control (often with risk-free, ratepayer-funded capital)? Thus, if we want to see innovation flourish, we need to confine the monopoly business model wherever possible.</p><p>III. Solutions</p><p>Step 1: Let Consumers Decide</p><p>The first big step is empowering consumers to choose, if they wish, to \"green\" their own power supply free from unfair competition and domination by monopolies. Public opinion polls have consistently found that overwhelming majorities, across parties, support taking action to address climate change. We ought to test if that's real, or not, by letting consumers vote with their pocketbooks. Among larger, commercial and industrial buyers seeking to green their power supply, we have seen powerful advocates n3 for open, competitive energy markets enter the fray. Why can't every single person in the United States decide, if they wish to do so, to 'fire their utility' in favor of picking a greener energy solution, and telling a larger pool of companies that they will have to compete - on the basis of cost - for that consumer's business?</p><p>Instead, customers in two-thirds of the country must battle powerful regional monopolists who fight to keep their stranglehold on the customer relationship, all in the name of protecting against profit erosion that may come with customers choosing to take their business elsewhere. In Florida, the utility lobby is so strong, that customers looking for the right to produce and sell solar power in the Sunshine state couldn't even get a constitutional amendment on the ballot last November. Fortunately, they will have another chance in 2020, as citizens take their fight for consumer choice to the ballot box again, this time in the form of an initiative requiring Florida to open its electricity markets.</p><p>But, the best part of this first step? Enabling enhanced customer choice doesn't cost taxpayers a penny. Putting the power to choose in the hands of more consumers presents a tremendous opportunity to let consumers take control of their own carbon footprint and for innovators to offer options to drive meaningful change. Still, unleashing consumer demand, n4 by itself, is only part of the solution.</p><p>Step 2: The Competitive Clean Energy Market</p><p>In a clean energy attributes market, NRG sees head-to-head competition between all zero-carbon resources as the lowest-cost means of achieving ambitious carbon targets. NRG has worked with the well-respected economists Drs. Kathleen Spees and Sam Newall of The Brattle Group to develop a competitive clean energy attributes market that could be implemented at either the federal, state, or multiple-state levels. The market design is laid out in a whitepaper attached to this testimony. It is also the basis of the Competitive Clean Energy Act, which has been introduced into the Illinois Legislature (Senate Bill 135 Amendment 2 / House Bill 125 Amendment 2, introduced by Sen. David Koehler). Our competitive clean energy market adheres to the following key principles:</p><p>. Technology-Inclusive: All zero-carbon resources - nuclear, wind, solar, carbon capture and sequestration, and voluntary emission reduction commitments - are allowed to compete to sell their attributes. Every increment of clean electricity, regardless of technology, is paid the same clearing price because every carbon-free megawatt has the same value to fight climate change. Everyone competes. Lowest-cost resources win.</p><p>. Quantity Matches Desired Carbon-Free Electricity Content: The market is designed to procure carbon-free energy in the quantities specified by regulators in each delivery year.</p><p>. Moves Carbon Price Signal into the Forward Timeframe: Forward market clearing moves the carbon investment price signal three-years into the future, allowing for new entrants to arrange for financing early in the development cycle.</p><p>. Financeable Contracts for New Winning Resources: New resources receive financial support (in the form of long-term contracts) that ensures they actually get built.</p><p>. Assigns Risk Appropriately: Private capital competes, not only on who has the best technology, but on accepting the lowest rate of return. Investors wear technology, regulatory, and performance risk.</p><p>. As Price Goes Down, Procurement Goes Up: Encourages early achievement of clean energy goals, because total clean energy purchases increase as price-per-megawatt decreases (i.e., a downward sloping demand curve).</p><p>. Allows Participation from Third-Parties: Opens up lowest cost procurement to third-parties (municipalities, private businesses, etc.) on a voluntary basis, encouraging even faster achievement of carbon goals.</p><p>Step 3: Re-Define Cooperative Federalism</p><p>NRG sees a clear need for federal leadership. Competition for long-term renewables contracts centrally cleared through a centralized market structure is the most promising option for achieving long-term decarbonization at the lowest possible cost. Even more promising would be a coordinated forward auction for renewable and conventional energy that co-optimizes the procurement of renewable and conventional capacity, resulting in a total fuel mix that delivers the state's preferred carbon goals at the least possible cost, while also ensuring that reliability is maintained. Under such a system, states would achieve all of their environmental goals and consumers would save money in the process.</p><p>The main federal protector of competition in the energy sectors - the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - is, unfortunately, nowhere to be seen on the clean energy playing field. For that matter, it seems to be nowhere in terms of basic protection of well-functioning markets. Congress gave the FERC exclusive jurisdiction over sales of electric energy for resale, as well as programs \"affecting\" or \"in connection with\" those sales. That means that FERC should have the authority--and, indeed, the duty--to ensure that rules or practices affecting wholesale rates are just and reasonable. But it has struggled to enact even basic efforts to harmonize federal competition policy with state subsidies. If the Agency wants to remain relevant in today's changing regulatory climate, it must take immediate steps to evolve wholesale market structures in a world increasingly concerned with carbon externalities.</p><p>If a state picks a politically-favored entity to receive lucrative long-term contracts without conducting a competitive solicitation that is open to all parties, then how can anyone say that the state has provided consumers with rates that are just and reasonable? In the absence of clarity on that question, there is absolutely a role for federal oversight. n5 In such scenarios, there must be a federal role if the Federal Power Act is to have any meaning as a consumer protection statute.</p><p>States are increasingly incorporating carbon, jobs, tax, and other externalities into their energy policies. In isolated cases, states have adopted jobs and economic development programs which \"mix and match\" environmental and economic goals in a deliberate effort to avoid federal jurisdiction. Clearly, the answer cannot be that FERC is powerless to prevent this type of consumer abuse. Congressional leadership is key to helping FERC refocus on preserving the benefits of competition and restoring a functional cooperative federalism relationship.</p><p>Electricity markets in the regions of the country that have elected to restructure and minimize the role of monopoly utilities provide billions in annual savings to consumers while delivering reliability. These highly competitive markets, however, are likewise sidelined from the fight against carbon pollution because we have not added carbon considerations into their core missions of ensuring reliability at the lowest possible costs. As a result, we have denied consumers access to the markets most able to deliver the lowest priced carbon abatement.</p><p>Strong Congressional leadership can help break the log-jam that has threatened competitive markets. States are (understandably) reluctant to stall progress on meeting carbon goals. This leaves an opening for Congress to redefine cooperative federalism by, for example, allowing states to set the desired carbon content of their electricity, but leave it for federal regulators, running some of the most fiercely competitive markets in the world, to accomplish that goal at just and reasonable rates.</p><p>n1 Notably, this reduction in costs for energy often has not been noticed by end-use consumers, because the monopoly providers of transmission and distribution service - utilities - spent billions of dollars on new Transmission and Distribution facilities which have dramatically increased customers' costs for those services even while energy costs have gone down.</p><p>n2 For more on the Four Product Future, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrg.com/insights/energy-education/the-four-product-future-transforming-the-energy-industry-today.html\">https://www.nrg.com/insights/energy-education/the-four-product-future-transforming-the-energy-industry-today.html</url>.</p><p>n3 See, e.g., the Renewable Energy Buyers Association, a trade group representing large corporate buyers interested in sustainable solutions: <url normalizedValue=\"https://rebuyers.org/\">https://rebuyers.org/</url>.</p><p>n4 See, e.g., The Myth of the Ethical Consumer, by Timothy Devinney, discussing the limits on consumer uptake of sustainable products.</p><p>n5 For example, regulators in Illinois and New York committed ratepayers to more than $10 billion in no-bid contracts over the next decade on keeping economically inefficient nuclear plants operating in the wholesale market. Both states implemented these programs without ever testing these investments to determine whether consumers could have received more carbon \"bang-for-their-buck\" elsewhere. Other states risk falling victim to the same rhetoric, as evidence by recent bailout efforts in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=04CD0799-1F01-4F74-A9AB-331B0CC9BE1D\">https://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=04CD0799-1F01-4F74-A9AB-331B0CC9BE1D</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSC4119146841299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW0-WJ91-JCCP-04GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3231\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 11, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002HHH</classCode><className>NRG ENERGY INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS424720 PETROLEUM &amp;

GARY PETERS (D-MICH.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]PAUL: Call this hearing to order. The Federal Spending Oversight Subcommittee meeting. We're glad that you came. We're a little bit delayed because we got involved with voting, which comes up periodically. And so, we got that out of the way, but we're glad you're here. When I think of the federal government, I kind of think of how 9,000 soothing voice. Unfortunately, the soothing voice kind of got out of control and there weren't any rules, there weren't any regulations on how or that--the regulations on how failed and how it got out of control and there was no turning back. Government's a little bit that way in that it's sort of gotten out of control. </p><p>There's been a great deal of attention that's been paid to out of control government regulations and how they affect the private sector. But today, we're going to talk about how the out of--out of control overzealous regulations, how these negative effects affect actually government and actually ma--how they make government more expensive. </p><p>This happens in many ways, but Congress has and continues to create programs and agencies that promulgate regulations to implement programs. We often give broad definitions of who gets what benefit, leaving it up to the agency to fine tune the regulation. I've often said when we pass laws, we pass outlines of laws. A good example is Obamacare. It was, like, 1,500 pages and there were fifteen hun--hundred references to the secretary of health will at a later date decide this. We really didn't write the law. We wrote a shell of a law and we gave it to the regulators and then they write the law. And this is too much power to give to unelected people who aren't responsive to the people. </p><p>We're still--Congress, though, gives agencies a blank check on appropriation saying often such sums as are necessary. We have a bill like that on the floor today on 9/11. They're saying, well, we have to give them more money, we have to give them money through 2092, but we're not sure. So, let's just give them as much as they can possibly spend until 2029--until 2092. The problem is is that without congressional involvement, any agency can expand the eligibility for a program and in effect increase government spending on their own without a proper appropriation. Similarly, regulations can be used to alter programs and processes to reduce spending, but that doesn't seem to happen very often. </p><p>A flagrant example of a government agency expanding its mission and spending billions of dollars without congressional approval occurred when the Social Security Administration expanded the disabled population to include those who are obese. Also in the 1970s, disability insurance was extended to those who do not speak English. Really? It's a disability that requires government programs if you fail to speak English? We didn't vote on that. Congress didn't make it a disability, the agency did and inevitably, that added thousands and thousands of people to the disability rolls. Disability now consumes about 17 percent of the social security money. Social Security Administration's $7 trillion in the hole, but we didn't even decide to make, you know, obese people disabled, some bureaucrat did. </p><p>Both of these expansions have been curtailed a little bit and rolled back and I agree with reforms, but we still should do more. Whatever side you come down on, though, this causes government spending without Congress appropriating the money. Certainly, such things were not envisioned when the disability program was created.  </p><p>Administrations publish some of the budgetary impact of regulation, but those are buried deep in the president's budgets and have--we have looked at this, we have found that during the past three administrations, Trump, Obama, and Bush, there have been billions of dollars in federal spending changes that have resulted from regulatory changes. I'm told this might not even show the full scope of the regulatory spending. But, it's also a question of checks and balances in two regards. First, Congress makes laws and while we generally recognize that the executive will make certain regulations to execute those laws, what constraints exist to prevent regulation above and beyond the intent of Congress?  </p><p>Second, the Constitution reserves the right of appropriation of Congress. I believe that we are failing in our duties when we appropriate such sums as are necessary, but Congress does this often. So, what kind of checks and balances exist or should exist? This is one of the questions this hearing will address. </p><p>The Congressional Review Act, which is in itself an insufficient check, does allow Congress to disapprove of a--of significant regulation. However, many regulations fly under Congress's radar and do not get reviewed. I think before this administration, we had actually never--we might have one time before this actually used the Congressional Review Act to reverse regulations. So, it's been rarely used and this administration only when we got all three branches of government. We're finally able to repeal some regulations previously a divided government had never done. So, we're government inside the opposition party. </p><p>The only other check I know of is is the advise and consent powers over nominees. At a minimum, senators can question and get commitments from would be regulators as to how they will execute their regulatory authority and hold them accountable. However, recent research indicates that an alarming num of--number of regulations are finalized by career employees that are not confirmed by the Senate. In other words, it appears that unelected career bureaucrats who enjoy civil service protections have the capacity to make what amount to laws and appropriate funds without any real accountability by Congress. That should trouble certainly members of Congress, but more importantly, the Americans they represent. </p><p>With that, I'd like to recoret (PH)--recomment (PH)--recognize the ranking member, Senator Hassan. </p><p>HASSAN: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And good afternoon to our witnesses and thank you--good afternoon to our witnesses and thank you for your patience as we went through three remarkably slow votes. So, I also want to thank the chairman and say how much I appreciate your work, Mr. Chair, and your staff's work on this hearing. And I also want to thank the witnesses for being here today to provide their expertise on these issues. </p><p>As members of the Federal Spending Oversight Subcommittee, we have an obligation to examine all federal spending in order to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and effectively. Today's hearing focuses on how regulations drive federal spending and how accountability within the regulatory process may prevent unnecessary or even wasteful spending. I have long supported eliminating outdated and burdensome regulations that stymie economic growth and innovation. And I'd be glad, Mr. Chair, to work with you on that.  </p><p>At the same time, I also believe that government's first job is to keep the people who we serve safe. Many regulations are intended to protect Americans from harmful products, infectious diseases, and financial exploitation. As we work to both foster innovation and also to protect the American people, today's hearing reminds us that we need to account for the costs of establishing any common sense safeguards, as well as the costs of failing to provide adequate protections. Keeping track of regulatory-driven spending must involve strong congressional oversight, robust input from federal--from non-federal stakeholders, and a thorough judicial review process.  </p><p>I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about the adequacy of the checks and safeguards that exist to cut unnecessary or unlawful regulatory spending. Most importantly, I hope our witnesses can help us identify ways to continue to improve this process in order to safeguard taxpayer dollars, while ensuring basic protections of public safety and the quality of life that Americans hold dear. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. And to the witnesses, thank you for your attendance. I look forward to hearing from you. Mr. Chair. </p><p>PAUL: Thank you. Our first witness is Dr. James Broughel. Dr. Broughel is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center. He has authored numerous policy briefs and reports on regulatory issues. His works have appeared in Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, the European Journal of Risk Regulation, the Washington Post, among other outlets. Dr. Broughel holds a BA and a master's degree, both in economics, from City College of New York and a PhD in economics from George Mason University.  </p><p>Dr. Broughel, you are recognized for your opening statement. </p><p>BROUGHEL: Thank you, Chairman Paul, Ranking Member Hassan. It's great to be here with you today. Thank you for allowing me to offer this testimony on the cost of federal regulations as it pertains to the federal government and to taxpayers. </p><p>My message today is simple. Much of what constitutes federal policy is on autopilot. By this, I mean, many government programs, including the amount of money spent on them, operate largely outside the annual appropriations process and the active management of legislators in Congress. Now, the true cost of leaving so many important policy decisions on autopilot remains largely unknown, but estimates of automatic mandatory spending and the total cost of federal regulations are in the trillions annually. A simple reform could begin to shed light on some of these costs. Require the Congressional Budget Office to analyze the fiscal effects of regulations. CBO could start with so-called budget regulations, which primarily impact the federal government's budget. </p><p>Now, as background, in 1969, 29 percent of federal outlays consisted of fe--mandatory spending, which doesn't require the same act of management from legislators because it doesn't typically require an annual appropriation from Congress. By 2018, that number had risen to 61 percent. So, from 29 percent to 61 percent.  And CBO projects that this will rise to 65 percent by 2029. In other words, a huge fraction of federal spending is on autopilot and this trend is getting worse over time. </p><p>Credible estimates put the annual cost of federal regulation in the trillions. One estimate produced by the Mercatus Center is that the cumulative cost of federal regulation was $4 trillion in 2012 alone. By comparison, total federal outlays in 2018 were around $4.1 trillion. The cost of regulation are an invisible cost that doesn't receive an annual appropriation from Congress. Now, although much of federal spending is not discretionary from the perspective of Congress because it's mandatory, some mandatory spending is discretionary from the perspective of regulators. That's because some appropriations decisions are made by unelected regulators in the executive branch. For example, budget regulations are rules whose primary impact is on the federal government's budget. These rules can come in a variety of forms. They might set physician fees for the Medicare program, consular service fees, or broaden or narrow eligibility standards for Agricultural Disaster Relief to name just a few examples. </p><p>The Office of Management and Budget estimates that major budget regulations in fiscal year 2016 and pose a net budgetary cost of about $5 billion that year. That may not sound like much money compared to the massive federal budget, but this cost estimate comes from just 27 regulations. By comparison, roughly three to 4,000 final regulations are published in the Federal Register each year. So, the OMB's cost estimate is very incomplete. Regulations other than budget regulations also impact the federal government's finances, as any regulation that allows or restricts economic activity will have some kind of impact on tax collection.  </p><p>Now, one reason we don't have more information about the budgetary cost of federal regulations is because the quality of the federal agency regulatory analysis tends to be quite poor, especially for budget regulations. Mercatus Center has conducted analysis of the quality of regulatory impact analyses using a regulatory scorecard system and a key finding from that project was that budget regulations have significantly lower quality analysis than other economically significant regulations. </p><p>A first step towards addressing these regulatory costs on autopilot is to task an agency like CBO with reviewing the fiscal impacts of regulations. CBO has a few specific advantages that make it well poised to take on this task. First is independence. Unlike regulatory agencies, which are run by political personnel with specific policy agendas they enter office looking to implement, CBO doesn't have an obvious stake in the outcome of regulations. Experience. Since the mid 1970s, CBO has analyzed the fiscal impacts of legislation. It could do the same for regulations, which may be even easier to analyze as they are simpler. Democratic accountability. CBO is part of the legislative branch, which has direct accountability to voters. </p><p>So, to conclude, with more transparency about the budgetary impacts of regulations, the true cost of having so much of the government on autopilot could begin to reveal themselves. Thank you for granting me the opportunity to speak today and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. </p><p>PAUL: Thank you, Dr. Broughel. Our next witness is Thomas Berry. Mr. Berry is an attorney in the Pacific Legal Foundation's D.C. Center. Prior to joining the foundation, Mr. Berry was a legal associate in the Cato--Cato Institute Center for Constitutional Study. Mr. Berry is the coauthor of the Pacific Legal Foundation's report analyzing the rulemaking process at HHS. Mr. Berry holds a bachelor degree from St. John's College and a J.D. from Stanford Law School. Mr. Berry, your opening statement. </p><p>BERRY: Thank you, Chairman Paul and Ranking Member Hassan for inviting me today to testify on rulemaking by unaccountable agency bureaucrats. Today, I'll make three points. First, this rulemaking practice has weakened the separation of powers and harmed political accountability. Second, this practice is rampant, including 98 percent of FDA rules. And third, this rulemaking is unconstitutional. I'll conclude with potential solutions. </p><p>When senators, like you and your colleagues, question nominees for agency leadership, you're well aware of the rulemaking power that those positions hold. For example, when Robert Califf was questioned at his 2015 confirmation hearing for FDA commissioner, he received several questions on what rulemaking judgments he might make if confirmed. Why then were the vast majority of rulemaking decisions during his tenure made not by Califf, but by a low-ranking FDA employee who had never been nominated by the president or confirmed by the Senate? An employee who had been hired years be--before Califf and would stay on well after. </p><p>In such a system, the decisions this body makes to confirm--confirm or reject any nominee simply don't guarantee any effect on the rulemaking judgments made within an agency. Similarly, the president has never nominated nor is he expected to even know of these low-ranking career bureaucrats. When rulemaking decisions are made by low level employees, those rules are deprived of any ability to be traced back to the top and the people are thus deprived of democratic accountability in those rules. </p><p>This type of rulemaking has become rampant. The following numbers come from a recent first of its kind study for the Pacific Legal Foundation that I co-authored with Angela C. Erickson. We collected all final rules from the Department of HHS going back to 2001 and the result was that 71 percent of these rules were signed by non-Senate confirmed employees. That's nearly 2,100 rules. And within FDA, it was 98 percent. And this is not limited to minor rules like typo fixes. We omitted rules with small changes like technical corrections and found that still 1,300 substantive rules were signed by non-Senate confirmed employees. That's 63 percent. And looking only at rules deemed significant by the Office of Management and Budget, over 250 such rules signed by non-Senate confirmed employees, or 34 percent. Those are rules with combined economic effects in the billions of dollars  </p><p>And now, finally, the constitutionality of this. The Supreme Court has explicitly held that the power to issue a final rule is an authority that can only be held by a duly appointed officer of the United States. The Constitution divides officers into two categories, principal and inferior. And the key difference between those two categories is that principal officers must be confirmed by the Senate before taking office without exception. The Supreme Court has held that to be an inferior officer, your work must be directed and supervised by a Senate-confirmed superior. In the absence of such supervision, Senate confirmation becomes a constitutional requirement. </p><p>The ability to issue a final rule without the approval of a superior means that such supervision is absent. And contrary to Professor Parker's testimony, the FDA has essentially conceded that for many rules, that supervision is absent. That is why rules can only be issued by officers confirmed by the Senate. Rules issued in any other way are unconstitutional. So, the bottom line is this. In just one department, thousands of rules have been issued and continue to be issued by career--career employees who have no accountability to the Senate or to the people, which subverts the system our framers designed.  </p><p>Now, potential solutions. The simplest would be a short bill requiring that every rule published in the Federal Register must be signed by a Senate-confirmed officer. Short of the sweeping solution, the individual organizational statutes for each department should be amended so that subdelegating rulemaking authority is no longer permissible, unless to a Senate-confirmed officer. Congress can further bring attention to this matter through oversight and hearing such as this can help encourage the executive branch to alter its rulemaking practices. </p><p>And since sub delegation is always made at the discretion of higher ranking officers, the Senate can question nominees for agency leadership on this practice and ensure they commit not to subdelegate rulemaking power below the level of Senate-confirmed officers.  </p><p>As the body charged by the framers with vetting the character and judgment of executive branch officers, it's natural that the Senate would take a leading role in reining back this abusive end run around that system. Congress has several options at its disposal to restore the balance our framers designed and ensure that every rule binding on the public is made by a politically accountable officer. </p><p>Thank you, again, for allowing me to testify today and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>PAUL: Thank you, Mr. Berry, for your testimony. Our last witness today is Richard Parker. Professor Parker is a tenured professor at the University of Connecticut Law School. Teaches and writes in the fields of administrative and international environmental law. Mr. Parker serves on the Council of the American Bar Association's Administrative Law section where he chairs the Committee on Collaborative Governance and co-chairs the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources. Professor Parker holds a bachelor's degree in public and international affairs from Princeton, a J.D. from Yale, and he received a doctorate of philosophy in politics from Oxford University, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar. Professor Parker, your opening statement. </p><p>PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Hassan, members of the subcommittee. Thank you for your opportunity--for giving me this opportunity to testify today. As an academic, I'm not required to espouse any particular point of view, but my recent research has focused on reviewing the claims of advocates of deregulation, like those you've heard from today. And I've reviewed with particular interest the Pacific Legal Foundation report, which I understand inspired this hearing.  </p><p>That report tells a story of unaccountable civil servants imposing exorbitant cost on the public through unconstitutional procedures. For reasons I will explain, I don't share that dark view of how things work in government and I'd like to explain why not. </p><p>To begin with, the--the report cites a recent study by the Mercatus Center, which Mr. Broughel mentioned earlier today, which alleges that federal regulations are costing the federal economy--the U.S. economy $4 trillion per year. This exorbitant cost is cited as evidence of a regulatory state run amuck that needs to be reined in. What you need to understand is that that figure comes from a single unpublished study that derides its estimate not by actually measuring the cost of regulation, but by constructing a hypothetical model of the economy, which basically assumes what it ought to prove, that regulations always produce growth, never promote growth. Like, for example, keeping workers healthy. Like, for example, avoiding market meltdowns that cause thing--things like the 2008 recession. </p><p>So, obviously, you can prove pretty much anything you want if you construct a hypothetical model that builds your conclusions into the premises of the model. So, I suggest we begin by setting that $4 trillion cost estimate to one side. </p><p>I then want to turn to the claim that the agencies are issuing all manner of unconstitutional rules because, as you've just heard, they appear in the Federal Register over the signature of senior civil servants and not political appointees. This is a very novel and creative argument, but in my judgment, it reads way too much into the name appearing at the end of the rule while ignoring how the administrative process actually works. What I would like to suggest is that what matters to accountability in the rulemaking process is not who signs the rule, but who signs off on the rule and who was accountable for the rule and responsible for that rule before it can be issued. </p><p>Let's just take as an example the FDA rule to regulate vaping, which the PLF report uses as its prime example. That rule was, indeed, signed by Leslie Kux, a very senior and very capable civil servant, but what the PLF neglects to mention is that before the rule was issued, it was reviewed multiple times by the Food and Drug commissioner himself. In fact, I spoke with the FDA commissioner who dealt with this rule, Dr. Robert Califf, by phone the other day. He told me there were probably a dozen or so meetings in which he personally reviewed the vaping rule or aspects of the vap--vaping rule and grappled with issues surrounding it. He personally signed off on issuing it.  </p><p>The rule then went to the HHS secretary who also personally reviewed the rule. He had several meetings on the rule over the course of the rulemaking with the secretary, he tells me. The rule was then approved by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the White House, which is a--which is an O--OMB office that is--that is, again, he--led by a career appointed civil servant. Only after clearing these multiple levels of review by political appointees was the rule issued over the signature of Leslie Kux, career civil servant. </p><p>The point is that at the FDA and across government, civil servants may have their name appear at the end of the rule, but any significant rule goes out if and only if their political overseers review and approve it. These overseers are accountable to Congress, to the president, ultimately to taxpayers. The buck stops with them. The signature appearing at the end of the rule is, in my view, really beside the point.  </p><p>The last thing I want to mention and address is--is the wor--is the worry that agency regulations are coming--issuing forth under old delegations of authority that are broadly worded. Is this a bad thing? I don't think so. And let me offer you just a simple example to illustrate what I mean. The Public Health Service Act first passed in 1944 authorizes the detention and quarantine of, \"Any individual reasonably believed to be infected with incommunicable disease in a qualifying stage.\" No one had heard of Ebola when this act was passed in 1944, but Ebola came along. And the question is should the CDC have been required to go back to Congress and get a specific authorization to address Ebola before responding to it? Clearly, no. They did the right thing by using the broad authority delegated to them in real time.  </p><p>The problem is that Congress--that most of modern regulation, whether they're of the benefits kind or of a--of regulatory form or highly technical and complex and those circumstances just don't favor congressional micromanagement of rulemaking. Agencies need broad delegation and Congress does have tools to rein them in through the appropriations process, through the oversight process, and through the--through--through simple law making as well as Congressional Review Act if they overstep their mark.  </p><p>I will leave it at that and I'll be happy to address further questions in the question and answer period, if you so in--are so inclined. Thank you. </p><p>PAUL: Great. Thanks for your testimony. I think in some ways, you know, whether or not it's a Senate-approved person who signed off on it or a low level thing isn't as--as--as big a problem is that we have to either agree or disagree do we have too much of an unelected bureaucracy writing rules. I think our founding fathers never imagined an enormous bureaucracy with millions of people in it. When they talked about the non-delegation doctrine, the idea that you can't give away your powers even if you want to, Congress is not allowed to, I don't think we adhere to that nearly as strictly as our founding fathers intended us to. And I think it's kind of hard to make the argument that there isn't an overzealous nature to regulation when they're, you know, telling us how many cherries need to be in a cherry pie. And I--I just kind of think probably no one's going to be losing their life whether there's 42 cherries or 41 cherries. And probably we could list 10,000 examples like that, you know, as you look through government. </p><p>So, I think there is a problem. The pendulum's gone way too far. I'd love to go all the way back to where government was intended, but may not get there. But, for certain, I think part of the hearing and I think what should come forward here is that the pendulum swung way too far in the direction of having unelected people make these decisions, often making decisions that could lead to $100 million worth of costs, major regulations for the economy. But, not only for the economy, for the government. </p><p>I'm not so sure I agree with if we confirmed everybody. I've been here. It's hard to get to know all the nominees. It's hard enough just confirming the ones we confirm to get validity to what you're--what the people are actually telling you. Most of the time, you ask them to make a judgment if they want to be head of the FDA and they'll say, well, I can't comment on anything that's going to come before my committee. Same way Supreme Court works, which is--is very difficult. </p><p>But, what I would say is that the one thing that tends to work when you have people on both sides of things, it tends to find justice is when you have advocates in the judicial system. There's a lear--there's an attorney for the defense and an attorney for the state and the prosecution and they battle and we get a version of the truth by what comes forward. And so, one of the things I think would actually work is if we actually have a taxpayer advocate involved with regulation or if we talked about the mandate. So, for example, we have a--the fed has a mandate, you know, for price stability and employment. People always debate, well, what if we change their mandate? What if we change the mandate for regulators that's not just to regulate, but it's to regulate in how we talked about some of these other ideas, the--that the cost would have to be part of it. I don't know if that's even part of their mandate. </p><p>I can tell you as a physician that over a 20-year career, day after day, year after year there's always new regulations added. I can't point to almost any of them that--that help with quality. Almost all of them are pushing paper. In fact, I think there's so much paper to push that it might distract you from actually missing something that you shouldn't miss because you're not paying attention to the patient. Never does the joint hospital association come and say, you know what? We've gone too far and this year we're going to take away a regulation. And so, this is the nature of the beast. Government gets bigger and bigger and bigger because nobody ever takes away from it.  </p><p>So, I've been an advocate and we put this forward and I think Senator Johnson and other people have put it forward, repeal two for every one you add. Just force people to look and go, oh, that would be terrible. It'd be so indiscriminate. You'd get rid of something that's going to save people's lives. We've got hundreds of thousands of regulations. We've got stupid ones, like how many cherries are in the cherry pie. For goodness sakes, let's review all of these things.  </p><p>But, I think the idea that we're too stupid to be involved with regulations and that the scientists and the regulators know better than us, they're not responsive to people and they hear one side. And so, I think it's a one-sided debate. So, I think we really do need a taxpayer advocate. The same goes for all of these things. The National Science Foundation. We print something probably once a week on, you know, crazy research, you know, how--are Japanese quail more sexually promiscuous on cocaine? Are people more or less likely to eat food if the person in front of them in the--in the cafeteria line sneezes on the food? Two million bucks from NIH. The one for the Japanese quail, $300,000. And people say, well, Congress, you're not smart enough to decide who gets grant. I think actually the opposite. </p><p>What I would do for all the grant process for scientists is if it's behavioral science, I'd make sure that every committee has someone representing the diabetes community of science, the cardiothoracic, the Alzheimer's, the cancer. I'd have all of those on every committee and I'd have a taxpayer advocate. Right now, if you want a behavioral science, which is where a lot of the crummy research comes from, the people reviewing it are the people who will then review your--your--you know, they review you, you review them the next time. It's a small group of people on the same field and the taxpayers are never represented. That's the way I feel for regulations as well. Maybe if we had an adversarial thing where there was an advocate for the marketplace, an advocate for, you know, arguing what is the cost of this regulation? Should we do it?  </p><p>But, Mr. Berry, what--what do you think of the--that idea? I'm not saying I wouldn't--would vote against confirming more people. I'm just not sure it gets to the point. But, whether or not we actually got someone into the process who was an advocate or maybe change the mandate of what we tell regulators to do. </p><p>BERRY: That seems like a very promising idea to me. It's sort of the first--first time I've heard of something like that. But, I think the--the--the key point is that, as you said, the legislative branch is not underequipped to sort of deal with these issues of a lack of expertise that a lot of people often bring up. I think, in many cases, though, it's blurred the lines between advice and helping drafting versus final decision making. And the system that was set up is that 535, yes, generalists in the legislature who are not necessarily experts on quail or anything like this would take in advice from many sides, including--I think it's a great idea to take in advice from a taxpayer advocate and would synthesize those and ultimately come to a decision that synthesizes those. </p><p>And I'd analogize it to Senate-confirmed judges who are generalists who are not experts in necessarily the medical issues that come before them in malpractice cases, but who we rely on to make the final decision based on the credibility of the experts that come before them. So, I want to emphasize that our proposal and I think your proposal also doesn't say no expert--we should kick all the experts out of Washington. It simply says we shouldn't allow them to have final decision-making authority that doesn't end run around the only people who are political accountable. </p><p>PAUL: Yeah. And you could even call the advocate--the judges on grants or something to be a lay scientific graduate, someone with a science degree that comes from a lay perspective as a generalizing. But, we've got to have more because this stuff's been going on since the time of Proxmire. I mean, everybody complai--he complained about ways the same--you know, there was a study, a $50,000 trying to study what makes people happy and he made such fun of it in 1972. It's still going on. None of that has improved an iota since 1972. And it's really because we give them more money and they won't ever conserve their money into--or--or spend it more wisely until they have less of it. </p><p>Dr. Broughel, do you want to comment on the thoughts of a--either a taxpayer advocate or a--a lay advocate? And also, do you think it's enough--you talked about having some reporting requirements, which I think might help, but I just wonder if it's enough to actually transform the situation. </p><p>BROUGHEL: So, there is a--there are--when the Administrative Procedure Act was passed in 1946, it actually created two pro--procedures for creating regulations. One is the--the way that we're used to, notice in comment rulemaking, agency's propose a rule, take comments from the public, finalize them. Another is called formal rulemaking, which is actually not used very often, but could be used and it would establish trial-like procedures for regulations where an agency would have to present its case, provide evidence, provide witnesses. Those witnesses could be cross-examined and someone like a taxpayer advocate could be-- </p><p>PAUL: --Are you saying some of that exists already? </p><p>BROUGHEL: It's part of the Administrative Procedure Act. It's called formal rulemaking. It's just that it's-- </p><p>PAUL: --Is it ever used-- </p><p>BROUGHEL: --Rarely used-- </p><p>PAUL: --In that fashion? </p><p>BROUGHEL: What's that? </p><p>PAUL: Is it ever used in that fashion? </p><p>BROUGHEL: There are some specific agencies, like EPA and OSHA that can--used it in some cases. But, in--as a general matter, it's not used very often. Sometimes-- </p><p>PAUL: --And see--and this is, I guess, my point, is--is that you get one side. The people appointed and who want to become regulators-- </p><p>BROUGHEL: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>PAUL: --want to regulate. </p><p>BROUGHEL: Right. </p><p>PAUL: They don't become a regulator because they think, well, the government--the marketplace would handle this better. They already have the predisposition to thinking reg--regulations work. So, maybe if you had a--more of an adversarial-- </p><p>BROUGHEL: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>PAUL: --process, you'd get market advocates saying, well, yeah, it may work, but you may have--no longer have an industry and--and talk about the ramifications of something in advance and it's--it's how you find truth. How do we find truth? I've got facts on my side. Senator Hassan's going to have facts and opinion on her side. How do we find truth? By discussing it and then finally letting somebody vote on it. But, no, that's good. Did you have a further point you want to make? </p><p>BROUGHEL: I would--I would just say anyone who's submitted a comment to an agency is part of the notice and comment process knows it's very easy for them to dismiss you if they--if they want to. As a general rule, it seems like they've made up their minds often before they've even proposed a regulation. So, it's very hard to see regulations change. It's hard for--just a--a member of the general public to make a difference. </p><p>PAUL: Right. </p><p>BROUGHEL: But, if there was more of an adversarial process, it could be--that could make it more possible. </p><p>PAUL: Senator Hassan. </p><p>HASSAN: Well, thank you. And--thank you. And I--I--I see that Mr. Parker would like to respond to a couple of these things, but if I can ask a couple of questions first, Mr. Parker, and then--and then I think we'll have the opportunity for discussion. And I--I do want to just kind of point out that there is a significant regulatory process that some might argue is significantly more transparent than the process Congress uses to make laws. And there are comments that come in on regulations supporting, for instance, net neutrality, but Congress went ahead and overruled those comments and withdrew the net neutrality regulations. So, I'm not sure that all of the problems here rest with the regulatory process. </p><p>But, I want to just start with a couple of questions to Mr. Parker because I believe sometimes it is necessary and appropriate for agencies to update their rules to reflect new information or other changes that come to light from the outside world. Mr. Parker, could you provide an example you--you talked about Ebola, but of how agencies have updated their rules within their existing statutory authority to address current issues that have emerged? </p><p>PARKER: True. I think if--if you go through the Code of Federal Regulations, you'll find that the vast majority of--of rules that are--that are issued are either very minor rules, like rules having to do with the opening and closing of the quail season or drawbridge times or else they are revisions to prior rules. They're updated all the time. They're modified all the time. It's very cumbersome to modify them, actually, because of the notice and comment rulemaking process and the--and the analytical requirements that have been imposed on it. </p><p>But, you--you know, whether--whether it's emission standards for vinyl chloride or whether it's eligibility standards for benefits program, you'll find that rules modify rules all the time. The only way that any rule can be modified is by issuing another rule and people need to understand that. So, when you talk about 3,000, 4,000 rules issued a day, many of them--a year, many of them are--are rules that just change other rules and make them better in response to comment from the public and problems raised by the public. </p><p>HASSAN: Okay. That--that is helpful. Following that point, I think it's important to acknowledge that agencies do work that Congress cannot. Namely, crafting policies with a level of expertise that's outside the scope of what we do on the Hill and reacting to emerging threats-- </p><p>PARKER: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>HASSAN: --through health and safety. In many circumstances, the benefits of regulations outweigh the cost. Can you just give us an example or two--you started to--on the benefits, Mr. Parker, of agency rulemaking to the American people? </p><p>PARKER: Well, I think to understand the benefits of rulemaking to the American people, you have to go back to what the world looked like--what the United States looked like before the expansion of the administrative state really began in earnest. President Trump made news by saying he wanted to return the Code of Federal Regulations to the size that it was in 1960, when it was about one-tenth the size that it is now. Well, in 1960, EPA did not exist. Occupational Safety and Health Administration did not exist. You know, the air was--was so filthy that killer smogs were killing people, you--you--you know, in a matter of days and weeks, not even in the matter of months and years. Lake Cuyahoga caught on fire, right? </p><p>So--so, regulations have--have had a huge impact in promoting health safety and protecting the environment. Yes, they are complex, but they have accomplished an awful lot. And let me just say that there is a tendency to think of agencies as the sort of the father knows best and mother knows best, the--the--the know-it-alls, the experts. In my experience, working with agencies and I've--in my consulting capacity, I've actually led rulemaking exercises for agencies--negotiated rulemaking exercises. What I have found is that agencies don't have the expertise to make good rules in these complex areas, like vinyl chloride standards or auto safety standards.  </p><p>They rely on industry and they work collaboratively with industry to get the information that they need. Industry is very much consulted throughout the rulemaking process. And it's just not true that industry and--and the regulated community have no say in how the rule reads. In fact, what I teach in administrative law is case after case where the agency ignored an agency comment and then was then reversed for failing to do that. One classic example is a case involving the--the regulation of--of smoked white fish. The Nova Scotia case where an agency, you know, did issue a bad rule, they didn't take into account of--of the industry comments. And when the case came to court, the court said you didn't respond to the comments. You didn't listen to this industry. This rule is arbitrary and capricious and the court throws it out. </p><p>HASSAN: Okay. </p><p>PARKER: Agencies worry about that and as a result, they do listen and that's one of the things that makes them--that's an inf--you know, we always say that agencies are not accountable and Congress is, but this fear of judicial review, this fear of judicial oversight is a real check on agency powers that makes them--that forces them to listen to--to industry when they speak and to stakeholders when they speak. </p><p>HASSAN: Well, okay. Thank you for that as well. And I wanted to touch on one more thing before my time come up and--and then we can move back to--to the chair. I--I think we should also acknowledge Congress's role in holding agencies accountable to the--the statutes we enact and we have several ways of doing that. With that in mind, I'd like to turn, Mr. Parker, to the Pacific Legal Foundation's article on the role of career civil servants-- </p><p>PARKER: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>HASSAN: --at the Food and Drug Administration in the role (PH) making--rulemaking process. I have profound respect for federal employees and the work that they do, but I agree that it is imperative that we have accountability in the rulemaking process and you just talked about the judicial oversight providing part of that. What role would a career civil servant, rather than a political appointee, serve in that process? Why might a career civil servant's name ultimately end up on the final rule? </p><p>PARKER: Yeah, that's a great question and I actually asked that question of Commissioner Califf when I talked to him on the phone. And he said, well, there--there's--there's this sort of tradition of putting the name at the bottom. It's--I think it's a way of just sort of--I--I think of it as something like the person who packs the parachute has to jump their own parachute every so often. It's a way of saying this is the person who was responsible for coordinating this rule and for putting it together. It's the associate commissioner for policy, that's been the tradition. It's a way of sort of honoring them, recognizing them, holding them accountable. But, it's not to say, and I don't think it is meant to say that it is their authority which authorizes the rule. It is not to say that they were solely responsible for issuing that rule.  </p><p>This is an FDA rule that goes out and it has to be reviewed and approved by the FDA. And the FDA political appointees and the FDA itself is responsible for every single rule that they issue.  </p><p>HASSAN: Okay. Thank you very much. Mr. Chair. </p><p>PAUL: I agree with Senator Hassan that a lot of the problem--there--there is congressional responsibility that we've abdicated. So, ultimately, it is our fault. We don't--we don't do our job. And particularly with writing legislation, the legislation is very, very loose and then people are surprised. Oh, my goodness, they're doing this and we had no idea they were--that we even gave them power to do this. And it happens not in--just in sort of environmental regulations. It happens in, you know, regulations of your privacy as well. So, for example, when the PATRIOT Act passed, James Sensenbrenner in the House was a big advocate for it and one of the authors of it and, you know, pretty much thought it was a good thing. And then when all of the sudden Snowden revealed that, you know, billions of people were having their phone calls recorded by the government under the pretense of that, he says, no, no, no, that's not what we intended at all.  </p><p>And not only that, the intelligence community at that time really closed his ranks and really probably even bigger and worse than all of the sort of the business or environmental regulations are the things that happen in our intelligence community that no rank (INAUDIBLE) senator is ever told about. And I think there's a great abuse of congressional authority. But, once again, we could write stricter rules and we could do it, but in the end, what happens and what comes forward is congressmen are lazy and they say, oh, it's to fight terrorism. So, you don't care about civil liberties. We're going to fight terrorism. So, everything just flows on and it gets worse and worse. </p><p>You know, examples of--of--of how people get kind of crazy crossways with regulations, there was another one in our state. We had a lake where the earthen dam was fa--go--possibly going to fail, so we decided to repair it and they--they dropped the lake by 40 feet. So, some enterprising environmentalists went into the area where the lake was lowered and low and behold, they found some dusky darters there. And they then hypothesized that if we put the lake water back in the lake, we might hurt the dusky darter.  </p><p>Well, the government created the lakes and we had a big fight over the government taking property in the 1930s, but we kind of decided that one, it's over. We got a lake. Now, we've got these marinas and the environmentalists are saying, oh, you can't fill up back the lake because you might hurt the dusky darter, to which I responded was, well, don't they live in water? Won't they like more water? But, you can see the craziness that you can kind of get into on some of this stuff. And fortunately, there, saner heads did prevail, but we have a lot of stuff like that. I'll give you a--another example from endangered species. </p><p>We have the pocketbook mussel that's supposedly endangered and people say, well, you are just a senator and you know nothing of science and you should not get involved with this at all. Well, they studied the population of it probably, I don't know, 30 years ago in about five places and said, oh, there's a shortage of them, you know, or they're endangered. Well, since that time, there have been 20 more studies and everywhere you look, you find one of these things. They're everywhere. You--you know, if you've ever seen mussels propagate, I've got a pond behind my house. You can't stop mussels. They come in on the birds. They come in from everywhere. There are mussels everywhere. There is no shortage of this mussel. It's been found in 30 other places. We can't get it off the endangered species list because really those people don't work for us. They--they're sort of in charge of it or we just abdicate and we fail to tell them it's time to take the, you know, the pocketbook mussel off, but it's a big racket, too. </p><p>So, what happens is any time you want to build something in any state that has a--supposedly the--the pocketbook mussel, you got to get a consultant. It's almost always approved, but it cost you a hundred grand for the consultant. It's a huge racket. They're all in lig with this and they love the--the--the consultants love the regulators because they have a whole racket going on this. We have archaeology consultants and pocketbook mussel consultants. They always have to be paid. </p><p>Another example of how you pay the regulators. Bats. We say that the Indiana bat is--there's a shortage of Indiana bats. They're--they're rare of whatever. It's really hard, even for scientists, to tell the difference between that and the brown bat, which there are a gazillion brown bats. They say you can't cut down your tree. Oh, no, no, you can cut down your trees if you pay us. It's, like, really? If cutting down the trees is going to hurt the bat, why wouldn't you just say we can't cut them down, you just have to pay the government money? So, it isn't really about the bat. It's about exchanging money.  </p><p>But, this goes throughout government. I mean, we could spend days and days and days of talking about regulations that have run amuck, but we really have to figure out the conclusion of where we are on the spectrum of--of belief of whether the government is too big or too small. And I don't think it's zero government versus totalitarianism, but I would say that the pendulum has--has--has been gradually growing and growing and growing for more unelected rules and laws and we do need to do something about it. </p><p>I like the idea of looking at the regulatory mission, cost--mandating cost analysis. Maybe confirming more of the regulators. I'm not sure if it would work or not. But, I really like the idea of maybe utilizing some of the trial process that--that we have and see if there's a way to do that and bring in the adversarial nature to it. Some of that would probably just take an executive who chooses to--to police the executive branch that way. But, any other suggestions on the idea of trial process? Or, does anybody know anything more about how we actually do use a trial process? Any of you? Mr. Parker.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: Well-- </p><p>PAUL: --Professor Parker. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Go ahead. Go ahead. </p><p>PARKER: Yes, (INAUDIBLE) are--are--are familiar with a time when ru--formal rulemaking was actually used and tried. There's a famous story about how it took 12 years to figure out how to label peanut butter using formal rulemaking. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>PAUL: My guess is the marketplace figured it out before that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>PARKER: The problem with formal--with trial type procedures applied--and I'm going to--I'm going to take issue with your idea and then I'm going to offer constructive alternative, which is a--of a similar nature. The problem with formal rulemaking applied to--or trial type procedures applied to rulemaking is that there are many different actors--there are many different industry positions in any given rule. There are many--many different ways of doing things, many different production processes that produce different kinds of pollution, et cetera. And I've--and--and in my work at convening negotiated rulemaking exercises, I've discovered that industry is not just one thing. There are many different actors in the regulated community. Many different beneficiaries as well. </p><p>If you have--you can't have everybody cross-examining everybody else. You can't have everybody--it just doesn't--it's not like a trial. It just doesn't work that way. This is a polycentric exercise. The idea of a rule is its--its general applicability and future effect. So, how do you get this? How--but--but you're right that these people--these folks need to be consulted. They need to be consulted for their expertise and they need to be--be consulted for the legitimacy of the process.  </p><p>One way that I think could capture a lot of what you're trying to do is greater use of negotiated rulemaking, which I have personal experience with. Full disclosure. I've been paid for doing it. So, I like it. But, I'm--I'm not--I--I--I am not pushing for me to do this. I'm saying this is a process that really works. What negotiated rulemaking does is it's another way of coming up with a proposed rule or a revision to a rule, but it requires that the industry be at the table. It requires that the population community be at the table and that regulators be at the table. It's presided over by a neutral facilitator or convener, which is what I did. But, everybody is heard and it's in a wonderful--it's a magnificent BS detector, right? Because if you say something that's wrong, you will be called out by other experts and other stakeholders around the table right then and there. </p><p>PAUL: Right. No, I think it does-- </p><p>PARKER: --So, that--that might be something that you could explore and that would be doable. </p><p>PAUL: No, and we're open to that and we will look at that. I think that the other thing that has to come into this is every regulation can't be looked at through either an adversarial process or even this kind of process. But, we set dollar limits or whatever and we figure out and certain of them will be and more important ones absolutely should be. But, you mentioned industry a couple of times and I think it's important from the understanding that I don't consider myself to be an advocate of any industry or for industry in general. I'm an advocate for capitalism and the marketplace, for people mostly being left alone if they don't hurt others. </p><p>So, what I would say is my experience up here has found that most industry loves regulation. Big banks love all the regulation, all the compliance because there's a compliance cost. They can absorb the compliance cost and the new guys can't. Small banks don't like the regulations, big banks don't care. They've already hired it, they've baked it into the pie. And so, often you get that. The other thing that's in--particularly infuriating to me is that businesses coming up here all the time saying we hate California's regulations. Please, regulate us nationally. So, every business group comes to me and wants to be regulated now and I say beware, you don't know who the next president's going to be. You don't know who the next Congress will be. And then with the flip of the switch, the national rule will become California's rule. </p><p>But, it's all this getting away from there being, you know, places where you can seek refuge. You know, the states to seek refuge from the federal government. And I think that's a--a big mistake. Do we--Dr. Broughel, do you have any comment on industry, you know, business actually promoting or actually liking regulation to keep out competition? </p><p>BROUGHEL: Absolutely. I mean, there's a well-known phenomenon in economic--in the economic literature known as regulatory capture, which is the idea that regulatory agencies tend to get captured by the industries they regulate and serve their interests. And when I made that comment earlier about being ignored in the public commenting process, I wasn't referring to industry. I was referring to members of the ordinary public who really have trouble making a difference. And the reason is very often because regulatory agencies have sat down with industry before they've even proposed a regulation, hashed out some kind of deal or arrangement with them, and then it's only at that point that they propose a regulation and the public has a--an opportunity-- </p><p>PAUL: --Right-- </p><p>BROUGHEL: --to chime in. </p><p>PAUL: And I think it's hard because people don't look forward to the unintended consequences of it. So, right now, everybody's up in a roar about surprise billing in medicine. So, we're going to regulate what people can charge and they have to accept a certain rate. Five years from now, we're going to come back and say, oh, my God, I can't believe we did this. We've now regulated maybe 75 percent of the medical transactions because it's going to be everyone associated with a hospital. Over half the doctors are associated with hospitals now. So, it's not just going to be ER doctors. It's going to be doctors.  </p><p>And then as that increases, it's going to be every transaction. And then we're going to find out that we have shortages because people are going to say I don't want--I--I'm not even in the network. Why should I offer a discount? Now, I got to take the discount and all the power will devolve to the insurance companies and all the complaints we have about big insurance are going to be worse, but nobody realizes that because nobody's thinking through the end result of that. </p><p>HASSAN: And--and--and actually, I'll just say that I--I think we are trying to address that very issue in the version of the surprise medical billing because there's been a good back and forth. So, you know, I don't want to turn this into a HELP hearing, but I--I do want you to know that that's being a--hashed out. </p><p>PAUL: Let's hope because it's sort of the inadvertent result is that people say, well, insurance companies are getting bi--too big, tech is getting too big. And then we attempt to regulate it, but we make it worse. Doctors are small potatoes in this. Hospitals are fairly small potatoes compared to the insurance companies. So, when we do something that the insurance companies all love, we should be a little bit wary that we're now--but, we're also getting involved in the marketplace. We are going to dictate what the rates are for medicine and who can join, who can't join networks. And the thing that isn't really discussed is some doctors want to be in the network and are excluded for it because it's a--it's a monetary thing. And then some doctors say, well, they're only offering me $50. Why should I be in the network?  </p><p>And so, they don't take the $50 and guess what? They--they promote and then they--they--now, they're going to say, well, you got to take $50. So, you're stuck. You don't get in the network and you're going to be stuck with the 50 bucks. And it's, like, if you were in the trucking business or selling carpet or pens or glasses, would you want the government to tell you how much you can sell things? I think it's a terrible disaster that's going to unfold from all this. </p><p>HASSAN: Well, I--again, not wanting to turn this into a HELP education--Health, Education, Labor And Pension's hearing, which Senator Paul and I both serve on, I am going to have to go in a minute. So, I just wanted to thank all of you very much for your testimony, for your attention to this. I would look forward to continuing this discussion both with the chairman and with all of you because I actually thought I heard some levels of agreement among the three of you, including, you know, there--there's a role of judicial oversight that is important here.  </p><p>There are--is a role, obviously, of congressional oversight, but there's also some really good ideas. And some really, I think, joined and common concerns about how we make sure that members of the public actually really have a voice in the regulatory process, something hard to do in a capitalist democracy, but we're a capitalist democracy. So, that's where people--regular people are supposed to come in. And it's a reminder to--to members of Congress that we are supposed to be taxpayer advocates, too. So, I would look forward to that continued discussion. I'm sorry, I have to go to another meeting. But, thank you all for very illuminating testimony and for your fine work. </p><p>PAUL: Thank you, Senator Hassan. And we'll keep working with your office to try to find common ground, to find reform type of legislation that we can sign on to from some of these ideas. And I know our staffs are continuing to talk.  </p><p>At this point, be--being the libertarian that I am, I'm going to say, is there anything else you want to say? But, you got to keep it under about two minutes or so apiece. Mr. Berry. </p><p>BERRY: Sure. Thank you. I just wanted to briefly comment on what--what Professor Parker brought up about Commissioner Califf's claim that these procedures, really they always go up to the top and that the name on the brief doesn't matter so much. The FDA in litigation against the deeming rule where I represent some clients who sued against it conceded that the associate commissioner for policy was the one who issued the rule. And they conceded that it was under her rulemaking authority that had been subdelegated by the FDA commissioner.  </p><p>And when they attempted--and so, the entire crux of the case is not whether she issued the rule. They admit she did. It's whether she was validly appointed as an inferior officer and whether inferior officers, in her case, can constitutionally issue rules. </p><p>And the second interesting thing is that they cited every statute they could for supervision, but they didn't have one that essentially showed that the FDA commissioner has to sign off on these rules. They had one that said the FDA commissioner can also issue rules, but that's sort of obvious. They have concurrent authority. And the only oversight they cited was one that said highly significant public policy question rules can be reviewed by the HHS secretary, but presumably don't have to. And given that only about 2 percent of FDA rules have the signature of the FDA commissioner, HHS secretary, it seems like that's a pretty small number of them.  </p><p>And given also what we've said about political accountability and how people want to know that their ru--comments are at least being heard by someone, I don't think it's just a formality of whose name appears on the rules. I think that's what people--the general public is going to look at. And when these things are done behind the scenes, you kind of--higher ups can play it both ways. If a rule becomes popular, they can say, oh, yeah, I was very closely involved in that. And if it's not popular, they can say, my--my name's not on it. </p><p>PAUL: Anybody else? Professor Parker. </p><p>PARKER: I'll just say that when the public or a member of the public sues to challenge a rule for being arbitrary and capricious are a violation of law, the lawsuit doesn't read so and so versus Leslie Kux. The law reads so and so versus the FDA or the FDA commissioner, right? The lawsuit--it is the commissioner who's ultimately responsible. And these-- </p><p>PAUL: (INAUDIBLE) have to do with sovereign law or something where you have to sue the government or not. </p><p>PARKER: And--I don't know. But, the--but, the agency is ultimately responsible in court and--and to you--accountable to you for every rule that goes out over--over the FDA's signature, right? And I don't think anybody has ever said--come to you and said, well, I don't know about that rule. Leslie Kux issued that rule. I don't--you know, I--I don't defend that rule, right? </p><p>PAUL: I think the bigger question is not really actually on who individually it is, whether it's higher up or the middle management or the lower management. It's a little disconcerting if it's a huge rule and lower management is doing the rule. But, I think the bigger concern is are we involved with too many rules in our world or too few? And I think that if you look--I just find it hard to believe that the evidence isn't overwhelming that our government's gotten too big and too involved. And like I say, there's lists of--of thousands of ridiculous things, like the how many cherries in a cherry pie, how many apples in an apple pie that really we finally got somebody--you know, the current administration got rid of some of that stuff and threw it out. But, those things have been on the books for--for decades and decades and decades. </p><p>So, I think we do have to consider whether we do too many things or too few things. And I don't think anybody's arguing for no regulations, really. I mean, we're arguing for whether you want more or less. And it's sort of the argument we have here in government for--for taxes. Do you want more or less? Nobody's ar--arguing for zero. Nobody's arguing for 100 percent. But, with corporate taxes, it's very clear, there's a division between the parties. One party wanted to keep a 35 percent corporate and the other party wanted a 21 percent and it was a clear demarcation more versus less. </p><p>PARKER: I would just say one thing, that you're absolutely right that the fou--founding fathers did not contemplate the growth of the modern administrative state. </p><p>PAUL: We can definitely agree on that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>PARKER: We can agree on that? They also did not complicate--contemplate modern aviation or modern cars or the explosion of--the proliferation of toxic chemicals, none of which existed. These are all manmade chemicals, none of which existed in their day. So-- </p><p>PAUL: --I would--I would probably take a--take a--an argument with that in the sense that they--they did have significant pollution back then. They had airborne things. Probably in many ways more than we have now. Lon--the air of London was worse in the time of our founding fathers than it is today. This is a lot of things that people don't really realize about the environment. The EPA has published that of the six main pollutants in our environment, they have been reduced by 70 percent over the last 40 or 50 years. But, the real bad pollution that we had in--in our history was when everybody burned their own fossil-- </p><p>PARKER: --Yes-- </p><p>PAUL: --fuel in their fireplace. And so, by concentrating on utilities-- </p><p>PARKER: --That's right-- </p><p>PAUL: --Actually, the air is much cleaner than it actually used to be. Dr. Broughel, final comment? </p><p>BROUGHEL: I would just add that I--I think the idea of pursuing more negotiated rulemaking sounds like an interesting idea. I think--I think--believe that formal rulemaking can work and has worked in the past. Some critics have said it takes too long, but I think the--that the evidence is that-- </p><p>PAUL: --That sounds like, to me, an advantage, that it might take a long time to get a new regulation. </p><p>BROUGHEL: Well, it's also just not true. For example, the peanut regulation, it wasn't formal rulemaking that dragged that process on and on for years. It was other factors. It just happened that that rule also went through formal rulemaking. But, I'm also serving on a negotiated rulemaking right now for the Department of Energy and I'm the consumer representative on this--on this working group. And it's an interesting experience. I don't--wouldn't say it works perfectly. It would be nice if there were more--if there were more people like me on that--on that working group because I'm essentially--there's lots of representatives for industry. There's lots of representatives for the energy efficiency activists, but there aren't really more representatives for just the people. So, if you had a taxpayer representative or more consumer representatives that could balance that out, I think that would be a good thing. </p><p>PAUL: I think that's a good idea. We'll send you a summary of what we think or some of the ideas we've discussed. Feel free to comment back to us. If you have ideas in general in the future, always feel free to communicate-- </p><p>BROUGHEL: --Love to-- </p><p>PAUL: --With us because we do consider you to be experts on various sides of the issue and we--we'd like to hear from you. But, thank you all for coming. Meeting adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMP-3R61-JDPT-T3VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

The report was advanced by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, on Aug. 10.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I. Purpose and Summary</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">S. 3455, the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop standards and guidelines, consistent with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2014, to remove the TikTok application from Federal information technology devices and platforms. The standards and guidelines developed by OMB must be developed in consultation with the General Services Administration (GSA), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the Department of Defense (DoD). The bill includes an exemption for law enforcement activities, national security interests and activities, and security researchers.</p><p>II. Background and the Need for Legislation</p><p>In November 2017, a Beijing-based media and technology company, ByteDance Limited (ByteDance), acquired a Shanghai-based social media company, Musical.ly, Inc. (Musical.ly) for approximately $1 billion./1/ At the time of acquisition, Musical.ly's flagship web application included a user base of over 60 million in the United States and Europe and its offices were located in Shanghai and Santa Monica, California./2/ In August 2018, ByteDance merged Musical.ly's web application with its own social media short-form video app, TikTok, managed by its subsidiary TikTok, Inc./3/ TikTok is estimated to have a global audience of approximately 800 million active users./4/</p><p>--</p><p>/1/Liza Lin and Rolfe Winkler, Social-Media App Musical.ly Is Acquired for as Much as $1 Billion, Wall St. J.

Sec. 3553.</p><p>--</p><p>III. Legislative History</p><p>Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced S. 3455, the No TickTok on Government Devices Act, on March 12, 2020, with Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) and Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR). The bill was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), John Kennedy (R-LA), and Martha McSally (R-AZ) later joined as cosponsors.</p><p>The Committee considered S. 3455 at a business meeting on July 22, 2020. Senator Hawley offered a substitute amendment that specifies that OMB, within 60 days of passage, shall issue standards and guidelines to Executive Branch agencies regarding the removal of the TikTok application from information technology (rather than previous language that would have banned the use of the application by Federal employees but without specific direction from OMB on how to do so), and makes minor technical corrections. The bill was ordered reported favorably as modified by the Hawley amendment by voice vote en bloc. Senators present for the en bloc vote on the amendment and the bill as amended were Johnson, Portman, Paul, Lankford, Romney, Scott, Enzi, Hawley, Peters, Carper, Hassan, Harris, and Rosen.</p><p>IV. Section-by-Section Analysis of the Bill, as Reported</p><p>Section 1. Short title</p><p>This section established that the bill may be referred to as the \"No TikTok on Government Devices Act\".</p><p>Section 2. Prohibition on the use of TikTok</p><p>Subsection (a) defines the terms \"covered application\", \"executive agency\", and \"information technology.\" Subsection (b) requires the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Administrator of GSA, the Director of CISA, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Secretary of Defense, and consistent with the information security requirements of FISMA, to develop standards and guidelines for the removal of covered applications from information technology.</p><p>This subsection also includes directs OMB to include in its standards and guidelines exemptions for law enforcement activities, national security interests and security researchers.</p><p>V. Evaluation of Regulatory Impact</p><p>Pursuant to the requirements of paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee has considered the regulatory impact of this bill and determined that the bill will have no regulatory impact within the meaning of the rules. The Committee agrees with the Congressional Budget Office's statement that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.</p><p>VI. Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate</p><p>U.S. Congress, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, DC</p><p>August 5, 2020</p><p>Hon. Ron Johnson, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC</p><p>Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 3455, the No TikTok on Government Devices Act.</p><p>If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew Pickford.</p><p>Sincerely, Phillip L. Swagel, Director</p><p>Enclosure.</p><p>S. 3455 would require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in consultation with other government agencies to develop guidelines that would require the removal of the social networking service TikTok from any executive branch information technology.</p><p>Several federal laws, regulations, and policies prohibit the use of government property for unauthorized purposes. S. 3455 would expand those prohibitions to include TikTok or any successor service provided by its developer. Some federal agencies including the Department of Defense have already banned TikTok from their devices. Based on the cost of similar requirements, CBO estimates that implementing S. 3455 would cost less than $500,000 over the 2020-2025 period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Those costs would primarily be for administrative expenses at OMB to develop the guidelines and for other government agencies to comply with the new restriction.</p><p>Enacting S. 3455 could affect direct spending by some agencies that are allowed to use fees, receipts from the sale of goods, and other collections to cover operating costs. CBO estimates that any net changes in direct spending by those agencies would be negligible because most of them can adjust amounts collected to reflect changes in operating costs.</p><p>The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew Pickford. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.</p><p>VII. Changes in Existing Law Made by the Bill, as Reported</p><p>Because this legislation would not repeal or amend any provision of current law, it would not make changes in existing law within the meaning of clauses (a) and (b) of paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate.</p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALIF., EX OFFICIO</p><p>      WITNESSES:      ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR ANTITRUST MAKAN DELRAHIM</p><p>      AND FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN JOSEPH SIMONS TESTIFY</p><p>      [*]      LEE:  (OFF-MIKE) It's also not subject to any effective acronym that I could think of, but it's the one that we've got to work with. We're pleased very much to have with us today the assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim and also the chairman of a Federal Trade Commission, Mr. Joseph Simons. And we welcome both of you and we appreciate your willingness to come to the subcommittee and we appreciate all the great work you do on behalf of the American people.</p><p>      The landscape in the antitrust world as well as in the Senate and beyond has changed immensely since our last oversight hearing of this kind was held back in 2016. For one, the Senate's failure to quickly process your nominations has contributed to confusion about American competition law and policy.</p><p>      Since January of 2017, I've had innumerable meetings with business executives and global regulators and consumers, all of whom want to know one thing, how the Trump administration approach antitrust and competition issues, how those issues and the way our government approaches them change and affect their lives.</p><p>      I've tried to answer those questions as best I could, but there's no substitute for leadership at the Department of Justice and at the Federal Trade Commission and some senators' insistence on delaying executive nominations, including non-controversial nominations like those of Mr. Delrahim and Mr. Simons, has undermined the nation's ability to provide leadership on competition policy. </p><p>      It has deprived businesses of clear guidance and has allowed regulators across the world to take a lead on important issues. Those regulators have often resolved issues in a way that may harm the interests of American businesses, American consumers and in a way that maybe inconsistent with American law.</p><p>      In addition, we're seeing a breakdown of sort of decades-long consensus concerning the proper approach to antitrust. For those following the topic of antitrust in the news, one would think that we were back in the days of the robber barons, politicians and pundits, many of them at least claim that the economy has become increasingly concentrated over the last 30 years with dire consequences for consumers and workers and for everyone else.</p><p>      As we explored in a hearing a few months ago in December of 2017, these critics are wrong about their core premise. It's extremely difficult to measure market concentration across the entire economy and in any event, fair-minded economists have explained that the reported increase in concentration should not be enough alone, in and of itself, to be of overwhelming concern to us.</p><p>      Nevertheless, critics of the current regime called for a fundamental transformation an antitrust law and competition policy, in particular they want competition policy to incorporate subjective and political goals into the analysis. I have strong concerns that that approach could result in antitrust enforcement that is unmoored from objective economic analysis and could invite the kind of corporate and political influence that modern antitrust policy has long sought to avoid and with good reason.</p><p>      It might reshape the economy to better fit some people's aesthetic preferences, but it would not make consumers better off. For those of us in the antitrust world, there's no alternative but to pick a side and to argue the merits.</p><p>      The United States has the oldest and the most well-developed body of antitrust case law dating back to when Congress passed the Sherman Act back in 1890. Over the years, the U.S. has been influential in how competition law has developed globally; however, few other nations have two competition authorities whose role it is to enforce antitrust laws. </p><p>      A bifurcated system such as the one that we have represented here today by the Department of Justice and by the FTC has the potential for incoherence if the two agencies' enforcement approaches are at odds with each other. Divergence in enforcement policy between the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice on the one hand and the Federal Trade Commission on the other hand is likely to result in confusion among international competition enforcers and lead to a harmful weakening of U.S. leadership and influence in the international antitrust community.</p><p>      Indeed, I have very real concerns that this kind of divergence, this kind of dysfunction is currently affecting the analysis of intellectual property licensing which could undermine efforts by U.S. companies to create and develop key technologies, the same key technologies that will help drive the U.S. economy forward.</p><p>      Let me say one additional word about what I consider to be appropriate competition enforcement policy. Antitrust law in this country has been developed primarily in the courts which allows adversaries to make their best case in each instance before an impartial judge. This approach may be lengthy, it may be time consuming, it maybe costly at times, in fact it almost always is in one way or another, but it has served us well for over 100 years of antitrust jurisprudence. I believe it is the most equitable way to flesh out the sparsely worded antitrust laws that we have.</p><p>      Side stepping this fair, historical process in favor of administrative rulemaking by unelected bureaucrats is a recipe for mischief that is not in the best interests of American consumers or businesses or the American economy or the world economy for that matter. With respect to the hardworking people at the FTC, it is Congress' job to write the laws. If we believe that we need to change the antitrust laws, then Congress should take up that mantel.</p><p>      I look forward to discussing these and other important topics with our witnesses today. In the meantime, we will hear from Senator Klobuchar for her opening statement.</p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We have long chaired this committee together and I am very pleased that we're having this oversight hearing. I am also pleased at all the interest, sudden interest in our antitrust hearing, that's great, that you'll all here and maybe some of it has to do with our guests. I don't think they're going to make a Saturday Night Live skit out of this hearing, but we are pleased -- pleased to be back in this room with the Assistant Attorney General Delrahim and also with FTC Chairman Simons.</p><p>      And while the chairman did mention some delay, I was -- I supported both of you as you know. And I think it's very important that we keep bipartisan work going on in this area.</p><p>      As both of our witnesses have now settled into their jobs, it's an appropriate time to review what your agencies are doing to protect competition and to address enforcement challenges. I just think back to my favorite game growing up which was Monopoly. The basic premise was that the more you owned, the more you made and there is always been that element in American capitalism. If you monopolize the board in that game by buying up multiple properties of the same color and covering them in rent-producing real estate, you could basically take your opponents out of the game, especially if you own the four railroads or maybe Park Place. I'm not going to get into the whole thing.</p><p>      But the issue right now is we're seeing more and more of this in the real world. One example, the failed merger between Norfolk Southern Railway and Canadian Pacific, something that we took on immediately after it was announced, but even without the merger, 90 percent of the freight traffic in this country is handled by only four railroads, which is the exact number of railroads on the Monopoly board.</p><p>      So that's the game, Monopoly, but this is the real world. Now, let me be clear, coming from a state that has many big very stable and very good companies, big by itself is not bad. And our witnesses here today, big certainly does not mean anticompetitive. But when big means market dominance, when big means there's not any innovation, when big means that consumer prices aren't going down, then it becomes an issue.</p><p>      Two-thirds of Americans have come to believe that the economy unfairly favors powerful interests. Many have raised concerns about higher levels of market concentration across our economy and it has understandably led to calls for more vigorous antitrust enforcement. So we are entering a watershed moment for antitrust. It's a moment that's been driven by a number of factors.</p><p>      First, our economy is experiencing a wave of industry consolidation that shows no signs of slowing, annual merger filings at the antitrust agencies have increased by more than 50 percent in the last five years. More than 50 percent in the last five years. </p><p>      Second, we are living in a time of rapid technological change that is reshaping our economy, but also concentrating power in the hands of relatively few companies. </p><p>      Third, the courts have become increasingly skeptical of antitrust enforcement continually raising the evidentiary bar for government enforces and private plaintiffs. Supreme Court cases like Trinco, Twombly, Legion and most recently Ohio v. American Express have made enforcing our antitrust laws more challenging, and potential changes to the make-up of the high court could even accelerate this trend.</p><p>      It's the right moment to ask whether the antitrust laws are up to the task of protecting competition in today's economy and whether our laws still promote their fundamental purpose, to promote competition and consumer welfare in this era or unprecedented change.</p><p>      We can all recognize that the stakes are high and the American people increasingly understand that competition is critical for their welfare, it means products and services are more affordable, it means more innovation, and it means more opportunities for new businesses and a more prosperous society. </p><p>      And effective federal antitrust enforcement is key, the FTC and the Antitrust Divisions must protect consumers from anticompetitive mergers and anticompetitive conduct despite the challenges that I just outlined.</p><p>      And a number of challenges remain. Dramatic increase in both size and number of mergers I mentioned. Since 2008, American firms have engaged in more 10 trillion in acquisitions and if you think things have been slowing down recently, you would be wrong. A record 2.5 trillion in mergers were announced in just the first half of this year. </p><p>      These deals are part of a pattern of horizontal consolidation and vertical integration that is transforming many of our important industries, and in some cases, threatening competition and consumer welfare. Reviewing these increasingly complex mergers and challenging them when appropriate can stretch limited agency resources.</p><p>      That's why I've introduced two antitrust bills focused on mergers. The first, the Merger Enforcement Improvement Act renews the federal government's commitment to antitrust enforcement. It would update merger filing fees for the first time since 2001. Think of all the changes to our economy since 2001 especially in the Internet space. It would lower the burden on small and medium-size businesses and ensuring that -- ensure that larger deals pay their fair share while also raising revenues.</p><p>      It would also require parties that enter into merger consent decrees to provide post-closing data to the agencies so they can determine if the remedies are actually protecting competition. How many times have we heard consent decrees were reached, but then after the fact, many parties come to us, to our offices and say, \"You know, this isn't really working.\" So that's contained in there as well as increasing fees on some of the mega mergers in order to pay for people to be as sophisticated as the companies that are making these mergers happen.</p><p>      The second bill, the Consolidation Prevention and Competition Promotion Act would restore the Clayton Act's original purpose of promoting competition by updating our legal standards. It strengthens the current legal standard to help stop harmful consolidation and codifies the structural presumption so that the parties involved in a deal that substantially increases market concentration have to prove that their merger does not harm competition.</p><p>      We are also confronting the profound concerns regarding the conduct of dominant firms. The most well-publicized concerns relate to online platforms, but as consolidation is taking place throughout our economy, dominant companies in many industries are raising issues. During this current merger wave, we need to ensure that civil conduct cases receive appropriate attention.</p><p>      Some have complained that the U.S. enforcement agencies have not been sufficiently active in investigating dominant firm conduct, particularly when compared with enforcers in Europe. We need to determine the cause of the discrepancy and whether it is justified.</p><p>      Finally, we need to keep working together to stop anticompetitive conduct when it comes to prescription drugs. Too many Americans are unable to pay their medical bills or are forced to skip doses because they simply can't afford it. American consumers have every right to demand that anticompetitive activity does not inflate the cost of prescription drugs. We know that 4 of the top 10 best-selling drugs in America have seen a doubling of prices. That's just wrong.</p><p>      That is why Chairman Grassley and I introduced our bill to make it easier to stop anticompetitive pay for delay patent settlements which cost consumers billions of dollars. It's also why Chairman Grassley and Senator Lee, our chairman, Leahy and Feinstein and many others have introduced the CREATES Act which has passed in this committee in June. It would help put a stop to other pharmaceutical company tactics like refusing to provide samples for testing which can delay generic introduction for years.</p><p>      As a former prosecutor, I know how important it is to have enforcers that are ready and willing to go to court when necessary to enforce the law. I know that the two gentlemen before us are dedicated to this cause. I know that you have staff that are ready and willing to do this work and I truly appreciate that. So I am hoping with some of the challenges that we all know that we share, we can go forward together with the commitment of the administration and the two of you to move on these important issues as well as the chairman.</p><p>      So I thank you very much both of you for being here.</p><p>      LEE:  Thank you very much, Senator Klobuchar. We'll now introduce our witnesses.</p><p>      Makan Delrahim was confirmed on September 17th, 2017 as assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division. Mr. Delrahim previously worked for the antitrust agency he currently leaves having served as deputy AAG with the division between 2003 and 2005. Prior to joining the Department of Justice, Assistant Attorney General Delrahim served as deputy assistant to the president and deputy White House counsel. Earlier in his career, he had been a partner of Brownstein Hyatt Farber and Schreck and also was chief counsel of the U.S. Senate Judiciary committee. </p><p>      That by the way is when I first had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Delrahim when I wrote an amicus brief on a constitutional issue before the Supreme Court on behalf of my future colleague, Senator Hatch, for whom Mr. Delrahim was then working. Good times.</p><p>Joseph Simons was sworn in as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission on May 1st, 2018. Before joining the commission, Chairman Simons was a partner at Paul Weiss and served as the co-chair of the firm's antitrust group. He practiced there and focused primarily on antitrust mergers and acquisition, litigation and counseling.</p><p>      Prior to joining Paul Weiss, Chairman Simons was the director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition from 2001 to 2003, having previously served another stint at the Bureau of Competition from 1987 to 1989, first as assistant to the director, then as assistant director for evaluation, and finally as associate director for mergers.</p><p>      Before we begin your testimony, I'd like you both to stand and I'll administer the oath. If you could both raise your right hands, do you swear that the testimony you're about to provide will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Thank you.</p><p>      Assistant Attorney General Delrahim, we'll hear first from you and then we'll hear from Mr. Simons.</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Thank you, Chairman Lee and thank you, Ranking Member Klobuchar and my former mentor and former chairman of this committee, Senator Hatch for being here and also for inviting me to be back. First, let me begin by expressing my gratitude not only to all of you, but for the support you provided for me and my -- for my nomination and also for your steadfast support in a bipartisan manner for the work we do at the Antitrust Division.</p><p>      I am also honored to be here with Chairman Simons, a friend who I've known and worked with probably over the last two decades and we're -- we're grateful that the FTC has its full complement of commissioners so that we can work well together.</p><p>      As you know, the division has crucially -- has the crucially important mission of protecting competition on behalf of the American consumer. Before I discuss the division's many successful enforcement efforts and some statistics that you might find informative, I want to share a quote of a person who I often quote, which was the former great Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson who at one point was the head of the Antitrust Division. </p><p>      In 1940 while we was serving as the attorney general, I quote, he says, \"Any prosecutor who risks his day-to-day professional name for fair dealing to build up statistics of success has a perverted sense of practical values as well as defects of character.\" </p><p>      I preface that just before I give some statistics on this. It's always a good reminder that effective antitrust enforcement is not measured by the number of lawsuits we file or the statistics in cases that we address. With your permission, I'll turn to a few of the highlights of the division's work in criminal enforcement, civil enforcement, competition advocacy and finally, international engagement.</p><p>      In criminally prosecuting antitrust violations such as price fixing and bid rigging, the division protects American consumers from certain and direct economic harm. In recent years, we have obtained criminal fines averaging $1.3 billion through our enforcement actions. A record-setting number of criminal cases went to trial just this past year, the highest in the last two decades.</p><p>      Over the fiscal years 2016 and 2017, 52 defendants in Antitrust Division cases have been sentenced to prison terms totaling over 15,000 days of incarceration. Also the division has implemented at least what we call the No Poach Initiative investigating and prosecuting anti-poaching and wage fixing agreements among employers that hurt American workers.</p><p>      We have conducted outreach and training for agents at multiple offices of the inspectors generals within the federal government at multiple federal agencies to identify, investigate and pursue bid rigging and market allocation crimes that hurt the American taxpayer.</p><p>      On the civil enforcement front, the division has confronted multi-billion dollar mergers that involve industries important to every American consumer. We have protected and restored competition in a number of key industries in markets ranging from crowd protection and seed treatments to nationwide telecommunication fibers and entertainment. The division has litigated matters in a variety of industries including being forced to litigate its first vertical merger case to judgment in 40 years in the AT&amp;TTime Warner case after multiple efforts to settle that case.</p><p>      That case continues on appeal at DC circuit. Currently, we're actively investigating pending mergers including CVS's acquisition of Aetna, the proposed acquisition of Aetna and the proposed merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. Also as part of our continued efforts to modernize our civil enforcement work, last week, we announced a set of reforms to the merger review process with the goal of completing all merger reviews within 6 months and most within the statutory 30-day waiting period.</p><p>      We move to competition advocacy. The division has engaged in robust competition advocacy implementing a wide range of initiatives designed to advance competition. To highlight just a few examples, we significantly improved the consent -- our consent decree process to make our decrees more enforceable and less regulatory, to better protect competition and ultimately the consumer.</p><p>      We've initiated a proactive amicus program in the courts and have engaged an advocacy of numerous regulatory agencies. Over the past year, we hosted a series of roundtables on topics including competition and deregulation and on improving our criminal cartel enforcement efforts.</p><p>      With our partners at the Federal Trade Commission, we co-hosted a workshop on promoting competition in the real estate industry, a topic dear to many numbers of this committee.</p><p>      Finally, on the international front, as this committee knows well, the United States and U.S. businesses benefit when the nations enforcing their competition laws according to sound economic principles and in accordance with appropriate procedures and protections. Our highlights in that area include the advancement of a core set of procedural norms through -- through what we refer to as the multilateral framework on procedures and competition law or we call it the MFP, working in partnership with both the Federal Trade Commission and leading agencies around the world including Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and a number of others to advance those goals.</p><p>      Separately, along with our colleagues at the Federal Trade Commission, we have promoted effective enforcement of antitrust and competition laws across the globe, visiting or hosting agencies in numerous jurisdictions to discuss enforcement including, just to name a few, China, Brazil, the European Union, UK and Mexico and coordinating numerous technical assistance programs. </p><p>      These are just some of the many initiatives and actions taken by the division since I've had the great honor of leading the capable attorneys and staff of the Antitrust Division just over a year ago. </p><p>      I look forward to the coming challenges and to working with this committee knowing the importance of our work and with great gratitude for the support that you have provided to us in the past. Thank you very much. </p><p>      LEE:  Thank you. </p><p>      Mr. Simons? </p><p>SIMONS:  Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, Senator Hatch, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. </p><p>      I am so pleased to testify on behalf of the commission and to discuss some of our current competition enforcement activities and our policy priorities. I am particularly pleased to be here with my esteemed colleague and friend, Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for antitrust. </p><p>      And I'd also like to start by thanking the three of you in particular for supporting me personally in the nomination and the confirmation process and also for your incredible support over a long period of time for the FTC, its specific mission, the men and women who make up the staff of the FTC and who do a terrific job and also for antitrust generally both of our agencies. So, thank you so much for that. </p><p>      For over 100 years, the FTC has worked to ensure that American markets are open, vibrant, and unencumbered by unreasonable private or public restraints. With technological developments and globalization the FTC continues to monitor and evaluate how these changes can and should impact our law enforcement, our rulemaking and our policy work. </p><p>      Although our agency mostly tackles these challenges together law enforcement, we also take advantage of policy tools. Our structure, research capacity and committed staff enable us to meet our mandate of protecting consumers and competition in an ever-changing marketplace. </p><p>      The commission seeks to promote through a rigorous, fact-intensive approach to law enforcement. One of the agency's principal responsibilities is to prevent mergers that may substantially lessen competition. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, the commission has challenged 55 mergers. </p><p>      The commission took action to prevent harm for mergers involving a wide variety of products and services including hospitals, medical instruments, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, water treatment chemicals, cooking oil and cement. Many of these cases were resolved through divestiture settlements. </p><p>      But in the last year, the commission sued to block five mergers and there were four active merger litigations when I arrived at the commission in May. </p><p>      The commission also maintains a robust program to identify and stop any competitive conduct, non-merger conduct, especially in health care markets. </p><p>      The commission continues to prioritize any competitive reverse payments in which a brand manufacturer pays its potential generic rival to forego its patent challenge and to stay out of the market. </p><p>      The commission has also challenged unilateral conduct by drug manufacturers to maintain a monopoly. For example, a federal court recently ruled that drug manufacturer AbbVie used sham litigation to illegally maintain its monopoly over testosterone replacement drug Androgel. The court awarded $493 million in monetary relief as a result of AbbVie's conduct. </p><p>      This is the first time any court has found that sham litigation violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act since the Supreme Court first recognized this legal theory in 1993. </p><p>      One increasing challenge for the commission in litigating competition cases is the need to hire testifying economic experts. Qualified experts are critical to litigating these types of cases but they represent a very significant expense in any litigation matter. </p><p>      We truly appreciate the Congress' attention, yours in particular, to the agency's resource needs including the need to continue to hire outside experts to support aggressive antitrust enforcement. </p><p>      Last, in addition to our vigorous enforcement work, the commission continues to promote competition through our ongoing policy work. As you know, in June we announced the set of public hearings entitled Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century. This series of public hearings will explore whether we need to adjust our enforcement efforts, our priorities and our policies in light of the marketplace changes, new evidence and new thinking which were referenced by both Chairman Lee and Ranking member Klobuchar. </p><p>      Issues to discuss include whether we need to change the governing stand for antitrust enforcement, whether merger enforcement has been too lax, our remedial authority with respect to privacy and data security and other issues. Discussion of these issues at the hearing along with public comments collected throughout the hearings will help inform our thinking. </p><p>      The FTC is committed to maximizing its resources to enhance its effectiveness in protecting consumers and promoting competition; to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace; and to meet current and future challenges. </p><p>      We look forward to continuing that work with the subcommittee and Congress and I look forward to discussing that with you here today. Thank you. </p><p>      LEE:  Thank you very much. </p><p>      We'll now go into questions and I will kick that off. </p><p>      Chairman Simons, you noted in your written testimony that the agencies have updated their jointly issued antitrust guidelines for licensing intellectual property last year. Those guidelines were silent on the issue of patents incorporated into technologic standards known as Standard Essential Patents. </p><p>      Differences between how the Antitrust Division, the Department of Justice on one hand and the FTC on the other hand have viewed enforcement relating to Standard Essential Patents has become more pronounced in recent years. As I said in my opening remarks, the lack of clarity or consistency on this issue has the potential to undermine U.S. leadership on antitrust issues and also opens the door, I fear, for other nations to exploit those differences to their own unfair advantage. </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, you've voiced concerns that antitrust enforcers have gone too far in accommodating concerns of technology implementers who participate in standard setting organizations relative to the concerns of intellectual property creators whose participation is equally essential to the pro-consumer mission of standard setting bodies. </p><p>      And so, I want to ask both of you a couple of questions about these issues. </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, first, how what's the Antitrust Division doing to ensure that the antitrust laws are being enforced in a manner that fosters competition while respecting strong intellectual property rights? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you've noted, we have discussed this issue in a number of public speeches and encouraged a debate, a vigorous debate on this really important issue. And it's important not only in the United States but abroad because what I'm concerned about is the misapplication of the antitrust laws could take away the incentive for the innovation that I see that provides the dynamic competition that we need here. </p><p>      And there had been some talk about patent holdups and whether or not in a standard setting organization certain kinds of conduct should be treated as an antitrust violation. And in these discussions, I tried to engage not only the academic community but various folks in the economics arena to have a more robust discussion and look at not only patent holdup but patent holdout. </p><p>      And that's where -- what we really should be worried about is concerted action where it creates a monopsony effect and lowers the potential recovery that an inventor makes in the R&amp;D to create that innovation in the first place. And we want to be sure that they are properly -- that the incentives are there so we think we should focus our attention on the concerted action whether it's by patent owners products patent users and the issues such as contractual obligations to licensure patent under what some people call FRAND or fair, reasonable and otherwise could be treated just as you would in a contract case. And there are multiple cases abound but not to be treated with the blunt force of antitrust. </p><p>      LEE:  So, on that point, what do you say to those who would respond to your statements highlighting the dangers of holdout by implementers as in overcorrection and enforcement priorities? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I would respond that they're wrong. But I respectfully want to receive more criticism because that's the only way we'll improve our policies. I would also point to a number of academics including Judge Doug Ginsburg as well as Judge Michel who used to be the chief judge of the Federal Circuit and a number of other folks who have supported the policies that I have advanced on behalf of the U.S. </p><p>      LEE:  And then Chairman Simons, in what circumstances do you think antitrust law may be inappropriate tool for settling licensing disputes involving Standard Essential Patents. In other words, when are more targeted theories like, say, contract law or fraud insufficient to avoid harm to consumers that might arise from market-based royalty negotiations in this area? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Thank you. So, the way I look at it is there has to be an antitrust problem in addition to a problem with the standard setting context, Okay? So, just the fact that there is a breach of a FRAND commitment does not mean in any way that there is an antitrust violation. The other component... </p><p>      LEE:  Sometimes a breach is just a breach. </p><p>      SIMONS:  Sometimes a breach -- not only that but you could have a -- well, two things. So, one is there might not be a competition issue that's there to resolve in the first place. For example, if the technology at stake or at issue is really a monopoly and there's no other choice then it's not a competition issue because they would have to incorporate into the standard no matter what. </p><p>      So, that's not just a competition issue at that point. If when they're promulgating the standard, there are multiple potential technologies that could be incorporated, that's the point in which competition law is implicated. But even if there's a breach in that circumstance, you still have to meet the other requirements to show monopolization under the law. </p><p>      LEE:  So, how should we think about the relative cost of over and under enforcement in the standard setting context? </p><p>      SIMONS:  So, the way I look at it is there could be an antitrust issue on either side. So, you can have an antitrust issue for a holdup and an antitrust issue for holdout. </p><p>      And in my view, what we should do is we should pay attention to both those potential problems. We should not discriminate between them. </p><p>      LEE:  And so, what then is the appropriate time? It sounds like you're saying the appropriate time for dealing with these is at the beginning not later on. </p><p>      SIMONS:  No, because you want to see what happens. I mean, it may be the case that there is no effect, right, that there's no effect on competition in which case you don't do anything. But if there's no competition at the outset then there's no antitrust problem. You just stop right there. </p><p>      LEE:  Senator Klobuchar? </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. </p><p>      I'm going to start with something that I hope will help both of you and I don't think this is a partisan issue at all. This is about making sure we have an even playing field as we have these increasingly complex industries and mergers that you have staff that or you're staffed up enough so that you're able to review them. And this is the Merger Enforcement Improvement Act which would address the ability of the antitrust agencies to conduct enforcement in light of this current wave of consolidation. </p><p>      As you know, the bill would ensure that bigger deals which often are more complex and more costly to review pay their fair share. For deals worth more than $1 billion, the filing fee would amount to less than a tenth of a percent of the deal value. And it would be practically nothing for the merging parties but it would be a huge help for enforcement. </p><p>      Do you think that this would be helpful if we would update the filing fees? Either of you can start. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I certainly don't think it would hurt and I think it's important to continuously look at these and see if there's a more equitable allocation of our resources. When you have $100 billion merger that requires 40 of our lawyers and God knows $100 million in expert fees, should they pay the same amount of those resources. </p><p>      Those are important policy considerations for this committee and not necessarily for us but we would dedicate any of our resources, our statistics to help provide any technical assistance you need to better allocate that. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay. All right. </p><p>      SIMONS:  I agree with everything that Makan just said. And then also with what you said earlier, it's been quite a while since we've revised the fee numbers. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. I am hoping we can right now -- I know we've been in talks about this but it would be good to do it in a bipartisan way so we'll continue to work on that. </p><p>      Pay-for-Delay, will that continue to be -- that's with the pharmaceutical prices with major companies paying generics to keep their products off the market. Will, this continue to be a priority for the FTC? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Absolutely. This was a priority the last time I was at the FTC in 2001 to 2003. When I got there, there were four Pay-for-Delay cases in litigation and I see no reason to take the foot off the accelerator and put the foot on the brake. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  I like that answer. Is the FTC on the lookout for patent settlements that may unlawfully delay the entry of biosimilars on to the market? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes, absolutely. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay. Very good. </p><p>      The vertical mergers and this is for you, Mr. Delrahim, how would you describe your agency's approach to vertical merger enforcement and what lessons if any has your agency taken from the AT&amp;T-Time Warner litigation. I know this is still on appeal so I don't expect you to reveal big details but... </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Without commenting -- thank you for that -- but without commenting on that particular matter, we have reviewed a number of vertical mergers including Bayer and Monsanto where we secured I think one of the larger if not the largest divestiture to address the issues that farmers and consumers would have faced in that transaction. We commend the parties for working with us on that matter. </p><p>      I think vertical mergers, there's agreement that by and large they don't pose the same competition concerns that horizontal transactions would but that doesn't mean they're per se legal. And there was I think during the trial and leading up to it, there was a perception that was created by maybe hundreds of new vertical merger experts on television that... </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  That sounded a bit sarcastic. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Just a little bit sarcastic. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  That's okay and good. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  ... that all of a sudden they were saying that oh, we've never challenged a transaction in 40, 50 years but that's just not true. There have been multiple challenges where parties have sought whether that have been divestitures or consent decrees and that's an important part. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  And we're seeing more of these types of vertical mergers in health care, video content, things like that. </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, could you tell me about the FTC's ongoing efforts to protect consumers from potential anticompetitive behavior and conduct by dominant online platforms? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Sure. So, as I have said before several times, for antitrust enforcers, the place to look for antitrust conduct, the best place to look is where there's likely to be potential significant market power. And so, that description would describe some of these big tech platforms that we're all talking about in the news regularly. So, those are the places you would look. </p><p>      And without commenting on any specific company or any specific investigation, this is something that is a priority for us. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  And what do you think explains the difference in enforcement activity from here and Europe? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Hard to tell. I haven't been in the job long enough to kind of work that out yet. But I will say that we are working very closely with the European Union on these issues. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay. This is during Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, I asked him about issues on Philadelphia National Bank and which he declined to apply in a major antitrust case. And the reason I asked was because the case is foundational authority for structural presumption, the market concentration-based rebuttable presumption that the agencies and courts have relied on for decades. </p><p>      And this as you know, Mr. Delrahim, plays a key role in merger cases are absolutely litigated and eliminating it with result, I think, in a decline in merger enforcement. And in fact, one of the bills I have would codify the principle that a merger that leads to a significant increase in market concentration would be presumptively unlawful. But that isn't the law now that's what's in this bill. </p><p>      Now, this is only a presumption and it can be rebutted with evidence. But as a practical matter, how important is a structural presumption in merger enforcement and I note that a number of prominent industrial organization scholars have voiced support for the continued use of market concentration-based legal presumptions and what is your view? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  It certainly helps us if we want to challenge transaction to have that presumption in court. It's an important tool for enforcement and provides a bright line for not only the business community but for the courts to follow. </p><p>      There has been scholarly criticism of it because Congress didn't necessarily create that presumption and the courts provided that, so could a future Supreme Court overturn that and say just go prove your case, you don't deserve a presumption since Congress hasn't, that's certainly possible in the future but that is the law. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  And that was, of course, my concern when I was questioning Judge Kavanaugh because of those cases, the Whole Foods case that he had written, but thank you. I just see it as important as we're seeing an eroding in the court decisions of antitrust enforcement and the ability to do it just even making it worse concerns me so thank you. </p><p>      LEE:  Senator Hatch? </p><p>      HATCH:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Madam Chairman. </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, as you know, Congress recently passed and sent to the president the Orrin T. Hatch Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act. Now, this landmark legislation will update our music licensing laws for the digital age. Among other things, the bill establishes a formal consultation process between Congress and the Department of Justice regarding department reviews of the ASCAP and BMI consent decree. </p><p>      It also directs the department to notify Congress a reasonable time before moving to terminate one or both of the decrees. Now, I entered some remarks into the Congressional record regarding this provision of the bill which I would refer you to. </p><p>      The Music Modernization Act's formalized consultation and notification process reflect the judgment by Congress that before the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees are terminated, there needs to be a legislative framework in place to govern the market that follows. </p><p>      Now, I've long been a critic of the decrees. I because they are outdated, but I also believe that tearing them up without a replacement framework in place would be misguided. Will you commit to work with Congress as required under the Music Modernization Act before moving to terminate the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Senator, thank you and congratulations to you for your leadership and to the Senate and the House for passing an important bill to continue to modernize our laws. As you know, those consent decrees have been on the books for over 75 years and they are very important in multiple sectors of that industry and many who rely on them. </p><p>      We have embarked on this effort to review over 1,300 of these consent decrees that date back almost 100 years, and we're systematically examining these, providing public comment meeting with all the interested parties. We'd be happy to continue to brief you and other members of the committee throughout this process and we will have advance notice on our website and seeking public comment before we take it. We recognize fully the disruption that it could cause with just terminating them without proper transition period. </p><p>      HATCH:  How do you anticipate complying with the act's consultation and notification provisions? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  We will certainly comply with the act and we very much appreciate the changes and modifications provided into that amendment. As you know, there were some issues that the Office of Legal Counsel had provided to the committee with respect to its constitutionality, but with respect to notification, we'd be delighted to do that. I don't think anybody has any intentions to disrupt this industry, but provide for a smooth transition towards a market-based solution for how songwriters are compensated. </p><p>      HATCH:  Thank you. </p><p>      Mr. Simons, as you know, a few weeks ago I sent you a letter that expressed my concerns about Google's potentially anticompetitive conduct. </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter that letter into the record at this point. </p><p>      LEE:  Yes. Without objection... </p><p>      HATCH:  Okay. I also raised these concerns during an oversight hearing with Madam Chairwoman Ramirez back in 2016. Now, I understand you cannot disclose the existence of a nonpublic investigation. And since you cannot comment on whether you are investigating Google specifically, I was hoping you could discuss the commission's approach to oversight of the Internet and mobile economies. </p><p>      How do you decide to start an investigation into conduct that may be anticompetitive? And how do you decide whether it is worthwhile to investigate whether a market participant has market power. </p><p>      SIMON:  Thank you, senator. Yes, this is a very important issue. So, it could happen in a whole bunch of different ways how we come to decide to open an investigation. It could come from our own staff, which has expertise in this area and is constantly monitoring. </p><p>      It could come from complaints from you, for example, or others on the Hill. It could come from consumers - consumer groups. It could come from competitors. It could come from referrals from foreign competition authorities. </p><p>      So there is a whole range of possibilities in terms of how we might become aware of the behavior and then, of course, we would consider on a fact by fact, case by case basis whether opening up an investigation makes sense or not. </p><p>      HATCH:  Well, thank you. Mr. Simons, as you know, direct selling is an important industry in Utah and many other states. This industry provides countless people with opportunities to build a business and is an engine for economic growth. </p><p>      I've heard from many industry stakeholders about the need for regulatory consistency. They argue that clear rules are essential to sustaining their business model. In the coming weeks and months, will you commit to work with me on this important issue? </p><p>      SIMON:  Absolutely, sir. </p><p>      HATCH:  Thank you. I'm also interested in the series of hearings that you announced. This is a huge undertaking and an important step that you should be proud of. The response to the hearings so far has been almost universally positive as far as I can see. </p><p>      There is one issue that some people brought to my attention, however, I understand that you are hoping to give an open platform to discuss the ideological debates going on concerning antitrust. And in doing that, it's laudable that you want to give both sides time to make their points. </p><p>      Some have expressed concern, however that the witnesses selected for the hearings have been predominantly in favor of changing the standard for evaluating antitrust claims and those in favor of current - of the current approach have not had sufficient time to rebut some of the claims being made. </p><p>      I thought I'd give you a chance to talk just a little bit about how the commission has been selecting witnesses and managing the amount of time for various viewpoints and how that will happen going forward. </p><p>      SIMON:  Thank you, senator. Thank you for that question. So first let me say that it's almost encouraging to hear your -- yes, you're hearing these criticisms from the one side of the aisle because I assure you I'm hearing criticism from the other side of the aisle as well. </p><p>      So that gives me some hope that maybe we're someplace actually in the middle. And we're trying to be as completely representative as we possibly can and to get everyone's views out. The hearings actually are not completely set in terms of what is going to be done at each panel session. </p><p>      And so, I would be interested to hear those specific concerns and maybe we can address them going forward. But I would also like to say that one thing that's very important, probably maybe even more important than what happens at these panel sessions is the comments that we are getting in the process. </p><p>      And so those are completely open. And we've gotten some really terrific, long and very thoughtful comments so far. So, that always is an option available to anyone who thinks that a particular side of the argument has not been heard sufficiently. </p><p>      HATCH:  Well, thank you. </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>      LEE:  Thank you, Senator Hatch. </p><p>      A vote has been called. We are going to have to recess for a few minutes to go and do that. So we'll stand in recess for about 10 minutes. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  We will return. </p><p>      (RECESS) </p><p>      LEE:  Welcome back. Thank you for your patients while we voted. We'll now continue with the questioning. </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, I want to get back to this issue related to Standard Essential Patents as I was discussing with Chairman Simons. Within this world of Standard Essential Patents, if antitrust enforcers work to focus their enforcement efforts exclusively on holdup -- on hold by patent holders, what do you see is the likely impact for innovation and ultimately for consumers? And do you have any examples of that, what that would look like? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  So I would refine that into two issues on holdup. One is, is it a concerted action in that standard setting by multiple patent owners who might hold up somebody or is that a unilateral act by a patent holder. </p><p>      So if it's concerted, absolutely, we should be concerned. We should get engaged and if there is a violation of the antitrust laws and apply them. If it's a unilateral that's where I start to think is it a matter of policy, I don't think Congress has provided us the authority under the antitrust laws and there is more appropriate remedies. </p><p>      The concern is if you do that, we now begin removing, so for example, there have been cases and there are cases abroad where folks say, your refusal to license to your competitor or just the mere allegation that it violates some reasonableness standard, what is that? Who knows? If they haven't set the price, what is reasonable. </p><p>      And there should be left to fact finders in a court. What reasonable royalty should be or non-discriminatory. If you say that by your refusal to license, where there is no such duty under the antitrust laws, I think -- I don't think there's a single case where there is a unilateral refusal and unconditional to license your patent, there's a duty to do so. By imposing antitrust penalties you're now completely changing that fine balance and I think Congress doesn't and repeatedly changes the anti -- the patent laws to provide that proper incentive. </p><p>      LEE:  Okay. Thank you. </p><p>      We may get more -- back to that more a little bit later, but I want to talk a little bit about rulemaking. Chairman Simons, your colleague Commissioner Chopra has recommended that the FTC increase its use of rulemaking to define unfair methods of competition under Section 5 of the FTC Act. </p><p>      In 2015, the FTC as you know, issued a statement of enforcement principles that guides the agency's application of its statutory authority under Section 5 but not necessarily by the Sherman or Clayton Acts. </p><p>      Former Commissioner Ohlhausen dissented to the release of that statement, claiming that it did too little to bind the agency's enforcement authority under Section 5. So commissioner, do you agree that the FTC Section 5 authority is vague and should more explicit guardrails be placed on the agency's enforcement of unfair methods of competition under Section 5? </p><p>      SIMON:  Yes. I would agree that it's vague, over a long period of time people have tried one way or another to think about ways to define the pure Section 5 case. In other words, where Section 5 applies in addition to the other antitrust laws and largely have been fairly unsuccessful. </p><p>      In my view, the overwhelming majority of what the FTC does is covered by the other antitrust statutes, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act for example. And so, it's a little sliver which is ambiguous that we're talking about, and my preference is for us to focus on the overwhelming majority of what we do and not devote resources to a very small, ambiguous part of what we might do. </p><p>      LEE:  Okay. So that might signal where you might go in response to my next question, which is what do you think of Commissioner Chopra's proposal of what he suggested here? </p><p>      SIMON:  So, I think in the abstract, it's worth thinking about but in practice, I think people have been thinking about this for a very long time and haven't come up with anything. So, I'm not optimistic that something concrete will come out of this. </p><p>      LEE:  And what concerns do you have, if any, about this being worked out by the FTC, within the FTC rather than through litigation in the courts or alternatively by Congress? </p><p>      SIMON:  Well, eventually, whatever we'd work out internally would almost certainly be challenged in court. Whatever rule we pass, the rule would be appealed. </p><p>      LEE:  Good point. </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, I realize this is an FTC issue, but do you have any thoughts about competition issues being developed by rulemaking rather than by litigation? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  It depends what those rules are. I think if those were bright line rules that are informed by I think mainstream economic thought, that could be positive, but to begin regulating into an industry without the rigors of the economics and then not being able to change those rules and be -- and have the flexibility we currently have in antitrust law to adapt to new technologies, new markets and new thought might actually cause more consumer harm. So having that flexibility to be able to change that would be really important. </p><p>      LEE:  And certainly in the content of litigation you've got an added feature in that you've got multiple parties there to be able to hash out the issues, that makes a difference, right? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Right. </p><p>      LEE:  Do you agree, Mr. Simons? </p><p>      SIMON:  Yes. And plus you've got the opportunity to have multiple courts and circuit courts and maybe the Supreme Court take a look at it. </p><p>      LEE:  Okay. Thank you. </p><p>      Let's -- Mr. Delrahim, let's get back to the ASCAP, BMI issue for a minute, the division look that the ASCAP and BMI decrees during the Obama administration, issuing a closing statement in August 2016 announcing that it had determined that no modification was warranted at that time. </p><p>      What factors do you think the Antitrust Division will rely on in judging whether legacy decrees should be -- that should be terminated? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  We will look to see -- first of all, I think we will be moving from a presumption that those decrees that were put in place prior to 1979, after 1979 there's a 10-year period and a 10-year term from most of these consent decrees. </p><p>      But most of these, we should take a look at to see how they are being implemented in the marketplace. Are these actually causing market divisions? Are they preventing new innovation and that's what -- that is the mission we're on as far as getting the public comment from the multiple parties and stakeholders in this. </p><p>      LEE:  I'm slightly over time, with your indulgence, Senator Klobuchar, I want to ask one more follow up question on this. What if anything has changed in music licensing -- in the music licensing market since 1941 that would suggest these legacy decrees might no longer be required or current </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Well, since 1941, probably the innovation of 8-track, cassette, CD, streaming, downloads...</p><p>      LEE:  What I still listen to. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Going to make him feel bad. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I hope I -- did I answer the question or is it (inaudible)? </p><p>      LEE:  Really subtle, so I'm still wrestling. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Thank you. </p><p>      LEE:  But Senator Klobuchar? </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay. Assistant Attorney General Delrahim, last week you announced a series of changes to expedite the division's merger review process with the goal of resolving most investigations within six months I understand, assuming cooperation between the merging parties. I also support increasing the efficiency of the review process. But setting an explicit deadly, there's concerns by some that would sacrifice accuracy and thoroughness. </p><p>      What would you say to those who are concerned about the implications of this six-month goal for resolving investigations? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Well, first, I think we did not and I've mentioned it in the speech. We did not unilaterally disarm here. It is six months as a goal to work to and I think that's plenty of time for us to do the work we need to do, assuming we're focused on exactly what the harm is rather than on a broader fishing expedition. </p><p>      And most of even some of the more complex transactions, like Disney-Fox, we were able to get to an answer within six months. I think within those reforms that I announced, I also noted that it requires cooperation, cooperation of data, cooperation of production, not hiding the eighth ball by the parties. </p><p>      Many of this -- the timing is in the control of the parties. And so to the extent that the markets and the merging parties have an interest in getting certainty as soon as possible, they can help us get there. I think we can do most of them within six months, but sometimes it might be more complex and with the authorization of a Deputy AAG there could be additional processes that may be required in case-by-case basis. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  I was just reminded when I was -- has had my first and only other government job as the prosecutor county attorney, I set deadlines when I first got in for property cases or something to be resolved and one of the judges sent me a letter that said, \"You better start viewing your time as county attorney as more of a marathon than a sprint.\" </p><p>      And I remember I wrote back and said, \"It's both a marathon and a sprint.\" Because you have to have some sprints as well, so you're saying that the cases may be different. The reviews may be different but you would like to expedite a good portion of them, is that what you...</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Exactly. And sometimes parties sit on third-party CIDs that we issued to them. They won't get us the data. And it was along with those, Congress has given us the power to enforce those CIDs in court. We will begin doing those. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  And did the Antitrust Division confer with the FTC on this issue? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  On the broad, no, although we did follow what some of the reforms that they have done that for example some of the transparency and having the timing agreement on their website are things that we learned and were illuminated. We have some different processes and procedures between our two agencies. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay. </p><p>      Do you want to add anything? </p><p>      SIMON:  Now, we've done -- some of the things that Makan recently announced and we're -- and having to process some of other things that he also recently announced, so for example, we also are creating a statistical database to track what's happening with the mergers, how long they're taking various milestones along the way and coding for things that may cause the investigation to go longer or shorter. </p><p>      And then we're going to have -- we're planning to have case studies for the ones that are, went longer to have lessons learned about maybe why we can shorten them and in case studies for the ones that went -- that were more efficiently run so we can have lessons learned about what to do right. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay. Most favored nation clauses or MFNs are contract provisions in which one side imposes limits on the other side's ability to deal with third-parties by ensuring that the side imposing the provision will always receive the best price or terms of trade. </p><p>      While some MFNs may be pro-competitive, I've heard complaints about the common use of MFNs in certain industries, which may limit competition such as the unconditional MFNs imposed by television and video content distributors that's imposed on content providers. </p><p>      What can you tell us about your agency's recent enforcement efforts related to MFNs? </p><p>      Anyone? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I'll be happy to address. MFNs can be pro-competitive but they can also be anticompetitive... </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Right. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  ... for example, they can raise new barriers to entry or stabilize what would otherwise be effective price competition. The DOJ did examine, I believe it was 2012, 2013, they had a workshop on the effect on the MFNs and with respect to the Time Warner, the cable merger, that was an issue that was addressed in a consent decree with the use of the MFNs. </p><p>      We've also done it in the health care, in the Blue Cross Blue Shield in the Michigan Hospitals case. That was even a more egregious use of the MFN because that's the -- it was an MFN plus. </p><p>      Because they said that you may not license to a competitor and if you do you have to give us an additional 10 or 20 percent lower than what the favored nation cost would be. And that was one that was litigated and Michigan passed the law to outlaw that. </p><p>      So it's one that we are on the lookout for and continue to examine their effect in the marketplace. </p><p>      SIMON:  Okay. We look for these -- for issues with MFNs in concentrated markets both on the potential collusion facilitating side and also potentially as a monopolization issue. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay. Following up on what I asked of the chairman before, I'll give this to you Assistant Attorney General Delrahim, what has the Antitrust Division have been doing to assess the impact of technology platforms on competition? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  We have also been thinking about. We have convened internally with our 50 or so economists. We have also invited speakers from the outside who are experts both economists as well as our folks who think about these from the venture capital community and others to come and explain some of these issues to us. </p><p>      They're important factors. It's something the attorney general himself has also expressed an interest and invited as you know some of the -- a number of state attorney generals that came into it for a meeting last week to discuss this issue. We continue to study it, beyond that I probably shouldn't comment. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  All right. Thank you. </p><p>      SIMON:  This is also a subject of one of our panel sessions at the hearings that we're having. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  All right. Thank you. </p><p>      LEE:  Senator Blumenthal? You may. You may. </p><p>      (OFF-MIKE) </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  ... and I apologize for my absence before now and I apologize if I may be repeating some of the ground you've already covered. Let me ask Mr. Delrahim, as you well know, as we all know in this room, corporate consolidation doesn't just threaten consumers. It threatens workers as well. </p><p>      If you live in a one-company town, as some people still do, it's easy for a company to keep wages low and force people to accept working conditions that may be substandard. When was the last time, so far as you're aware, that you cited labor market considerations as the basis for rejecting a merger? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  That's a good question. I don't know if labor markets, when the last time it would have been, but I do know and as you know we have been quite active in this area and thank you for your support in the no-poach area where competitors engage in not only price fixing but anti-poaching agreements amongst themselves. </p><p>      We announced a number of them dealing with the Westinghouse Labtech merger and a number of mergers, we have actually, now have software with the documents that are produced for mergers. We go through all those documents and identify no-poach agreements that might have come and we have several investigations that are ongoing, some of which are criminal. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  I've been very supportive of those efforts as you have mentioned and I think they are important. I am glad to hear that you have investigations underway. </p><p>      I am aware of no past case where labor market considerations were cited as a basis for rejecting a merger but I would respectfully suggest that it should be. </p><p>      Do you have an idea as to what the threshold level of monopsony powers that would raise concerns?</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  If it's a horizontal merger where such a market would be posed I presume it would be the, say, Philadelphia National Bank thresholds that we would apply and we would look at it whether it's a monopsony effect or a monopoly effect here just as the merger guidelines would allow. And, you know, it certainly can be a consideration.</p><p>      We also recognize that sometimes if the wage issues are not a consideration that the merger itself could provide for a certain growth and efficiencies that could create more jobs. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  And I'm assuming that the FTC likewise is focused on labor market conditions. </p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes, we've told the staff that they are supposed to look for potential effects on the labor market with every merger they review. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Thank you. </p><p>      Let me ask a question about search algorithms. Search engines like Google and Yelp use algorithms to produce search results that guide users to particular restaurants or shops. These algorithms can have profound market effects. For example, consumers often choose the restaurant that appears at the top of the search results, smaller businesses that offer high quality products at low prices may be less tech-savvy and as a result these algorithms might guide users away from them and away from the best option at the cheapest price. </p><p>      So let me ask you what resources and authorities do you have to scrutinize the fairness of algorithms and artificial intelligence systems as a potential misuse of market power?</p><p>      Mr. Delrahim?</p><p>      And then...</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  The use of search algorithms to cause the anticompetitive effect could take two forms. One could be if, you know, a use of an algorithm where there two parties, potential competitors might agree to use that and it's a way of either policing or effectuating a price fixing scheme that they might have. </p><p>      We actually have a case that's a criminal case that is going to be coming into a conclusion in the next coming, in the next two weeks I think and that we can make -- we will make public of the use of that. And I believe it's the first of its kind. But it's an important issue that we are struggling with both here in the United States, in Europe, about how that is done. </p><p>      So whereas the monopolization case where there's a platform that uses a single-firm conduct, if there is the market power and there is discrimination that is hurting either new innovation, new entry or a threat to that market power through the use of that algorithm it certainly could be a violation of the antitrust laws.</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Are you going to make us hold our breath and wait in suspense for the announcement of the...</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  It's an interesting case. Yes, it's a criminal case that I can't comment on...</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  But it heightened our interest even more.</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I think it is a fun one. The facts of that are very interesting.</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Thank you.</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Sure. </p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes, senator, this would be part of the overall review that we are having on tech platforms generally. And of course you know that the commission had an investigation along these lines about five years or so ago and closed it. So that was an old investigation. </p><p>      I am not going to comment on what we are doing now in terms of our investigative work.</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Well I am very interested in that investigation which I think I understand. It's been, you know, six years since the FTC concluded its investigation into Google without expressing an opinion on the merits of these allegations. Do you believe that competition in search and other aspects could warrant renewed investigation by U.S. antitrust authorities?</p><p>      SIMONS:  What I would certainly agree with is that these types of -- this type of conduct could be an antitrust violation. I would definitely say this, not per se legal.</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Would you, Mr. Delrahim, be open to the Justice Department investigating these allegations against Google?</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  These are matters between the two agencies, of which agency it takes the lead. The justice Department has investigated some Google transactions in the past. The Federal Trade Commission has investigation monopolization and other transactions, and so, the chairman and I will discuss the jurisdictional issues. But one will either do it or the other, depending on...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Now let me draw a parallel to Microsoft where I had some involvement. And the Department of Justice there took over the investigation. I would just emphasize the Department of Justice has an institutional interest. I hope you will agree to ensure the antitrust laws are enforced in such a key sector of the economy that is not to any way demean or dismiss the authority and the scrutiny that the FTC will bring to bear which I hope it will. But I am just raising as a possibility.</p><p>      SIMONS:  So neither one of us is going to get in the way of the other investigating. One of us -- if this is matter of one of us wants to investigate and the other one maybe has prior expertise and might get it under the clearance agreement but is not going to do an investigation then the other one is going to get it. We are not going to use the clearance process to stop an investigation.</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  If I may ask one more question, Mr. Chairman?</p><p>      LEE:  Yes, that's fine.</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  The recent news of hackers breaching of 50 million Facebook users raises, again, concerns about how online platforms are securing their data. Very sadly powerful technology companies like Facebook are able to impose their preferred privacy terms on customers. There's little that customers can do to fight back and protect their own data given the power of Facebook to dictate those terms. </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, in an April speech you described this dilemma with a very apt question for this hearing, quote, \"Our consumers who believe that their data is digital currency facing a monopoly seller or a monopsony buyer with structural barriers to competition and entry.\" End quote. </p><p>      With that in mind, let me ask you, do you believe that violation of a consumer right to privacy, digital privacy qualifies as a consumer harm and what can and should Congress do to boost competition and increase consumer awareness about this or their data?</p><p>      I know these are two questions, big questions, I invite you to begin and answer here but I would welcome a fuller answer in writing if you wish to do it that way.</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Absolutely, no. And not only are they quite deep questions or important questions, that every consumer in America grapples with right now. It's an issue -- in that speech as I discussed is one where, you know, the issue of revealed preferences may show if there's going to be a competitor in place. </p><p>      So some consumers gravitated to SnapChat when it first came out because they thought it had this disappearing text after 24 hours. And so, there was I think a consumer preference being revealed towards that and maybe there was a solution there. </p><p>      Specifically with respect to, you know, kind of the privacy and data breaches that's an issue that we don't have the direct statutory authority to be enforcing our friends at the Federal Trade Commission do some of that. And when it gets to be criminal I presume our criminal division of the Justice Department will do that. </p><p>      But the power that they might have is important. And are they doing -- are they taking any action to preclude a new innovator who could provide the consumer that safety and security they might want and they might wish. And that is an antitrust issue, that is something that we should be concerned about.</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  I agree. </p><p>      Anything?</p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes, which I say that this fits into the normal toolbox for antitrust. We look at for example the mergers impact on price but we also look at the merger's impact on quality and privacy can be a part of quality. So some consumers may prefer more privacy than less, and so, that can be determined in the marketplace, and a merger could eliminate or reduce that quality factor. </p><p>      And then in terms of data security let me just say this, if there is news about data security or data breach in the news it's public already, then we are concerned about it and we are looking at it. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Thank you.</p><p>      LEE:  Senator Booker?</p><p>      BOOKER:  Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. </p><p>      I recently visited farmers out in the Midwest in Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois and I was stunned with the testimony I got from farmers about the challenges with corporate consolidation and how it's transformed the heritage of this country and really hurt a lot of them. There are really harmful effects that are facing farmers on all side of the political spectrum. This is an American crisis in my opinion.</p><p>      And so, I recently introduced legislation to place a moratorium on any new large mergers in the food and agricultural space. And just some of the data is stunning. Today's nearly 70 percent of all pork, 53 percent of all chicken and 84 percent of all beef is slaughtered by only four companies. These processes are exploited by their contract growers and locked out of the market access for independent livestock producers. </p><p>      In poultry for instance 97 percent of the chicken consumed in the U.S. was grown by contract farmers. These farmers must accept whatever prices a company sets. The poultry farmers are paid in opaque ranking systems with little to no transparency to pay farmers more at the expense of their very neighbors, creating very unfortunate environments for competition that's not constructive. </p><p>      In 2010 the Antitrust Division of DOJ and USDA hosted a series of workshops which was really constructive, exploring competition in the agricultural sector. The DOJ stated in 2012 that a clear lesson from these workshops was that antitrust enforcement has a crucial role to play in fostering a healthy and competitive agricultural sector. And I say anecdotally this concentration we are seeing as our farmers are getting squeezed from below with seed folks, and other suppliers and from above from a lot of these processing companies is just driving farmers out of business at rates that are stunning and even farmer suicide rates right now I did not realize it's as bad as it is.</p><p>      And so, Mr. Delrahim, your statements DOJ's recent antitrust enforcement actions in the crop and seed protection sector. But what is the DOJ currently doing as it relates to the antitrust enforcement in the packing sector that so many farmers around this country have complained about to me and others?</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Thank you, senator. </p><p>      Certainly the agricultural industry and particularly the plight of the farmer is an important factor and something that we are concerned about at the Justice Department. We have a whole section that is just dedicated to, you know, the transportation and agricultural sectors. </p><p>      With the seed and seed treatment I was referencing largely the Bayer-Monsanto merger where we got one of the largest divestitures and it kept the competitive balance in the marketplace the same in reviewing that transaction. And we have I think a very strong consent decree and enforcers, and we just appointed with the court, former Attorney General Mukasey as the trustee to make sure that the parties live up to the commitments on that one. </p><p>      In addition to that the Packers and Stockyards Act which is largely enforced by the Department of Agriculture. However we get involved in a system with it. So those are issues that are even more specific to the competitive concerns of farmers than antitrust but it is one where we worry about both the monopsony effect which harms the farmer and getting recovery for their crop or their animals that they raise from the process. But also the monopoly effect that they could cause to the consumer. </p><p>      BOOKER:  And so, what was stunning to this what I found out that many of these most powerful entities in the sector are actually foreign corporations. Given the administration's interest in modifying trade relations with countries like China is the DOJ taking any action to evaluate foreign influence over farming and food related or antitrust issues?</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  So we apply the antitrust laws and the standard for Section 7 of the Clayton Act regardless of the nationality of the merging parties, and we expect that from our foreign countries as well on how they address their antitrust laws. </p><p>      When there's a national security issue dealing with foreign investment in important areas and certainly farm and food stock is one. And I know BayerMonsanto for example did go through the CFIUS process which is chaired and run by the Treasury Department but the Justice Department participates in that to ensure that there is -- national security interests are raised or if there are they can be addressed.</p><p>      BOOKER:  Yes, thank you and I hope that my office can learn more and may have some more questions for the record because it's really stunning to me to see what a lot of these large multi-national corporations are doing to American heritage and to American farmers. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I would be delighted to follow up.</p><p>      BOOKER:  Thank you, sir, very much. </p><p>      I want to switch to something that my colleague Senator Blumenthal from one of the best states in the Northeast that's proximate to New Jersey. He asked about privacy issues and some of the recent scandals are reflective of a much more pervasive set of problems, really, regarding social media and other online services. </p><p>      There's a manipulation and misuse of user information. The distribution of misleading or even illegal content and the ability to engage in criminal activity with relative anonymity, these are just to name a few of the challenges that I know that you are aware of. </p><p>      And so, perhaps maybe Mr. Simons and Mr. Delrahim, you both can maybe answer some of these questions and I will put a couple of them out there. </p><p>      Number one, do you think that new laws are necessary to promote consumer privacy and then fairness in competition?</p><p>      And I'd like to really understand your view in the connection between privacy and competition in this forum. And so, yes or no, do you agree that protecting consumers' privacy ensures a level playing field and therefore promotes fair competition?</p><p>      And maybe, Mr. Simons, I will start with you?</p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes. So that's a great question. So privacy, I think we need to do something about privacy. And the FTC has been involved and a leader in this field for a long time. And we would like to continue in that role but we would like both -- and we need to get this right and we need to do it with you, with you and the Congress. </p><p>      So I couldn't agree more that we need to do something.</p><p>      Second, the one thing we need -- the one thing we need to be careful about though is we don't want to have a situation where more privacy equal less completion. We want to do privacy in a way that doesn't hinder competition. Or else it will be, you know, it will be at counteractive purposes. So that's another really important factor. </p><p>      BOOKER:  Mr. Delrahim?</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I support that. And we have a live example right now in Europe where GDPR has been enacted. It adds new regulation, however usually it's the incumbents who have the resources and the power to utilize the new regulatory burden and for that entrants to come in. So how that is done is there's a good way, how that will be done in Europe will be a good way for us to learn about what not to do.</p><p>      BOOKER:  Thank you, sir. </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I'm grateful for the time.</p><p>      LEE:  Thank you, Senator Booker. </p><p>      Okay, Mr. Delrahim, I want to go back to the music issue, I was over time so I couldn't get past your hilarious comment there. The technology definitely has changed there's no question about that. </p><p>      My question for you is with the changes in technology, the advancements that have been made since then how has that changed the incentives, the relative incentives of licensees, of licensors and how does that impact the way you view an antitrust enforcement generally or the consent decrees specifically?</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  This whole technology has done a lot for the consumer. There is greater consumption of music. You now have streaming revenues outpacing any other form of revenue that is coming in to the artists, on one. </p><p>      Two, you have some new -- you have two PROs that perform in rights organizations that on the consent decree with the DOJ but you have two and perhaps others that may prop that are not under that same consent decree. And you have different methods of price setting by that. </p><p>      There might be new efficiencies. For example an identification of the song in a repertoire that technology can provide with data that we weren't capable of doing just even 10 or 20 years ago that might address some of the efficiencies, considerations of the Supreme Court announced or observed in upholding some of those consent decrees that the arrangements -- that the ASCAP and BMI had to justify what they do.</p><p>      So it's an area that is very fluid. We have a number of new services but we also have a new second circuit interpretation of the consent decrees with respect to fractional rights that have changed the landscape just within the last year. </p><p>      LEE:  Thank you. Thank you. </p><p>      I want to pick up on a couple of topics that were covered I think by Senator Blumenthal and Senator Booker just about the Consumer Welfare Standard. For more than decades, more than four decades our approach to antitrust policy has been based on empirically grounded economic analysis. </p><p>      Today, there are some critics of centrist antitrust policy that are complaining that this is too focused on economics and focused too little perhaps on the accumulation of political power that is capable of creating and then sustaining monopolies wielding significant market power. </p><p>      Some of these critics claim that the data suggest that the economy has become dramatically more concentrated over the last 40 years, and would very much like to see antitrust policy solve problems for a whole range of issues, including income inequality, wages, labor issues, and so forth. So, I'll start with the question, what do you make of claims that the economy is suffering dramatically because of lax antitrust enforcement? We go -- we'll go to you first, Chairman Simons. </p><p>      SIMONS:  Thank you, senator. So, we have had a very strong bipartisan consensus on how to do antitrust enforcement and policy in this country until very recently, it existed probably for 25 years, and now recently, people are raising the concerns that you just articulated, senator, and they're doing it in a way that is more thoughtful I think than had been done previously. </p><p>      And so what we've done in the FTC is we've initiated these hearings in large measure to get information and to talk about these concerns with the people who are making them, among ourselves, among other antitrust stakeholders. And as a -- as a part of a process to try to put back together the strong bipartisan consensus that we've had previously, which I think was a huge service to the agency itself and also to the country. </p><p>      LEE:  Mr. Delrahim, you've warned going up on this topic that abandoning the Consumer Welfare Standard and opening antitrust policy into a broader range of objectives would quote, \"make the antitrust agencies more open to the exercise of corporate influence and capture.\" What are your -- what are your primary concerns about recommendations made to modify or even abandon the Consumer Welfare Standard along these lines?</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I agree with Chairman Simons as far as the Consumer Welfare Standard, it has been one that has served us well, it's flexible enough, abandoning it might not have those principles that we -- that there's the basic principles to follow that ultimately, the actions we take should benefit the consumer, and keep the markets free, let them go back to FDR and Justice Jackson, many of us might recall Judge Bork as you know in his 1979 book, and he wrote it in 1969, but you go back 30 years before him, Justice Jackson was the one who argued against price controls by the government, and let the market decide the price and consumers benefit from that. </p><p>      And I would adhere to that, I don't think we need changes every now and then, we do have to study, and I commend Chairman Simons, and we've had some workshops, but continuously examining, do we know enough here? We're learning more about vertical mergers for example, but some of the cases that we have and we're dealing with and we're going to learn more what the -- what the courts as some of these cases are litigated, but I commend the committee also for examining this issue. </p><p>      LEE:  Thank you. And Chairman Simons, if -- would you agree that if we incorporated factors like these into antitrust analysis, factors like income inequality and excess political power, we incorporated those into antitrust analysis, would that be administrable? I mean, regardless of whether it would be wise or consistent with existing laws, would it be administrable? </p><p>      SIMONS:  That's one of the most serious concerns about those proposals, and which I am hopeful will be addressed at the hearings. That is -- it has been a criticism of those types of proposals going back, you know, 40 or 50 years that at least in a broad sense that they are difficult to administer, and to some extent inconsistent with each other. This is was -- as AAG Delrahim mentioned, these were part of the criticisms that appear in Judge Bork's book. But this is a different time, and perhaps there are different facts, there are different arguments, and there's different evidence, and that's what we want to see. </p><p>      LEE:  Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Thank you very much. And I appreciate those comments because I think what I said in my opening statement, we're just seeing this massive increase in the number of mergers, and at the same time we're seeing more and more conservative court opinions coming out of the Supreme Court, and I mean that in a way that it makes it harder to bring these actions, yet we haven't updated the laws at all. </p><p>      And so, when you go back in history, in Assistant Attorney General Delrahim mentioned back in history, and what happened with the justices, but when you go back even when the Sherman Act passed in 1890, I think that's right. Yes. </p><p>      In 1890, then you went for a number of 10, 15 years without much happening there, because of court decisions that were conservative, and then finally enforcers took on the cause with Teddy Roosevelt and his attorney general, and then suddenly with the Northern Securities case being the first based out of Minnesota, by the way, I don't we should be proud or not with James J. Hill. </p><p>      But you saw these actions taking place and the change, and I just feel like then you went on to Captain Wilson, and there were all these enforcement actions. And then, maybe partly because of the wars and the depression things were dormant, and yet another period in the '60s and '70s where things were active. </p><p>      But it seems like we're at this point where we just, not much has been happening, and we're seeing these mergers increase, and that's why I'm so interested in looking at these potential bills that we've been talking about, if we're unable to get that relief as in the recent case that Justice Department valiantly brought. If we can't get the relief in court, then you've got to start looking at legislation or different enforcement methods. </p><p>      So, I'd like to ask you about monopsony and buyer power, and this often overlooked area of antitrust has recently received more attention, as buyer power among employers has been linked to stagnant wages. This is one of my bills, the Consolidation Prevention and Competition Promotion Act I want to make explicit that a merger that tends to create a monopsony is unlawful under the Clayton Act. </p><p>      I guess my first question at present that we -- at present we don't see a great deal of monopsony enforcement at the agencies, why is that, and can you discuss how your agency approaches issues of monopsony and buyer power in merger analysis? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Sure. So for -- thank you, senator. For every merger that we investigate, the staff has been instructed that they need to look for potential impacts on labor. And it can come in multiple different flavors, the most, perhaps the simplest version you can imagine a merger of two auto manufacturers for example that both have operations in a -- in a -- not in a big city, but in a relatively rural area, and are the primary employers. </p><p>      Well, even though -- even though on the output side, they may not -- they may not be in any competitive problem there, it might be because the two plants are next to each other. So, that that's an extreme version. </p><p>      A lot of the mergers involve more mobile skilled employees and that takes a completely different analysis, because the market would probably be broader, but we'd have to look. So, through all these types of different possible scenarios, we're looking. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay. With a more specific question Assistant Attorney General Delrahim, you announced last week that you were withdrawing 2011 policy guide to merger remedies as part of reassessing the division remedy policy, have the division and FTC considered working jointly on an updated joint policy guide? And are there reasons for the two agencies to have different policies in this area? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  The remedies, the merger remedies, going back to 2004 have been specific to each of the agencies, I would welcome the input for my colleague and see if there is one way it makes sense given our different procedures about whether or not a merger I think, to the extent we do these jointly, we're better off and provide better certainty to the business community. </p><p>      But I think that mergers remedy guide is probably one where we don't need to diverge, because I don't think the differences in our structure and our procedures would allow for that. In withdrawing the 2011, we in the interim have placed in back the 2004 guidelines which call for structural remedies as a preferred mode rather than behavioral remedies until we update those. </p><p>      And by the way, we'll probably look at the vertical merger guidelines in the coming future, since those have been in place since 1984, and most of us would not even understand the if we read them today. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  So, they don't really have much use. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  I brought up the CREATES Act early on my opening and this bill with Senator Grassley, Leahy, and Senator Lee, and myself that we introduced. Can you talk about quickly what the FTC is doing now to address these issues? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes, sure. Thank you. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  The sampling and other things. </p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes, so, yes. So this is something that we get note -- we get notification from CMS or HSS, I can't remember which one. And we look at these things, and we are looking for a good case to bring. But having said that, I think this is an area...</p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  That's very out there, I like that. </p><p>      SIMONS:  I'm sorry? </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  That's a good thing to warn people that you're looking for. </p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes. We're it looking, but having that said that...</p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay, good. </p><p>      SIMONS:  Having said that, I think it make sense in this area for what that -- to do a legislative solution, so I think what you're doing is very important and we support it. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Yes, and this is about the sampling of being able to get more generics on the market, to get more pharma competition. So, now that you've been in your roles, because I have to leave shortly, I may have to leave before my colleagues do, as you look at your roles here. What would you say are your two or three biggest challenges right now as you head into this new arena we're in and with all of the consolidation and also some market dominance that we're seeing in the online platforms, the pharmaceutical issues? I guess I'm giving you ideas, but what do you see as your challenges and resources? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Well, those three things I think would be at the top. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Okay. </p><p>      SIMONS:  The other thing that I think is really important also which is being addressed hopefully by these hearings that we're having, which is really to get antitrust community and all of our stakeholders to talk to each other, and developing better bipartisan consensus. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Yes, and I do think we have an opportunity, Mr. Delrahim and I have talked about this with the administration's interest in this issue, and I have talked to Mr. McCann about this that, you know, maybe we have a chance to move forward with some policy and legislative changes. </p><p>      SIMONS:  And I also want to commend the two of you for the way you conduct this committee. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Oh. </p><p>      SIMONS:  On such a bipartisan basis. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Thank you. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  But the only challenge I would add to that, obviously resources are, because as some of these transactions are larger, more complex, much more resource intensive, how we address them, and some of the legislative proposals you put forth, I think merit action, but it -- on the international front, the international front is becoming...</p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Good point. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  ...a more challenging area, we just had our bilateral meetings with a European commissioner, Commissioner Vestager, and her staff, that we held on Thursday, largely a good meeting, and cordial, those continue, and are ongoing. </p><p>      We have at a minimum try to promote these due process rights, and code of conduct that we -- every agency can sign on to, so that our companies are not discriminated against, there are basic procedures that they could accord to their subjects, and we hope to advance those. But the challenges we're seeing internationally, potentially discrimination against U.S. companies, could be a real issue. </p><p>      KLOBUCHAR:  Thank you so. </p><p>      LEE:  Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Thanks, Mr. Chairman, I will brief, I know you had a long afternoon. I hope you agree that having a fair and open Internet is critical to both free discourse and to free markets, and effective competition. </p><p>      Unfortunately, the FCC has declared that it will abandon net neutrality even though states like California have stepped in to preserve net neutrality principles, the DOJ is now suing to block them. I hope that the DOJ will reconsider this decision which in my view will harm ordinary Americans. </p><p>      Some of the FCC and the FTC's responsibilities with regard to net neutrality are overlapping as you know, for example the FTC has the ability to prevent providers and distributors from providing preferential treatment to their own content, net neutrality has as one of its goals to prevent that kind of discrimination. </p><p>      So, as our top antitrust officials, you have an important role to play in ensuring that there is in fact a fair and open Internet. Let me ask you very directly, were you consulted before the FCC rolled back the net neutrality rules? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  It might have been before I was confirmed, so I don't know if the Antitrust Division was consulted prior to my arrival, but I personally was not, sir. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Would you ask and inform this committee whether you were -- whether the -- whether the division was? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I will -- I will do that. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  And how about the FTC?</p><p>      SIMONS:  I don't know, but I can find out for you. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Thank you. Now that the FCC has abandoned its role in preserving net neutrality, are you considering enforcement actions that would consider preserving the free and open Internet?</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  So within the antitrust laws, if there is market power and certain conduct that incumbent would take, that would -- that would cause anticompetitive harm, it's an area that we would, where we stand ready to do so, part of our case against the combination of AT&amp;T and Time Warner tried to address some of that particularly with new competition coming on with online MBPDs, the virtual MBPDs that would be there, and to what extent harm would be caused by those types of consolidations, so that is one. </p><p>      And then, I should also mention since you mentioned the Justice Department's suit against the state of California, that is one that the FCC and the Civil Division of the Justice Department brought that suit on the constitutionality under the supremacy clause of that, and one that the Antitrust Division is not involved in. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  I recognize that fact, and I would've asked you to withdraw... </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I wanted to clarify. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  If I thought you were involved in it. But let me ask the -- Mr. Simons, whether you feel that lawsuit is well justified? </p><p>      SIMONS:  I don't have a view on it. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Let me ask finally, and it's a larger issue than just the Comcast NBCU merger. When that merger was approved in 2011, approximately 150 separate behavioral conditions were imposed on the new company, there is a question in my view whether those kinds of behavioral conditions really work in the real world, these conditions were meant to prevent the merged company from unfairly discriminating against rivals and raising prices on consumers, recently those merger conditions expired as you know, and The New York Times recently reported that Comcast NBCU is now moving to appoint three directors to Hulu. </p><p>      Are you concerned that consumers are at risk now that these conditions, merger conditions have expired? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Well, senator, as you know I agree with you, your skepticism of the efficacy of behavioral remedies to address anticompetitive conduct, it is one where I wasn't privy to the investigative materials, and not in a position to be second guessing the prior, what I do find ironic, this is the same judge that sat over the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case who was very skeptical about those conditions and asked the Justice Department to add more conditions because of the -- his concerns about the Comcast and NBCU merger. So, it is one that some people have raised the concerns of should we extend a consent decree? That was a settlement of a lawsuit and...</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Right. </p><p>      SIMONS:  ...really couldn't, am I concerned if there is anticompetitive conduct now that the companies are merged, we will certainly take action if there is a violation by the now, the combined company. You mentioned Hulu, I don't know if the appointment they were restricted from taking any kind of management positions throughout the consent decree, I don't know if the appointment of new directors to Hulu, certainly Hulu could be a competitor to the cable business, and it's one that we will examine carefully to see if they might take any conduct that would harm its ability to compete with their market -- within their market. </p><p>      And also take a look to see if there's a section 8 of the Clayton Act perhaps a violation of a -- of interlocking directorates of that. </p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Thank you. </p><p>      SIMONS:  Sure.</p><p>      BLUMENTHAL:  Thank you, Mr Chairman. </p><p>      LEE:  Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. I want to turn back to the Consumer Welfare Standard for a minute to discuss another topic. Some have argued that the Consumer Welfare Standard with its focus on price theory is incapable of adequately addressing issues, certain issues arising in the high-tech industries, especially those involving so-called big data. </p><p>      So, I have a question for both of you, just want to get your reaction to a couple of questions actually -- does the Consumer Welfare Standard need nuancing to address markets in which the product doesn't have an actual price tag paid by the consumer that's attached to the product?</p><p>      But such as is the case where services are provided for free, but consumers sort of pay for those services by relinquishing a certain amount of their personal data, and I guess a related question to that is, do you think an individual has a property right in his or her personal data? We'll start with you, Mr. Simons and go to Mr. Delrahim. </p><p>      SIMONS:  Thank you. So, In terms of the property right, I think that's a very difficult question. And one -- and that may -- that may put us in a situation where we have to be very sensitive to whether more privacy results, you do it in a way that more privacy results in less competition. So, I think this is one of the things that's really important that we need to think about, and we need to get right, and this is something that I would very much look forward to working with you and other members of Congress on. </p><p>      In terms of the Consumer Welfare Standard, my view is it's very flexible, and so for example, and it develops, and accounts for new things over time. So, for example one thing that like -- that is relatively new in the economic field is multi-sided platforms. There's now a whole literature that deals with that, that didn't exist 20 years ago. And there's probably other types of examples and I'm not thinking of off the top of my head. </p><p>      But one of the things where -- so one of the things where we could probably use some help and kind of new developments in the consumer welfare model would be how to deal with just these markets that you're describing, where the product is essentially given away for free either for people watching to get their eyeballs so you can advertise to them, just like in the television model or for the situation where you're describing where you get personal data. </p><p>      LEE:  Thank you. Mr. Delrahim? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I agree with the same challenge that we should be consider -- concerned with is how do we treat that particularly when it deals with the doctrine of predatory pricing where we have to look at after the Supreme Court precedent, even if it's below a certain level of cost pricing, which zero presumably would be, but is that the proper way of looking at it when a consumer is turning over something valuable, how do you assess value to that information that they're providing in exchange for certain goods? </p><p>      I don't think there's a question about some of the pro-competitive consumer benefits of some of these services that are out there, but how do you value that? And in one of those speeches that you referenced, it was this issue can we wait as a matter of public policy and we deferred to you, and would be delighted to work with you, can we wait for a period of time until there is revealed preferences by consumers to address that? And how do we value that in an antitrust setting? Or should there be policies earlier to place a value on that consumer data through a privacy regime? </p><p>      But it's one where some folks have raised the issue that we should look at the data when the consumer goes online as a, and assign a value to that. I don't know the clear answer to that, obviously courts have not addressed that quite yet, but I do believe that the Consumer Welfare Standard is flexible enough for us to -- within that framework to work on that, and address the competitive concerns it might raise. </p><p>      LEE:  I guess, you're saying assignment of value sort of connects back to the question of whether or not there is a property right attached to a person's -- or is there, did you answer that part of the question? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  Not so much the property rights. No, I did not address that, is there? </p><p>      LEE:  Do you think there is -- there is -- there is a property right? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I think it's a difficult question because right now how we treat it is -- there is a right that folks by whether it's through a click through where you give consent to your information being collected as a condition of using that, and if there's a violation of that then there -- that's our friends at the FTC would come in and say, you violated this commitment. </p><p>      However when there is no such click through, and there's no commitment made by the company, if the consumer still uses that, and the data is collected, what happens in the absence of a commitment of what to do with that, there is no action, I presume. Unless there is some kind of a property right associated with that, so then there would be a trespass I presume. </p><p>      LEE:  I wonder if Pearson v. Post could offer some insight into this case with the Foxes, so I've looking for an opportunity to cite Pearson v. Post since law school. </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  We will examine that. </p><p>      LEE:  Seemed like as good of a time to do it as any. </p><p>      Mr. Simons, in May I introduce the Smarter Act which seeks to ensure that the fate of a proposed transaction would be determined solely by whether raises competitive issues under the law, and not on the basis of which federal antitrust law enforcement agency happens to be assigned to the transaction in question. </p><p>      Among other things, this proposed legislation, the Smarter Act would require the FTC to litigate a merits of a merger challenge, of any merger challenge in federal district court rather than before an FTC administrative law judge. So, Mr. Chairman, at your confirmation hearing you indicated that FTC should generally file merger challenges in federal court, and if the agency loses in federal court it should not proceed to administrative litigation. </p><p>      The practical effect of differences between the DOJ and FTC has recently come up in the FTC's attempt to block Tronox's proposed acquisition of Cristal, two manufacturers of titanium dioxide, important things but not necessarily something that your average consumer is aware of on a day to day basis. </p><p>      Now, in that case, the FTC held a full merits trial in administrative litigation before ever appearing in federal court. The differences in agency merger procedure is a prolonged resolution of this case and it resulted in a duplicate cost because the FTC had to argue the same issues in two different forums. </p><p>      So, Mr. Chairman, had the FTC been required to file in federal district court like the Department of Justice does in similar circumstances, is it fair to say that that would have promoted a faster resolution of the case and thus lower cost to the -- to the taxpayer and ultimately to the consumer? </p><p>      SIMONS:  And so that case is in active litigation, so I really can't comment on that specific case, but let me say this, so I'll repeat, as a general rule, we should go to court, if we lose in court on appeal, we shouldn't file an administrative case. If on the other hand we find out about a transaction after the fact, we've done this several times previously, that is appropriate for administrative litigation. So that -- those would -- those would be the kind of the general framework that I would -- that I would prefer. </p><p>      LEE:  Okay. And you would agree certainly that passage of the Smarter Act would avoid these kinds of issues, because the Smarter Act would require the FTC to challenge mergers in federal court just the same way that the Department of Justice does that?</p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes, just be clear, I'm not agreeing with the premise of your earlier question. </p><p>      LEE:  Okay. No, I understand, as the particular litigation you don't comment on that? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes, right. </p><p>      LEE:  So, let me rephrase my question in a hypothetical scenario in which something like that happened, wouldn't passage of a Smarter Act result in you having to follow the same process that the Department of Justice goes through? </p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes, I'm not, you know, I'm not so familiar with the details of the legislation, my understanding of it primarily was that it would -- it would serve to make sure we have the same standard in federal court for the FTC cases as for the DOJ cases, so I hadn't really focused on the impact on the administrative litigation. </p><p>      LEE:  Okay. One moment. Let's talk about vertical merger guidelines, do they need updating? </p><p>      SIMONS:  That's a fun -- that is a funny thing the way you said it, because they need updating, because the old ones are so old that no one's ever looked at them in probably 20 years, so my sense is we -- I haven't even looked at them in a very long time, we probably have to start from scratch. </p><p>      LEE:  If you believe efficiencies are a legitimate merger defense?</p><p>      SIMONS:  And they're certainly something that needs to be considered, we now use complex economic models that for any horizontal merger will predict a price effect, unless there's some efficiency. So, if you're using those types of economic models, you really need to consider efficiencies. </p><p>      LEE:  Mr. Delrahim, any response that? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  You know, I think efficiencies as long as they are merger specific and verifiable rather than pie in the sky, certainly can be used to overcome the anticompetitive concerns of a merger. </p><p>      LEE:  But the -- do you think -- do you think language in some earlier Supreme Court decisions on efficiencies is dicta or is it Supreme Court precedent that efficiencies cannot be considered a defense to an otherwise illegal merger? </p><p>      DELRAHIM:  I don't -- I don't think I subscribe to the view that there is Supreme Court precedent that it cannot be otherwise overcome an anticompetitive merger, but I think, you know, with the way we would approach it would be consistent with the -- with the guidelines that we would have to take a look at balance, and I'm not aware of a single merger where it has overcome the anticompetitive concerns of a transaction, but it is one where if they are merger specific, they should be considered. </p><p>      LEE:  Now, given differences in how various lower courts have interpreted Supreme Court case law on efficiencies, and given the unlikelihood of any merger case reaching the Supreme Court any time soon that involves that specific issue, should an efficiencies defense perhaps be codified and put into law?</p><p>      DELRAHIM:  It could be, it could also be used, it could be applied in a -- in a certain way through the discretion of the enforcement agencies that we -- how we apply that, but whether it's codified into law consistent with some of the precedents that we have, I'll have to think about that, but I don't -- I don't know if there's any problem with that, of providing greater certainty and guidance to the business community. </p><p>      LEE:  Mr. Simons?</p><p>      SIMONS:  Yes, I'd want to do some more thinking before I give you a view on that. </p><p>      LEE:  Understandable. You have to understand how difficult this is for me to resist this temptation because I've got so many questions I'd love to ask each of you, but you've put in a long day, and I have to get to the floor to preside in exactly six minutes where I will have to sprint. </p><p>      Thank you so much for coming and answering questions. Thank you for your service to our country, and for all you do in an effort to make sure that marketplace -- that our free market economy remains free, and a place where robust competition can thrive. Thank you very much. </p><p>      SIMONS:  Thank you. </p><p>      LEE:  And your record will remain open for one week. And we stand adjourned.</p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2116073446</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDN-XVW1-DY0W-44H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"18790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bloomberg Government</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 4, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Department of Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Trade Commission--FTC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Case law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust laws</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Enforcement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consumers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Competition policy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congressional committees</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 922130</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 926150</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

We're pleased very much to have with us today the assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim and also the chairman of a Federal Trade Commission, Mr. Joseph Simons. And we welcome both of you and we appreciate your willingness to come to the subcommittee and we appreciate all the great work you do on behalf of the American people.  </p><p>      The landscape in the antitrust world as well as in the Senate and beyond has changed immensely since our last oversight hearing of this kind was held back in 2016. For one, the Senate's failure to quickly process your nominations has contributed to confusion about American competition law and policy.  </p><p>      Since January of 2017, I've had innumerable meetings with business executives and global regulators and consumers, all of whom want to know one thing, how the Trump administration approach antitrust and competition issues, how those issues and the way our government approaches them change and affect their lives.  </p><p>      I've tried to answer those questions as best I could, but there's no substitute for leadership at the Department of Justice and at the Federal Trade Commission and some senators' insistence on delaying executive nominations, including non-controversial nominations like those of Mr. Delrahim and Mr. Simons, has undermined the nation's ability to provide leadership on competition policy.   </p><p>      It has deprived businesses of clear guidance and has allowed regulators across the world to take a lead on important issues. Those regulators have often resolved issues in a way that may harm the interests of American businesses, American consumers and in a way that maybe inconsistent with American law.  </p><p>      In addition, we're seeing a breakdown of sort of decades-long consensus concerning the proper approach to antitrust. For those following the topic of antitrust in the news, one would think that we were back in the days of the robber barons, politicians and pundits, many of them at least claim that the economy has become increasingly concentrated over the last 30 years with dire consequences for consumers and workers and for everyone else.  </p><p>      As we explored in a hearing a few months ago in December of 2017, these critics are wrong about their core premise. It's extremely difficult to measure market concentration across the entire economy and in any event, fair-minded economists have explained that the reported increase in concentration should not be enough alone, in and of itself, to be of overwhelming concern to us.  </p><p>      Nevertheless, critics of the current regime called for a fundamental transformation an antitrust law and competition policy, in particular they want competition policy to incorporate subjective and political goals into the analysis. I have strong concerns that that approach could result in antitrust enforcement that is unmoored from objective economic analysis and could invite the kind of corporate and political influence that modern antitrust policy has long sought to avoid and with good reason.  </p><p>      It might reshape the economy to better fit some people's aesthetic preferences, but it would not make consumers better off. For those of us in the antitrust world, there's no alternative but to pick a side and to argue the merits.  </p><p>      The United States has the oldest and the most well-developed body of antitrust case law dating back to when Congress passed the Sherman Act back in 1890. Over the years, the U.S. has been influential in how competition law has developed globally; however, few other nations have two competition authorities whose role it is to enforce antitrust laws.   </p><p>      A bifurcated system such as the one that we have represented here today by the Department of Justice and by the FTC has the potential for incoherence if the two agencies' enforcement approaches are at odds with each other. Divergence in enforcement policy between the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice on the one hand and the Federal Trade Commission on the other hand is likely to result in confusion among international competition enforcers and lead to a harmful weakening of U.S. leadership and influence in the international antitrust community.  </p><p>      Indeed, I have very real concerns that this kind of divergence, this kind of dysfunction is currently affecting the analysis of intellectual property licensing which could undermine efforts by U.S. companies to create and develop key technologies, the same key technologies that will help drive the U.S. economy forward.  </p><p>      Let me say one additional word about what I consider to be appropriate competition enforcement policy. Antitrust law in this country has been developed primarily in the courts which allows adversaries to make their best case in each instance before an impartial judge. This approach may be lengthy, it may be time consuming, it maybe costly at times, in fact it almost always is in one way or another, but it has served us well for over 100 years of antitrust jurisprudence. I believe it is the most equitable way to flesh out the sparsely worded antitrust laws that we have.  </p><p>      Side stepping this fair, historical process in favor of administrative rulemaking by unelected bureaucrats is a recipe for mischief that is not in the best interests of American consumers or businesses or the American economy or the world economy for that matter. With respect to the hardworking people at the FTC, it is Congress' job to write the laws. If we believe that we need to change the antitrust laws, then Congress should take up that mantel.  </p><p>      I look forward to discussing these and other important topics with our witnesses today. In the meantime, we will hear from Senator Klobuchar for her opening statement.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We have long chaired this committee together and I am very pleased that we're having this oversight hearing. I am also pleased at all the interest, sudden interest in our antitrust hearing, that's great, that you'll all here and maybe some of it has to do with our guests. I don't think they're going to make a Saturday Night Live skit out of this hearing, but we are pleased -- pleased to be back in this room with the Assistant Attorney General Delrahim and also with FTC Chairman Simons.  </p><p>      And while the chairman did mention some delay, I was -- I supported both of you as you know. And I think it's very important that we keep bipartisan work going on in this area.  </p><p>      As both of our witnesses have now settled into their jobs, it's an appropriate time to review what your agencies are doing to protect competition and to address enforcement challenges. I just think back to my favorite game growing up which was Monopoly. The basic premise was that the more you owned, the more you made and there is always been that element in American capitalism. If you monopolize the board in that game by buying up multiple properties of the same color and covering them in rent-producing real estate, you could basically take your opponents out of the game, especially if you own the four railroads or maybe Park Place. I'm not going to get into the whole thing.  </p><p>      But the issue right now is we're seeing more and more of this in the real world. One example, the failed merger between Norfolk Southern Railway and Canadian Pacific, something that we took on immediately after it was announced, but even without the merger, 90 percent of the freight traffic in this country is handled by only four railroads, which is the exact number of railroads on the Monopoly board.  </p><p>      So that's the game, Monopoly, but this is the real world. Now, let me be clear, coming from a state that has many big very stable and very good companies, big by itself is not bad. And our witnesses here today, big certainly does not mean anticompetitive. But when big means market dominance, when big means there's not any innovation, when big means that consumer prices aren't going down, then it becomes an issue.  </p><p>      Two-thirds of Americans have come to believe that the economy unfairly favors powerful interests. Many have raised concerns about higher levels of market concentration across our economy and it has understandably led to calls for more vigorous antitrust enforcement. So we are entering a watershed moment for antitrust. It's a moment that's been driven by a number of factors.  </p><p>      First, our economy is experiencing a wave of industry consolidation that shows no signs of slowing, annual merger filings at the antitrust agencies have increased by more than 50 percent in the last five years. More than 50 percent in the last five years.   </p><p>      Second, we are living in a time of rapid technological change that is reshaping our economy, but also concentrating power in the hands of relatively few companies.   </p><p>      Third, the courts have become increasingly skeptical of antitrust enforcement continually raising the evidentiary bar for government enforces and private plaintiffs. Supreme Court cases like Trinco, Twombly, Legion and most recently Ohio v. American Express have made enforcing our antitrust laws more challenging, and potential changes to the make-up of the high court could even accelerate this trend.  </p><p>      It's the right moment to ask whether the antitrust laws are up to the task of protecting competition in today's economy and whether our laws still promote their fundamental purpose, to promote competition and consumer welfare in this era or unprecedented change.  </p><p>      We can all recognize that the stakes are high and the American people increasingly understand that competition is critical for their welfare, it means products and services are more affordable, it means more innovation, and it means more opportunities for new businesses and a more prosperous society.   </p><p>      And effective federal antitrust enforcement is key, the FTC and the Antitrust Divisions must protect consumers from anticompetitive mergers and anticompetitive conduct despite the challenges that I just outlined.  </p><p>      And a number of challenges remain. Dramatic increase in both size and number of mergers I mentioned. Since 2008, American firms have engaged in more 10 trillion in acquisitions and if you think things have been slowing down recently, you would be wrong. A record 2.5 trillion in mergers were announced in just the first half of this year.   </p><p>      These deals are part of a pattern of horizontal consolidation and vertical integration that is transforming many of our important industries, and in some cases, threatening competition and consumer welfare. Reviewing these increasingly complex mergers and challenging them when appropriate can stretch limited agency resources.  </p><p>      That's why I've introduced two antitrust bills focused on mergers. The first, the Merger Enforcement Improvement Act renews the federal government's commitment to antitrust enforcement. It would update merger filing fees for the first time since 2001. Think of all the changes to our economy since 2001 especially in the Internet space. It would lower the burden on small and medium-size businesses and ensuring that -- ensure that larger deals pay their fair share while also raising revenues.  </p><p>      It would also require parties that enter into merger consent decrees to provide post-closing data to the agencies so they can determine if the remedies are actually protecting competition. How many times have we heard consent decrees were reached, but then after the fact, many parties come to us, to our offices and say, \"You know, this isn't really working.\" So that's contained in there as well as increasing fees on some of the mega mergers in order to pay for people to be as sophisticated as the companies that are making these mergers happen.  </p><p>      The second bill, the Consolidation Prevention and Competition Promotion Act would restore the Clayton Act's original purpose of promoting competition by updating our legal standards. It strengthens the current legal standard to help stop harmful consolidation and codifies the structural presumption so that the parties involved in a deal that substantially increases market concentration have to prove that their merger does not harm competition.  </p><p>      We are also confronting the profound concerns regarding the conduct of dominant firms. The most well-publicized concerns relate to online platforms, but as consolidation is taking place throughout our economy, dominant companies in many industries are raising issues. During this current merger wave, we need to ensure that civil conduct cases receive appropriate attention.  </p><p>      Some have complained that the U.S. enforcement agencies have not been sufficiently active in investigating dominant firm conduct, particularly when compared with enforcers in Europe. We need to determine the cause of the discrepancy and whether it is justified.  </p><p>      Finally, we need to keep working together to stop anticompetitive conduct when it comes to prescription drugs. Too many Americans are unable to pay their medical bills or are forced to skip doses because they simply can't afford it. American consumers have every right to demand that anticompetitive activity does not inflate the cost of prescription drugs. We know that 4 of the top 10 best-selling drugs in America have seen a doubling of prices. That's just wrong.  </p><p>      That is why Chairman Grassley and I introduced our bill to make it easier to stop anticompetitive pay for delay patent settlements which cost consumers billions of dollars. It's also why Chairman Grassley and Senator Lee, our chairman, Leahy and Feinstein and many others have introduced the CREATES Act which has passed in this committee in June. It would help put a stop to other pharmaceutical company tactics like refusing to provide samples for testing which can delay generic introduction for years.  </p><p>      As a former prosecutor, I know how important it is to have enforcers that are ready and willing to go to court when necessary to enforce the law. I know that the two gentlemen before us are dedicated to this cause. I know that you have staff that are ready and willing to do this work and I truly appreciate that. So I am hoping with some of the challenges that we all know that we share, we can go forward together with the commitment of the administration and the two of you to move on these important issues as well as the chairman.  </p><p>      So I thank you very much both of you for being here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Senator Klobuchar. We'll now introduce our witnesses.  </p><p>      Makan Delrahim was confirmed on September 17th, 2017 as assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division. Mr. Delrahim previously worked for the antitrust agency he currently leaves having served as deputy AAG with the division between 2003 and 2005. Prior to joining the Department of Justice, Assistant Attorney General Delrahim served as deputy assistant to the president and deputy White House counsel. Earlier in his career, he had been a partner of Brownstein Hyatt Farber and Schreck and also was chief counsel of the U.S. Senate Judiciary committee.   </p><p>      That by the way is when I first had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Delrahim when I wrote an amicus brief on a constitutional issue before the Supreme Court on behalf of my future colleague, Senator Hatch, for whom Mr. Delrahim was then working. Good times.  </p><p>Joseph Simons was sworn in as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission on May 1st, 2018. Before joining the commission, Chairman Simons was a partner at Paul Weiss and served as the co-chair of the firm's antitrust group. He practiced there and focused primarily on antitrust mergers and acquisition, litigation and counseling.  </p><p>      Prior to joining Paul Weiss, Chairman Simons was the director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition from 2001 to 2003, having previously served another stint at the Bureau of Competition from 1987 to 1989, first as assistant to the director, then as assistant director for evaluation, and finally as associate director for mergers.  </p><p>      Before we begin your testimony, I'd like you both to stand and I'll administer the oath. If you could both raise your right hands, do you swear that the testimony you're about to provide will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Thank you.  </p><p>      Assistant Attorney General Delrahim, we'll hear first from you and then we'll hear from Mr. Simons.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Thank you, Chairman Lee and thank you, Ranking Member Klobuchar and my former mentor and former chairman of this committee, Senator Hatch for being here and also for inviting me to be back. First, let me begin by expressing my gratitude not only to all of you, but for the support you provided for me and my -- for my nomination and also for your steadfast support in a bipartisan manner for the work we do at the Antitrust Division.  </p><p>      I am also honored to be here with Chairman Simons, a friend who I've known and worked with probably over the last two decades and we're -- we're grateful that the FTC has its full complement of commissioners so that we can work well together.  </p><p>      As you know, the division has crucially -- has the crucially important mission of protecting competition on behalf of the American consumer. Before I discuss the division's many successful enforcement efforts and some statistics that you might find informative, I want to share a quote of a person who I often quote, which was the former great Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson who at one point was the head of the Antitrust Division.   </p><p>      In 1940 while we was serving as the attorney general, I quote, he says, \"Any prosecutor who risks his day-to-day professional name for fair dealing to build up statistics of success has a perverted sense of practical values as well as defects of character.\"   </p><p>      I preface that just before I give some statistics on this. It's always a good reminder that effective antitrust enforcement is not measured by the number of lawsuits we file or the statistics in cases that we address. With your permission, I'll turn to a few of the highlights of the division's work in criminal enforcement, civil enforcement, competition advocacy and finally, international engagement.  </p><p>      In criminally prosecuting antitrust violations such as price fixing and bid rigging, the division protects American consumers from certain and direct economic harm. In recent years, we have obtained criminal fines averaging $1.3 billion through our enforcement actions. A record-setting number of criminal cases went to trial just this past year, the highest in the last two decades.  </p><p>      Over the fiscal years 2016 and 2017, 52 defendants in Antitrust Division cases have been sentenced to prison terms totaling over 15,000 days of incarceration. Also the division has implemented at least what we call the No Poach Initiative investigating and prosecuting anti-poaching and wage fixing agreements among employers that hurt American workers.  </p><p>      We have conducted outreach and training for agents at multiple offices of the inspectors generals within the federal government at multiple federal agencies to identify, investigate and pursue bid rigging and market allocation crimes that hurt the American taxpayer.  </p><p>      On the civil enforcement front, the division has confronted multi-billion dollar mergers that involve industries important to every American consumer. We have protected and restored competition in a number of key industries in markets ranging from crowd protection and seed treatments to nationwide telecommunication fibers and entertainment. The division has litigated matters in a variety of industries including being forced to litigate its first vertical merger case to judgment in 40 years in the AT&amp;TTime Warner case after multiple efforts to settle that case.  </p><p>      That case continues on appeal at DC circuit. Currently, we're actively investigating pending mergers including CVS's acquisition of Aetna, the proposed acquisition of Aetna and the proposed merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. Also as part of our continued efforts to modernize our civil enforcement work, last week, we announced a set of reforms to the merger review process with the goal of completing all merger reviews within 6 months and most within the statutory 30-day waiting period.  </p><p>      We move to competition advocacy. The division has engaged in robust competition advocacy implementing a wide range of initiatives designed to advance competition. To highlight just a few examples, we significantly improved the consent -- our consent decree process to make our decrees more enforceable and less regulatory, to better protect competition and ultimately the consumer.  </p><p>      We've initiated a proactive amicus program in the courts and have engaged an advocacy of numerous regulatory agencies. Over the past year, we hosted a series of roundtables on topics including competition and deregulation and on improving our criminal cartel enforcement efforts.  </p><p>      With our partners at the Federal Trade Commission, we co-hosted a workshop on promoting competition in the real estate industry, a topic dear to many numbers of this committee.  </p><p>      Finally, on the international front, as this committee knows well, the United States and U.S. businesses benefit when the nations enforcing their competition laws according to sound economic principles and in accordance with appropriate procedures and protections. Our highlights in that area include the advancement of a core set of procedural norms through -- through what we refer to as the multilateral framework on procedures and competition law or we call it the MFP, working in partnership with both the Federal Trade Commission and leading agencies around the world including Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and a number of others to advance those goals.  </p><p>      Separately, along with our colleagues at the Federal Trade Commission, we have promoted effective enforcement of antitrust and competition laws across the globe, visiting or hosting agencies in numerous jurisdictions to discuss enforcement including, just to name a few, China, Brazil, the European Union, UK and Mexico and coordinating numerous technical assistance programs.   </p><p>      These are just some of the many initiatives and actions taken by the division since I've had the great honor of leading the capable attorneys and staff of the Antitrust Division just over a year ago.   </p><p>      I look forward to the coming challenges and to working with this committee knowing the importance of our work and with great gratitude for the support that you have provided to us in the past. Thank you very much.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      Mr. Simons?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, Senator Hatch, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.   </p><p>      I am so pleased to testify on behalf of the commission and to discuss some of our current competition enforcement activities and our policy priorities. I am particularly pleased to be here with my esteemed colleague and friend, Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for antitrust.   </p><p>      And I'd also like to start by thanking the three of you in particular for supporting me personally in the nomination and the confirmation process and also for your incredible support over a long period of time for the FTC, its specific mission, the men and women who make up the staff of the FTC and who do a terrific job and also for antitrust generally both of our agencies. So, thank you so much for that.   </p><p>      For over 100 years, the FTC has worked to ensure that American markets are open, vibrant, and unencumbered by unreasonable private or public restraints. With technological developments and globalization the FTC continues to monitor and evaluate how these changes can and should impact our law enforcement, our rulemaking and our policy work.   </p><p>      Although our agency mostly tackles these challenges together law enforcement, we also take advantage of policy tools. Our structure, research capacity and committed staff enable us to meet our mandate of protecting consumers and competition in an ever-changing marketplace.   </p><p>      The commission seeks to promote through a rigorous, fact-intensive approach to law enforcement. One of the agency's principal responsibilities is to prevent mergers that may substantially lessen competition. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, the commission has challenged 55 mergers.   </p><p>      The commission took action to prevent harm for mergers involving a wide variety of products and services including hospitals, medical instruments, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, water treatment chemicals, cooking oil and cement. Many of these cases were resolved through divestiture settlements.   </p><p>      But in the last year, the commission sued to block five mergers and there were four active merger litigations when I arrived at the commission in May.   </p><p>      The commission also maintains a robust program to identify and stop any competitive conduct, non-merger conduct, especially in health care markets.   </p><p>      The commission continues to prioritize any competitive reverse payments in which a brand manufacturer pays its potential generic rival to forego its patent challenge and to stay out of the market.   </p><p>      The commission has also challenged unilateral conduct by drug manufacturers to maintain a monopoly. For example, a federal court recently ruled that drug manufacturer AbbVie used sham litigation to illegally maintain its monopoly over testosterone replacement drug Androgel. The court awarded $493 million in monetary relief as a result of AbbVie's conduct.   </p><p>      This is the first time any court has found that sham litigation violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act since the Supreme Court first recognized this legal theory in 1993.   </p><p>      One increasing challenge for the commission in litigating competition cases is the need to hire testifying economic experts. Qualified experts are critical to litigating these types of cases but they represent a very significant expense in any litigation matter.   </p><p>      We truly appreciate the Congress' attention, yours in particular, to the agency's resource needs including the need to continue to hire outside experts to support aggressive antitrust enforcement.   </p><p>      Last, in addition to our vigorous enforcement work, the commission continues to promote competition through our ongoing policy work. As you know, in June we announced the set of public hearings entitled Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century. This series of public hearings will explore whether we need to adjust our enforcement efforts, our priorities and our policies in light of the marketplace changes, new evidence and new thinking which were referenced by both Chairman Lee and Ranking member Klobuchar.   </p><p>      Issues to discuss include whether we need to change the governing stand for antitrust enforcement, whether merger enforcement has been too lax, our remedial authority with respect to privacy and data security and other issues. Discussion of these issues at the hearing along with public comments collected throughout the hearings will help inform our thinking.   </p><p>      The FTC is committed to maximizing its resources to enhance its effectiveness in protecting consumers and promoting competition; to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace; and to meet current and future challenges.   </p><p>      We look forward to continuing that work with the subcommittee and Congress and I look forward to discussing that with you here today. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.   </p><p>      We'll now go into questions and I will kick that off.   </p><p>      Chairman Simons, you noted in your written testimony that the agencies have updated their jointly issued antitrust guidelines for licensing intellectual property last year. Those guidelines were silent on the issue of patents incorporated into technologic standards known as Standard Essential Patents.   </p><p>      Differences between how the Antitrust Division, the Department of Justice on one hand and the FTC on the other hand have viewed enforcement relating to Standard Essential Patents has become more pronounced in recent years. As I said in my opening remarks, the lack of clarity or consistency on this issue has the potential to undermine U.S. leadership on antitrust issues and also opens the door, I fear, for other nations to exploit those differences to their own unfair advantage.   </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, you've voiced concerns that antitrust enforcers have gone too far in accommodating concerns of technology implementers who participate in standard setting organizations relative to the concerns of intellectual property creators whose participation is equally essential to the pro-consumer mission of standard setting bodies.   </p><p>      And so, I want to ask both of you a couple of questions about these issues.   </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, first, how what's the Antitrust Division doing to ensure that the antitrust laws are being enforced in a manner that fosters competition while respecting strong intellectual property rights?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you've noted, we have discussed this issue in a number of public speeches and encouraged a debate, a vigorous debate on this really important issue. And it's important not only in the United States but abroad because what I'm concerned about is the misapplication of the antitrust laws could take away the incentive for the innovation that I see that provides the dynamic competition that we need here.   </p><p>      And there had been some talk about patent holdups and whether or not in a standard setting organization certain kinds of conduct should be treated as an antitrust violation. And in these discussions, I tried to engage not only the academic community but various folks in the economics arena to have a more robust discussion and look at not only patent holdup but patent holdout.   </p><p>      And that's where -- what we really should be worried about is concerted action where it creates a monopsony effect and lowers the potential recovery that an inventor makes in the R&amp;D to create that innovation in the first place. And we want to be sure that they are properly -- that the incentives are there so we think we should focus our attention on the concerted action whether it's by patent owners products patent users and the issues such as contractual obligations to licensure patent under what some people call FRAND or fair, reasonable and otherwise could be treated just as you would in a contract case. And there are multiple cases abound but not to be treated with the blunt force of antitrust.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  So, on that point, what do you say to those who would respond to your statements highlighting the dangers of holdout by implementers as in overcorrection and enforcement priorities?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I would respond that they're wrong. But I respectfully want to receive more criticism because that's the only way we'll improve our policies. I would also point to a number of academics including Judge Doug Ginsburg as well as Judge Michel who used to be the chief judge of the Federal Circuit and a number of other folks who have supported the policies that I have advanced on behalf of the U.S.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  And then Chairman Simons, in what circumstances do you think antitrust law may be inappropriate tool for settling licensing disputes involving Standard Essential Patents. In other words, when are more targeted theories like, say, contract law or fraud insufficient to avoid harm to consumers that might arise from market-based royalty negotiations in this area?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Thank you. So, the way I look at it is there has to be an antitrust problem in addition to a problem with the standard setting context, Okay? So, just the fact that there is a breach of a FRAND commitment does not mean in any way that there is an antitrust violation. The other component...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Sometimes a breach is just a breach.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Sometimes a breach -- not only that but you could have a -- well, two things. So, one is there might not be a competition issue that's there to resolve in the first place. For example, if the technology at stake or at issue is really a monopoly and there's no other choice then it's not a competition issue because they would have to incorporate into the standard no matter what.   </p><p>      So, that's not just a competition issue at that point. If when they're promulgating the standard, there are multiple potential technologies that could be incorporated, that's the point in which competition law is implicated. But even if there's a breach in that circumstance, you still have to meet the other requirements to show monopolization under the law.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  So, how should we think about the relative cost of over and under enforcement in the standard setting context?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  So, the way I look at it is there could be an antitrust issue on either side. So, you can have an antitrust issue for a holdup and an antitrust issue for holdout.   </p><p>      And in my view, what we should do is we should pay attention to both those potential problems. We should not discriminate between them.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  And so, what then is the appropriate time? It sounds like you're saying the appropriate time for dealing with these is at the beginning not later on.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  No, because you want to see what happens. I mean, it may be the case that there is no effect, right, that there's no effect on competition in which case you don't do anything. But if there's no competition at the outset then there's no antitrust problem. You just stop right there.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Senator Klobuchar?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.   </p><p>      I'm going to start with something that I hope will help both of you and I don't think this is a partisan issue at all. This is about making sure we have an even playing field as we have these increasingly complex industries and mergers that you have staff that or you're staffed up enough so that you're able to review them. And this is the Merger Enforcement Improvement Act which would address the ability of the antitrust agencies to conduct enforcement in light of this current wave of consolidation.   </p><p>      As you know, the bill would ensure that bigger deals which often are more complex and more costly to review pay their fair share. For deals worth more than $1 billion, the filing fee would amount to less than a tenth of a percent of the deal value. And it would be practically nothing for the merging parties but it would be a huge help for enforcement.   </p><p>      Do you think that this would be helpful if we would update the filing fees? Either of you can start.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I certainly don't think it would hurt and I think it's important to continuously look at these and see if there's a more equitable allocation of our resources. When you have $100 billion merger that requires 40 of our lawyers and God knows $100 million in expert fees, should they pay the same amount of those resources.   </p><p>      Those are important policy considerations for this committee and not necessarily for us but we would dedicate any of our resources, our statistics to help provide any technical assistance you need to better allocate that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay. All right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  I agree with everything that Makan just said. And then also with what you said earlier, it's been quite a while since we've revised the fee numbers.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. I am hoping we can right now -- I know we've been in talks about this but it would be good to do it in a bipartisan way so we'll continue to work on that.   </p><p>      Pay-for-Delay, will that continue to be -- that's with the pharmaceutical prices with major companies paying generics to keep their products off the market. Will, this continue to be a priority for the FTC?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Absolutely. This was a priority the last time I was at the FTC in 2001 to 2003. When I got there, there were four Pay-for-Delay cases in litigation and I see no reason to take the foot off the accelerator and put the foot on the brake.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  I like that answer. Is the FTC on the lookout for patent settlements that may unlawfully delay the entry of biosimilars on to the market?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay. Very good.   </p><p>      The vertical mergers and this is for you, Mr. Delrahim, how would you describe your agency's approach to vertical merger enforcement and what lessons if any has your agency taken from the AT&amp;T-Time Warner litigation. I know this is still on appeal so I don't expect you to reveal big details but...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Without commenting -- thank you for that -- but without commenting on that particular matter, we have reviewed a number of vertical mergers including Bayer and Monsanto where we secured I think one of the larger if not the largest divestiture to address the issues that farmers and consumers would have faced in that transaction. We commend the parties for working with us on that matter.   </p><p>      I think vertical mergers, there's agreement that by and large they don't pose the same competition concerns that horizontal transactions would but that doesn't mean they're per se legal. And there was I think during the trial and leading up to it, there was a perception that was created by maybe hundreds of new vertical merger experts on television that...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  That sounded a bit sarcastic.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Just a little bit sarcastic.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  That's okay and good.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  ... that all of a sudden they were saying that oh, we've never challenged a transaction in 40, 50 years but that's just not true. There have been multiple challenges where parties have sought whether that have been divestitures or consent decrees and that's an important part.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  And we're seeing more of these types of vertical mergers in health care, video content, things like that.   </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, could you tell me about the FTC's ongoing efforts to protect consumers from potential anticompetitive behavior and conduct by dominant online platforms?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Sure. So, as I have said before several times, for antitrust enforcers, the place to look for antitrust conduct, the best place to look is where there's likely to be potential significant market power. And so, that description would describe some of these big tech platforms that we're all talking about in the news regularly. So, those are the places you would look.   </p><p>      And without commenting on any specific company or any specific investigation, this is something that is a priority for us.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  And what do you think explains the difference in enforcement activity from here and Europe?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Hard to tell. I haven't been in the job long enough to kind of work that out yet. But I will say that we are working very closely with the European Union on these issues.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay. This is during Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, I asked him about issues on Philadelphia National Bank and which he declined to apply in a major antitrust case. And the reason I asked was because the case is foundational authority for structural presumption, the market concentration-based rebuttable presumption that the agencies and courts have relied on for decades.   </p><p>      And this as you know, Mr. Delrahim, plays a key role in merger cases are absolutely litigated and eliminating it with result, I think, in a decline in merger enforcement. And in fact, one of the bills I have would codify the principle that a merger that leads to a significant increase in market concentration would be presumptively unlawful. But that isn't the law now that's what's in this bill.   </p><p>      Now, this is only a presumption and it can be rebutted with evidence. But as a practical matter, how important is a structural presumption in merger enforcement and I note that a number of prominent industrial organization scholars have voiced support for the continued use of market concentration-based legal presumptions and what is your view?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  It certainly helps us if we want to challenge transaction to have that presumption in court. It's an important tool for enforcement and provides a bright line for not only the business community but for the courts to follow.   </p><p>      There has been scholarly criticism of it because Congress didn't necessarily create that presumption and the courts provided that, so could a future Supreme Court overturn that and say just go prove your case, you don't deserve a presumption since Congress hasn't, that's certainly possible in the future but that is the law.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  And that was, of course, my concern when I was questioning Judge Kavanaugh because of those cases, the Whole Foods case that he had written, but thank you. I just see it as important as we're seeing an eroding in the court decisions of antitrust enforcement and the ability to do it just even making it worse concerns me so thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Senator Hatch?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HATCH</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Madam Chairman.   </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, as you know, Congress recently passed and sent to the president the Orrin T. Hatch Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act. Now, this landmark legislation will update our music licensing laws for the digital age. Among other things, the bill establishes a formal consultation process between Congress and the Department of Justice regarding department reviews of the ASCAP and BMI consent decree.   </p><p>      It also directs the department to notify Congress a reasonable time before moving to terminate one or both of the decrees. Now, I entered some remarks into the Congressional record regarding this provision of the bill which I would refer you to.   </p><p>      The Music Modernization Act's formalized consultation and notification process reflect the judgment by Congress that before the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees are terminated, there needs to be a legislative framework in place to govern the market that follows.   </p><p>      Now, I've long been a critic of the decrees. I because they are outdated, but I also believe that tearing them up without a replacement framework in place would be misguided. Will you commit to work with Congress as required under the Music Modernization Act before moving to terminate the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you and congratulations to you for your leadership and to the Senate and the House for passing an important bill to continue to modernize our laws. As you know, those consent decrees have been on the books for over 75 years and they are very important in multiple sectors of that industry and many who rely on them.   </p><p>      We have embarked on this effort to review over 1,300 of these consent decrees that date back almost 100 years, and we're systematically examining these, providing public comment meeting with all the interested parties. We'd be happy to continue to brief you and other members of the committee throughout this process and we will have advance notice on our website and seeking public comment before we take it. We recognize fully the disruption that it could cause with just terminating them without proper transition period.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HATCH</emphasis>:  How do you anticipate complying with the act's consultation and notification provisions?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  We will certainly comply with the act and we very much appreciate the changes and modifications provided into that amendment. As you know, there were some issues that the Office of Legal Counsel had provided to the committee with respect to its constitutionality, but with respect to notification, we'd be delighted to do that. I don't think anybody has any intentions to disrupt this industry, but provide for a smooth transition towards a market-based solution for how songwriters are compensated.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HATCH</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      Mr. Simons, as you know, a few weeks ago I sent you a letter that expressed my concerns about Google's potentially anticompetitive conduct.   </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter that letter into the record at this point.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Yes. Without objection...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HATCH</emphasis>:  Okay. I also raised these concerns during an oversight hearing with Madam Chairwoman Ramirez back in 2016. Now, I understand you cannot disclose the existence of a nonpublic investigation. And since you cannot comment on whether you are investigating Google specifically, I was hoping you could discuss the commission's approach to oversight of the Internet and mobile economies.   </p><p>      How do you decide to start an investigation into conduct that may be anticompetitive? And how do you decide whether it is worthwhile to investigate whether a market participant has market power.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMON</emphasis>:  Thank you, senator. Yes, this is a very important issue. So, it could happen in a whole bunch of different ways how we come to decide to open an investigation. It could come from our own staff, which has expertise in this area and is constantly monitoring.   </p><p>      It could come from complaints from you, for example, or others on the Hill. It could come from consumers - consumer groups. It could come from competitors. It could come from referrals from foreign competition authorities.   </p><p>      So there is a whole range of possibilities in terms of how we might become aware of the behavior and then, of course, we would consider on a fact by fact, case by case basis whether opening up an investigation makes sense or not.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HATCH</emphasis>:  Well, thank you. Mr. Simons, as you know, direct selling is an important industry in Utah and many other states. This industry provides countless people with opportunities to build a business and is an engine for economic growth.   </p><p>      I've heard from many industry stakeholders about the need for regulatory consistency. They argue that clear rules are essential to sustaining their business model. In the coming weeks and months, will you commit to work with me on this important issue?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMON</emphasis>:  Absolutely, sir.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HATCH</emphasis>:  Thank you. I'm also interested in the series of hearings that you announced. This is a huge undertaking and an important step that you should be proud of. The response to the hearings so far has been almost universally positive as far as I can see.   </p><p>      There is one issue that some people brought to my attention, however, I understand that you are hoping to give an open platform to discuss the ideological debates going on concerning antitrust. And in doing that, it's laudable that you want to give both sides time to make their points.   </p><p>      Some have expressed concern, however that the witnesses selected for the hearings have been predominantly in favor of changing the standard for evaluating antitrust claims and those in favor of current - of the current approach have not had sufficient time to rebut some of the claims being made.   </p><p>      I thought I'd give you a chance to talk just a little bit about how the commission has been selecting witnesses and managing the amount of time for various viewpoints and how that will happen going forward.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMON</emphasis>:  Thank you, senator. Thank you for that question. So first let me say that it's almost encouraging to hear your -- yes, you're hearing these criticisms from the one side of the aisle because I assure you I'm hearing criticism from the other side of the aisle as well.   </p><p>      So that gives me some hope that maybe we're someplace actually in the middle. And we're trying to be as completely representative as we possibly can and to get everyone's views out. The hearings actually are not completely set in terms of what is going to be done at each panel session.   </p><p>      And so, I would be interested to hear those specific concerns and maybe we can address them going forward. But I would also like to say that one thing that's very important, probably maybe even more important than what happens at these panel sessions is the comments that we are getting in the process.   </p><p>      And so those are completely open. And we've gotten some really terrific, long and very thoughtful comments so far. So, that always is an option available to anyone who thinks that a particular side of the argument has not been heard sufficiently.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HATCH</emphasis>:  Well, thank you.   </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Hatch.   </p><p>      A vote has been called. We are going to have to recess for a few minutes to go and do that. So we'll stand in recess for about 10 minutes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  We will return.   </p><p>      (RECESS)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Welcome back. Thank you for your patients while we voted. We'll now continue with the questioning.   </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, I want to get back to this issue related to Standard Essential Patents as I was discussing with Chairman Simons. Within this world of Standard Essential Patents, if antitrust enforcers work to focus their enforcement efforts exclusively on holdup -- on hold by patent holders, what do you see is the likely impact for innovation and ultimately for consumers? And do you have any examples of that, what that would look like?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  So I would refine that into two issues on holdup. One is, is it a concerted action in that standard setting by multiple patent owners who might hold up somebody or is that a unilateral act by a patent holder.   </p><p>      So if it's concerted, absolutely, we should be concerned. We should get engaged and if there is a violation of the antitrust laws and apply them. If it's a unilateral that's where I start to think is it a matter of policy, I don't think Congress has provided us the authority under the antitrust laws and there is more appropriate remedies.   </p><p>      The concern is if you do that, we now begin removing, so for example, there have been cases and there are cases abroad where folks say, your refusal to license to your competitor or just the mere allegation that it violates some reasonableness standard, what is that? Who knows? If they haven't set the price, what is reasonable.   </p><p>      And there should be left to fact finders in a court. What reasonable royalty should be or non-discriminatory. If you say that by your refusal to license, where there is no such duty under the antitrust laws, I think -- I don't think there's a single case where there is a unilateral refusal and unconditional to license your patent, there's a duty to do so. By imposing antitrust penalties you're now completely changing that fine balance and I think Congress doesn't and repeatedly changes the anti -- the patent laws to provide that proper incentive.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Okay. Thank you.   </p><p>      We may get more -- back to that more a little bit later, but I want to talk a little bit about rulemaking. Chairman Simons, your colleague Commissioner Chopra has recommended that the FTC increase its use of rulemaking to define unfair methods of competition under Section 5 of the FTC Act.   </p><p>      In 2015, the FTC as you know, issued a statement of enforcement principles that guides the agency's application of its statutory authority under Section 5 but not necessarily by the Sherman or Clayton Acts.   </p><p>      Former Commissioner Ohlhausen dissented to the release of that statement, claiming that it did too little to bind the agency's enforcement authority under Section 5. So commissioner, do you agree that the FTC Section 5 authority is vague and should more explicit guardrails be placed on the agency's enforcement of unfair methods of competition under Section 5?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMON</emphasis>:  Yes. I would agree that it's vague, over a long period of time people have tried one way or another to think about ways to define the pure Section 5 case. In other words, where Section 5 applies in addition to the other antitrust laws and largely have been fairly unsuccessful.   </p><p>      In my view, the overwhelming majority of what the FTC does is covered by the other antitrust statutes, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act for example. And so, it's a little sliver which is ambiguous that we're talking about, and my preference is for us to focus on the overwhelming majority of what we do and not devote resources to a very small, ambiguous part of what we might do.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Okay. So that might signal where you might go in response to my next question, which is what do you think of Commissioner Chopra's proposal of what he suggested here?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMON</emphasis>:  So, I think in the abstract, it's worth thinking about but in practice, I think people have been thinking about this for a very long time and haven't come up with anything. So, I'm not optimistic that something concrete will come out of this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  And what concerns do you have, if any, about this being worked out by the FTC, within the FTC rather than through litigation in the courts or alternatively by Congress?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMON</emphasis>:  Well, eventually, whatever we'd work out internally would almost certainly be challenged in court. Whatever rule we pass, the rule would be appealed.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Good point.   </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, I realize this is an FTC issue, but do you have any thoughts about competition issues being developed by rulemaking rather than by litigation?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  It depends what those rules are. I think if those were bright line rules that are informed by I think mainstream economic thought, that could be positive, but to begin regulating into an industry without the rigors of the economics and then not being able to change those rules and be -- and have the flexibility we currently have in antitrust law to adapt to new technologies, new markets and new thought might actually cause more consumer harm. So having that flexibility to be able to change that would be really important.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  And certainly in the content of litigation you've got an added feature in that you've got multiple parties there to be able to hash out the issues, that makes a difference, right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Do you agree, Mr. Simons?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMON</emphasis>:  Yes. And plus you've got the opportunity to have multiple courts and circuit courts and maybe the Supreme Court take a look at it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Okay. Thank you.   </p><p>      Let's -- Mr. Delrahim, let's get back to the ASCAP, BMI issue for a minute, the division look that the ASCAP and BMI decrees during the Obama administration, issuing a closing statement in August 2016 announcing that it had determined that no modification was warranted at that time.   </p><p>      What factors do you think the Antitrust Division will rely on in judging whether legacy decrees should be -- that should be terminated?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  We will look to see -- first of all, I think we will be moving from a presumption that those decrees that were put in place prior to 1979, after 1979 there's a 10-year period and a 10-year term from most of these consent decrees.   </p><p>      But most of these, we should take a look at to see how they are being implemented in the marketplace. Are these actually causing market divisions? Are they preventing new innovation and that's what -- that is the mission we're on as far as getting the public comment from the multiple parties and stakeholders in this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  I'm slightly over time, with your indulgence, Senator Klobuchar, I want to ask one more follow up question on this. What if anything has changed in music licensing -- in the music licensing market since 1941 that would suggest these legacy decrees might no longer be required or current   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Well, since 1941, probably the innovation of 8-track, cassette, CD, streaming, downloads...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  What I still listen to.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Going to make him feel bad.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I hope I -- did I answer the question or is it (inaudible)?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Really subtle, so I'm still wrestling.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  But Senator Klobuchar?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay. Assistant Attorney General Delrahim, last week you announced a series of changes to expedite the division's merger review process with the goal of resolving most investigations within six months I understand, assuming cooperation between the merging parties. I also support increasing the efficiency of the review process. But setting an explicit deadly, there's concerns by some that would sacrifice accuracy and thoroughness.   </p><p>      What would you say to those who are concerned about the implications of this six-month goal for resolving investigations?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Well, first, I think we did not and I've mentioned it in the speech. We did not unilaterally disarm here. It is six months as a goal to work to and I think that's plenty of time for us to do the work we need to do, assuming we're focused on exactly what the harm is rather than on a broader fishing expedition.   </p><p>      And most of even some of the more complex transactions, like Disney-Fox, we were able to get to an answer within six months. I think within those reforms that I announced, I also noted that it requires cooperation, cooperation of data, cooperation of production, not hiding the eighth ball by the parties.   </p><p>      Many of this -- the timing is in the control of the parties. And so to the extent that the markets and the merging parties have an interest in getting certainty as soon as possible, they can help us get there. I think we can do most of them within six months, but sometimes it might be more complex and with the authorization of a Deputy AAG there could be additional processes that may be required in case-by-case basis.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  I was just reminded when I was -- has had my first and only other government job as the prosecutor county attorney, I set deadlines when I first got in for property cases or something to be resolved and one of the judges sent me a letter that said, \"You better start viewing your time as county attorney as more of a marathon than a sprint.\"   </p><p>      And I remember I wrote back and said, \"It's both a marathon and a sprint.\" Because you have to have some sprints as well, so you're saying that the cases may be different. The reviews may be different but you would like to expedite a good portion of them, is that what you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Exactly. And sometimes parties sit on third-party CIDs that we issued to them. They won't get us the data. And it was along with those, Congress has given us the power to enforce those CIDs in court. We will begin doing those.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  And did the Antitrust Division confer with the FTC on this issue?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  On the broad, no, although we did follow what some of the reforms that they have done that for example some of the transparency and having the timing agreement on their website are things that we learned and were illuminated. We have some different processes and procedures between our two agencies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay.   </p><p>      Do you want to add anything?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMON</emphasis>:  Now, we've done -- some of the things that Makan recently announced and we're -- and having to process some of other things that he also recently announced, so for example, we also are creating a statistical database to track what's happening with the mergers, how long they're taking various milestones along the way and coding for things that may cause the investigation to go longer or shorter.   </p><p>      And then we're going to have -- we're planning to have case studies for the ones that are, went longer to have lessons learned about maybe why we can shorten them and in case studies for the ones that went -- that were more efficiently run so we can have lessons learned about what to do right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay. Most favored nation clauses or MFNs are contract provisions in which one side imposes limits on the other side's ability to deal with third-parties by ensuring that the side imposing the provision will always receive the best price or terms of trade.   </p><p>      While some MFNs may be pro-competitive, I've heard complaints about the common use of MFNs in certain industries, which may limit competition such as the unconditional MFNs imposed by television and video content distributors that's imposed on content providers.   </p><p>      What can you tell us about your agency's recent enforcement efforts related to MFNs?   </p><p>      Anyone?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I'll be happy to address. MFNs can be pro-competitive but they can also be anticompetitive...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  ... for example, they can raise new barriers to entry or stabilize what would otherwise be effective price competition. The DOJ did examine, I believe it was 2012, 2013, they had a workshop on the effect on the MFNs and with respect to the Time Warner, the cable merger, that was an issue that was addressed in a consent decree with the use of the MFNs.   </p><p>      We've also done it in the health care, in the Blue Cross Blue Shield in the Michigan Hospitals case. That was even a more egregious use of the MFN because that's the -- it was an MFN plus.   </p><p>      Because they said that you may not license to a competitor and if you do you have to give us an additional 10 or 20 percent lower than what the favored nation cost would be. And that was one that was litigated and Michigan passed the law to outlaw that.   </p><p>      So it's one that we are on the lookout for and continue to examine their effect in the marketplace.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMON</emphasis>:  Okay. We look for these -- for issues with MFNs in concentrated markets both on the potential collusion facilitating side and also potentially as a monopolization issue.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay. Following up on what I asked of the chairman before, I'll give this to you Assistant Attorney General Delrahim, what has the Antitrust Division have been doing to assess the impact of technology platforms on competition?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  We have also been thinking about. We have convened internally with our 50 or so economists. We have also invited speakers from the outside who are experts both economists as well as our folks who think about these from the venture capital community and others to come and explain some of these issues to us.   </p><p>      They're important factors. It's something the attorney general himself has also expressed an interest and invited as you know some of the -- a number of state attorney generals that came into it for a meeting last week to discuss this issue. We continue to study it, beyond that I probably shouldn't comment.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMON</emphasis>:  This is also a subject of one of our panel sessions at the hearings that we're having.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Senator Blumenthal? You may. You may.   </p><p>      (OFF-MIKE)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  ... and I apologize for my absence before now and I apologize if I may be repeating some of the ground you've already covered. Let me ask Mr. Delrahim, as you well know, as we all know in this room, corporate consolidation doesn't just threaten consumers. It threatens workers as well.   </p><p>      If you live in a one-company town, as some people still do, it's easy for a company to keep wages low and force people to accept working conditions that may be substandard. When was the last time, so far as you're aware, that you cited labor market considerations as the basis for rejecting a merger?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  That's a good question. I don't know if labor markets, when the last time it would have been, but I do know and as you know we have been quite active in this area and thank you for your support in the no-poach area where competitors engage in not only price fixing but anti-poaching agreements amongst themselves.   </p><p>      We announced a number of them dealing with the Westinghouse Labtech merger and a number of mergers, we have actually, now have software with the documents that are produced for mergers. We go through all those documents and identify no-poach agreements that might have come and we have several investigations that are ongoing, some of which are criminal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  I've been very supportive of those efforts as you have mentioned and I think they are important. I am glad to hear that you have investigations underway.   </p><p>      I am aware of no past case where labor market considerations were cited as a basis for rejecting a merger but I would respectfully suggest that it should be.   </p><p>      Do you have an idea as to what the threshold level of monopsony powers that would raise concerns?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  If it's a horizontal merger where such a market would be posed I presume it would be the, say, Philadelphia National Bank thresholds that we would apply and we would look at it whether it's a monopsony effect or a monopoly effect here just as the merger guidelines would allow. And, you know, it certainly can be a consideration.  </p><p>      We also recognize that sometimes if the wage issues are not a consideration that the merger itself could provide for a certain growth and efficiencies that could create more jobs.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  And I'm assuming that the FTC likewise is focused on labor market conditions.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes, we've told the staff that they are supposed to look for potential effects on the labor market with every merger they review.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      Let me ask a question about search algorithms. Search engines like Google and Yelp use algorithms to produce search results that guide users to particular restaurants or shops. These algorithms can have profound market effects. For example, consumers often choose the restaurant that appears at the top of the search results, smaller businesses that offer high quality products at low prices may be less tech-savvy and as a result these algorithms might guide users away from them and away from the best option at the cheapest price.   </p><p>      So let me ask you what resources and authorities do you have to scrutinize the fairness of algorithms and artificial intelligence systems as a potential misuse of market power?  </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim?  </p><p>      And then...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  The use of search algorithms to cause the anticompetitive effect could take two forms. One could be if, you know, a use of an algorithm where there two parties, potential competitors might agree to use that and it's a way of either policing or effectuating a price fixing scheme that they might have.   </p><p>      We actually have a case that's a criminal case that is going to be coming into a conclusion in the next coming, in the next two weeks I think and that we can make -- we will make public of the use of that. And I believe it's the first of its kind. But it's an important issue that we are struggling with both here in the United States, in Europe, about how that is done.   </p><p>      So whereas the monopolization case where there's a platform that uses a single-firm conduct, if there is the market power and there is discrimination that is hurting either new innovation, new entry or a threat to that market power through the use of that algorithm it certainly could be a violation of the antitrust laws.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Are you going to make us hold our breath and wait in suspense for the announcement of the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  It's an interesting case. Yes, it's a criminal case that I can't comment on...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  But it heightened our interest even more.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I think it is a fun one. The facts of that are very interesting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Sure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes, senator, this would be part of the overall review that we are having on tech platforms generally. And of course you know that the commission had an investigation along these lines about five years or so ago and closed it. So that was an old investigation.   </p><p>      I am not going to comment on what we are doing now in terms of our investigative work.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Well I am very interested in that investigation which I think I understand. It's been, you know, six years since the FTC concluded its investigation into Google without expressing an opinion on the merits of these allegations. Do you believe that competition in search and other aspects could warrant renewed investigation by U.S. antitrust authorities?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  What I would certainly agree with is that these types of -- this type of conduct could be an antitrust violation. I would definitely say this, not per se legal.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Would you, Mr. Delrahim, be open to the Justice Department investigating these allegations against Google?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  These are matters between the two agencies, of which agency it takes the lead. The justice Department has investigated some Google transactions in the past. The Federal Trade Commission has investigation monopolization and other transactions, and so, the chairman and I will discuss the jurisdictional issues. But one will either do it or the other, depending on...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Now let me draw a parallel to Microsoft where I had some involvement. And the Department of Justice there took over the investigation. I would just emphasize the Department of Justice has an institutional interest. I hope you will agree to ensure the antitrust laws are enforced in such a key sector of the economy that is not to any way demean or dismiss the authority and the scrutiny that the FTC will bring to bear which I hope it will. But I am just raising as a possibility.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  So neither one of us is going to get in the way of the other investigating. One of us -- if this is matter of one of us wants to investigate and the other one maybe has prior expertise and might get it under the clearance agreement but is not going to do an investigation then the other one is going to get it. We are not going to use the clearance process to stop an investigation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  If I may ask one more question, Mr. Chairman?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Yes, that's fine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  The recent news of hackers breaching of 50 million Facebook users raises, again, concerns about how online platforms are securing their data. Very sadly powerful technology companies like Facebook are able to impose their preferred privacy terms on customers. There's little that customers can do to fight back and protect their own data given the power of Facebook to dictate those terms.   </p><p>      Mr. Delrahim, in an April speech you described this dilemma with a very apt question for this hearing, quote, \"Our consumers who believe that their data is digital currency facing a monopoly seller or a monopsony buyer with structural barriers to competition and entry.\" End quote.   </p><p>      With that in mind, let me ask you, do you believe that violation of a consumer right to privacy, digital privacy qualifies as a consumer harm and what can and should Congress do to boost competition and increase consumer awareness about this or their data?  </p><p>      I know these are two questions, big questions, I invite you to begin and answer here but I would welcome a fuller answer in writing if you wish to do it that way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Absolutely, no. And not only are they quite deep questions or important questions, that every consumer in America grapples with right now. It's an issue -- in that speech as I discussed is one where, you know, the issue of revealed preferences may show if there's going to be a competitor in place.   </p><p>      So some consumers gravitated to SnapChat when it first came out because they thought it had this disappearing text after 24 hours. And so, there was I think a consumer preference being revealed towards that and maybe there was a solution there.   </p><p>      Specifically with respect to, you know, kind of the privacy and data breaches that's an issue that we don't have the direct statutory authority to be enforcing our friends at the Federal Trade Commission do some of that. And when it gets to be criminal I presume our criminal division of the Justice Department will do that.   </p><p>      But the power that they might have is important. And are they doing -- are they taking any action to preclude a new innovator who could provide the consumer that safety and security they might want and they might wish. And that is an antitrust issue, that is something that we should be concerned about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  I agree.   </p><p>      Anything?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes, which I say that this fits into the normal toolbox for antitrust. We look at for example the mergers impact on price but we also look at the merger's impact on quality and privacy can be a part of quality. So some consumers may prefer more privacy than less, and so, that can be determined in the marketplace, and a merger could eliminate or reduce that quality factor.   </p><p>      And then in terms of data security let me just say this, if there is news about data security or data breach in the news it's public already, then we are concerned about it and we are looking at it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Senator Booker?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.   </p><p>      I recently visited farmers out in the Midwest in Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois and I was stunned with the testimony I got from farmers about the challenges with corporate consolidation and how it's transformed the heritage of this country and really hurt a lot of them. There are really harmful effects that are facing farmers on all side of the political spectrum. This is an American crisis in my opinion.  </p><p>      And so, I recently introduced legislation to place a moratorium on any new large mergers in the food and agricultural space. And just some of the data is stunning. Today's nearly 70 percent of all pork, 53 percent of all chicken and 84 percent of all beef is slaughtered by only four companies. These processes are exploited by their contract growers and locked out of the market access for independent livestock producers.   </p><p>      In poultry for instance 97 percent of the chicken consumed in the U.S. was grown by contract farmers. These farmers must accept whatever prices a company sets. The poultry farmers are paid in opaque ranking systems with little to no transparency to pay farmers more at the expense of their very neighbors, creating very unfortunate environments for competition that's not constructive.   </p><p>      In 2010 the Antitrust Division of DOJ and USDA hosted a series of workshops which was really constructive, exploring competition in the agricultural sector. The DOJ stated in 2012 that a clear lesson from these workshops was that antitrust enforcement has a crucial role to play in fostering a healthy and competitive agricultural sector. And I say anecdotally this concentration we are seeing as our farmers are getting squeezed from below with seed folks, and other suppliers and from above from a lot of these processing companies is just driving farmers out of business at rates that are stunning and even farmer suicide rates right now I did not realize it's as bad as it is.  </p><p>      And so, Mr. Delrahim, your statements DOJ's recent antitrust enforcement actions in the crop and seed protection sector. But what is the DOJ currently doing as it relates to the antitrust enforcement in the packing sector that so many farmers around this country have complained about to me and others?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Thank you, senator.   </p><p>      Certainly the agricultural industry and particularly the plight of the farmer is an important factor and something that we are concerned about at the Justice Department. We have a whole section that is just dedicated to, you know, the transportation and agricultural sectors.   </p><p>      With the seed and seed treatment I was referencing largely the Bayer-Monsanto merger where we got one of the largest divestitures and it kept the competitive balance in the marketplace the same in reviewing that transaction. And we have I think a very strong consent decree and enforcers, and we just appointed with the court, former Attorney General Mukasey as the trustee to make sure that the parties live up to the commitments on that one.   </p><p>      In addition to that the Packers and Stockyards Act which is largely enforced by the Department of Agriculture. However we get involved in a system with it. So those are issues that are even more specific to the competitive concerns of farmers than antitrust but it is one where we worry about both the monopsony effect which harms the farmer and getting recovery for their crop or their animals that they raise from the process. But also the monopoly effect that they could cause to the consumer.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  And so, what was stunning to this what I found out that many of these most powerful entities in the sector are actually foreign corporations. Given the administration's interest in modifying trade relations with countries like China is the DOJ taking any action to evaluate foreign influence over farming and food related or antitrust issues?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  So we apply the antitrust laws and the standard for Section 7 of the Clayton Act regardless of the nationality of the merging parties, and we expect that from our foreign countries as well on how they address their antitrust laws.   </p><p>      When there's a national security issue dealing with foreign investment in important areas and certainly farm and food stock is one. And I know BayerMonsanto for example did go through the CFIUS process which is chaired and run by the Treasury Department but the Justice Department participates in that to ensure that there is -- national security interests are raised or if there are they can be addressed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Yes, thank you and I hope that my office can learn more and may have some more questions for the record because it's really stunning to me to see what a lot of these large multi-national corporations are doing to American heritage and to American farmers.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I would be delighted to follow up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Thank you, sir, very much.   </p><p>      I want to switch to something that my colleague Senator Blumenthal from one of the best states in the Northeast that's proximate to New Jersey. He asked about privacy issues and some of the recent scandals are reflective of a much more pervasive set of problems, really, regarding social media and other online services.   </p><p>      There's a manipulation and misuse of user information. The distribution of misleading or even illegal content and the ability to engage in criminal activity with relative anonymity, these are just to name a few of the challenges that I know that you are aware of.   </p><p>      And so, perhaps maybe Mr. Simons and Mr. Delrahim, you both can maybe answer some of these questions and I will put a couple of them out there.   </p><p>      Number one, do you think that new laws are necessary to promote consumer privacy and then fairness in competition?  </p><p>      And I'd like to really understand your view in the connection between privacy and competition in this forum. And so, yes or no, do you agree that protecting consumers' privacy ensures a level playing field and therefore promotes fair competition?  </p><p>      And maybe, Mr. Simons, I will start with you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes. So that's a great question. So privacy, I think we need to do something about privacy. And the FTC has been involved and a leader in this field for a long time. And we would like to continue in that role but we would like both -- and we need to get this right and we need to do it with you, with you and the Congress.   </p><p>      So I couldn't agree more that we need to do something.  </p><p>      Second, the one thing we need -- the one thing we need to be careful about though is we don't want to have a situation where more privacy equal less completion. We want to do privacy in a way that doesn't hinder competition. Or else it will be, you know, it will be at counteractive purposes. So that's another really important factor.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Mr. Delrahim?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I support that. And we have a live example right now in Europe where GDPR has been enacted. It adds new regulation, however usually it's the incumbents who have the resources and the power to utilize the new regulatory burden and for that entrants to come in. So how that is done is there's a good way, how that will be done in Europe will be a good way for us to learn about what not to do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Thank you, sir.   </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I'm grateful for the time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Booker.   </p><p>      Okay, Mr. Delrahim, I want to go back to the music issue, I was over time so I couldn't get past your hilarious comment there. The technology definitely has changed there's no question about that.   </p><p>      My question for you is with the changes in technology, the advancements that have been made since then how has that changed the incentives, the relative incentives of licensees, of licensors and how does that impact the way you view an antitrust enforcement generally or the consent decrees specifically?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  This whole technology has done a lot for the consumer. There is greater consumption of music. You now have streaming revenues outpacing any other form of revenue that is coming in to the artists, on one.   </p><p>      Two, you have some new -- you have two PROs that perform in rights organizations that on the consent decree with the DOJ but you have two and perhaps others that may prop that are not under that same consent decree. And you have different methods of price setting by that.   </p><p>      There might be new efficiencies. For example an identification of the song in a repertoire that technology can provide with data that we weren't capable of doing just even 10 or 20 years ago that might address some of the efficiencies, considerations of the Supreme Court announced or observed in upholding some of those consent decrees that the arrangements -- that the ASCAP and BMI had to justify what they do.  </p><p>      So it's an area that is very fluid. We have a number of new services but we also have a new second circuit interpretation of the consent decrees with respect to fractional rights that have changed the landscape just within the last year.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you.   </p><p>      I want to pick up on a couple of topics that were covered I think by Senator Blumenthal and Senator Booker just about the Consumer Welfare Standard. For more than decades, more than four decades our approach to antitrust policy has been based on empirically grounded economic analysis.   </p><p>      Today, there are some critics of centrist antitrust policy that are complaining that this is too focused on economics and focused too little perhaps on the accumulation of political power that is capable of creating and then sustaining monopolies wielding significant market power.   </p><p>      Some of these critics claim that the data suggest that the economy has become dramatically more concentrated over the last 40 years, and would very much like to see antitrust policy solve problems for a whole range of issues, including income inequality, wages, labor issues, and so forth. So, I'll start with the question, what do you make of claims that the economy is suffering dramatically because of lax antitrust enforcement? We go -- we'll go to you first, Chairman Simons.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Thank you, senator. So, we have had a very strong bipartisan consensus on how to do antitrust enforcement and policy in this country until very recently, it existed probably for 25 years, and now recently, people are raising the concerns that you just articulated, senator, and they're doing it in a way that is more thoughtful I think than had been done previously.   </p><p>      And so what we've done in the FTC is we've initiated these hearings in large measure to get information and to talk about these concerns with the people who are making them, among ourselves, among other antitrust stakeholders. And as a -- as a part of a process to try to put back together the strong bipartisan consensus that we've had previously, which I think was a huge service to the agency itself and also to the country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Mr. Delrahim, you've warned going up on this topic that abandoning the Consumer Welfare Standard and opening antitrust policy into a broader range of objectives would quote, \"make the antitrust agencies more open to the exercise of corporate influence and capture.\" What are your -- what are your primary concerns about recommendations made to modify or even abandon the Consumer Welfare Standard along these lines?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I agree with Chairman Simons as far as the Consumer Welfare Standard, it has been one that has served us well, it's flexible enough, abandoning it might not have those principles that we -- that there's the basic principles to follow that ultimately, the actions we take should benefit the consumer, and keep the markets free, let them go back to FDR and Justice Jackson, many of us might recall Judge Bork as you know in his 1979 book, and he wrote it in 1969, but you go back 30 years before him, Justice Jackson was the one who argued against price controls by the government, and let the market decide the price and consumers benefit from that.   </p><p>      And I would adhere to that, I don't think we need changes every now and then, we do have to study, and I commend Chairman Simons, and we've had some workshops, but continuously examining, do we know enough here? We're learning more about vertical mergers for example, but some of the cases that we have and we're dealing with and we're going to learn more what the -- what the courts as some of these cases are litigated, but I commend the committee also for examining this issue.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you. And Chairman Simons, if -- would you agree that if we incorporated factors like these into antitrust analysis, factors like income inequality and excess political power, we incorporated those into antitrust analysis, would that be administrable? I mean, regardless of whether it would be wise or consistent with existing laws, would it be administrable?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  That's one of the most serious concerns about those proposals, and which I am hopeful will be addressed at the hearings. That is -- it has been a criticism of those types of proposals going back, you know, 40 or 50 years that at least in a broad sense that they are difficult to administer, and to some extent inconsistent with each other. This is was -- as AAG Delrahim mentioned, these were part of the criticisms that appear in Judge Bork's book. But this is a different time, and perhaps there are different facts, there are different arguments, and there's different evidence, and that's what we want to see.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator Klobuchar.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. And I appreciate those comments because I think what I said in my opening statement, we're just seeing this massive increase in the number of mergers, and at the same time we're seeing more and more conservative court opinions coming out of the Supreme Court, and I mean that in a way that it makes it harder to bring these actions, yet we haven't updated the laws at all.   </p><p>      And so, when you go back in history, in Assistant Attorney General Delrahim mentioned back in history, and what happened with the justices, but when you go back even when the Sherman Act passed in 1890, I think that's right. Yes.   </p><p>      In 1890, then you went for a number of 10, 15 years without much happening there, because of court decisions that were conservative, and then finally enforcers took on the cause with Teddy Roosevelt and his attorney general, and then suddenly with the Northern Securities case being the first based out of Minnesota, by the way, I don't we should be proud or not with James J. Hill.   </p><p>      But you saw these actions taking place and the change, and I just feel like then you went on to Captain Wilson, and there were all these enforcement actions. And then, maybe partly because of the wars and the depression things were dormant, and yet another period in the '60s and '70s where things were active.   </p><p>      But it seems like we're at this point where we just, not much has been happening, and we're seeing these mergers increase, and that's why I'm so interested in looking at these potential bills that we've been talking about, if we're unable to get that relief as in the recent case that Justice Department valiantly brought. If we can't get the relief in court, then you've got to start looking at legislation or different enforcement methods.   </p><p>      So, I'd like to ask you about monopsony and buyer power, and this often overlooked area of antitrust has recently received more attention, as buyer power among employers has been linked to stagnant wages. This is one of my bills, the Consolidation Prevention and Competition Promotion Act I want to make explicit that a merger that tends to create a monopsony is unlawful under the Clayton Act.   </p><p>      I guess my first question at present that we -- at present we don't see a great deal of monopsony enforcement at the agencies, why is that, and can you discuss how your agency approaches issues of monopsony and buyer power in merger analysis?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Sure. So for -- thank you, senator. For every merger that we investigate, the staff has been instructed that they need to look for potential impacts on labor. And it can come in multiple different flavors, the most, perhaps the simplest version you can imagine a merger of two auto manufacturers for example that both have operations in a -- in a -- not in a big city, but in a relatively rural area, and are the primary employers.   </p><p>      Well, even though -- even though on the output side, they may not -- they may not be in any competitive problem there, it might be because the two plants are next to each other. So, that that's an extreme version.   </p><p>      A lot of the mergers involve more mobile skilled employees and that takes a completely different analysis, because the market would probably be broader, but we'd have to look. So, through all these types of different possible scenarios, we're looking.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay. With a more specific question Assistant Attorney General Delrahim, you announced last week that you were withdrawing 2011 policy guide to merger remedies as part of reassessing the division remedy policy, have the division and FTC considered working jointly on an updated joint policy guide? And are there reasons for the two agencies to have different policies in this area?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  The remedies, the merger remedies, going back to 2004 have been specific to each of the agencies, I would welcome the input for my colleague and see if there is one way it makes sense given our different procedures about whether or not a merger I think, to the extent we do these jointly, we're better off and provide better certainty to the business community.   </p><p>      But I think that mergers remedy guide is probably one where we don't need to diverge, because I don't think the differences in our structure and our procedures would allow for that. In withdrawing the 2011, we in the interim have placed in back the 2004 guidelines which call for structural remedies as a preferred mode rather than behavioral remedies until we update those.   </p><p>      And by the way, we'll probably look at the vertical merger guidelines in the coming future, since those have been in place since 1984, and most of us would not even understand the if we read them today.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  So, they don't really have much use.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  I brought up the CREATES Act early on my opening and this bill with Senator Grassley, Leahy, and Senator Lee, and myself that we introduced. Can you talk about quickly what the FTC is doing now to address these issues?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes, sure. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  The sampling and other things.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes, so, yes. So this is something that we get note -- we get notification from CMS or HSS, I can't remember which one. And we look at these things, and we are looking for a good case to bring. But having said that, I think this is an area...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  That's very out there, I like that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  I'm sorry?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  That's a good thing to warn people that you're looking for.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes. We're it looking, but having that said that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay, good.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Having said that, I think it make sense in this area for what that -- to do a legislative solution, so I think what you're doing is very important and we support it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Yes, and this is about the sampling of being able to get more generics on the market, to get more pharma competition. So, now that you've been in your roles, because I have to leave shortly, I may have to leave before my colleagues do, as you look at your roles here. What would you say are your two or three biggest challenges right now as you head into this new arena we're in and with all of the consolidation and also some market dominance that we're seeing in the online platforms, the pharmaceutical issues? I guess I'm giving you ideas, but what do you see as your challenges and resources?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Well, those three things I think would be at the top.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Okay.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  The other thing that I think is really important also which is being addressed hopefully by these hearings that we're having, which is really to get antitrust community and all of our stakeholders to talk to each other, and developing better bipartisan consensus.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Yes, and I do think we have an opportunity, Mr. Delrahim and I have talked about this with the administration's interest in this issue, and I have talked to Mr. McCann about this that, you know, maybe we have a chance to move forward with some policy and legislative changes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  And I also want to commend the two of you for the way you conduct this committee.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Oh.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  On such a bipartisan basis.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  But the only challenge I would add to that, obviously resources are, because as some of these transactions are larger, more complex, much more resource intensive, how we address them, and some of the legislative proposals you put forth, I think merit action, but it -- on the international front, the international front is becoming...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Good point.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  ...a more challenging area, we just had our bilateral meetings with a European commissioner, Commissioner Vestager, and her staff, that we held on Thursday, largely a good meeting, and cordial, those continue, and are ongoing.   </p><p>      We have at a minimum try to promote these due process rights, and code of conduct that we -- every agency can sign on to, so that our companies are not discriminated against, there are basic procedures that they could accord to their subjects, and we hope to advance those. But the challenges we're seeing internationally, potentially discrimination against U.S. companies, could be a real issue.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Thank you so.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Senator Blumenthal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Thanks, Mr. Chairman, I will brief, I know you had a long afternoon. I hope you agree that having a fair and open Internet is critical to both free discourse and to free markets, and effective competition.   </p><p>      Unfortunately, the FCC has declared that it will abandon net neutrality even though states like California have stepped in to preserve net neutrality principles, the DOJ is now suing to block them. I hope that the DOJ will reconsider this decision which in my view will harm ordinary Americans.   </p><p>      Some of the FCC and the FTC's responsibilities with regard to net neutrality are overlapping as you know, for example the FTC has the ability to prevent providers and distributors from providing preferential treatment to their own content, net neutrality has as one of its goals to prevent that kind of discrimination.   </p><p>      So, as our top antitrust officials, you have an important role to play in ensuring that there is in fact a fair and open Internet. Let me ask you very directly, were you consulted before the FCC rolled back the net neutrality rules?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  It might have been before I was confirmed, so I don't know if the Antitrust Division was consulted prior to my arrival, but I personally was not, sir.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Would you ask and inform this committee whether you were -- whether the -- whether the division was?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I will -- I will do that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  And how about the FTC?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  I don't know, but I can find out for you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Thank you. Now that the FCC has abandoned its role in preserving net neutrality, are you considering enforcement actions that would consider preserving the free and open Internet?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  So within the antitrust laws, if there is market power and certain conduct that incumbent would take, that would -- that would cause anticompetitive harm, it's an area that we would, where we stand ready to do so, part of our case against the combination of AT&amp;T and Time Warner tried to address some of that particularly with new competition coming on with online MBPDs, the virtual MBPDs that would be there, and to what extent harm would be caused by those types of consolidations, so that is one.   </p><p>      And then, I should also mention since you mentioned the Justice Department's suit against the state of California, that is one that the FCC and the Civil Division of the Justice Department brought that suit on the constitutionality under the supremacy clause of that, and one that the Antitrust Division is not involved in.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  I recognize that fact, and I would've asked you to withdraw...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I wanted to clarify.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  If I thought you were involved in it. But let me ask the -- Mr. Simons, whether you feel that lawsuit is well justified?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  I don't have a view on it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Let me ask finally, and it's a larger issue than just the Comcast NBCU merger. When that merger was approved in 2011, approximately 150 separate behavioral conditions were imposed on the new company, there is a question in my view whether those kinds of behavioral conditions really work in the real world, these conditions were meant to prevent the merged company from unfairly discriminating against rivals and raising prices on consumers, recently those merger conditions expired as you know, and The New York Times recently reported that Comcast NBCU is now moving to appoint three directors to Hulu.   </p><p>      Are you concerned that consumers are at risk now that these conditions, merger conditions have expired?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Well, senator, as you know I agree with you, your skepticism of the efficacy of behavioral remedies to address anticompetitive conduct, it is one where I wasn't privy to the investigative materials, and not in a position to be second guessing the prior, what I do find ironic, this is the same judge that sat over the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case who was very skeptical about those conditions and asked the Justice Department to add more conditions because of the -- his concerns about the Comcast and NBCU merger. So, it is one that some people have raised the concerns of should we extend a consent decree? That was a settlement of a lawsuit and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  ...really couldn't, am I concerned if there is anticompetitive conduct now that the companies are merged, we will certainly take action if there is a violation by the now, the combined company. You mentioned Hulu, I don't know if the appointment they were restricted from taking any kind of management positions throughout the consent decree, I don't know if the appointment of new directors to Hulu, certainly Hulu could be a competitor to the cable business, and it's one that we will examine carefully to see if they might take any conduct that would harm its ability to compete with their market -- within their market.   </p><p>      And also take a look to see if there's a section 8 of the Clayton Act perhaps a violation of a -- of interlocking directorates of that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLUMENTHAL</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. I want to turn back to the Consumer Welfare Standard for a minute to discuss another topic. Some have argued that the Consumer Welfare Standard with its focus on price theory is incapable of adequately addressing issues, certain issues arising in the high-tech industries, especially those involving so-called big data.   </p><p>      So, I have a question for both of you, just want to get your reaction to a couple of questions actually -- does the Consumer Welfare Standard need nuancing to address markets in which the product doesn't have an actual price tag paid by the consumer that's attached to the product?  </p><p>      But such as is the case where services are provided for free, but consumers sort of pay for those services by relinquishing a certain amount of their personal data, and I guess a related question to that is, do you think an individual has a property right in his or her personal data? We'll start with you, Mr. Simons and go to Mr. Delrahim.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Thank you. So, In terms of the property right, I think that's a very difficult question. And one -- and that may -- that may put us in a situation where we have to be very sensitive to whether more privacy results, you do it in a way that more privacy results in less competition. So, I think this is one of the things that's really important that we need to think about, and we need to get right, and this is something that I would very much look forward to working with you and other members of Congress on.   </p><p>      In terms of the Consumer Welfare Standard, my view is it's very flexible, and so for example, and it develops, and accounts for new things over time. So, for example one thing that like -- that is relatively new in the economic field is multi-sided platforms. There's now a whole literature that deals with that, that didn't exist 20 years ago. And there's probably other types of examples and I'm not thinking of off the top of my head.   </p><p>      But one of the things where -- so one of the things where we could probably use some help and kind of new developments in the consumer welfare model would be how to deal with just these markets that you're describing, where the product is essentially given away for free either for people watching to get their eyeballs so you can advertise to them, just like in the television model or for the situation where you're describing where you get personal data.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you. Mr. Delrahim?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I agree with the same challenge that we should be consider -- concerned with is how do we treat that particularly when it deals with the doctrine of predatory pricing where we have to look at after the Supreme Court precedent, even if it's below a certain level of cost pricing, which zero presumably would be, but is that the proper way of looking at it when a consumer is turning over something valuable, how do you assess value to that information that they're providing in exchange for certain goods?   </p><p>      I don't think there's a question about some of the pro-competitive consumer benefits of some of these services that are out there, but how do you value that? And in one of those speeches that you referenced, it was this issue can we wait as a matter of public policy and we deferred to you, and would be delighted to work with you, can we wait for a period of time until there is revealed preferences by consumers to address that? And how do we value that in an antitrust setting? Or should there be policies earlier to place a value on that consumer data through a privacy regime?   </p><p>      But it's one where some folks have raised the issue that we should look at the data when the consumer goes online as a, and assign a value to that. I don't know the clear answer to that, obviously courts have not addressed that quite yet, but I do believe that the Consumer Welfare Standard is flexible enough for us to -- within that framework to work on that, and address the competitive concerns it might raise.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  I guess, you're saying assignment of value sort of connects back to the question of whether or not there is a property right attached to a person's -- or is there, did you answer that part of the question?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  Not so much the property rights. No, I did not address that, is there?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Do you think there is -- there is -- there is a property right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I think it's a difficult question because right now how we treat it is -- there is a right that folks by whether it's through a click through where you give consent to your information being collected as a condition of using that, and if there's a violation of that then there -- that's our friends at the FTC would come in and say, you violated this commitment.   </p><p>      However when there is no such click through, and there's no commitment made by the company, if the consumer still uses that, and the data is collected, what happens in the absence of a commitment of what to do with that, there is no action, I presume. Unless there is some kind of a property right associated with that, so then there would be a trespass I presume.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  I wonder if Pearson v. Post could offer some insight into this case with the Foxes, so I've looking for an opportunity to cite Pearson v. Post since law school.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  We will examine that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Seemed like as good of a time to do it as any.   </p><p>      Mr. Simons, in May I introduce the Smarter Act which seeks to ensure that the fate of a proposed transaction would be determined solely by whether raises competitive issues under the law, and not on the basis of which federal antitrust law enforcement agency happens to be assigned to the transaction in question.   </p><p>      Among other things, this proposed legislation, the Smarter Act would require the FTC to litigate a merits of a merger challenge, of any merger challenge in federal district court rather than before an FTC administrative law judge. So, Mr. Chairman, at your confirmation hearing you indicated that FTC should generally file merger challenges in federal court, and if the agency loses in federal court it should not proceed to administrative litigation.   </p><p>      The practical effect of differences between the DOJ and FTC has recently come up in the FTC's attempt to block Tronox's proposed acquisition of Cristal, two manufacturers of titanium dioxide, important things but not necessarily something that your average consumer is aware of on a day to day basis.   </p><p>      Now, in that case, the FTC held a full merits trial in administrative litigation before ever appearing in federal court. The differences in agency merger procedure is a prolonged resolution of this case and it resulted in a duplicate cost because the FTC had to argue the same issues in two different forums.   </p><p>      So, Mr. Chairman, had the FTC been required to file in federal district court like the Department of Justice does in similar circumstances, is it fair to say that that would have promoted a faster resolution of the case and thus lower cost to the -- to the taxpayer and ultimately to the consumer?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  And so that case is in active litigation, so I really can't comment on that specific case, but let me say this, so I'll repeat, as a general rule, we should go to court, if we lose in court on appeal, we shouldn't file an administrative case. If on the other hand we find out about a transaction after the fact, we've done this several times previously, that is appropriate for administrative litigation. So that -- those would -- those would be the kind of the general framework that I would -- that I would prefer.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Okay. And you would agree certainly that passage of the Smarter Act would avoid these kinds of issues, because the Smarter Act would require the FTC to challenge mergers in federal court just the same way that the Department of Justice does that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes, just be clear, I'm not agreeing with the premise of your earlier question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Okay. No, I understand, as the particular litigation you don't comment on that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes, right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  So, let me rephrase my question in a hypothetical scenario in which something like that happened, wouldn't passage of a Smarter Act result in you having to follow the same process that the Department of Justice goes through?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes, I'm not, you know, I'm not so familiar with the details of the legislation, my understanding of it primarily was that it would -- it would serve to make sure we have the same standard in federal court for the FTC cases as for the DOJ cases, so I hadn't really focused on the impact on the administrative litigation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Okay. One moment. Let's talk about vertical merger guidelines, do they need updating?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  That's a fun -- that is a funny thing the way you said it, because they need updating, because the old ones are so old that no one's ever looked at them in probably 20 years, so my sense is we -- I haven't even looked at them in a very long time, we probably have to start from scratch.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  If you believe efficiencies are a legitimate merger defense?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  And they're certainly something that needs to be considered, we now use complex economic models that for any horizontal merger will predict a price effect, unless there's some efficiency. So, if you're using those types of economic models, you really need to consider efficiencies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Mr. Delrahim, any response that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  You know, I think efficiencies as long as they are merger specific and verifiable rather than pie in the sky, certainly can be used to overcome the anticompetitive concerns of a merger.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  But the -- do you think -- do you think language in some earlier Supreme Court decisions on efficiencies is dicta or is it Supreme Court precedent that efficiencies cannot be considered a defense to an otherwise illegal merger?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  I don't -- I don't think I subscribe to the view that there is Supreme Court precedent that it cannot be otherwise overcome an anticompetitive merger, but I think, you know, with the way we would approach it would be consistent with the -- with the guidelines that we would have to take a look at balance, and I'm not aware of a single merger where it has overcome the anticompetitive concerns of a transaction, but it is one where if they are merger specific, they should be considered.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Now, given differences in how various lower courts have interpreted Supreme Court case law on efficiencies, and given the unlikelihood of any merger case reaching the Supreme Court any time soon that involves that specific issue, should an efficiencies defense perhaps be codified and put into law?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELRAHIM</emphasis>:  It could be, it could also be used, it could be applied in a -- in a certain way through the discretion of the enforcement agencies that we -- how we apply that, but whether it's codified into law consistent with some of the precedents that we have, I'll have to think about that, but I don't -- I don't know if there's any problem with that, of providing greater certainty and guidance to the business community.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Mr. Simons?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Yes, I'd want to do some more thinking before I give you a view on that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Understandable. You have to understand how difficult this is for me to resist this temptation because I've got so many questions I'd love to ask each of you, but you've put in a long day, and I have to get to the floor to preside in exactly six minutes where I will have to sprint.   </p><p>      Thank you so much for coming and answering questions. Thank you for your service to our country, and for all you do in an effort to make sure that marketplace -- that our free market economy remains free, and a place where robust competition can thrive. Thank you very much.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  And your record will remain open for one week. And we stand adjourned.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDM-K941-F15W-H18W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

On behalf of my Office and our partners in state and local law enforcement, I thank the Committee for its work and attention to this vital issue of local, state, and national public safety.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The single most important criminal justice challenge in the last ten years is, in my opinion, the use of mobile devices by bad actors to plan, execute, and communicate about crimes. Just as ordinary citizens rely on digital communication, so do people involved in terrorism, cyber fraud, murder, rape, robbery, and child sexual assault.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For this reason, lawful, court-ordered access to these communications has become essential for us to prevent crime, to hold people accused of crimes accountable, and to exonerate the innocent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Until the fall of 2014, Apple and Google routinely provided law enforcement access to their mobile phones when they received a court-ordered search warrant. That changed when they rolled out their first mobile operating systems that, by design, often make the contents of smartphones completely inaccessible. In doing so, Apple and Google effectively upended centuries of American jurisprudence holding that nobody's property is beyond the reach of a court-ordered search warrant.</p><p>In 2014, my Office stood in the vanguard of American law enforcement sounding the alarm about the dangers of default smartphone encryption. n1 In subsequent years, I have delivered this call in testimony to the U.S. House and Senate, including members of this committee in 2015, n2 and joined with law enforcement leaders in the U.S. n3 and Europe n4 in op-eds that explained the public safety import of this issue. My Office has also published five annual reports on Smartphone Encryption and Public Safety providing unique and valuable data and analysis on this topic. n5</p><p>Apple and Google, meanwhile, have framed this issue as an either/or proposition. Either we can have user privacy or lawful access, but we can't have both, they say. And they've been successful in propagating this message, even though it's not true.</p><p>My Office is not anti-encryption. Far from it. We routinely use encryption in the course of our daily work, whether in guarding our city's critical infrastructure against cybersecurity threats or soliciting tips on crimes against immigrant New Yorkers, and we recognize its value in our society and across the world. That does not mean encrypted material should be beyond the law when a judge signs a search warrant -- especially when we're talking about evidence tied to a child sex abuse case or a potential terrorist attack.</p><p>Apple and Google have maintained their absolutist position that no form of lawful access can be reconciled with privacy concerns. Yet they have not demonstrated to law enforcement leaders what, if any, damaging effects to user privacy their pre-2014 cooperation with law enforcement caused. n6 Further, they have decided for their own private business interests that the Fourth Amendment grants a right, not just to privacy, but to anonymity. This is wrong, and it upends the careful balance our Constitution strikes between privacy and public safety interests.</p><p>W SMARTPHONE ENCRYPTION AFFECTS PROSECUTORS AND VICTIMS OF CRIME</p><p>So how has default smartphone encryption affected law enforcement and crime victims? Let me answer these questions with two brief examples from my own Office.</p><p>The first involves child sexual abuse. A babysitter at a local church in Manhattan was identified as having shared images of child sexual assault online. Pursuant to a search warrant, his encrypted mobile phone and other devices were seized. Over time, we opened the devices using technology from a paid consultant. We then discovered the suspect was, not only sharing images of child sexual assault, but sexually abusing children himself, and recording the abuse as well. Based on this evidence, we charged him and a jury convicted him of predatory sexual assault of children. n7 He was subsequently sentenced to 100 years to life in prison. n8</p><p>In the second example, we were not so lucky. My Office was investigating a case of sex trafficking, and obtained an encrypted phone from a suspect who was incarcerated on a different case. In a recorded telephone call from prison, the suspect told an accomplice that he hoped his phone had the newest encrypted operating system.</p><p>The inmate said to his friend, \"Apple and Google came out with these softwares that can no longer be [un]encrypted by the police ... [i]f our phone[s are] running on iOS8 software, they can't open my phone. That may be [a] gift from God.\"</p><p>In fact, we were never able to view the contents of his phone because of this gift to sex traffickers that came, not from God, but from Apple. As a result, our investigation of sex trafficking was blocked by encryption.</p><p>II. A GROWING PROBLEM WITH RAMIFICATIONS FOR OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND ENTIRE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE</p><p>Our most recent internal data from our fifth annual report on Smartphone Encryption and Public Safety n9 puts this growing problem into sharp relief:</p><p>First, my Office receives, in criminal investigations, on average 1,600 mobile devices each year, with almost half of those being Apple devices. The percentage of locked Apple devices has increased substantially over the past five years, from 60 percent in 2014 to more than 82 percent we obtained over the past two years. So that means, for Apple devices alone, we receive over 600 locked and encrypted devices each year.</p><p>Second, more than 50 percent of the mobile devices that we've received this year are connected to investigations into crimes of violence, such as homicides, sex crimes, and assaults.</p><p>Our statistics illustrate the alarming frequency in which smartphone encryption forces my Office to investigate and prosecute our city's most serious criminal offenses without access to key evidence. To be clear, we are in some cases able to gain entry into these phones by using lawful hacking tools we've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to private companies to obtain.</p><p>In one notable case, a forensic search of an armed robbery and kidnapping suspect's phone made us aware of numerous text messages that had been exchanged between various unknown parties at or near the time of the kidnapping. These messages had been deleted and were not viewable by investigators -- that is until, after months of attempts, a third-party vendor helped us access deleted texts that had been exchanged before, during, and after the kidnapping. This new evidence helped us identify and charge three other culprits.</p><p>Such third-party workarounds are cost prohibitive, however, for all but a handful of local law enforcement agencies, like mine in Manhattan. They are simply out of reach for many of the smaller and rural communities that you represent. And the price we pay doesn't guarantee access, since the process doesn't work in roughly half the cases. The paid workarounds simply give us a better chance of getting into a phone using automated guesses, and Apple and Google have methods to slow down our rate of guessing. This cat-and-mouse game n10 can stretch across weeks, months, or even years, and that time line is unacceptable for a criminal justice system that has strict statutes of limitations and speedy trial requirements.</p><p>This issue also matters in another important way that few people appreciate: in a number of important cases, our ability to open and access phones has led to the exoneration of people wrongly suspected or arrested for crimes.</p><p>In one such case, two defendants were identified by eyewitnesses as part of a gang assault in which a large group of people attacked three men and two women. Based on evidence successfully extracted from an encrypted phone, it was determined that the defendants were not present for the assault at all, and they were exonerated prior to trial.</p><p>I believe everyone on this committee and Americans generally want to avoid miscarriages of justice. So do I. Our ability to access devices enables us to protect our two-fold obligations -- to hold the guilty responsible and to protect the innocent from injustice.</p><p>III. SMARTPHONE ENCRYPTION IS A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBLEM</p><p>The smartphone encryption debate is often framed as a national security issue. The F.B.I. reportedly paid $900,000 to have a private vendor unlock the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone after Apple told authorities it could not access the device. n11 The mass shooters at Sutherland Springs, Texas n12 and Dayton, Ohio n13 also left behind locked phones that stymied the completion of investigations -- investigations that might help communities and law enforcement stop the next mass shooter.</p><p>While these are obviously important national cases that demand significant attention and resources, I believe the smartphone encryption debate should center more around the threat it poses to local security in towns across our nation. The majority of collateral damage incurred due to locked mobile devices occurs at the local and state levels, where it is estimated up to 95 percent of American criminal cases are handled. Prosecutors in your home states are all now facing these intractable challenges.</p><p>The impact is felt across the country. For instance, it is my understanding that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement alone possessed 418 locked devices earlier this year. In addition, the Raleigh (N.C.) Police Department had 281, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation had more than 100, and the Charleston County (S.C.) Sheriff s Office had 70.</p><p>As I noted earlier, the workarounds by third-party vendors that sometimes succeed for our office are not an option for most local prosecutor's offices, due to the prohibitive costs involved. Thus, two versions of justice exist: one for major cities that can afford such workarounds, and a second for smaller agencies that lack the financial means.</p><p>Why should justice be made unattainable for victims in these localities for the sake of Apple and Google's bottom line?</p><p>Their decisions to advertise privacy, above all else, make a loud statement that they're not concerned about victims where key evidence is inaccessible due to their locked devices. Earlier this year, no less an authority than Rene Mayrhofer, Google's Director of Android Platform Security, belittled the locking out of law enforcement as an \"unintended side effect\" n14 of its latest security features.</p><p>Unintended or not, the reality remains that these tech titans are doing tremendous damage to our justice system, particularly justice at the local and state levels, by choosing to render themselves incapable of complying with a judge's signed order.</p><p>IV. WHY THE CLOUD IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR LAWFUL ACCESS</p><p>Law Enforcement is often told that we do not need access to a mobile device to conduct a thorough investigation. Proponents of smartphone encryption say we are living in a \"golden age of surveillance,\" and we should therefore obtain evidence from alternative sources, such as data saved on \"the cloud.\"</p><p>My Office does, in fact, regularly obtain evidence from cloud providers pursuant to search warrants, in the form of emails, photographs or videos, and other data that has been backed up from a device.</p><p>However, the cloud is an imperfect and incomplete solution to the encryption problem, since the most critical evidence is often only available on a device itself.</p><p>This is true for three main reasons:</p><p>1. More storage exists on devices than on the cloud. For instance, an iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro come equipped with a minimum of 64 Gigabytes of storage (and, in the case of the iPhone 11 Pro, a maximum of 512 Gigabytes). Meanwhile, Apple provides only 5 Gigabytes of free storage on iCloud by default. n15 Therefore, not all information can be backed up to the iCloud unless a user purchases additional storage data.</p><p>2. Even if a user chooses to purchase more data storage, the user has the option to choose which applications to backup to the iCloud. A user can simply decide to not backup communications, videos, or photos that are incriminating or otherwise critical to an investigation. The user can also opt out of backing up data to the iCloud entirely.</p><p>3. Data is available through the cloud only when it has been saved to the cloud. Often a device that is in use during the commission of a street crime -- such as a robbery or shooting -- is recovered before the evidence is saved by the device to the cloud. The only way to access that data is through the device itself.</p><p>V. CHANGING WINDS, DISPELLING MYTHS</p><p>Ideally, Apple and Google would do their part to help create a balanced technical and legal solution to the problems caused by their encryption decisions. Absent this contribution, the changing winds of public sentiment around Big Tech, in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica n16 and Google's Project Dragonfly n17 scandals, has recently created a climate that will support a legislative solution.</p><p>Project Dragonfly, in particular, raised a host of questions about Google's planned adherence to China's strict internet censorship rules. Among those questions: if Google is willing to obey an authoritarian government's censorship rules for search engines why won't it do what is necessary to comply with lawful court-ordered search warrants in the United States?</p><p>Similar questions on censorship surround Apple's activities in China. Knowledgeable observers suggest Apple -- a self-proclaimed champion of consumer privacy in America -- does not abide by the same standard when it comes to protecting the privacy of protestors in Hong Kong, because it's better for its bottom line to acquiesce to China's wishes. n18</p><p>To be clear, I, as well as prosecutors across America, are not asking Apple or Google for something extraordinary. We are not asking for a \"backdoor\" mechanism that would allow our offices to surreptitiously snoop on private citizens. Nor do we want \"surveillance\" of smartphone communications. n19 Instead, we are asking these companies to comply with warrants issued by impartial judges upon findings of probable cause: something I explained in letters to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Larry Page in 2014. n20</p><p>Some in the tech sector have sought to stoke fear that this type of lawful access will morph into a sweeping data collection apparatus that places consumer privacy at risk. I can assure anyone with such a concern that the search warrant process is subject to strict constitutional protections, which have been successfully overseen by impartial courts for over 200 years.</p><p>The same cannot be said for Facebook or Google -- which harvest our private data, sell it to others for extraordinary profit, and, on occasion, lose millions of people's private information due to hacks. Just last month, we learned that Google's \"Project Nightingale\" gathers the personal health data of millions of Americans, without informing patients. n21 Likewise, the 2018 security breach that exposed the accounts of 50 million Facebook users n22 demonstrates how the tech companies' priorities are not about protecting privacy after all.</p><p>Finally, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in March planned privacy changes involving end-to-end encryption for Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. n23 In doing so, Zuckerberg conceded that, with billions of people using these services, there would be some who would use these newly encrypted services for \"truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion.\" Law enforcement leaders from the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Australia have since signed an open letter publicly opposing these changes. n24</p><p>In 2018 alone, Facebook was responsible for 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse to the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. n25 The National Crime Agency estimates these reports resulted in more than 2,500 arrests, with 3,000 children brought to safety. Yet Zuckerberg's announced changes would dramatically restrict the ability to generate these reports: again, because a private company has made a business decision to render its products inaccessible to itself or law enforcement. Simply put, Facebook's planned end-to-end encryption will make it harder to detect -- and stop -- child abuse and similar crimes. n26</p><p>It's deeply troubling to think the overwhelming majority of these reports would cease if child sex predators were able to \"go dark\" because of Facebook's business decision. My Office, which is one of the leading anti-trafficking agencies in America, frequently relies on Facebook messages obtained through appropriate judicial process to build cases against traffickers. A world in which children can be recruited and groomed on Facebook -- with no hope of law enforcement intervention -- is a world in which we, collectively, are failing our children.</p><p>VI. CONGRESSIONAL ACTION IS REQUIRED TO SOLVE THIS COMPANY-MADE PROBLEM</p><p>Five years since the smartphone encryption sea change, it is unconscionable that smartphone manufacturers, rather than working with government to address public safety concerns, have dug in their heels and mounted a campaign to convince their customers that government is wrong and that privacy is at risk. Because Apple and Google refuse to reconsider their approach, I believe the only answer is federal legislation ensuring lawful access. Tech goliaths have shown time and again they have no business policing themselves.</p><p>Of course, as in any industry -- especially when it comes to public safety -- federal regulation has been important for many decades in the communications industry.</p><p>For example, when telephone companies went from using copper wires to using fiber optics and digital signals, law enforcement could no longer rely on previous technology when it came to wiretaps, so Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), mandating that telecom providers build into their systems mechanisms for law enforcement to install new forms of wiretaps when approved by a court. CALEA has worked. It has saved lives, and it has withstood constitutional challenge. It has not stifled innovation, as its opponents feared. And it has not caused American consumers to migrate to foreign competitors in search of greater privacy.</p><p>The same is true in the financial services industry. Beginning in the 1970s, as law enforcement learned more about how criminals were using banks to move money, Congress passed new laws to require financial institutions to adopt new technologies and procedures to detect money laundering; to better know their customers; to maintain customer data; and to make that data available to law enforcement pursuant to a court order. Over time, government and industry came together to develop protocols and procedures to effectively implement those new laws, and a broad consensus emerged. Banks and investment firms did not want to be conduits for crime and terror.</p><p>My sincere hope is that, with appropriate congressional leadership and legislation, a similar result can be achieved with this industry, too.</p><p>I anticipate that today Apple will tell you it is impossible to maintain keys to open one of their devices without creating a hole for cryptocriminals themselves to gain access. I have two responses to this:</p><p>* First, in 2016, Apple's then-general counsel acknowledged that the company's process for unlocking phones in response to warrants prior to 2014 had never led to a security breach. n27</p><p>* Second, this new criminal justice problem is the direct result of these private companies' decisions to redesign their products. I'm not a technologist, but I'm confident the problem can be solved by a company re-design as well. As President Kennedy once said, \"Our problems are man-made, therefore, they can be solved by man. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings.\"</p><p>A middle ground exists in the smartphone encryption debate. The right balance between privacy and public safety can be achieved by (1) requiring a court-ordered search warrant, and (2) limiting the information sought to data at rest (for example, the photos and messages that are already on your phone). In other words, I'm not talking about surveillance of live discussions or other communications while they are in progress. This middle ground on encryption is the position \"most likely to enable fruitful debate among diverse communities-of-interest,\" according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. n28</p><p>Given the current impasse, I am convinced this middle ground will only be achieved through federal legislative action, which is why I am here today. Allowing private companies in Silicon Valley to continue to assert themselves as the unregulated gatekeepers of critical evidence is dangerous, and warrants legislative intervention.</p><p>Thank you for inviting me to testify today.</p><p>n1 Vance Jr., Cyrus R. \"Apple and Google threaten public safety with default smartphone encryption.\" The Washington Post, 26 September 2014. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/apple-and-google-threaten-public-safety-with-default-smartphone-encryption/2014/09/25/43af9bf0-44ab-11e4-b437-1a7368204804\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/apple-and-google-threaten-public-safety-with-default-smartphone-encryption/2014/09/25/43af9bf0-44ab-11e4-b437-1a7368204804</url> story.html</p><p>n2 Written Testimony of the New York County District Attorney Cyrus R.

So many of the problems that families are struggling with today - such as how to protect children's privacy, how to prevent exposure to inappropriate content, and how to limit the amount of time children spend on digital devices - are a direct result of two things. First, the business models of the dominant tech companies are designed to attract large number of users, including children, and to keep them online as long as possible, so they can maximize revenue by collecting valuable data about the users and delivering targeted marketing to them. Second, the government has failed to adopt sufficient safeguards for children and has not effectively enforced existing safeguards. In particular, the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) failure to vigorously the enforce the Children's Online Privacy Act (COPPA) creates an atmosphere in which the big tech companies - such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon - feel empowered to ignore existing safeguards.</p><p>COPPA was adopted in 1998 to protect the privacy of children under age 13. At that time, there was no YouTube, no social media, no smartphones, no smart speakers in children's bedrooms, and no toys connected to the internet. Moreover, the Children's Television Act of 1990 and FCC rules limited the amount and types of advertising on children's television programs, on both broadcast and cable. These safeguards, however, have not been applied to children's content on the internet. Thus, the laws are out of sync with the current media marketplace and fail to provide the protections children need for healthy development.</p><p>My testimony today largely summarizes the points made in the attached comments I filed with the FTC on behalf of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood and Center for Digital Democracy. These comments explain why COPPA is no longer sufficient to protect children in the current environment and call for new legislation. Passing the Do Not Track Kids Act of 2019 introduced by Senators Markey and Hawley would be a good first step.</p><p>Even in the absence of new legislation, however, the FTC can and should act to better protect children's privacy. First, the FTC must enforce COPPA more effectively. Since COPPA took effect in 2000, the FTC has brought only 29 actions to enforce COPPA, and all have been settled by consent decree. Consent decrees provide only limited relief; they are binding only on the parties to the decree and provide less guidance for interpreting COPPA than litigated cases or rules. Moreover, the civil penalties imposed have generally been too low to deter future violations.</p><p>In addition, the self-regulatory safe harbors, which Congress intended to augment the FTC's enforcement efforts, have not been effective. While the FTC has approved seven safe harbors, these programs seem more interested in protecting companies that pay for the right to display a seal than protecting children. The FCC has failed to hold the safe harbors accountable, or to even make public the annual reports that safe harbors are required to submit to the FTC.</p><p>This lack of transparency extends to the FTC operations as well. It will not discuss any investigation or even say whether an investigation is taking place. The FTC provides no formal process for parents to file complaints or obtain relief for COPPA violations.</p><p>Nonetheless, on behalf of my clients, I have filed since 2012, filed 14 requests asking the FTC to investigate COPPA violations. The FTC has not acted - at least publicly - in response to any of these requests.</p><p>I would like to tell you about two recent requests that may be of particular interest to the Committee. In December 2018, we asked the FTC to investigate whether the Google Play Store was engaging in unfair and deceptive practices in marketing apps for children. After several academic studies found that many apps in the \"Family\" section of the Play Store identified as intended for children, were not actually appropriate for children, we conducted our own investigation.</p><p>Apps included in the Family section display a small green star to indicate they are \"family-friendly.\" Often, the star is accompanied by the age range that the app was designed for, such as under age 8. Google requires app developers to apply and to meet certain criteria to be included in the Family section and display the green star. To meet the criteria, apps must comply with children's privacy laws, not engage in deceptive or unfair advertising practices, and not show content inappropriate for children. While these are reasonable criteria, we discovered that Google was not enforcing them.</p><p>We found many examples of children's apps that violate COPPA by collecting personal information from children without giving notice to parents and obtaining verifiable parental consent. We also found many instances of unfair or deceptive practices - such as manipulating kids to watch ads or make in-app purchases. We also found apps with content inappropriate for children such as advertisements for beer and gambling. We argued that by misrepresenting that these apps were appropriate for children, Google was engaging in deceptive practices in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.</p><p>Earlier, in April 2018, we asked the FTC to investigate whether YouTube was violating COPPA. YouTube is the most popular online platform among children. It hosts channels of nursery rhymes, unboxing videos, popular cartoons, and other content specifically designed for children on the main YouTube platform. Some, such as ChuChuTV Nursery Rhymes and Kids Songs and Ryan ToysReview, are among the most popular of all YouTube channels.</p><p>Google asserts that it need not give notice or obtain parental consent for collecting personal information as required by COPPA, because children are not on YouTube. The absurdity of this claim is belied by the company's recent decision to disable comments on tens of millions of videos featuring children under 13 due to concerns that pedophiles have used comments on videos of children to guide other predators. n1</p><p>Recent press reports have indicated that the FTC is considering taking action against YouTube for violating COPPA. Consequently, my clients and I wrote the FTC outlining what we believe would be appropriate remedies. Among other things, we asked the FTC to ensure that Google lives up to its Terms of Service - which stipulate YouTube is only for persons thirteen and older - by removing all kids' content from the main YouTube platform. All child-directed content should be placed on a separate platform where targeted advertising, commercial data collection, links to other sites or content, comments, and autoplay are prohibited. These changes would help advance a healthy media environment for children, while sending a clear message to all online and mobile operators that no one is above the law.</p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the Committee and am happy to answer any questions.</p><p>The Center for Digital Democracy (CCD) and Campaign for a Commerical Free Childhood (CCFC), by their attorneys, the Institute for Public Representation (IPR) at Georgetown Law, n2 submit comments regarding the FTC's Approach to Consumer Privacy. Our comments focus on privacy of children and teens. We show how prevalent data collection and tracking have become in the lives of children and teens.</p><p>While the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is intended to protect the privacy of children under age 13, it is no longer up to the task. COPPA's underlying assumption is that parents will be able to protect their children's privacy if companies give notice of their privacy practices and do not collect personal information until unless the parent gives consent. But this no longer works. Most parents do not read privacy policies, and even if they do, many not provide the information needed for informed consent. Given the unprecedent amount of data being collected, the sophistication of data mining techniques, and the lack of transparency, most people lack a sufficient understanding of scope of the data collected and how it could be used. Moreover, because the FTC has not effectively enforced COPPA, many companies feel free to ignore COPPA's requirements.</p><p>New legislation, such as the bi-partisan Markey-Hawley bill, is needed to address COPPA's short comings. Any legislation must include developmentally-appropriate protections for teens, because COPPA only covers children under age 13. The legislation should also prohibit practices that may be harmful to children, rather than requiring parents to read and try to understand the impact of multiple privacy policies.</p><p>Until such legislation is passed, however, the FTC can and should do more to better protect children's privacy. Specifically, we urge the FTC to undertake more enforcement actions, to enforce COPPA's notice requirements, and to fix problems with the COPPA safe harbor program.</p><p>Table of Contents I.

Conclusion......................................................................................................................33</p><p>I. Introduction</p><p>Both CCD and CCFC have had many years of experience with COPPA. CDD's predecessor organization, Center for Media Education (CME), and counsel IPR, filed the first complaint alleging that a children's website, Kidscom, was engaging in unfair and deceptive practices in 1996. n3 After Congress passed COPPA in 1998, a coalition of groups led by CME commented on the FTC proposed rules for implementing COPPA.</p><p>When the FTC opened a proceeding to revise COPPA in 2010, CDD, CCFC, and others urged the FTC to update the COPPA Rule to take account of changes in technology and marketing. The FTC adopted many of our suggestions and cited our comments multiple times in the Statement of Basis and Purpose accompanying the revised rule. n4 We also filed comments on every proposal for a COPPA safe harbor as well as and proposals for verifiable parental consent mechanisms.</p><p>CDD and CCFC have also filed numerous complaints alleging COPPA violations and asking the FTC to investigate. n5 Most recently, in April 2019, we alleged that Amazon's Echo Dot Kids Edition violated COPPA by failing to give adequate notice, failing to obtain verifiable parental consent, and retaining children's voice recordings and transcription for far longer than necessary. In December 2018, we alleged that Google Play's family section included a large number of apps rated for children under age 13 that were not in compliance with COPPA. In October, 2018, CCFC and others alleged that Facebook's Messenger Kids violated COPPA by collecting personal information from children without obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parents with clear and complete disclosures of Facebook's data practices.</p><p>In April 2018, CDD and CCFC alleged that YouTube failed to provide notice or get parental consent before collecting personal information from children watching children's program channels on YouTube. Other complaints alleging COPPA violations concerned interactive toys, online promotions of candy, a child-directed website, mobile apps, and \"refer-a-friend\" features on children's websites.</p><p>Our experience informs these comments. While historically COPPA has protected children's privacy, it is no longer sufficient today. Due to the pervasiveness of data collection, tracking and surveillance and the FTC's failure to adequately enforce the law, children may be tracked in virtually all aspects of life. Unless a website is considered \"directed to children\" and parents decline to consent, a child will likely be tracked whenever she browses the internet, watches a video online, uses a search engine, plays an online game, visits a website, or makes an online purchase. Simply having a cell phone, allows a child's location to be tracked. Smart speakers in the home, as well as toys connected to the internet, record children's voices and answer their questions. Children's television viewing may be tracked by smart television sets or streaming services.</p><p>As explained below, the collection of so much data, combined with sophisticated means of analyzing data poses substantial risks to children and teens. Personal information collected from children and teens may combined with other data from a variety of sources. It can be mined using powerful computing processing including AI, to allow marketers to gain insights on how they can influence consumer attitudes and values, test how to make advertising even more manipulative, test what products will be successful, and expand or limit opportunities that children and teens are exposed to through marketing. Thus, new legislation. along with more effective enforcement of existing laws, are needed to ensure adequate protection of children and teens.</p><p>II. Changes since COPPA was adopted in 1998 require new legislation</p><p>In the more than 20 years since COPPA's passage, the development of new platforms, the rise of the internet of things, and the ubiquity of data collection have allowed digital risks to outpace the law. COPPA was intended to mitigate these privacy risks to children, but experience has shown that it is no longer provides sufficient protection. For this reason, we urge the FTC to support bi-partisan legislation such as S. 748, introduced by Senators Markey and Hawley.</p><p>A. Digital technologies have become a pervasive presence in the life of children and teens</p><p>In 1999, children ages 2-18 spent on average 5:29 minutes a day using media. Of this total, 2:46 hours were spent watching television, 21 minutes using the computer for fun, 20 minutes playing video games, and 8 minutes using the internet. n6 When COPPA was passed in 1998, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and other social networks did not exist. Nor did smart phone and mobile apps.</p><p>At that time, broadcast and cable television were the dominant means for advertisers to market to children and teens. But today, television is just one of many ways that advertisers can reach children. An entire industry has developed to track consumers (including children) across difference digital devices, to profile them based on their online activities and other data, and to target marketing messages to them on a one-to-one basis. New forms of advertising such as \"influencer\" videos, has proven very effective with children because children do not recognize them as ads. Advertisers use artificial intelligence and other sophisticated techniques for analyzing and acting upon data. Advertisers have very strong incentives to keep children and teen on screens - as it both allows them to deliver more advertising and to collect more data that it can use to target ads with greater precision.</p><p>Studies show that new technologies such as smart phones and tablets play a large role in the lives of children and teens. As of 2017, 98% of homes with children aged 8 and under had a smartphone or tablet, up from 53% in 2011. n7 On average, children 8 and under spent 2 hours and nineteen minutes on a screen, of which only 42% was watching television, while 35% was on mobile devices. n8</p><p>A 2015 study found that 53% of tweens (aged 8-12) had their own tablets and 67% of teens had their own smartphones. n9 On average, tweens spent almost 4 hours, 36 minutes on screen media and teens spent 6 hours, 40 minutes. n10 A Pew Survey of teens in 2018 found that 85% of teens reported using YouTube, 72% using Instagram, 69% using Snapchat, 51% using Facebook and 32% using Twitter. n11 In addition to being an essential part of children's and teen's social lives, students are often required to use digital technologies in school, for homework, and to participate in extracurricular activities. Technology is no longer an optional part of childhood or adolescence.</p><p>B. Teens as well as children need privacy protections</p><p>One reason that new legislation is needed is that COPPA applies only to children ages 13 and under. Consequently, once a child turns thirteen, she is treated the same as an adult in terms of data collection and use. US laws generally do not require that adults be given notice of privacy practices or choices about whether and how their data is collected and used.</p><p>We support legislation that would give privacy protections to people of all ages because that would represent an improvement over the status quo for teens and children (when they are using an online service that is not directed at children). But teens also need their own special protections. Teens are particularly at risk because their cognitive control systems necessary to regulate risky behavior are relatively immature. n12 As panelist Ariel Fox Johnson explained at the April 9 hearing, adolescents are more reward-sensitive than adults are, which means they're more likely to take short term risks online. n13 Not only do adolescents tend to take more risks, but they are more vulnerable to peer pressure. This means they are more likely to join (and less likely to leave) online communities where their friends are. n14</p><p>These development characteristics of teens means that they have more difficulty evaluating privacy risks than adults are and less likely to abandon technologies that violate their privacy because of network effects. The Pew Report found that few adolescents regularly deleted or restricted access to their posts due to concerns that they could negatively impact them in the future. n15 Research have shown that teens care about and make efforts to protect their privacy, but but they find it challenging to control how their information is distributed. n16</p><p>C. Affording parents notice and consent is no longer sufficient to protect children's privacy</p><p>COPPA properly recognizes that children are not capable of assessing privacy risks on their own. Children often do not understand the implications of the technology they use, and they are more vulnerable to manipulation than teens or adults. As Ariel Fox Johnson explained at the April 9 hearing, children don't understand the privacy implications of the technology they're using, and they're even less capable than adults are of correctly assessing the risks. n17</p><p>Studies back up this claim. A recent study found that children under age 11 \"could identify and articulate certain privacy risks well, such as information oversharing or revealing real identities online; however, they had less awareness with respect to other risks, such as online tracking or game promotions.\" n18 This study found that familiarity could give children a false sense of safety. n19 Another study found that children rarely understand the invasive potential of the interconnected toys. n20 When asked whether a smart toy could remember what the child told it, most children either didn't understand the toy was recording them, or thought that the toy would only record them when a parent was nearby. n21</p><p>Because children cannot protect their own privacy, COPPA places the responsibility on parents. COPPA is premised on the assumption that parents will be able to protect their children's privacy by reading privacy notices and deciding whether to give consent. COPPA requires direct notice to parents and post privacy policies contain the information needed for parents to make an informed decision. COPPA further requires verifiable parental consent before an operator may collect personal information from a child. It also gives parents the right to find out what information has been collected, to delete than information, and to prohibit further collection.</p><p>In the 1990s, when there were fewer child-directed websites and online services and no YouTube, no social networks such as Facebook and Instagram did, and no smart phones collecting geolocation and other information, it was reasonable to expect that parents could protect their children's privacy if they had adequate notice of an operator's. privacy practices and children's information could not be collected in the absence of verified parent consent. Notice and consent, however, are no longer sufficient today. The proliferation of networked technology has made that paradigm obsolete. There are too many privacy notices to read them all, and parents are ill-equipped to evaluate the information provided in privacy policies that they do read.</p><p>It is common knowledge that most people do not read privacy policies. A recent poll found that 56% of consumers usually or always click to accept a company's privacy policy without reading it, while only 13% say they never do so. n22 This is hardly surprising. People do not have time to read privacy policies. A well-known study published in 2008 estimated that it would take 76 work days for an internet user to read every privacy policy on every website they visited. The study further calculated the national opportunity cost of reading privacy policies at $781 billion, or greater than the GDP of Florida. n23 Given the increase in the number of websites and other online services (such as mobile apps) and the increasing amount of data collection by third parties, it would undoubtedly take much longer today. And as the New York Times recently opined, \"Why would anyone read the terms of service when they don't feel as though they have a choice in the first place? It's not as though a user can call up Mark Zuckerberg and negotiate his or her own privacy policy.\" n24</p><p>Privacy law scholars have documented many reasons why notice and consent is not effective at protecting consumer privacy. n25 For example, Alessandro Acquisti and Jens Grossklags have shown how hyperbolic discounting, i.e., the idea that people tend to opt for quick rewards in the short term over more protracted rewards in a longer timeframe, skews privacy decisionmaking. n26</p><p>Other research shows that many parents lack the understanding necessary to assess privacy risks. For example, a Pew Research Center survey found that 52% of internet users believe -- incorrectly -- that \"When a company posts a privacy policy, it ensures that the company keeps confidential all the information it collects on users.\" n27 Another survey found that while many parents use privacy settings on social media, \"privacy settings are not well understood by all users.\" As a result of this lack of understanding, many children under 13 \"have a lengthy \"digital profile\" based on their parents' social media use.\" n28 Another study showed it was possible to deduce the names, birthdates, addresses and faces of children from their parents' publicly-available Facebook profiles combined with the parents' voter registration information. n29</p><p>Privacy policies are often long. n30 And they can be difficult to understand. Research by Professor Turow at the Annenberg School of Communications suggests that \"ordinary users don't fully understand the scope of the data that is being collected on them -- or how small amounts of data can be used to create a much more detailed portrait when matched with information from third-party sites that collect and share various types of customer information with each other.\" n31 Turow explains that the \"general sense among marketers is that people understand that their data is being used, but we've found in our research that people don't truly understand how data mining works. They may realize that one or two pieces of their information are being given out; what they don't realize is that those one or two data points can be linked with other sources to uncover information they would have never given out in the first place.\" n32</p><p>Finally, COPPA requires that websites and online services directed to children, directed to a general audience, or that operate an ad network, plug-in or other third-party service used by child-directed sites, to have a children's privacy policy. n33 Moreover, privacy policies must contain certain information specified in Rule 312.4(d) such as a \"description of what information the operator collects from children, including whether the Web site or online service enables a child to make personal information publicly available; how the operator uses such information; and, the operator's disclosure practices for such information.\"</p><p>In our experience, privacy policies often do not contain all required information. For example, the privacy policy for Facebook's Messenger Kids states that Facebook may transfer information to third parties to \"support [its] business.\" That phrase might be interpreted to cover almost anything, including transfers to advertising networks, data brokers, and analytics firms, and Facebook lists only a few, non-exclusive examples of service providers that would support Facebook's business. This privacy policy also states that data may be disclosed \"to improve the services provided by the Facebook family of companies.\" While this sounds benign, most parents are unlikely to know that Facebook has acquired or merged with 66 different companies, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Masquerade (which sells face-tracking technologies), and Facebook does not name any of these companies. Facebook also fails to list all third party operators collecting or maintaining personal information from children as required by [Sec.]312.4(d)(1) and that that parents have the right to direct the operator to delete their child's personal information as required by [Sec.]312.10. n34 Similarly, we found that the we found the privacy policies for the Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition did not identify the actual types of personal information collected, and improperly disavowed any responsibility for third party collection of data through this service. n35 Insufficient notice preventing parents from making informed decisions about whether to grant consent.</p><p>D. Manipulative designs exacerbate the problems with inadequate notice</p><p>Many digital services employ what are known as \"dark patterns,\" or surreptitious design cues that prey on users' vulnerabilities to induce conduct that benefits the service, typically to the detriment of the user. n36 Such practices make it difficult for teens to protect their privacy and for adults to protect the privacy of children under age 13.</p><p>Some examples of dark patterns include default settings that require users to opt out of having their information shared, defaults that are difficult to change, ads disguised as organic content, and misleading, loaded descriptions of user choices. n37 A report by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office on \"age-appropriate design\" describes \"sticky\" features like \"reward loops, continuous scrolling, notifications and auto-play features, which encourage users to continue playing a game, watching video content or otherwise staying online.\" It found that these types of intentionally persuasive design techniques may be overly coercive for children. n38</p><p>Examples of manipulative design intended to coax more data, money, or time spent on kids' platforms abound. Our investigation of children's apps on the Google Play Store, as well as a study by researchers at the University of Michigan, n39 found that children's apps in the family section of the Google Play Store were filled with disruptive and manipulative advertising. For example, we saw ads disguised as game content so that children would mistakenly click on them. n40 We also found content that was highly manipulative, such as an app in which Strawberry Shortcake told the child that the puppy will be sad unless she makes an in-app purchase of a \"treat\" For it. n41 These games prey on children's vulnerabilities--difficulty closing ads, frustration with frequent interruption, a desire to please to wring data and revenue from them. And of course, the more time that a child or teen spends using these apps, the more information companies can collect and use to manipulate them.</p><p>We agree with Professor Ohm's comments at the April 9 hearing rejecting the concept that when strong privacy preferences contrast with non-privacy-protective behavior, the behavior \"reveals\" consumers' true preference. The inability of teens and parents to navigate a broken system doesn't indicate privacy apathy; it indicates that the system is broken. Or, as Professor 38 39 40 41 Ohm put it, \"it's crazy think that any of the preferences that we're measuring in any of these \"studies\" are revealed. They're manipulated, they're bought, they're controlled. We're talking about companies that have made their great wealth by being the greatest purveyors of information that the globe has ever seen. And so the fact that they can trick people to act against their preferences is not surprising.\" n42</p><p>E. Pervasive Tracking of Children and Teens is Harmful</p><p>The pervasive tracking the online behaviors of children and teens puts young people at significant risk of harm. Here are just a few examples;</p><p>* Data brokers have compiled lists of students based on criteria such as \"fourteen and fifteen year old girls for family planning services.\" n43</p><p>* Student data brokers have catalogued children on the basis of descriptors like \"affected by September 11th attacks,\" \"refugee/immigrant,\" \"down syndrome\" or \"clinically depressed.\" Some of these categories include children as young as two years old. n44</p><p>* Wearable devices, growth monitors, and fitness trackers collect extremely sensitive information about children, particularly their health data and location, which could be used to sort and filter students in unexpected and detrimentalways. n45</p><p>* Facebook has the ability to monitor posts and photos in real time to determine the emotional state of young people, for example, when they feel stressed, overwhelmed, or anxious, and to make this information available to advertisers. n46</p><p>As shown by the Georgetown Center on Privacy and Technology, opaque and unreliable automated decision-making can have a very real and dangerous impact on the lives and opportunities of children and teens, especially those from economically disadvantaged families. n47 We also agree with the Georgetown Center on Privacy and Technology that when it comes to teens, the FTC should recognize privacy violations themselves as harms. n48</p><p>We urge the FTC to support new legislation to extend appropriate privacy protection to teens. New legislation should also replace the unrealistic expectation that parents can safeguard their children's privacy by choosing whether or not to give consent after reading privacy policies, and instead, prohibit practices that are harmful and unfair to children.</p><p>III. Even without new legislation, the FTC can take steps to better protect children's privacy</p><p>Even in the absence of new legislation, however, the FTC can and should take actions to better protect children's privacy. Specifically, we urge that the FCC bring more COPPA enforcements action, ensure that companies comply with COPPA's notice requirements, and to make sure that COPPA safe harbors are in fact ensuring that their members comply with COPPA.</p><p>A. The FTC should enforce the existing COPPA Rules more effectively</p><p>The small number of enforcement actions brought by the FTC, as well as the generally low civil penalties imposed, have created a climate in which companies have little incentive to comply with COPPA. Given the large number of providers that have child-directed websites or online services, or have actual knowledge that children are using their services, the chance that the FTC will take an enforcement action against an particular company is miniscule. Second, even when the FTC has acted, it has often imposed civil penalties so low that companies may view them as simply the cost of doing business. Consequently, it is not surprising that many companies seem to be ignoring the COPPA requirements.</p><p>1. The FTC rarely brings enforcement actions under COPPA</p><p>Since COPPA took effect in 2000, the FTC has brought only 29 actions to enforce COPPA, or an average of 1.5 per year. n49 None of these cases were litigated. Instead, they were settled by entering into a consent decree prohibiting further COPPA violations. Consent decrees provide only limited relief, as they are binding only on the parties to the decree. Consent decrees also provide much less guidance for interpreting COPPA rules than litigated cases.</p><p>All but one consent decree have included civil penalties ranging from a low of $10,000 to a high of $5.7 million. The largest civil penalty was imposed earlier this year when the FTC settled with Musically. n50 But even the civil penalty assessed against Musical.ly's, is extremely small compared to the financial resources of its parent company Bytedance, which was recently valued at $75 billion. n51</p><p>The FTC has no formal process for members of the public to file complaints and to get relief. Nor does it make public when it undertakes an investigation or report on the outcome. The FTC has not acted - at least publicly - in response to any of the many COPPA complaints filed by CCD, CCFC, and IPR. It is particularly concerning that the FTC has not taken any enforcement action against Google for the ongoing COPPA violations on YouTube. As we documented in our April 2018 complaint, YouTube is the most popular online destination for children and is rife with content designed for young kids. The FTC's failure to act more than a year after the complaint was filed sends the message to website operators and app developers that they can evade COPPA's requirements if they pretend their service is not child-directed.</p><p>2. Many companies fail to comply with COPPA requirements</p><p>When the FTC is seen as ineffectual and unlikely to do anything, and companies are rewarded in the market for collecting and using large amounts of data, it is not surprising that COPPA violations are rampant. Many studies have found widespread noncompliance with COPPA. For example, a study conducted at Oxford University found that most apps on the US and UK Google Play Store contained a variety of tracking, but that child-directed apps contained the most third-party trackers of any category (tied with news). n52 Another study by computer scientists at UC Berkeley found that examined 5,855 of the most popular free children's apps in the Google Play store. It found that a majority were potentially in violation of COPPA, mainly due to their use of third-party SDKs. It noted that while many of these SDKs offer configuration options to respect COPPA by disabling tracking and behavioral advertising, the majority of apps either do not make use of these options or incorrectly propagate them across mediation SDKs. n53 It also found that 19% of children's apps collect identifiers or other personally identifiable information via SDKs whose terms of service outright prohibit their use in child-directed apps.</p><p>Other studies have found widespread security weaknesses in internet connected toys and gadgets used by children. For example, computer scientists at Princeton conducted case studies of three commercially available products targeted to children - a hydration tracker, a smart pet, and a fitness band. n54 They discovered several publicly undisclosed vulnerabilities such as a lack of data encryption, lack of authentication, sensitive user information in crash reports, and secret keys in source code. They concluded that the \"[l]ack of industry-standard security practices, especially encryption/authentication of communications with first-party cloud services, leaves personal data unprotected and constitutes violations of manufacturer privacy policies and federal COPPA regulation\" and that the \"use of common third-party analytics services across smart toys could allow cross-device tracking of child behavior.\" n55</p><p>These examples illustrate the need for the FTC to bring more COPPA enforcement actions. In so doing, it is particularly important that the FTC act quickly, so that developers will feel the need to pay attention to privacy rules, and security weaknesses will be minimized. Unfortunately, it took the FTC more than two years after reports came out that digital toy company Vtech experienced a massive breach of children's data before the FTC reached a settlement with Vtech. n56</p><p>B. The FCC should enforce COPPA's requirements regarding parental notice</p><p>Not only should the FTC bring more enforcement actions on a timely basis, but it should enforce all COPPA provisions. Our experience reviewing online services directed at children suggests that the FTC has been exceptionally lax in enforcing COPPA's requirement that parental notice \"must be clearly and understandably written, complete, and must contain no unrelated, confusing, or contradictory material regarding adequate notice.\" n57</p><p>Even though, as discussed above, parental notice and choice is no longer a realistic way to protect children's privacy, there is still tremendous value in the FTC enforcing the COPPA notice requirements. A well-written privacy policy remains the best way to determine what data is collected, how it is used, and whether it is shared with third parties. Even if privacy policies are not very helpful to parents to make informed decisions on an individual basis, they provide valuable information for regulators, researchers, and advocates.</p><p>We have reviewed numerous privacy policies and found that many do not comply with the notice requirements set out in Rule 312.4. See supra at 13-14. Often, they fail to list exactly what kind of information is collected or how it is used. Similarly, privacy policies are often confusing, contradictory or simply unclear. Furthermore, even though the FTC's guidance that the COPPA rule is \"not just for kids' sites,\" n58 many websites and online services aimed at general audience that include children, such as YouTube, do not have even have a children's privacy policy.</p><p>While the COPPA rule explicitly requires companies to provide the name, address, phone number, and email address of any third party collecting information about child users, companies frequently fail to do so. For example, Amazon's children's privacy policy does not list the third parties that collect or receive children's personal information and improperly tells parents that it has no responsibility for third party collection. n59 Thus, the FTC should strictly enforce COPPA's notice requirements.</p><p>C. The FTC should hold COPPA safe harbors accountable for enforcing COPPA</p><p>The FTC should also do more to ensure that COPPA safe harbors are functioning effectively. COPPA allows entities subject to COPPA to satisfy the law by following a set of self-regulatory guidelines issued by an approved COPPA Safe Harbor. n60 COPPA Safe Harbors must apply to the FTC for approval. The FTC rules require that a safe harbor provide at least as much protection as the FTC's COPPA rules. The FTC has stated that the purpose of the safe harbor program is to encourage industry members and other groups to develop their own COPPA oversight programs, thereby promoting efficiency and flexibility in complying with COPPA's substantive provisions.306 COPPA's safe harbor provision also was intended to reward operators' good faith efforts to comply with COPPA. The Rule therefore provides that operators fully complying with an approved safe harbor program will be ''deemed to be in compliance'' with the Rule for purposes of enforcement. In lieu of formal enforcement actions, such operators instead are subject first to the safe harbor program's own review and disciplinary procedures. n61</p><p>The Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) filed the first application for approval of a safe harbor program in April 2000, the same month that the COPPA rules took effect. CARU subsequently revised the guidelines to respond to public comments, and the FTC approved the application in January 2001. Also in 2001, the FCC approved two more COPPA safe harbors-- Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) and TRUSTe. It has since approved four more -- Privacy Vaults Online, Inc. (PRIVO), Aristotle International, Inc., iKeepSafe, and kidSAFE. Two of the seven safe harbors - CARU and ESRB - are operated by industry-supported non-profit organizations, while the others are for-profit entities.</p><p>When the FTC launched its review of the COPPA Rule in 2010, CDD, CCFC, and other organizations represented by IPR, asked the FTC to take action to assure the effectiveness of the safe harbor program.</p><p>First, [the FTC] should determine what proportion of child-directed websites and online service operators participate in a safe harbor program. Second, it should assess the effectiveness of the safe harbor programs by requiring annual reports about their enforcement efforts. Third, to ensure that the safe harbor programs are keeping up to date on new threats to children's privacy, it should require them to apply for recertification every five years. n62</p><p>While the FTC did not adopt all of these proposals, it did take steps to strengthen the COPPA Safe Harbor program. n63 Specifically, it \"mandate[d] that (at a minimum) safe harbor programs conduct annual, comprehensive reviews of each of their members' information practices.\" n64 It also required applicants\" to explain in detail their business model and their technological capabilities and mechanisms for initial and continuing assessment of subject operators' fitness for membership in the safe harbor program.\" Finally, it required approved safe harbors to submit an annual report to the FTC containing an aggregated summary of the result of its independent assessments. n65</p><p>1. The FTC should make public all information in the safe harbor annual reports</p><p>CDD and CCFC expected the FTC to make these annual reports available for public comment, just as it does for the applications. n66 But it did not, and so CDD and IPR filed FOIA requests for both the 2014 and 2015 annual reports. Eventually, the FTC released the reports, but virtually all information that could permit an analysis of their effectiveness was redacted. n67</p><p>A more recent review conducted by the Technologist in Commissioner Chopra's office, found that many safe harbor programs \"received very few, often zero, complaints.\" It also found that few safe harbor programs disciplined or suspended operators for noncompliance. n68 These findings are very troubling. Thus, it is important that the FTC make the full reports available to the public so that there can be a rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of the safe harbor program.</p><p>2. The small number of complaints does not mean that safe harbor members are complying with COPPA</p><p>It would be incorrect to infer from the small number of complaints that the COPPA safe harbors are working well. That might be a plausible claim only if parents recognized the privacy seals, correctly understood their meaning, knew that they had a right to file a complaint, and had an incentive to file a complaint. Yet, these conditions do not exist.</p><p>FCC rules require that the COPPA safe harbors review their members' privacy practices at least annually. If the members are found in in compliance, they may display a seal signifying that they comply with COPPA. The seal is intended to assist parents in deciding whether to allow their child to use a particular website or online service.</p><p>Since most COPPA safe harbors refuse to publicly disclose their members, parents have no easy way of finding websites and online services that participate in a safe harbor; they only find out that a website or on-line service is part of a safe harbor program if they see the seal or they read the privacy policy. Oftentimes, seals are not easy to find.</p><p>Even if parents see a seal, they are likely to be confused about what it means. Not only are there seven different seal programs, but several have multiple types of seals, as shown below.</p><p>Parents are unlikely to understand, for example, that of the three nearly identical kidSafe seals, only the one that includes \"kidsSafe COPPA certificate\" have been reviewed for COPPA compliance.</p><p>Even if parents recognize a COPPA safe harbor seal, they may not realize its significance. Safe harbor seals may mislead parents into a false sense of security. Parents may see an official-looking seal and assume that it means that the website or online service will protect their child's privacy. But in fact, it only means that the website or online service complies with the safe harbor guidelines. It does not mean, as some might believe, that no personal information is collected. Nor does it relieve parents from the burden of reading and trying to understand privacy policies.</p><p>Finally, even if a parent understands what COPPA requires and determines that a website or online service displaying a seal is not in compliance, it is unclear what incentives busy parents would have to file a complaint with the safe harbor. The costs of filing such a complaint would surely outweigh any benefit. At best, the member might be required to change its practices, but the parent filing the complaint would not be able to obtain any monetary or other relief.</p><p>3. COPPA Safe harbors lack the incentive to rigorously enforce their guidelines</p><p>Companies that comply with an FTC-approve safe harbor program are exempt from agency COPPA enforcement. While as discussed above, the FTC rarely enforces COPPA, when it does, it can result in substantial civil penalties, such as those assessed against Musical.ly. In these circumstances, as Commissioner Chopra has observed, it is \"hard for anyone to bite the hand that feeds them. Whenever regulated entities pay fees and shop for a regulator, are there the right incentives for the regulators to be tough? Or might the incentives lead to competition on who can be the most lax and forgiving?\" n69</p><p>Commissioner Chopra cites as an example the for-profit company TRUSTe, which failed to carry out the required annual recertifications of its members. n70 But this problem is not limited to for-profit safe harbors. Non-profit CARU receives its funding from the advertising industry, while the ESRB receives funding from the video game industry. It is in the interests of both industry groups that the guidelines should not be rigorously enforced, and they would be unlikely to continue these programs if it hurt their members' bottom line. Moreover, the nonprofit safe harbors see themselves a competing with the for-profit companies. At an event last fall, the head of CARU's safe harbor program stated that CARU no longer publishes a list of its members because when they did, other safe harbor programs \"poached them.\" n71 While such competition may lower the costs for safe harbor members, this \"race to the bottom\" is harmful to consumers.</p><p>To ensure that COPPA safe harbors protect children's privacy rather than protect their members from FTC enforcement, the FTC needs to make its oversight process more transparent. The FTC should require the safe harbors, as organizations delegated to perform a government regulatory function, to make their annual reports public. If safe harbors are not willing to make public information necessary for to assess their performance, or otherwise perform their responsibilities, the FTC should decertify them.</p><p>IV. Conclusion</p><p>Because notice and consent no longer provide an effective means to protect the privacy of children, the FTC should call for new legislation that prohibits practices that may be harmful to children, rather than requiring parents to read and try to understand the impact of multiple privacy policies. Legislation should also include developmentally-appropriate protections for teens, because COPPA only covers children under age 13. Until such legislation is passed, however, the FTC can and should do more to better protect children's privacy. Specifically, we urge the FTC to undertake more enforcement actions, to enforce COPPA's notice requirements, and to fix problems with the COPPA safe harbor program.</p><p>n1 Daisuke Wakabayashi, YouTube Bans Comments on Videos of Young Children in Bid to Block Predators, NY Times, (Feb. 28, 2019), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/technology/youtube-pedophile-comments.html?module=inline\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/technology/youtube-pedophile-comments.html?module=inline</url>.</p><p>n2 Georgetown law student Tracey Klees assisted in the preparation of these comments.</p><p>n3 FTC Staff Sets Forth Principles For Online Information Collection From Children, July 16, 1997, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1997/07/ftc-staff-sets-forth-principles-online-information-collection\">https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1997/07/ftc-staff-sets-forth-principles-online-information-collection</url>.</p><p>n4 Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, Statement of Basis and Purpose, 78 Fed.

He also co-founded Firefox, and built it into one of the world's most popular browsers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brave is headquartered in San Francisco and we have staff in 17 states. The number of people using our browser grew 600 percent last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what I am about to say might surprise you. We view the GDPR as a great leveller. It can establish the conditions to allow young, innovative companies like ours to flourish. n1</p><p>Today, big tech companies create cascading monopolies by leveraging users' data from one line of business to dominate other lines of business too. n2 This hurts nascent competitors, stifles innovation and reduces consumer choice. n3</p><p>However, two elements in the GDPR can fix this - if they are enforced. First, Article 5(1)(b), is the \"purpose limitation\" principle, n4 which ring fences personal data held by companies so they can't use it outside of consumer expectations. They need a legal basis for each data processing purpose. n5</p><p>Second, Article 7 (3) requires that an opt-in must be as easy to undo as it was to give in the first place, and that people can do so without detriment. Once this is enforced, consent messages n6 will become far less annoying in Europe - because if a company insists on harassing you to opt in, and you finally click OK, it will be required to keep reminding you that you can opt back out again. n7</p><p>These two GDPR tools, the \"purpose limitation principle\", plus the ease of withdrawal of consent, enable freedom. Freedom for the market of users to softly \"break up\" - and \"un-break up\" - big tech companies by deciding what personal data can be used for.</p><p>Senators, the GDPR is risk based. That means Big Tech that creates big risks get big scrutiny and potentially big penalties. Regulators are only starting to enforce the GDPR and it will take years to have full effect. But already, things are looking bleak for our colleagues at Google and Facebook.</p><p>Their year-over-year growth declined steadily in Europe since the GDPR n8 - despite a buoyant advertising market. They face multiple investigations and it is very likely that they will be forced to change how they do business. (Google's consent has already been ruled invalid. n9) And things are even bleaker for other tracking companies, that don't have a search business to fall back on, as Google does.</p><p>Whereas -- we hear anecdotally that publishers are doing better than before! Lax privacy law hasn't helped publishers.</p><p>Let me tell you what happens almost every single time you visit a website: data about you is broadcast to tens or hundreds of companies, which lets advertisers compete for the opportunity to show you an ad. n10 Advertising is necessary, and this sounds OK.</p><p>But wait until you hear what information about you is in that big broadcast: it can include your - inferred - sexual orientation, political views, whether you are Christian, Jewish, or Muslim, etc., whether you have AIDS, erectile disfunction, or bi-polar disorder. n11 It includes what you are reading, watching, and listening to. n12 It includes your location, sometimes right up to your exact GPS coordinates. n13 And it includes unique ID codes that are as specific to you as is your social security number, so that all of this data can be tied to you over time. n14 This allows companies you have never heard of to maintain intimate profiles on you, and on everyone you have ever known. n15</p><p>This is not necessary for smart advertising. The latest research shows that this profiling nets publishers only zero point zero zero zero zero eight of a dollar extra per ad. n16 That's only an extra 4% revenue!</p><p>Whereas \"contextual\" ads, which don't broadcast your intimate details, would save publishers 55 to 70 percent in \"adtech tax\", n17 and avoid having their audiences bought cheaper elsewhere. Advertisers would also recover billions per year from \"ad bot fraud\" - though few realize this. n18 Privacy law will help the digital advertising ecosystem.</p><p>Let me conclude by urging you to enact strong privacy rules so that a healthy marketplace can develop. Give consumers freedom to choose the companies and services they want to reward.</p><p>The GDPR is based largely on American principles. We urge you to bring them home.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>n1 See Brave to National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Docket No. 180821780- 8780-01 (Privacy RFC), 5 November 2018 (URL: <url normalizedValue=\"https://brave.com/ntia-federal-privacy-law/);\">https://brave.com/ntia-federal-privacy-law/);</url> see also Brave to Federal Trade Commission, Docket FTC-2018-0100, 7 January 2019 (URL:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://brave.com/brave-ftc-jan-2019/);\">https://brave.com/brave-ftc-jan-2019/);</url> and Brendan Eich to Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 1 October 2018 (URL:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://brave.com/us-gdpr-senate/\">https://brave.com/us-gdpr-senate/</url>).</p><p>n2 The cross-use of data between different lines of business is analogous to the tying of two products. Indeed, tying and cross-use of data can occur at the same time, as Google Chrome's latest \"auto sign in to everything\" controversy illustrates.</p><p>n3 Competition authorities in other jurisdictions have addressed this matter. As early as 2010, France's Autorite de la concurrence highlighted the topic (in Opinion 10-A-13 on the cross-usage of customer databases). In 2015, Belgium's regulator fined the Belgian National Lottery for reusing personal information acquired through its monopoly for a different, and incompatible, line of business.</p><p>n4 As with many of the principles of the GDPR, this is based on the FIPPs of the 1974 US Privacy Act.</p><p>n5 Consider for example the act of posting a photo on the Facebook Newsfeed for the first time. The distinct processing purposes involved might be something like the following list. The person posting the photo is only interested only the first four or five of these purposes. If purpose limitation is enforced, Facebook will be very vulnerable: - To display your posts on your Newsfeed. - To display posts on tagged friends' Newsfeeds. - To display friends posts that tag you on your Newsfeed. - To identify untagged people in your posts. - To record your reaction to posts to refine future content for you, which may include ethnicity, politics, sexuality, etc..., to make our Newsfeed more relevant to you. - To record your reaction to posts to refine future content for you, which may include ethnicity, politics, sexuality, etc..., to make ads relevant to you. - To record your reaction to posts to refine future content for you, which may include ethnicity, politics, sexuality, etc..., for advertising fraud prevention.</p><p>n6 It does not necessarily matter what a person clicks on when shown one of the industry's \"consent notices\", because there is no technical security measure to prevent these companies from sharing the data with their business partners under the table. For this - and other reasons - the consent system that the industry came up with is itself under investigation for infringing the GDPR.

To gather evidence, The Guardian masqueraded as an advertiser and bought ads on its own website. For every dollar that The Guardian spent as an advertiser, it received only 30c as a publisher. The publisher got 30%, adtech took 70%. This is known as the ad tech tax.

But I want to complement Senator Lee for bringing this idea up to me. I think we're going to learn a lot today about perils of the social media sites and the internet in general for minor children and what can we do to help them better inform parents. </p><p>So-- well, he's on his way, and I'll give an opening statement, and he'll be here in a second, I hope. We're going to the border Friday. Everybody is welcome. We're going to meet the vice president. There's no intrigue about what we're trying to do. I haven't been and I while, and I'd like to go listen and learn. </p><p>And hopefully after our visit to the border, it will give us a better idea of what we can do legislatively to provide relief to those on the front lines of this chaotic situation at our southern border. And I'm hoping that we have a bipartisan group. And we're not going there to blame anybody, at least, I'm not. </p><p>I'm trying to find a solution. And I look forward to the trip. And Senator Cornyn and I know the folks in Texas are struggling mightily with this problem and look forward to learning from our friends in Texas about what we can do. Thank you very much. </p><p>I'll tell you what, we'll just--we'll just go ahead and get started. Could you please raise your right hand, rise please, raise your right hand? Do you solemnly swear the testimony your about to give this committee is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? </p><p>Okay, welcome Mr. Stone, Bluffton area, 14th judicial circuit solicitor in South Carolina, proud of your work, I welcome to Washington. </p><p>STONE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for having me. Mr. Chairman, thank you and I understand that Ranking Member Feinstein will not be able to be here, but I want to thank her as well and thank the members of this committee for the invitation to speak to you today. </p><p>I am the solicitor for the 14th circuit. That is a--that is a circuit made up of five counties in the low country of South Carolina. Senator Graham knows. I am also the incoming president of the National District Attorneys Association. </p><p>For the purpose of this hearing, though, I also carry the title of parent. And I think that's particularly relevant because I think in this particular issue, in this particular concept, I think we need to understand the world now that we are living in, which is substantially different than it used to be. </p><p>If you think about it, parents teach their children every day to not talk to strangers, to not open the locked door for people they don't know, certainly not to get into a car or a van with somebody they don't know, and yet, every day--and we take precautions about this. </p><p>We put out locked doors--we have our doors locked, our windows locked, we have security systems. Despite all of that, strangers are talking to our children every day, and they are doing it through the internet, they're doing it by use of the children's cell phones, often, unknowingly, but by invitation from our own children. </p><p>The Pew Foundation did a study recently, and I think this was a 2018 study, then stated that 95 percent of the teens today have access to the internet through their cell phones, 45 percent of which are doing it almost constantly. </p><p>And I don't think any of us that either have teenagers or know teenagers would doubt those statistics. If you look at it from that perspective, the question then is, what is the risk? What is the risk of these children having this type of access and people having access to our children behind locked doors? </p><p>And I think our friends from the Center of Missing and Exploited Children would tell you that 18.4--18.4 million cyber tips that they received in 2018 indicate the risk to our children, and of those 18.4, after the studies were conducted, the offenders themselves, 98 percent of those were strangers. </p><p>So, strangers are talking to our children. If you look at state department statistics, those state department statistics will also tell you that tens of thousands of children are being exploited online. If you look at further state department statistics concerning the role of human trafficking, you'll learn that half of those our children. </p><p>And what these human traffickers are doing when it comes to either labor or sex trafficking, they are using the internet to entice, coerce, and in many ways, even arrange the buying and selling of our children. </p><p>The internet and the cyber world that we live in, it is no longer a bricks and mortar world. It's a situation that we have to take into consideration. I am the Solicitor for a five county circuit in South Carolina. </p><p>I have, of those five counties, one of my counties is Beaufort County, which is the home of Hilton Head, the Heritage Golf Tournament, and what it seems like, at least, this time of the year in list tourism. It is a wealthy county, probably the second wealthiest county in the state of South Carolina. </p><p>But I have--the average poverty in South Carolina is 16.6 percent. I have three counties that are below that percentage. In fact, one of my counties is Allendale County. And unless your Senator Graham, you may never have heard of Allendale County. The Allendale County suffers at over 30 percent poverty. </p><p>The demographics of my circuit, basically, over a 3,700 square mile period, it is a microcosm of South Carolina in many ways of this country. What I see in the poor, as well as, the wealthy areas in my--in my circuit are the same issues when it comes to cybercrime. </p><p>And briefly, I'd like to tell you what I see. I spend about 14 percent--my office is probably a medium size prosecution office when it comes to national standards. I spend about 14 percent of my overall personnel budget on intelligence. </p><p>And part of that intelligence are computer and cell phone experts who not only download from these computers and cell phones, but also, study and try to help us uncover these crimes and help law enforcement throughout our circuit make these type of cases. </p><p>What I have seen, I have seen professionally made music videos that are being used, produced by and for gang members to basically recruit our children. I have seen prisoners who operate prostitution rings outside of the prison, or, having already been convicted. </p><p>I see, not only drug dealers, gang members, but other criminals with all of the information that they have inside their cell phones, which is, in the past, it would be a notebook, today it's their cell phone. </p><p>These events that we see, we need your help in many ways because law enforcement and the solicitors and the district attorneys around this country, they need--they face a little bit of a challenge. When it comes to these notebooks, the cell phones, the information that we have in there, we need help with the encryption issue. </p><p>When it comes to prisons, in particular, I'd like to thank Mr. Chairman Graham, as well as, Senator Kennedy, who is also on this committee, for sponsoring a bill that would allow our prisons to block that sells service. </p><p>We think of a purpose behind a prison and isolating those people inside of it. If they have access to a cell tower and a cell phone inside their prison, we are not keeping our citizens, our community or our children safe from them. </p><p>Let me also say, and I think we have to look at it from the perspective of, what type of war we are dealing with today as opposed to what we did when I first became a prosecutor in 1989. I think the biggest change that we have seen over the past 10 years is the use of technology by criminals. </p><p>We see that in every aspect of every case that we have. We have--if we go back and we talk first about the encryption issue, which I think is particularly relevant, I started my career as a narcotics prosecutor. </p><p>If a police officer executing a lawful search warrant went into someone's house and found drugs, that would help them with that case. If they found guns to protect their product, that would also help, scales that type of thing. </p><p>But in order to destroy the enterprise, if they could find the notebook, that piece of--those collections of documents that told them who the major buyers were, who the sellers were, that type of thing, that's how you could actually destroy that network. </p><p>Today, that's not on a notebook or a notepad like this. It's on their cell phone. We have experts that download those cell phones for law enforcement, and they do it with a court order based by--based on probable cause, and yet, there are some cell companies that refuse to assess law enforcement in enforcing those--those court orders. </p><p>If we are going to do those investigations, and if we are going to destroy these human trafficking enterprises, the gangs, we're going to need help with that particular aspect of it. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Ms. Campbell. </p><p>STONE: Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Ms. Campbell. </p><p>CAMPBELL: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for inviting me. For over 30 years, I've been a professor at Georgetown Law, where as a director of a clinic, I've represented nonprofit organizations such as the Campaign for Commercial Free Childhood and Center for Digital Democracy in matters--in efforts to try to improve the media environment for our children. </p><p>And I have also written a number of law review articles about that subject. So, many of the problems that families are struggling with today, such as how to protect their children's privacy, how to prevent exposure to inappropriate content and to limit the amount of time that children are spending online on digital devices are the direct result of two things. </p><p>First, is the business models of the dominant tech companies. They are--they have designed their systems, not to protect children or nurture children, but to attract a large number of users, including children, and to keep them on line as possible--as long as possible so they can maximize revenue by collecting valuable data about those users and delivering targeted marketing to them. </p><p>Second, as I explained in my written testimony, the government has failed to adopt sufficient safeguards for children, and has not effectively enforced the safeguards that do exist, in particular, the Federal Trade Commission has failed to vigorously enforce the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and as a result, the big tech companies, including Google, YouTube, Facebook and Amazon have felt empowered to ignore the existing safeguards. </p><p>When COPPA was adopted in 1998, there was no YouTube, no social media, no smart phones, no smart speakers in children's bedrooms and no toys connected to the internet. COPPA has not kept up with these new developments. </p><p>The underline premise of the law is that parents can protect their children if they are given adequate notice and if they have to give verifiable consent before data can be collected from their children. The practice has proven that this is no longer tenable. </p><p>Another problem with COPPA is that the safeguards only come into play in certain situations, either where a website or online service is directed at children or where the operator has actual knowledge of children using a specific service. </p><p>As a result, many times when children are online, they're not getting any of the COPPA protections. Another limitation with COPPA is that it doesn't provide safeguards once a child turns 13, and teens, because of their stage of development, are less able to evaluate risk and are very susceptible to peer pressure, so they take a lot of risks. </p><p>Passing the Do Not Track Kids Act of 2019, which was introduced by Senators Markey and Hawley, would be a good first step to update COPPA. But, even in the absence of new legislation, the FTC can and should act to better protect children's privacy. </p><p>Since 2000, when the law took effect, the FTC has only brought 29 actions to enforce COPPA. And since 2012, I personally have been involved in filing 14 requests, asking the FTC to investigate COPPA violations, yet, the COPPA--the FTC has not acted, at least publicly, in response to any of them. </p><p>In addition to bringing more enforcement actions, the FTC should ensure that the--that the self-regulatory COPPA safe harbor programs that Congress intended to help augment FTC enforcement are actually doing their job. </p><p>And given the large number of websites and online services used by children, of course, it's not easy for the FTC to pursue all violations. For this reason, I urge that the FTC should use its authority under section 5 to hold platforms responsible when they characterize apps or other content as appropriate for children, when they are not, and conversely when they say their services are not appropriate for children, and yet, they know there are a lot of children using them anyhow. </p><p>So, for example, just give you one example of recent complaint we filed in December 2018 on behalf of those organizations, I mentioned, we asked the FTC to investigate whether the Google play store was engaging in unfair and deceptive practices and labeling apps in the family section of the play store as family-friendly, when, in fact, the apps did not meet Google's own criteria. </p><p>Google's criteria was good, and included complying with the privacy laws, prohibited deceptive or unfair add practices, prohibited inappropriate content. But what we found through our investigation, was that Google was not enforcing them. </p><p>Another complaint that I'll briefly mention involves YouTube, and the fact that YouTube clearly knows that there are lots of children--it's the most popular destination for children online, and yet, they pretend there are no children, and so they don't apply--they don't give notice to parents, they don't comply with any of the COPPA requirements. </p><p>I urge the members to put pressure the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the laws that are on the books, and also on the companies to act more responsibly. I know a number of members have actually written letters to both the FTC and the companies. </p><p>And I also urge Congress to look up what kind of legislation might be helpful in addressing some of these, not only shortfalls, but some of the new issues that are coming up that are with facial recognition, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and other new technologies. Thank you and I welcome any questions. </p><p>MCKENNA: Good morning, Chairman Graham, Senator Blumenthal and members of the Committee, thank you so much for allowing all of us this opportunity to speak today. I cannot think of a more noble cause for all of us to be spending our time on than the safety and protection of our children. </p><p>I began Protect Young Eyes five years ago because the internet is complex. And even diligent parents are overwhelmed by the digital choices their children are facing. Through thousands of hours of research, hundreds of presentations at schools around the country and dozens of articles examining digital trends, we have witnessed, both, the wonderful potential and the troubling and pervasive darkness that exist in the pockets of millions of young people today. </p><p>I'm certain that in the course of today's discussion, we will hear difficult stories. I wish they were uncommon. In March 2019, CNN reported that Instagram was the leading social media platform for child grooming by sexual predators. </p><p>Our own test accounts quickly discovered that young people, particularly, young girls, can be hunted like prey. We started an Instagram account with two photos and tried to mimic the behavior of an average teen girl. </p><p>We posted to self these with three hashtags each, searched a few hashtags and liked a few photos. Within a week, we had dozens of men sending us images of their genitals, telling us they were horny and sending us hard-core pornography through direct messages, even after we told all of them that we were only 12. They were relentless. </p><p>A recent poll of 2000 teens found that nearly 75 percent of them had received pornographic direct messages from strangers on Instagram, even if they had a private account. But you won't find any warnings in the app store descriptions for Instagram that mention anything about sexual predators, direct message risks, sex trafficking or hard-core pornography. </p><p>Instagram's defaults are not set for child safety or data privacy, even though Instagram is rated 12 plus by Apple and 13 plus by Google. At Protect Young Eyes, we've also seen firsthand the predatory symbiotic relationship that exists between Instagram and Snapchat, both used by 75 percent of teens today. </p><p>Many Instagram predators quickly shuttle kids over to Snapchat where evidence disappears. For example, one relentless pedophile on Instagram who calls himself, daddy, invites young girls to join him in Snapchat with Instagram post like 12 plus year-old slave girls, obedient whores only or hit me up on snap to be daddy's naughty girl. </p><p>Snapchat is where explicit content on porn hub lives just seconds away from every user through backdoors within the app. The app knowingly allows a well-documented list of porn performers to make thousands of dollars daily through their premium snap accounts. </p><p>Snapchat is where harmless -looking face filters can encourage kids to share their location on snap map. It's the app that gave a Coors beer add to 13-year-olds, even though they tout age gating. </p><p>It's the app where every kid, regardless of age, has access to the discover news section, where they are taught how to engage in risky sexual behaviors such as hookup group, angle or torture sex, how to sell drugs and how to hide internet activity from parents using incognito mode. </p><p>But again, you won't find anything in Snapchat's app store descriptions that warn parents about premium Snapchat accounts, predator risks of using snap maps or the hyper-sexualized content and discover news. Snapchat is rated 12 plus by Apple and 13 plus by Google. </p><p>Tech companies will tell us that ratings are already in place. However, ratings are not uniform, lack transparency and there's little accountability for inaccurate rate. For example, Twitter was rated four plus for a decade, even though hard-core porn and prostitution was everywhere. </p><p>It is still breaking Apple and Google's no porn policy, but only claims infrequent or mild sexual content in the app description. Netflix is rated four plus in Apple's app store, but teen in Google play. VPNs, which allow teens to circumvent parental controls, are rated four plus. </p><p>Most social media platforms are rated 12 plus by Apple, even though COPPA restricts use by children until age 13. Obviously, the current app ratings process is broken. Tech companies will tell us that protecting kids is the parent's responsibility, however, this position ignores the ubiquitous nature of the internet. </p><p>Even if I do everything right to protect my own 14-year-old daughter, with almost 90 percent of teens owning a smart device, a simple ride on the bus or a visit to a friend's house can expose her to life altering content. Never before in human history have young people had the ability to so erratically change the trajectory of each other's lives so quickly. </p><p>Tech companies will tell us that safeguards are already in place, but it currently takes over 30 steps to properly set up parental controls on an iPhone. We need to simplify this process to help more parents protect their children. For example, better age-based defaults would instantly and easily protect millions of kids. </p><p>The addition of easy controls over school and bedtime could shut off distracting apps during these very critical times. Tech companies will tell us that regulating apps is too big of a job. It can't be done. However, video games are already successfully doing it, and the ESRB shows us a path that could be applied by reasonable individuals to apps. </p><p>In fact, it was Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook who recently said, I believe we need more affective role for governments and regulators. And we agree. Our hope is to create safer digital places for young people. </p><p>Two simple solutions could change everything. First, create a uniform independent and accountable rating system for apps, and second, enact better defaults based on the age provided during device and app set up. Let's fix this for the kids. Thank you and I look forward to answering your questions. </p><p>GRAHAM: Mr. Clark. </p><p>CLARK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, and members of the committee, it's an honor and privilege to be here. I also have the honor and privilege as serving as a president and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children or, NCMEC, as we refer to it often. </p><p>I'm pleased to be here today to provide NCMEC's perspective on the growing problem of child sexual exploitation online and a role in combating the dangers children are facing on the internet. </p><p>NCMEC was created in 1984 by child advocates as a private, nonprofit organization to help find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation and prevent child victimization. NCMEC's core program to combat online child sexual exploitation is the cyber tip line, a tool for the public and electronic service providers to report abusive images to NCMEC. </p><p>Technically, this content is legally defined as child pornography, but NCMEC chooses to use the term child sexual abuse imagery, to make clear what this content truly is, not pornography, but the rape and sexual assault of children captured on images and in video. </p><p>Since we began cyber tip line over 21 years ago, report numbers have exploded. Last year alone, we received over 18 million reports of international and domestic online child sexual abuse. The number of reports is daunting and so are many new trends, including the following, between 2017 and 2018, video files reported to NCMEC increased 541 percent. </p><p>A broader range of online platforms is being used to store and trade child sexual abuse images, including chat, video and messaging apps, photo sharing platforms, social media and dating sites, gaming platforms and email systems. </p><p>If someone can share content online, NCMEC knows that platform can be used to sexually exploit a child. Reports relating to enticement and sextortion are increasing. This devastating abuse uses nonphysical coercion to manipulate a child into sexual activity. </p><p>We're seeing reports with graphic and violent sexual images of young children, including infants, and reports of on demand sexual abuse known as live streaming. Virtually all reports at NCMEC come from the open web, not the dark web. </p><p>But NCMEC knows that the dark web, such as TOR, are havens for new and increasingly explicit child sexual abuse imagery. In light of these troubling trends, unique initiatives are needed. Law enforcement can't arrest their way out of this. </p><p>There must always be rapidly -- there must be a way to rapidly detect, report and remove such images. And this can't be done in a vacuum. Multiple layered partnerships are essential to protect children online. </p><p>NCMEC has been strong--built strong voluntary partnerships with technology companies in support of our mission. These initiatives are crucial because while there is no legal requirement for technology companies to proactively screen for child sexual abuse, many companies have business reasons to do so. </p><p>In support of this, NCMEC offers voluntary initiatives to proactively use hashing, including photo DNA, a hash is a digital fingerprint of an image that can scan for identical or similar images. </p><p>Many online companies use hashes of known sexual abuse images to screen and remove these images from their services. NCMEC facilitates voluntary hash sharing by hosting platforms for technology companies to share over 1.2 million hashes of abusive images, among themselves, and hosting a second platform for nonprofits including NCMEC to share over 1.7 million hashes with those companies. </p><p>NCMEC also is devoted to critical resources to modernizing the cyber tip line. We need to ensure that as a more complex technology is used to exploit children, we are using the most advanced technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning to protect children from abuse online. </p><p>As detailed in my written testimony, NCMEC also provides a broad range of additional programs to support children who have been victims of online sexual abuse and to provide data-driven prevention and education programs relating to such abuse. </p><p>So, to conclude, the problems of child sexual exploitation are becoming more complex, more challenging. We are fortunate to be joined in our mission by this committee, our nonprofit partners and the U.S. technology companies. It's essential for us to continue to form broader partnerships to support our work. </p><p>Also, as the society reflects on the continuing role of the Internet in our daily lives, we must make sure that technology tools, such as hashing, remain viable and effective to combat the spread of online child sexual exploitation. </p><p>So, thank you again for this opportunity to appear before you. And I look forward to the continuing work with this Committee and to answer any questions you have. Thank you very much. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Mr. Balkam. </p><p>BALKAM: Good morning, Chairman Graham, Senator Blumenthal, and distinguished members of the committee. My name is Stephen Balkam, and I'm the founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute or FOSI, as we call it. </p><p>My message for the committee is that we, one, need to create a culture of responsibility online. Two, we need to develop resiliency in our children, and three, we must move from protection to empowerment, from blocking to monitoring and from restrictions to responsibility. </p><p>FOSI is an international nonprofit organization working to make the online world safer for kids and their families. We achieve this by identifying and promoting the best practices, tools and methods in the field of online safety that also respect free speech. </p><p>I first testified before this committee 24 years ago as part of a hearing on cyber porn and children. The technology has changed immensely over the past two decades, but the challenges remain. </p><p>We must keep children safe on the internet, while ensuring that they are able to access the amazing opportunities for learning, creativity and fun that are available to them. Our experience has shown that by engaging all parts of the technology ecosystem, including government, industry, law enforcement, parents and teachers, we are able to empower and instill a sense of resilience in our children, and in this way, and sure their online experiences remain safe and productive. </p><p>The internet enhances the educational and social lives of children. Their use of this media allows them to gain knowledge in a variety of new ways. Children are able to create and share their own content and express their ideas and experiences on a worldwide platform. </p><p>While the many benefits of the online world are undeniable, the accompanying risks and challenges cannot be discounted. At FOSI, we do not seek to diminish the existence of these risks on the internet, but rather, to focus on the constructive ways that they can be managed against the benefits and opportunities of being online. </p><p>That's why we believe creating a culture of responsibility is the most effective framework to ensure that children are protected in the digital world. Hearings like this one today are an important part of the oversight and support role that government needs to play in order to create a safer internet for all. </p><p>Additionally, we have been pleased to work with the First Lady on her be best initiative. As a membership organization, we push industry to go further and consider online safety throughout the development of new products and services. </p><p>We support effective oversight of industry self-regulation, believing that this allows for maximum innovation in the development of creative solutions. We are grateful for the hard work of law enforcement, including those sitting here with me today. And we have a long history of working with NCMEC, which I really appreciate. </p><p>It is imperative that they are fully resourced and given the tools and training to combat the rise in cybercrime. Parents must be engaged and knowledgeable about what their children are doing on the internet. </p><p>We know that caregivers are worried about the amount of time their children are spending on devices, as well as, the content that they are accessing. We seek to allay these concerns by empowering parents to confidently navigate the online world with their children. </p><p>This involves exploring the internet alongside their kids and employing the many parental control tools provided by companies. First rate technology training must be provided to all teachers, since they are often one of the first places that children and parents look for help and information on digital challenges. </p><p>And most importantly, children must be taught to be good digital citizens, to know about the rights and responsibilities that come with being online, to understand the consequences of sharing personal information and to empower them to make the right decisions when they see upsetting content or inappropriate behavior. </p><p>The internet cannot be made 100 percent safe. We must foster resiliency in our children and give them the tools, both, moral and technical to deal with what they will inevitably encounter, both, on and offline. </p><p>The steps that we take to protect a seven-year-old will not be the same for a 17-year-old, although, they are both minors. That's why we must move from protection to empowerment, from blocking some monitoring, from restrictions to responsibility. </p><p>Let me--let me conclude by urging you to not underestimate the benefits and opportunities that enrich the lives of so many American children. Their access to information, the freedom to express themselves in the cultivation of skills that will equip them to compete and thrive in a connected world must be protected. </p><p>It is only through working together that we can ensure that we acknowledge the risks, mitigate the real harms and allow all children to reap the rewards of this digital world. Thank you for your time this morning and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Blumenthal, you make your opening statement and be-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --Thank you, Senator Graham. Thank you, Senator Graham for holding this hearing. It's supremely important that we face this question about protecting children online. And I want to particularly thank our witnesses, especially, Mr. Clark, NCMEC has been at the forefront of this cause from the very start. </p><p>I can remember well when Connecticut and other states established their child predator, sex offender registries. And then I argued in the United States Supreme Court to defend the constitutionality of our state laws. They were upheld and your support was invaluable. So, thank you. </p><p>If anything, the task of protecting children has become all the more difficult since then. It was hard then, it's nearly impossible now without the partnership of the big tech companies. Parents have a primary responsibility, but they need a more proactive and preventive role from the big tech companies. </p><p>All too often, these companies have been inadequate and abysmally slow in responding. Last month, researchers found that YouTube's recommendation system was promoting videos that sexualized minors. Parents could post innocent videos of their kids, and YouTube's algorithms might shepherd the wrong people to them. </p><p>And I'm disappointed, frankly, with YouTube's unwillingness to take basic steps that Senator Blackburn and I asked that they do to fix their platform. We have yet to receive an adequate response from them. And I'll be asking questions about it going forward. </p><p>This May, a YouTube celebrity, Austin Jones, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for coercing and deceiving at least six underage girls into sending him sexually explicit videos. YouTube's initial response was to demonize his videos saying that the channel didn't violate the terms of service, only after significant negative press, did they finally do the right thing. </p><p>And that encapsulates and epitomizes the reactive nature of the tech companies addressing this problem or failing to address it. Let me just say, in conclusion, as disappointed as I am in the failure of these companies to meet their own terms of service and to act more promptly and preventively, the failure of enforcement is, in many ways, even more disturbing, even shocking. </p><p>What you've just heard from Professor Campbell, I think, reflects my experience and others with the FTC's lapses and laxity in enforcement. If there's no deterrence and potential swift and sure punishment, these companies have a lot less incentive to enforce their own terms of service, not to mention, morals and standards that the law provides. </p><p>We need to set a national standard for tech companies as to how they protect children. We need to know that if a user is reported for abuse, social media sites will act immediately. We need to know that authorities and organizations like NCMEC will be provided all the evidence they need when children are threatened, and the resources that are required. </p><p>And we need to know that private sensitive information about our kids will be kept safe and secure. I want to thank all of you for your very impressive work, particularly, our enforcers who are here. And thank you for this opportunity to ask questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Mr. Stone, what percentage of the cases where you are trying to exploit a phone or other social media device where you have a warrant, the companies fail to help you? </p><p>STONE: The-- I don't know that I could give you an exact percentage. I will tell you that-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Is it a big problem? </p><p>STONE: It is a big problem. And I think there's some, at this point, there are just some phones that our investigators and our analysts recognize they cannot get into. And so, whether they have a search warrant or not, they recognize that they are not going to be able to get past those encryption codes. So, they are not even able to make the effort. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, from a prosecutor's point of view, if you had someone, or a group of people, going to a schoolhouse and exposing themselves at a bus stop, it would be front page news all over the world. And you would put every resource possible to go find these people, right? </p><p>STONE: Yes, Sir. </p><p>GRAHAM: This happens literally every minute of every day, right? </p><p>STONE: It does. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, what can we do to have that same intensity, track down the guy that is going to the school and doing inappropriate things to our children on the internet? What's missing? </p><p>STONE: I think that, first of all, what I think you are seeing throughout this country now is you are seeing prosecutions at both the state and federal level that are targeting these areas. Part of that, though, has to be the intelligence investigation aspect of it, and trying to stay focused on that. </p><p>GRAHAM: But, Mr. McKenna, you did a--set up a site to lure--to mimic a teenage girl, right? </p><p>MCKENNA: Correct, yes. </p><p>GRAHAM: What happened to the people who sent pictures of themselves? </p><p>MCKENNA: Absolutely nothing. Their messages showed up in the direct message box of the Instagram account. And that's--that's where they sit. We can report those accounts and then ask for Instagram through the reporting process, to, you know, do their own investigation and potentially take those accounts down. </p><p>But in our experience, because you can set up a new Instagram account within seconds, all that does is create a blip in their behavior. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, how do we get to the bottom of that? </p><p>MCKENNA: We would say that's a feature issue within Instagram, that the very nature in which we've identified four primary features that exist in Instagram, create ripe opportunity for exploitation through direct messaging, even if you have a private account, through hashtags, which Instagram really is a mini search engine where there are no filters. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, the social media companies, that's within their power? </p><p>MCKENNA: It's within their power. Their features create these opportunities. </p><p>GRAHAM: Mr. Clark, tell me about the 18.4 million number. Put that in context. What are we talking about? </p><p>CLARK: Those our cyber tip reports, Mr. Chairman, that come to us mostly from the electronic service providers or the large tech companies. About 98 percent of those come from the tech companies that are reported to us. The rest are from citizens who would report such content to us. </p><p>Interestingly to report, when I took over as CEO at the center, we were at about 4 million or so cyber chip reports coming in annually. That was just three and a half years ago. Last year, that number rose to 18.4 million. So, is due in part for the larger reporting requirements to the electronic service providers. But the-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --What happens to these people, for a lack of a better word, that are reported? </p><p>CLARK: Well, we send those reports on. It's a global problem, as well, about-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Does anybody ever get prosecuted? </p><p>CLARK: They do. They do get prosecuted, Senator. That's the, what we refer to as the good news. We--we work with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces around the United States. We send those reports around the globe. About 93 percent of those reports have an international connection, which, I think, typifies the global nature of this problem. </p><p>And so, when those reports are sent to those particular entities, because we are not a law enforcement organization, we trust in their goodwill to try to find out, investigate, prosecute those individuals. </p><p>GRAHAM: Is it creating a sense of deterrence? </p><p>CLARK: I--I believe it is in the sense that we had better reporting. And I think it's always good that you're getting more of that content identified. As I said in my initial testimony, it's a problem that we really can't arrest our way out of. </p><p>GRAHAM: Right. </p><p>CLARK: The volume alone is just staggering. </p><p>GRAHAM: Right. Ms. Campbell, what would your simple message to this committee about the FTC and how they should up their game? </p><p>CAMPBELL: I would encourage the FTC to enforce the law-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --I'm sorry, to match the button? </p><p>CAMPBELL: The FTC really needs to enforce the provisions of COPPA. They-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --On a scale of 1 to 10, how good are they doing? </p><p>CAMPBELL: I would say about one half. So, they need-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Then there's a lot of potential to get better. </p><p>CAMPBELL: There--there is. I mean, there's so many violations. They are very easy to find. </p><p>GRAHAM: Do you all recommend that we call in the tech companies, and they sit where you're sitting? </p><p>CAMPBELL: Yes, I do. I think they bear a lot of the responsibility. </p><p>GRAHAM: We'll do that. Senator Blumenthal, excuse me, Feinstein--Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I agree completely that we ought to be hearing from the tech companies because I think on that scale of 1 to 10, half is probably generous, given the experience that you and others have outlined today. Would others agree that the tech companies can and should do more to protect children? Mr. Stone. </p><p>STONE: I do, Senator. And I would like to make a comment about what you previously said concerning YouTube. The dark web gets the majority of the attention when it comes to criminal issues. On the other hand, I believe that the mainstream, the more mainstream internet, is actually just as dangerous. </p><p>The videos that I described earlier, the music videos that are professionally made that show the gang members with guns and drugs, show them belittling law enforcement, those recruiting tools, trying to get our teenagers and our young people to join into their gangs are not being posted on the dark web. They're being posted on YouTube. </p><p>We watch those in our office. So, from that perspective, I think the mainstream, more mainstream internet is something that we really need to be more concerned with right now. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And would you agree with me and let me ask the other members of the committee, as well, we can pass all the laws we want. And I'm a supporter of the Markey-Hawley revisions, and I will be a cosponsor as soon as I'm able, if we have another Republican to join us. </p><p>But the best laws in the world are dead letter if they are not enforced. And so, would the members of this panel agreed that the FTC should be doing a better job as professor Campbell has stated? Is there anyone who disagrees? </p><p>And I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, maybe we should have the FTC testify, as well, on an occasion separate from the tech companies. You indicated, professor Campbell, that there have been 29 actions to enforce COPPA, essentially all settled in adequately by consent decree with minimal penalties, and that the FTC has so far failed to respond to the 14 request for action. You outlined two of them. Would you be able to provide the committee with the other 12? </p><p>CAMPBELL: Yes, of course. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: In order to deter this kind of misconduct on the internet, let me ask Solicitor Stone and Mr. Clark, are the tech companies providing you with all the forensic data that--and support that you need when you are investigating sexual exploitation? </p><p>STONE: Until we get to the issue of the encryptions, yes sir, I think we are getting a good bit of that information. I prosecuted a case in May, in which the people--there was actually one 15-year-old that shot and killed another 15-year-old. The threat that the shooter made to the victim was over Snapchat. </p><p>The problem was Snapchat is it instantaneously the goes away. So, we were not able to get that material. The shooter also, when he was looking for his 40 caliber gun in order to gun down the other teenager, he posted that on Facebook. And we were able to pull all of the Facebook through a search warrant and get that material which was crucial. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And I think you mentioned, as a matter of fact, that the Department of Defense sponsored Memex project, and if that crawls the dark web, and is an example of the technical schools--tools that may be the federal government could provide for local and state law enforcement. </p><p>STONE: And thank you for saying that. Cyrus Vance is the Manhattan District Attorney. He used Memex and he has actually testified and to Congress concerning Memex. And that's correct. It crawls the dark web. It's an advanced search engine. Unfortunately, most prosecutors' offices do not have the resources to have that type of advanced search engine. </p><p>But I think in today's time, especially when it's dealing--when we're dealing with human trafficking, I think we are seeing a very small percentage of the actual crime. And I think something like that advanced search engine is essential for us to determine exactly how big of a problem we're dealing with. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And that's an example of how the federal government might be of more assistance to you? </p><p>STONE: Yes, Sir. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Clark, how about forensic evidence from the big tech--big tech companies. Is it forthcoming? </p><p>CLARK: Senator, the short answer to your question is there is great room for improvement. But I can tell you this, we have seen, thankfully, some improvement with that. For example, Microsoft use of photo DNA and helping us to do a better job of tracking the images online through the hashing process. </p><p>We also received--have by evidence, at least, of the cyber tip line, been receiving a lot more notifications through the electronic service providers and big tech that are reporting the images. Last year, I believe it was around 67,000 images that we also found. </p><p>NCMEC discovered that we asked the big tech companies ESRBs to take down, and they did. So, we're--we're doing better at that level of collaboration. But there is always room for improvement. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And they have been mostly reactive, not proactive, correct? </p><p>CLARK: In essence, yes. Reactive is not really the role we probably want to see, although, it is such a volume of imagery that is going out there around the globe, some of which is not just even coming from the United States, it's coming from other places around the world. It's very, very difficult to get all those tech companies, and right now, we have about 1,500 of them that are working with us, but to get them all in line to help on that problem. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Lee. </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. Thanks to each of you for being here. This is an important topic. It reminds me of a time I was riding in the car with my then teenage sons a few years ago, a song came on the radio. I listened to the words of it. I concluded the words were bad and I immediately told them, \"This is terrible,\" and I turned down the volume. My son, John, at the time, without missing a beat, said, \"Dad, it's not bad if you don't think about it.\" This is one of those things, we'd prefer not to have to think about it. This isn't bad if you don't think about it but it's not bad only if you don't think about it. </p><p>This is a--a crisis affecting our children and it's not an abstract one, it's not a rare one. A 2018 Pew Research Study concluded that 45 percent of America's teens today are online almost constantly, while another 44 percent are--are online at least several times a day, that's 89 percent of teens overall. And yeah, this is far from an abstract issue. Many of those people come into contact with things that harm them. Sometimes the results are severe. According to a Thorn Study conducted in--in 2018, fully 55 percent of human trafficking survivors, who were trafficked beginning in 2015, first encountered their trafficker online or via text message. Now, those are just sort of the extreme examples, many others who were never trafficked end up being harmed by things that they're exposed to online. </p><p>Collectively, the--the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store account for about 95 percent of app purchases in the United States. Now, to their credit, both Apple and Google use an age rating system and have some child focused rules to prevent children from being exposed to things that they--that they shouldn't be. And yet, some of the most popular apps sold through those stores, including things like YouTube, and Snapchat, and Instagram can and often do, in fact, constantly do, provide sexually explicit contact--content to children. And it's--it's not just when a child is looking for that, it's happening when they input very innocent, childlike search terms that have nothing to do with sexual content. </p><p>So, Mr. McKenna, I'd--I'd like to talk to you about this for a minute. What--what should app stores be doing differently with their rating measures to help prevent this kind of thing from happening, to help prevent providing this kind of sexually explicit conduct--yeah, content to children? </p><p>MCKENNA: Thank you, Senator Lee. </p><p>First and foremost, we--we simply want transparency and additional information for parents. In--in no other context where we know that young people are spending a lot of time do we allow for this much inaccuracy with the information that we give parents to know how to protect their kids. Like I'm envisioning more of an analog example of a toy in a toy aisle that had some of the features of some of the things that we see on apps that are used by teens and then just telling parents, \"Well, mixed in with all the other things that your kids love, we just want you to avoid looking at that one place.\" We--we would simply never allow that to happen. </p><p>And so when it comes to the app stores, we want there to be a unification. You referred to both Apple and Google, but they use very different processes, as we explained in my written testimony, to evaluate and also to score those apps, so there's this confusion, even if you look at one or the other. We also would argue that what you get is a very generic set of descriptions that really don't tell you what's actually going on inside of the app so this transparency of what the true interactions are. </p><p>If you were to look at the App Store description in Apple, for Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat, three of the top social media platforms used by kids today, you would find the exact same description. In other words, there's nothing unique to tell us about any of the predatory risks or things specific to Snap Map, which is why we connect back to say, the ESRB, where if you were to look at some of the top games that the ESRB has rated, there is volumes of information telling you exactly what goes on, what happens to certain body parts and blood and gore. And you walk away from this description, as a parent, with a clear view as to what I'm going to be putting in front of my children. Now, I still have, right, the option, but I've been informed. So we want that unification to make them the same, make it transparent, and provide some accountability so that when players in the App Store are not giving information to parents as they should that there's some ramifications for that, otherwise behavior is just never going to change. </p><p>LEE: Well said. Demanding or expecting that a--a child behave like a--a good internet citizen falls on deaf ears, especially when someone is encouraging a child to use an app that at times acts like a strip club. </p><p>Mr. Chairman, I ask anonymous consent that we submit into the record the testimony of Dawn Hawkins, the Senior Vice President and Executive Director for the National Center on Child Exploitation. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. Senator Ernst. </p><p>ERNST: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. And--and thanks for the panelists today. This is a really hard topic for us to talk about openly, but I think it is vitally important. </p><p>The internet has changed the way we do business so much and it's so easy to access information. In some ways that's--that's really wonderful but in other ways, I think about where we are today. I remember as a kid, and probably many of you too, at school we talked about stranger danger and don't approach a van if a man has candy or puppies. Well, now that--that hypothetical van has gone away and we have those that want to exploit our children using the internet as their van or their puppies or kitties. </p><p>So just talking, we're--we're talking about different apps, different devices, how we can protect our children. Are there ways that we can focus on the actual devices that our children are using? I mean, there's a way to block certain content and so forth, should we be going further with that? Mr. McKenna, could you maybe, you know, talk a little bit about that? </p><p>MCKENNA: Sure. Thank you, Senator. </p><p>I believe there are very simple things that could be done almost instantly. Whenever we set up a device for our young people, whether it's an iPhone or an Android device, that device almost always knows the age of the primary user because when you set up an Apple ID you put in a birthday, when you set up a Google account you put in a birthday. And so we would simply, you know, submit as an idea that in setting up the device, what if there were simple defaults that were attached to an age, which removes all of the barriers? </p><p>I speak to so many parents. I could tell you about a--a conversation I had on the airplane ride over here last night. In fact, I said, \"Are you busy tomorrow at 10:00? I'd love for you to come to this hearing.\" And she was relaying the difficulties as a--a doctor, a professor, and even with her high level education, to understand how to hunt for certain settings in a phone. So many of these things could be done by default, not only from a protection standpoint but from a privacy standpoint. What if the posture of our digital devices was one of protection and privacy instead of exploitation so that I have to search for protection? Instead, what I have now is to search for privacy, I have to search for parental controls in order to protect my children. And we would simply argue that the default posture should simply be the other way around, that if I want to choose to allow my children to have access to things then that should be what I hunt for-- </p><p>ERNST: --Absolutely-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --instead of the setting. </p><p>ERNST: I agree. I--I think that's just smart. Since we are able to set up our devices is to understand as a parent, that there are ways to do that-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --Right-- </p><p>ERNST: --but then also, it does need to be easier. </p><p>MCKENNA: Correct. </p><p>ERNST: For heaven's sakes, I have a hard time-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --Correct. Yeah-- </p><p>ERNST: --figuring out my own device. </p><p>GRAHAM: Excuse me. </p><p>ERNST: So, yes. Go ahead. </p><p>GRAHAM: This is very interesting to me. Could the FEC, could they do this by rule? </p><p>CAMPBELL: The FTC? </p><p>GRAHAM: Yeah, whatever that agency is that does all those. </p><p>CAMPBELL: Sorry. No, the FTC doesn't have rule-making authority, except, you know, for COPPA, I think they could probably do something, but they haven't really used that authority much. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. I'm just thinking of how you can make this a reality. </p><p>ERNST: Yeah, absolutely. </p><p>GRAHAM: You get more time. Go ahead. </p><p>ERNST: Because I--I think we can focus on, thank you, Mr. Chair, I think we can--we can focus on the apps, but I think that they could work in conjunction with our devices as well and if we really want these tech companies to step up I think that that needs to be part of the equation, as well. </p><p>So I know that my time is expiring. But no, I'll leave it there. I know we've got some other questions. But I do think that this is an area that we could delve a little--a little deeper into. I think that there needs to be creative solutions coming from all angles, and not one of just apps and--and the different programs that exist out there on the internet, but also finding ways that we can use our devices as a screening mechanism to protect our children, too. So thank you very much to our panelists. Thank you, Mr. Chair, </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Kennedy. </p><p>KENNEDY: Mr. McKenna, if you were buying a phone today for your 14-year-old and--and you wanted to prevent her from being exploited sexually or exposed to things that she shouldn't see what would you do? </p><p>MCKENNA: My daughter does currently have a phone. She has an Android device that is used in certain very public places so we've decided as a family that location matters, where kids use phones matters. We've also put-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --I'm not asking about your--your--your daughter, particularly but-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --But in general. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah, what I'm getting at is what can a parent do-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --Sure.-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --right--today to--to try to prevent their--their child from seeing this stuff? </p><p>MCKENNA: Well, frankly, if they allow their children to use social media there are very few parental controls that would prevent them from seeing these things. So the only way to prevent them from seeing the things that we experience social media is to not allow them to use social media, which creates this sort of binary decision that parents are confronted with, either we allow it or we don't and if we allow it we accept a certain level of risk. </p><p>KENNEDY: But media can be filtered, can it not? </p><p>MCKENNA: If social media creators--in--in its current iteration, no. I cannot filter content on Instagram, if I were to search for hashtags, the same is true on--on Snapchat, the nature of Snapchat is with (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Well, let me put it--let me put it another way. I'm interested in solutions. I think we all understand the problem. </p><p>MCKENNA: Yeah. </p><p>KENNEDY: Could Apple, for example, design a program that a parent could opt into and the instructions to Apple would be, \"Design a program to filter all information that my daughter or son may see that could be sexually exploitative?\" Maybe filter all pictures or written references to human genitalia. Can that be done? </p><p>MCKENNA: To be--to be honest, Senator, I'm not sure. I'm-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Well, isn't that short way home here? Sir, go ahead. </p><p>BALKAM: Senator, all of the major operating systems, all of the cell phone operators, all have got parental controls. What's very interesting is that the first White House Summit that the First Lady held only last year, she called upon the tech companies to make-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --But--but first, can it be done? </p><p>BALKAM: Yes. So just as-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --So could we write legislation or a--promulgate a rule that says, \"Here's the thing that a reasonable parent would do to protect his or her child from seeing this stuff,\" and we do that in conjunction with somebody who has the obvious expertise? And you filter everything. I don't know how to do it. I can't write software. Maybe it is to--to--to prohibit any pictures of human genitalia or--or prohibit any references to sexual activity. I don't know. The kids aren't going to like it but that's not--not who we're trying to please here. What couldn't that be done? </p><p>I think Senator--Senator Ernst right. I mean, you can go fight with the social media companies and their lobbyists and their campaign contributions. And I mean, we've been talking for, what, two years about a privacy bill? Haven't see one. Okay. Don't know if we'll ever seen one. That's not a criticism of--of anybody, it's just why this place is. It's we need a microwave, not a Crock-Pot here. And I just don't see why you can't--Apple can't just write a program. Are they going to miss some things? Sure. But if they are in good faith, write me a program, put it into my phone, that's going to filter all this stuff, and do it in good faith and look over their shoulders. Can we do that? </p><p>BALKAM: So just to give you an example, Verizon has something called Smart Family that will do exactly what you're asking to do. And they've created it, as has AT&amp;T has their own and T-Mobile has their own, without having created a law. I don't know how, I'm not a lawyer-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Can it be done? </p><p>BALKAM: It is--it is being done, Senator. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. Can we require that-- </p><p>BALKAM: --That, I-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --to be put on every operating device?-- </p><p>BALKAM: --Well, defer to my-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --If we did require that to be put in every operating device would that solve the problem substantially? </p><p>BALKAM: I don't know about how you craft the law and there are already parental controls in the devices. Our biggest challenge is to educate parents that these things-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Well, that-- </p><p>BALKAM: --are there.-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --that, we can't legislate on that. </p><p>Let me ask one other quick question of the Professor. Professor, you think there's some people at the FTC who are doing a lousy job on this, don't you? </p><p>CAMPBELL: Yes. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. Do you know who they are? </p><p>CAMPBELL: The Bureau of Consumer Protection? </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. Would--would you support legislation to make it easier to fire them? </p><p>CAMPBELL:  I don't know if that's the solution, Senator. </p><p>KENNEDY: You don't--you don't think somebody ought to be fired when they're doing a lousy job? </p><p>CAMPBELL: Well, perhaps, but you know, I think we need to look at the reasons why they're not doing a good job as they should. </p><p>KENNEDY: How about because they're lazy, or they're not interested, or they're just not very good employees? </p><p>CAMPBELL: Perhaps, sir, I'm not really-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --That's all I have, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Blackburn. Senator Blackburn. </p><p>BLACKBURN: And thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to each of you for being here. And Senator Kennedy, we've been on this issue of privacy and data security for seven years. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah. </p><p>BLACKBURN: I lead that working group in the House. I do have a privacy bill you can sign on, it's called the Browser Act. </p><p>KENNEDY: I've got a bunch of bills. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Be happy to have your support-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --We've got a bunch of bills-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: --and push this to finish because we need to. </p><p>I--I thank the chairman for this hearing and I thank Senator Blumenthal for working with me on this issue. And to each of you, I--I thank you for your attention on this. </p><p>I have to tell you, as I watched and read what was happening with Jeffrey Epstein this weekend and that arrest and how the authorities found hundreds of nude photos of these underage girls in his home and I think his case serves as a warning that predators really do lurk. And Mr. Clark, this is partly to your point and Mr. McKenna's point, they lurk in every corner of society, whether it's the rich and the powerful or the poor and depraved. And those protections that have existed in the physical world many times are not being transferred to the virtual space and you each have spoken to that. And I think, as you've said, these predators no longer lurk in AOL chat rooms, they are right there on all of these apps that our precious children are using, whether it is Snapchat, or Instagram, or Facebook, or YouTube, or GroupMe, or any of those. </p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have that regulation. And many of us have focused on this issue of safety of children online for years. I'm glad the Justice Department and General Barr are working on this. They've got the Safe Neighborhoods Program. I do hope these groups are working with you and going after these predators. I think that Deputy AG Stacey Harris, who is doing work with the National Strategy for Child Exploitation, is really focused on these tech platforms. And having a collaborative effort is going to be important. </p><p>I had reviewed that case from a couple of years ago, the Soledad case from California. When ICE agents apprehended him he was caught using Snapchat to try to coerce a 13-year-old boy to send him sexually explicit video. And then the parents called the police. And then when ICE agents got involved they found five more victims ages 12 to 15. The children lived in Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, Illinois, and California. And each victim was coerced using a social media application. That is how this sick, vile human being was going after these children. </p><p>And I will tell you, as a mom, as a grand-mom, it is really so disheartening to me to see children used as a center for profit on the social media platforms. And a few years ago the EFF filed a complaint with the FTC regarding an investigation into Google's surveillance of schoolchildren on Chromebooks. And to the professor's point about the lack of follow-up and due diligence that is being done by the FTC, this is one of those areas where they go in, they scoop the data, they track, they follow, and they've got that virtual you, if you will, of that child because they have all of that identifying information on that child, their virtual presence. </p><p>I do have a couple of questions. I've talked through much of my time. Mr. McKenna, I will just say this, you mentioned Mr. Zuckerberg, he has fought us on privacy for years, finally, he is changing his tune. You've talked about some of these dangers. I--what can the apps like Instagram and Snapchat do, specifics, to embed into these applications? They can manipulate these algorithms if they so choose, they are choosing not to do it. So if you were building that algorithm, what would you embed? </p><p>MCKENNA: We would simply allow--to--to Mr. Balkum's point, we are--we--we want children to learn how to use technology and to use these apps, we just would argue that parents need a choice as to what features their children do and don't have access to inside of these apps. So if I were creating a picture app, I would allow children to truly have a private account with a curated set of contacts that would not allow people who are not a part of that curated list to be in contact with me. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Much like the Apple Watch is doing now. </p><p>MCKENNA: That's correct. And so I would eliminate the ability for strangers to contact, right, so-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: --Let me move on to so and I'm going to ask you to submit this to me. </p><p>MCKENNA: Sure. </p><p>BLACKBURN: You mentioned the video game rating. And I was in the House when we handled that process. I think Mortal Kombat was the big game. </p><p>MCKENNA: It was. </p><p>BLACKBURN: And what I would like for you to do is to submit in writing, for the record, how you would approach this ratings system. Because I agree with you, the ratings are totally wrong on these apps and therefore, the parents do not have the information to make an informed decision, nor do they realize that when you're in Snap and you get into that Discover section or that newsfeed-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --Right.-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: --then it is - and I had said this yesterday when I was looking through some of these things - I said, \"This is almost what we went through with the video games-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --Correct.-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: --and Mortal Kombat, one thing leads you to another, to another and it is deeper and further down the--the chain of what is acceptable or even expected by parents.\" </p><p>So I thank each of you for your diligence and your work in protecting children. And I look forward to continuing the conversation. I yield back. Mr. Chairman. </p><p>MCKENNA: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Hawley. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to each of you for being here and for your testimony on this very important issue. I--I think we can agree that exploiting children online is--is one of the worst dangers and one of the worst social threats that we face. </p><p>But let's talk about whether or not being callous towards children's safety is actually a part of the business model of some of these companies. And my concern is that it is. And I think you don't have to look any further than the reports about YouTube and The New York Times reporting last month about the algorithm collecting and funneling videos of--of minor children to pedophiles, and of course, as--as we have discussed this morning, allowing them, those pedophiles, to contact the children. </p><p>This report was sickening but I think what was even more sickening was YouTube's refusal to do anything about it. YouTube admitted that they could do something about it, they could stop auto referring these videos of minors to pedophiles, but they chose not to do so. Why not? Because their--their model is that 70 percent of their business, 70 percent of their traffic, it comes from these auto recommended videos. In other words, there's--there's ad revenue that would be lost if they actually took some enforcement steps here, took some steps to stop this exploitation of children. </p><p>So my first question is, does anybody here think that one of the world's largest, most powerful companies should be privileging their ad revenue over children safety? Well, that's why I introduced a bill that would require YouTube to do what it can do, what it absolutely has the power to do, which is to stop recommending videos that feature children unless those videos fall within very carefully tailored safety and exceptions. It would apply not only to YouTube, but it would apply to any video hosting company. It's common sense legislation, I hope this committee will--will have--hold hearings on it and will mark it up, I hope will refer it to the full Senate and act to actually protect our children online. </p><p>Let me just ask you, Mr. McKenna, do you agree that for some of these companies aspects of their business model actually conflict with protecting the safety of children? </p><p>MCKENNA: Thank you for the question, Senator Hawley. </p><p>I absolutely agree that the--the business model based on reach and engagement is one that absolutely conflicts with protection. </p><p>HAWLEY: What--what else can we do about that? And tell us more about how the design of--of some of these companies model and their platforms pulls against the goal of--of safety for children online? </p><p>MCKENNA: Well, the--the simple premise of Snapchat, which is one based on images that--that disappear, right, they--they--they have a model that wants young people to use an app that neurologically they're not ready to use and--and so they're--the entire platform is built on something that we would argue that teens just are not ready to engage in. So Snapchat could be doing so much more in terms of the types of friend referrals that happen, in terms of what happens in Discover news. They know that in Discover, which is where third parties will play articles, is where revenue occurs, that's where engagement happens. Again, they're based on an engagement model. They want more people looking at that content and that just feeds that cycle of revenue. </p><p>HAWLEY: Is it--is it your sense that Snapchat and other similar platforms are engaging in practices that, at least as it relates to their child users, are exploitative? </p><p>MCKENNA: Absolutely. Knowing--in--in no other places where we have significant numbers of children spending time do we allow so few controls to govern those environments, right. I--I mean, 16 million--16 million teens are--are using Snapchat. Even if the app were to say that, \"We are for adults only,\" I believe they have a duty of care responsibility for a population of teens that they know are using their app to protect them. </p><p>HAWLEY: Professor Campbell, you were nodding your head. Do you agree with that and do you want to add something on this point? And then I want to ask you about COPPA. </p><p>CAMPBELL: Yes, I would add, just to give you an example of how I think a company could do a better job of structuring its products, YouTube actually has a product intended for children called YouTube Kids and it's got some good policies. The problem, again, is that they're not really enforcing those policies. There--there's a lot of content on--on--on --even on YouTube Kids, that is inappropriate and--and we've complained to the FTC about this. So one of the reasons is that they designed the product so that all programming on YouTube Kids first has to be on YouTube. So all of these kids channels are on YouTube and so kids are watching it on YouTube instead of YouTube Kids and then they're getting exposed all the advertising, and of course, Google's benefiting from those ad revenue. So if they had designed YouTube Kids differently so that it was actually protected space for children, that--that would have been a good thing, but that's not what they chose to do. </p><p>HAWLEY: Let me thank you for that. That's really helpful. </p><p>Let--let me just ask you briefly here about COPPA. You mentioned the need for the FTC to get serious about enforcement for updates to COPPA. I'm proud to be co-sponsoring with Senator Markey, a major update to COPPA, the first in 20 years, that would provide sweeping new privacy protections for children. It would also apply to any company that has reason to know that a child is a user, even if they don't have actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, which we think is--is hugely significant for actually holding these companies accountable. </p><p>Let me just ask you, though, you mentioned earlier that the FTC may be able to use some rule-making authority under COPPA, either the existing COPPA or our proposed update, to require new default privacy settings for devices or on platforms. Should we be thinking about, in the COPPA update, including language to this effect? I mean, what would you counsel us to do to make this COPPA update as--as tough and as comprehensive as possible? </p><p>CAMPBELL: Well, one problem is what we call dark patterns and--and that's when a company will create incentives for users to do something that is not necessarily in the users' interest but does benefit the company. And so what Mr. McKenna was talking about with making it difficult to find privacy settings, not setting defaults to protect privacy, those are part of the dark pattern problem, they can make it very easy for them to do what you want to do and make it very difficult, even if you make a lot of effort, to change those privacy settings or protect yourself. </p><p>HAWLEY: Great. Thank you very much. Thank you all for your work on this important topic. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Tillis. </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you all for being here. </p><p>Mr. Balkam, could you talk a little bit about the initiative with the First Lady? What--what does a successful end state look like? </p><p>BALKAM: She chose cyberbullying online safety as her main task to work on as--as first lady. She's also included opioid abuse and general wellbeing of children. We've been very impressed with her approach. </p><p>TILLIS: What does that look like in terms of the impact that it would have on the technology providers-- </p><p>BALKAM: --Well, I think it's raised-- </p><p>TILLIS: --or what is the expected-- </p><p>BALKAM: --it's raised the subject and the--and the topic to--to the front, and--and it said, \"Look, at the highest levels there is concern and there is a challenge to you technology companies to step up and to--to deal with this issue.\" </p><p>TILLIS: Mr. McKenna, the--when you were exchanging questions and answers with Senator Ernst, you brought up the concept of trying to figure out a way to--to understand who's likely to use a phone. I'm trying to, I'm a technology person, I'm trying to get my head around the numbers because there are some 300 million cell phones in use in the United States, that number is only going to grow. Many of those are in the hands of adults who may leave them, they may not be password protected, the kid picks up Mom and Dad's phone and plays games on it, so I'm trying to figure out practically how we could do that. </p><p>There's also, I think, in the last Census, some estimated 89 percent of all households have some personal computer. We haven't even talked about one of the other portals in all this horrible activity that we've also got to sweep into this. There are so many ways and--and the Internet of Things, who knows what's next in terms of being able to drive content to you and possibly have a child respond to it. </p><p>Has there been any sort of collaboration between groups like yourselves and the tech industry to sit down and figure out the short and long-term strategy for doing this? Because see, I--I know, I--I follow a lot of texting while driving. As matter of fact, I got criticized back when I was in the North Carolina State House for apparently denying somebody their constitutional right to endanger my drive while they're interacting with the phone going down the road, which seems silly to me. But now we know one in four accidents are likely attributed to texting while driving. So I--I understand what you all are here for. But I think if we really take a look at how we're going to make the--the new Internet of Things a safer and environment for youth and young adults and adults, we've got to really, instead of looking at any one area as the solution to the problem, we have to look at this holistically or we're only going to scratch the surface on what I consider to be the public health and public safety crisis. </p><p>So if we go back, though, to the--to the idea of the--I immediately think about when you go and set up an Apple ID or you go and set up a--a Google ID, you could lie and say you're 18-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --Sure.-- </p><p>TILLIS: --or 16, or 14, or 25. So who's responsible for determining the honesty of the user of that platform? I mean, let's say you're a 14--year-old who lied because your parents gave you access to the credit card or whatever you need to open up an Apple ID account and you lied and said you're 20, who's responsible in that case? </p><p>MCKENNA: The parents, in that case, no question. </p><p>TILLIS: I'm glad you answered the question that way. I was hoping you would because I think at some point we also have to recognize we cannot only weave into this discussion the responsibility of the tech providers, which are constantly changing-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --Correct.-- </p><p>TILLIS: --and if all of a sudden we put the big tech on notice and they do the right thing then a little tech's going to come in and provide a different solution. So what we also have to weave into the public consciousness is you're giving your child a potentially lethal device and at some point in time we have to have a discussion about the parents' responsibility for making that device safe or take it away from them. Here's a concept, at 9:00 they don't get the phone until they get ready to go to school. </p><p>MCKENNA: Right. </p><p>TILLIS: I mean, we've got to start having, as a matter of public policy discussions, we have to have the discussion with the parents about understanding their routers, understanding you can prohibit access to all of these sites if you choose to if your kid's connected to the hotspot at home, and then coming up with a balanced solution that absolutely mandates that technology providers get a handle on the content and the potential lethality of that content. But we have to get the parents and those who provide the technology to these young people into the equation. </p><p>MCKENNA: Yeah, absolutely agree. And--and in doing so make it as minimally complex as possible-- </p><p>TILLIS: --Right-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --because I believe it's--that's the idea-- </p><p>TILLIS: --And I think--I think Senator Ernst is absolutely right-- </p><p>MCKENNA: --Correct-- </p><p>TILLIS: --unless you--because--because then you can actually place more responsibility on the people who are--ultimately, they have to take care of their children. </p><p>MCKENNA: Correct. </p><p>TILLIS: If you opt-out of this, if you allow them to go into a gaming environment that potentially leads to a dangerous outcome, if you opt-out of these things that we would suggest would require an explicit act, then the parents, ultimately, have to be held accountable for that. </p><p>BALKAM: Senator, if I may, it's why we created the Good Digital Parenting Initiative. And we distilled all of our experience and expertise to something called the Seven Steps to Good Digital Parenting, which you can put on the back of your fridge door if you want to. And key to this is talking with your kids, sitting down to setting parental controls, using a online--a family safety contract with your children. And critically and what's missing in--in all of this also, is parents being good digital role models themselves, putting that phone down at dinner, not texting while driving, giving your kids eye to eye, you know, contact when they come for it. So parents are absolutely a critical part of this, they are the least well served, however, in terms of information and support. </p><p>TILLIS: But I do, just on a final note, I don't know if any of y'all, or a final question, and if you have the statistics, there was a news report about a month ago for some of--it may--it may have been Google or YouTube, but you know, they have operations set up where they have people, it's a horrible job, I can't imagine ever doing it, where they're reviewing all this content. Do we have any idea about how much of the maligned content is being interdicted by the current processes versus what's getting through? I think that's another thing that we need to do, to say to what extent do we scale what they're already doing to cast a wider net? Those are the sorts of things we have to talk about if we're going to come up with good, sustainable policy that lets us benefit from all the great things the internet has given us but also address the public safety risks that you're all here today. And I appreciate it. </p><p>But that sort of information, if you have any, that can give me an idea of--I know we're--we're doing poorly, but what efforts out there, if we simply scale them, could reduce a lot of the problems so that we can narrowly focus legislative outcomes and regulatory outcomes-- </p><p>STONE: --Senator-- </p><p>TILLIS:</p><p>--to get your feedback. </p><p>STONE: Senator, I may not be able to give you exact numbers on what we're missing, but I will tell you this, our attorney general's office in South Carolina prosecutes about 250 of these offenders every year, but what is more disturbing through the ICAC or the internet crimes against children, what is more disturbing, I think, to me, looking at those gross numbers, is while those indictments are being brought their investigators are working through about 85 new cases every year and in those 85 new cases they are seeing over a million, it's right at 1,860,000 files of child pornography that they are having to go through. So the--the massive--the numbers that we're talking about are massive. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>A couple of brief questions. We haven't really talked about data mining and the threat to children's security from the extraordinary exponentially exploding means of gathering information about children, COPPA was never designed for toys connected to the internet, toys with cameras, toys that often have their own security vulnerabilities. I'm part of a working group that is examining proposals to assure protections for privacy and one of our models is the California Consumer Privacy Act that requires businesses to get opt-in consent to sell information of children under the age of 16. I believe that the rest of country ought to follow California's example and impose the strictest protections possible. Does everyone on this panel agree that the standard for consent and strict privacy protections under federal rules should be expanded to cover children and minors under 16? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Mr. McKenna? </p><p>MCKENNA: Yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Clark? I'm glad that everyone agrees. </p><p>Ms.--Professor Campbell, you suggest that all child directed content should be placed on a separate platform where targeted advertising, commercial data collection, links to other sites or content, comments, and autoplay are prohibited. And I agree that that kind of separate platform would help protect children. Would legislation be required for it if it were imposed rather than done voluntarily? </p><p>CAMPBELL: I think it's possible that that's something that the Federal Trade Commission could negotiate with YouTube as part of--if they are investigating them as and trying to settle the case as part of the settlement, but otherwise, I think it couldn't require that under existing law. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Would that approach have applications beyond YouTube, in other words, who? </p><p>CAMPBELL: Well, that's the problem with consent decrees, they're only binding on the parties to the consent decrees. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Exactly. So it would probably require legislation. </p><p>CAMPBELL: Yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: It would require the FTC to impose that kind of separate platform on a variety of other sites. </p><p>CAMPBELL: Yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And let me ask, finally, if--if each of you were to design, or let me ask you, Professor Campbell, initially, heightened safeguards for children and minors to protect against this kind of data mining, what additional steps would you take? </p><p>CAMPBELL: Well, one of the important things is to limit the data collection to only data that's absolutely necessary and the other is to not allow companies to retain the data beyond the time that's reasonably necessary to use it. And--and we're seeing this happening a lot, for example, with the Amazon Echo Dot speaker for kids, it's specific for kids, but they're saving the voice recordings of children and the translations of those voice recordings, in many cases, indefinitely and there's no way to even delete all of them even when the parent tries so--except to take their child out of the service and a lot of times you want your child to be able to use these services. So I think that--that we really need to focus on data minimization and--and also data security because the data that's available to companies can easily be available through data brokers and other sources, to predators and--and lots of other people. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And data minimization is another requirement of the California law and the (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>CAMPBELL: --And of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Exactly. Any other suggestions from other members of the panel on this topic? My thanks, again. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Cruz. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to each of the witnesses for being here and testifying on this--this very important topic. </p><p>Mr. McKenna, an article last month in The New York Times detailed how YouTube's recommendation algorithm can lead users from adult pornography to videos of girls as young as 5 or 6-years-old wearing bathing suits. Do you know--know if YouTube has changed their algorithms regarding child exploitation, and if not, what can and should YouTube do to stop this? </p><p>MCKENNA: Senator Cruz, thank you on that very important topic. </p><p>I am not aware that YouTube has changed their algorithm. I'm guessing if they would have done that, that that would have been newsworthy and--and parents everywhere would have been celebrating that, but I have not been aware of that news. I--I believe that YouTube, in their vast knowledge, has the ability to, in the same way, that they can recommend videos, they can choose not to recommend videos, and that would simply be a change that they would have to choose to make. </p><p>CRUZ: Wired reported that sexual predators use the comments section of YouTube videos to help other predators find videos, for example, they would announce times and videos that would be of particular interest to sexual predators. YouTube, thankfully, disabled commenting on--on many of the videos of children under 13. Has this prevented sexual predators from using YouTube to spread this information or is--or is it simply moving the problem elsewhere? </p><p>MCKENNA: Well, I--I believe it's a step in the right direction. I'm--I'm happy that they've made this change. I believe that that should mitigate some of the activity, but based on our experience, these individuals are extremely creative. And the comments section, irrespective of platform, whether it's YouTube, or Instagram, and other platforms that allow comments, are all breeding grounds for this sort of networking of pedophiles. So if it's not going to be on YouTube, it'll simply move to another platform and we've been witness to that. </p><p>CRUZ: As you know, a little over a year ago we passed, and the President signed into law, the--the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which amended section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, to strip immunity from online platforms that knowingly assist, facilitate, or support sex trafficking. How successful has SESTA been in--in combating sex trafficking and--and--and what else does Congress need to do? And that's open to anyone who-- </p><p>CLARK: Senator, good question. </p><p>I think SESTA largely has helped takedown, I think of BackPage.com, for example, certain ads that were attractive to networks, as Mr. McKenna said, it shared a likeness for trying to recruit and find, entice young women, kids, into sex for sale. But I would also say that it seems like when--when one disappears, another one appears. That's a global issue as we've been saying, across the--the country, in the United States, plus the world now, we're seeing still an increase on those number of chat sites, video sites, opportunities for exploitation to continue in the digital world. </p><p>CRUZ: Last year, a--a Texas woman sued Facebook for providing human traffickers with a way to \"stalk, exploit, recruit, groom, and extort children into the sex trade\". In--in y'all's judgment, are Facebook and the other social media sites doing enough to combat exploitation of their platforms by--by sex traffickers? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Not all at once. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CLARK: Senator, once again, I'd--I'd say there's room for improvement here. I think a--what we've seen with the cooperation of the tech companies, on the plus side, being--are participating in things that we're doing like cyber tip roundtables, bringing the tech companies together so that we can have a collaborative approach. If there's ever been a cause for, what I call a true public/private partnership, this is it. But of all the tech companies that handle reporting to NCMEC, about 1,500 of them, I'm--would be, I--I think, suffice to say that many of them still can do more. </p><p>MCKENNA: Senator Cruz, thank you. What--what I was trying to formulate in my--in my head to say was that not--not enough is--is being done. And in our experience, it doesn't feel as though until there's a huge news report, or there's some pressure, there's always this reactive response to these sort of issues from these large companies. They are brilliant organizations. I am confident that they have in their know-how the ability to, within weeks, take care of many of the problems that we have spoken about here at this hearing but it's not until they're pushed, or there's pressure, or there's reputational damage, or something that they seem to move, and even then, in the case of YouTube, they're still unwilling to do some very simple things that we think would protect children. And so that's my greatest concern, is that there's this continual resistance and reactive approach to the problems that to us feel so obvious. </p><p>CRUZ: Well, and I--and I would certainly be interested, I know the committee would, in--in any of the witnesses recommendations for additional steps that--that need to be taken, because this--this has to be continually addressed and vigorously address. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Miss Campbell, you wanted to say something? </p><p>CAMPBELL: I just wanted to give an example, again, using YouTube, I have to wonder why are so many under 13-year-olds are on YouTube when the terms of service prohibit them from using YouTube? And so I think, again, if--if children were using a different site, or separate site, that you wouldn't have as much problem with predators. And I think that--that it is true that it's a global problem because you'll see the same kids, the same little kids, like you know, in--in a--a outdoor pool in their bathing suit promoting toys, they're being paid by-products to promote these toys, and they're on all of the different platforms as well. And so it is a problem that I think needs to be looked at across platforms. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Blumenthal: </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I want to thank Senator Cruz for mentioning SESTA and also section 230, which in some ways is the elephant in the room, right. The immunity, which is so broad and uniquely encompassing by many of the tech companies is part of the reason that they are failing to do more. Because you mentioned, Mr. McKenna, the potential duty of care, standard of care, which is enforceable only if there is some accountability and right now, the biggest obstacle to accountability is section 230. So I appreciate Senator Cruz mentioning SESTA. Senator Portman and I were the co-sponsors SESTA. It was strongly supported by NCMEC. We thank you, again, for your help on it. I think it's an example of the bipartisan action that I hope will emerge from this very excellent hearing. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. </p><p>Just along those lines, to sum up, things would change tomorrow if you could get sued. So the problem with getting sued about providing content, if you're responsible for everything that flows through your business organization in terms of content you'd probably drive at least new people out of business and maybe put the old people in jeopardy of--of folding. But what I'd like to do is make sure that you're earning this liability of protection, that under Section 230, you know, you're a neutral platform for you to have that liability of protection when it comes to exploiting children, that you're earning it, that we come up with best business practices, and if you meet those best business practices you have a safe haven from liability, if you don't, you're going to get sued. </p><p>So it seems to me that we need to come up with a set of best business practices to protect children, whether it's the device itself or whatever. You know, if you have a default, we think that's the best thing for the country. That if you have a--set up a system where if you're a minor the default thing kicks in, then you're good to go. So what I want to do is look at what are the best business practices when it comes to protecting children from exploitation on the internet? And if you meet those best business practices you're okay, if you don't, you're going to get sued. It seems to me that will do more good than anything else. </p><p>The solutions come from the people in the private sector, as long as they're legitimate, and people like you will tell us if these are legitimate. So rather than the government telling you what to do, you need to find out what does work and we'll certify at the government level whether or not it's genuine and if you pass that sort of government audit, then you're good to go, if you don't, then you're exposed to lawsuits from moms and dads and everybody else. So that's where I'd like to take this discussion because 230 is the elephant in the room. And what I'd like to do is leverage that elephant in the room, that you can have these liability of protections because we want to save the industry and preserve it for competition, but you have to earn it. </p><p>And what have I learned from this hearing? You've got a lot of--liability of protections, but you're not doing a whole lot to earn it. Thank you very much for your testimony. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJJ-CVS1-F15W-H1J1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

CORY BOOKER (D-N.J.) </p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CALIF.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]LEE: Welcome to this hearing on the Subcommittee on Antitrust Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. Today's hearing continues our series, looking at competitive issues in digital technology markets. In September, we looked at acquisitions of nascent competitors by digital platforms. Today, we're going to explore self-preferencing by these platforms in the same industry. That is, what are the potential antitrust issues when platforms favor their own products or their own services over those offered by third parties.  </p><p>As I said in our hearing in September, I'm encouraged that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice are investigating whether the tech giants have violated the antitrust laws. If those efforts identify bad conduct that has harmed consumer, then the agencies should--and predictably will--seek to enjoin such infringing behavior.  </p><p>However, I'm also concerned that we might overshoot the mark in our efforts to reign in these firms. In particular, I'm concerned that antitrust policy could lose focus, forgetting that its purpose is to protect competition and not competitors. And, so, it's always important for us to remain focused on the text of individual statutes and the purpose--and the underlying, overriding purpose of our antitrust laws, which is to protect competition. </p><p>Clearly, we should not allow dominant firms to engage in conduct that harms competition. We also cannot fall prey to the mentality that treats big as categorically bad. Far too many politicians and TV pundits fail to understand that our antitrust laws do, in fact, tolerate big firms. E--even in some circumstances, monopolies, if they acquire their large market shares through business acumen or by offering consumers a superior product. </p><p>What matters for antitrust law is not the size of the firm, but whether its engaged in anticompetitive conduct. There is a difference and it is a difference that very much matters. With that in mind, we shouldn't mistake harm to competitors as being necessarily indicative of harm c--to competition itself.  </p><p>This may be the view of the Eur--European Union and, in many respects, it is, but it's not how we enforce antitrust law in this country. Our laws in this country are different. They focus on protecting competition itself, rather than competitors. Appropriate antitrust analysis under U.S. law will distinguish harm to competitors from harm to competition. It does so by focusing on whether the contact involved has benefited consumers or, alternatively, imposed harm on them. </p><p>Unfortunately, neither consumers nor taxpayers are well-served when our antitrust agencies are focused more on protecting their own turf than they are on protecting competition. So, before we gin--begin, I want to say a few words, yet again, about ongoing clearance battles between the Federal Trade Commission on the one hand and the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division on the other hand. </p><p>I've recon--recently spoken both to FTC Chairman Simons and to Assistant Attorney General Delrahim about this issue. In particular, I have expressed to both my profound frustration that these agencies are conducting monopolization investigations of the very same tech companies, at the very same time. Frankly, it's unacceptable that the FTC and the DOJ are duplicating each other's investigations when they both can see that they're strapped for resources as it is, even when they're not tripping over each other. </p><p>Now, I recognize that I must sound like something of a broken record on this issue, but that's not going to stop. The fact is that, given our bizarre institutional setup, these issues continue to come up again and again. And that's not simply going to go away. If anything, I--I--I'm amazed that this hasn't become a bigger, more prominent issue before now than it has at this point. </p><p>Absent of change in the--in the law, this is a clash that surely is going to continue into the future. You just can't set up two competing federal agencies covering, basically, the same subject matter without conflict, without uncertainty, without turf battles that are themselves going to cause significant harm, including, among other things, harm to competition itself and harm to those people whose interests are supposed to be protected by their enforcement of the laws they've been charged with administering.  </p><p>At the very least, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission should be doing everything they possibly can to minimize the friction that's inherent within our dual system of antitrust enforcement agencies. If they cannot or will not, then Congress must. But, as I've indicated before, this is inevitable. It's not going to work. It's not a question of if, but rather when we change the law and bring our--our country into the 21st century--bring our country at least into conformity with rules of logic and reason that say that you can't have the same subject matter covered by two separate competing federal agencies. </p><p>Senator Klobuchar will now deliver her opening statement. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Very good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it's good to see everyone here. We have been getting complaints about self-preferencing (INAUDIBLE) platforms for years, so I'm glad that you're having this hearing today.  </p><p>As you know--you and I have discussed this before--I'm a little less obsessed with this overlapping jurisdiction. What I want is action when it comes to some of this conduct. And I think that while it would be nice if everything was nicely divided, but my biggest concern is what's been going on across our country when it comes to consolidation and anticompetitive behavior. Having spent just a little bit of time traveling across the country-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--In the last year, I've gotten to--as has Senator Booker--I've been able to talk to a lot of people about their hopes and dreams, and about their concerns. And a lot of them have focused on that things are too big. They may not know the nuances of antitrust law or digital competition, but they feel that their costs have been going up, their wages are stagnated, and mostly, a number of them see this startup slump that's real, which is only going to be, of course, potentially hurt even more by the epidemic that we're dealing with with the coronavirus.  </p><p>But we have seen a 30 percent reduction in new startups in this country. Americans know intuitively that competition is key to the health of our markets, the future of our economy, and their own prosperity. And they know that our country has a monopoly problem, which is what I think we should be focusing on. </p><p>We're living in a time when digital platforms have become intimately intertwined with the daily lives of millions of Americans. Many of us carry these platforms with us wherever we go. I was missing one phone today--only had one--and it was like Armageddon had occurred, so-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--I have it. All of us hear stories about how these companies are leveraging their scales--their financial resources with unparalleled access to users' data and market power when dealing with business partners and competitors. So, it makes sense to focus on the unique competition issues that these companies raise.  </p><p>The major digital platforms are complex businesses. We all know that. That's part of the reason I want to see more money to the FTC and--as well as the DOJ department dealing with antitrust. And Senator Grassley and I have a bill that would help us fund them at a higher level because they need to be as sophisticated as some of the deals that are coming before them, which is a very hard thing to do.  </p><p>These companies don't just operate their platforms, they also provide other products and services through their platforms in competition with third-party providers. For example, Google's inter--t--net search platform provides access to its mapping services--Google Map --online video website--YouTube--and reviews for local businesses. Apple's App Store allows users to access third-party apps, as well as Apple's own apps, such as Apple Music and Apple Arcade. Those are just a few examples.  </p><p>Self-preferencing occurs when the platform operator leverages its market power to advantage its own products and services over those of third-party competitors that also use the platform. There are numerous ways that a platform can do this. It can elevate its own products on a search result page. I remember you, Senator Lee, many, many years ago, showing what your concerns about that--with regard to one of the platforms.  </p><p>It can build the platform's product into the platform itself so that customers will be less likely to look for, much less find, competing products. It can impose significant costs for third-party competitors to access customers through the platform, harming their ability to compete on the basis of price. It can use the platform's privilege access to customer and competitor data to have an advantage over rivals. And it can degrade access to competing products through the platform so that customers have a more difficult time accessing the products of third-party competitors.  </p><p>Depending on the circumstances, these types of practices can have a devastating effect on competition. Some point to the example of adding a flashlight app into a smartphone operating system, a type of self-preferencing that may not be good for the business of flashlight app developers, but the end result might be a better experience for consumers. But this type of reasoning can be taken too far and is often used to justify more problematic behavior. </p><p>S--now, as far as what we do about it. Some of our witnesses--you, Ms. Hubbard--have advocated imposing a rule that would prohibit platform operators from competing with users of their platforms to completely remove the incentive and ability to self-preference. Others, such as Mr. Kimmelman, have proposed empowering a digital sector regulator to impose duties of nondiscrimination on dominant digital platforms to prevent harmful self-preferencing.  </p><p>I look forward to hearing more detail on these proposals. I think we have to do something, and my focus today is also on improving enforcement against anticompetitive exclusionary conduct, and I don't just mean problematic self-preferencing by big tech companies, I mean anticompetitive conduct in every sector of the economy. That is why, today, I am introducing the Anticompetitive Exclusionary Conduct Prevention Act. We need a better acromyn--acronym-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--With Senators Blumenthal and Booker. I'm pleased that they--we have worked together on this bill. The legislation would reinvigorate enforcement against anticompetitive conduct and enable enforcers to protect competition across our entire economy. The bill prohibits exclusionary conduct--which is what we're talking about here--that presents a \"appreciable risk of harming competition.\"  </p><p>For firms that are engaging in exclusionary conduct in markets in which they have market power, the bill shifts the burden to those dominant firms to prove that their exclusionary conduct does not risk harming competition. In addition, the bill imposes substantial civil penalties for violations while allowing for injunctive relief, and it sets aside the most problematic aspects of recent Supreme Court antitrust caselaw.  </p><p>Competition analysis will always involve uncertainty, but if we are serious about preserving competitive markets, we need laws that err on the side of protecting competition--laws that keep up with our times. And we have done nothing to keep up with all these new developments in tech, as well as other industries. Whether it's potential anticompetitive self-preferencing by a digital platform or other types of exclusionary conduct in pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, agriculture, transportation, or other industries, this legislation will give enforcers important legal tools they need to crack down on anticompetitive conduct.  </p><p>I look he--forward to hearing from the witnesses. Thank you, Senator Lee. </p><p>LEE: Thanks, Senator Klobuchar. We're going to turn to our witnesses now and I'll introduce them each. Gene Kimmelman is a senior advisor at Public Knowledge, having previously served as president and CEO of Public Knowledge. Earlier in his career, Mr. Kimmelman served as the staff director and chief counsel to this committee, the--the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee. He is a graduate of Brown University and holds a JD from the University of Virginia.  </p><p>Sally Hubbard is the director of Enforcement Strategy at the Open Markets Institute. Ms. Hubbard previously served as an assistant attorney general of the Antitrust Bureau of New York State and as an investigative reporter f--for the Capitol Forum. Ms. Hubbard holds a bachelor's degree from the College of William and Mary and a law degree from New York University School of Law.  </p><p>Thomas Hazlett holds the M.H. (PH) Macaulay Endowed Chair in Economics at Clemson where he conducts research in the field of law and economics, specializing in the information economy. Professor Hazlett previously served as chief economist of the Federal Communications Commission. He holds a PhD in economics from UCLA.   </p><p>Morgan Reed is the president of ACT | The App Association, which represents more than 5,000 app makers and connected-device companies in the mobile economy. Mr. Reed leads the organization's advocacy and strategy on behalf of small- to medium-sized businesses on policy issues, including innovation.

Mr. Lowe holds a bachelor's degree in government from the College of William and Mary. </p><p>Before we begin, I'd like to swear in our witnesses. If you'd all raise your right hand. Do you swear that the testimony that you're about to give to the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? </p><p>UNKNOWN: I do. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Mr. Kimmelman, we'll begin with you and then we'll continue with your opening statements in the order in which you were introduced. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Klobuchar, members of the subcommittee. We appreciate, on behalf of public knowledge, the opportunity to appear here today. Now, we've all grown up and seen companies grow and explode across markets and think they're about to take over the world. And, yet, they quickly get taken down a notch or two, or completely, by a new entrance in the market. Not a new phenomenon.  </p><p>But what's happening with the dominant digital platforms is that, as Google has grown in search as Facebook has grown in social networking, we're not getting the market entry. We're not getting the big challengers to take them down over numerous years of growth in this market. Now, that provides convenience--that provides one-stop shopping--but it's extremely dangerous for our long-term economic interests to have barriers to entry stand in the way of competition. Entry is what drives innovation and quality improvements--better quality par--products and services--and we need to do something about that. </p><p>A recent interim report from the United Kingdom's Competition Authority raises even greater concerns by showing that Google and Facebook not only are entrenched in these markets but are growing their power in the digital advertising market. Facebook in one portion of it, Google across a number of the elements of digital advertising. What that Competition Authority report signals is that this power may be fueled by leveraging and self-preferencing to exclude rivals using tools like strategic acquisitions, restrictions on contracts, platform rules, and bundling of their services.  </p><p>So, this is why I think it's extremely important that our antitrust authorities look into these behaviors, determine whether they're a problem in the U.S. market, and take enforcement action if they--if they do. But that isn't the whole story. The Competition Authority and many other reports also have found that the natural economics of these market (PH) tend to drive toward a few players or even tip to monopoly without bad behavior. That--the network effects around these platforms--bringing everyone one together, economies of scale, the power of data to fuel their--their ability to serve consumers may be unmatched by others in the marketplace.  </p><p>So, this is an extremely difficult task for antitrust enforcers to sift through what is a natural market occurrence and what is bad behavior. And it's not made any easier by recent precedence in the courts that create additional burdens on enforcers to bring cases--to prove their cases--and require a--a level of demonstrable harm that is far beyond the predictive nature of what antitrust is supposed to do.  </p><p>So, what do we do? Do we just throw up our hands and say, we may have to live with monopoly? I suggest not. The legislation, Senator Klobuchar, that you and your colleagues, Senator Blumenthal and--and Booker, have introduced today would be a great first step to try to create new balances in antitrust enforcement, create new streamlined opportunities for enforcers to show their cases, give the companies the full opportunity to defend themselves, but go more directly after self-preferencing and related misconduct that may be moving us away from more competitive markets. </p><p>But, even with this, the fundamental economics of these markets keep driving us towards few players and potentially a monopoly. So, I think it's time for Congress to do something that it's done many times before and that is augment antitrust with pro-competition policies.  </p><p>Remember the breakup of old Ma Bell, the AT&amp;T monopoly? That didn't just explode competition overnight. You had an agency that required interconnection, interoperability, equal access so everyone could use these networks--companies could grow. It required portability of numbers, so we all could take our phone number from company to company. You had them require the protection of our personal data and, very importantly, the data of businesses that travel across that telecommunications platform. </p><p>And then, when you found the same problem with the cable industry blocking the growth of satellite competition, you stepped in and prohibited the cable companies from discriminating to favor themselves in the market. It's these kinds of interventions that we now need for digital platforms. So, I urge you to both press enforcement at the agencies, update the--the laws, but add new powers so that we have the right set of pro-competition tools to drive entry into these digital platform markets. Thank you. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Ms. Hubbard.  </p><p>HUBBARD: Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. The problem that we're gathered here to discuss today, digital platform self-preferencing, is fundamentally about the American dream. The American dream, as defined by Wikipedia, is the set of ideals, democracy, rights, liberty, opportunity, and equality in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, as well as an upward mobility for the family of children achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers. </p><p>Ours is not a society with few barriers when digital platforms pick the winners and losers of our economy, particularly when they pick themselves as the winners. Antitrust law aims to stop established companies from shutting out competitors. If entrepreneurs and businesspeople bring their hard work and the best products and services forward, an open and freely competitive market rewards them with prosperity and success.  </p><p>To their credit, the big platforms started on their paths to dominance with innovation, but they're each more than 20 years old and have dominated their arenas for more than a decade. Their enduring and expanding monopoly power has less and less to do with competition based on merit. Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook have reached their controlling positions in large part through hundreds of acquisitions, many of which were illegal under the Clayton Act. </p><p>Big tech's enduring dominance is also fueled by illegal monopolization that violates section Act--section 2 of the Sherman Act. The tech giants are each following Microsoft's playbook, using what I call platform privilege--the incentive and ability to favor their own goods and services over those of competitors that depend on their platforms.  </p><p>They often eliminate rivals rather than competing against them to be the best. Google picks itself as the winner in online search, digital advertising, mobile apps, video, reviews, travel, and maps, just to name a few. It used Android to exclude competition just like Microsoft used Windows.  </p><p>Amazon picks itself as the winner of commerce. Brands and retailers of all sizes have little choice but to sell on Amazon, which can peek inside their businesses, knock them out of the competition, and knock them off. The same problems plague Amazon webservices.  </p><p>Apple, too, picks the winners and loser of apps on iOS. It increasingly picks itself as the winner. Facebook and YouTube pick the winners and losers of information. Their business models give preferential treatment to divisive and incendiary content that gets a reaction out of their billions of users.  </p><p>Finding success through ingenuity, hard work, and innovation is the American dream, but illegally kicking competitors out of the game, stealing their innovations, and leveraging monopoly power to take over markets instead of competing--that's the American monopoly nightmare. Luckily, we have the solutions and we've overcome these same problems before. We should revive enforcement against exclusionary conduct, as the bill that--as Senator Klobuchar's (PH) proposes to do in her new bill. </p><p>But we also need to structurally eliminate the platform's conflicts of interests (PH) and remove their incentive and ability to self-preference. Otherwise, enforcers will lose at a game of whack-a-mole. As Lina Khan has written, the U.S. has used structural separation as a standard regulatory tool and antitrust remedy in industries like banking, railroads, TV networks, and telecommunications.  </p><p>Lawmakers should also require the platforms to ocra--offer equal access on equal terms to all, just as we've done throughout our history with--to the telegraph, railroads, buses, airlines, pipelines, hotels to name a few. Otherwise, the platforms will still control the competitive playing field and extract tolls from companies that must use their infrastructure.  Further, lawmakers should open up the gates of competition for innovative challengers through interoperability, data regulation, and by blocking mergers that fortify monopoly power.  </p><p>Our economy, businesses small and large, and consumers would all benefit from immediate action. Consumers benefit from the choice, innovation, and quality that robust competition brings. Consumers are also citizens who benefit from the free flow of speech. They are the employees of companies that benefit from platform extraction seizes, and they are the entrepreneurs who deserve a shot at the American dream. Thank you very much. </p><p>LEE: Professor Hazlett. </p><p>HAZLETT: Thanks very much for inviting me to join you at today's hearing and it's nice to be here during March Madness, which may take on new meanings this March. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>My name is Thomas Hazlett. I teach economics at Clemson University. Economists have long wondered about the degree to which firms specialize. A producer of automobiles may decide to produce engines but buy the steel inputs from other companies. Tesla, for example, produces both electric vehicles and the batteries that power them, attempting to exploit complementarities that it hopes will allow it to dominate the car market one day, and maybe much more. </p><p>This form of coordination across product markets is extremely common--some might call it ubiquitous--but, of course, it is not without controversy. Economists consider a range of possibilities, including that vertical integration may foreclose rivalry, lessening competition. The general empirical conclusion, however, is that scope-and-scale economies prove efficient, promoting consumer welfare even as there are exceptions to the rule. This set of observations motivates U.S. antitrust law.  </p><p>Horizontal price coordination is anticompetitive, per say, while vertical coordination is governed under a rule of reason. In the recent case of U.S. versus AT&amp;T, the government sought to block a vertical merger--AT&amp;T distributing video programming--purchasing Time Warner, which produces it--and look for evidence to sep--separate an efficiency motivation from an anticompetitive goal in the event the evidence was not found, and the federal court rejected the Department of Justice argument, allowing the merger to proceed. </p><p>This is not a unique outcome. Digital platforms from iTunes and music to Google and search, Netflix and movies and video to Facebook and social media, Microsoft and computer platforms, Amazon and ecommerce, AOL and antitru--and--and int--internet access require risky investments that ultimately depend on the creation of a complex ecosystem for success, and vertical integration commonly assists. I'd like to point out just three quick historical examples of how this works. </p><p>First--and--and I'll take the three A's--Amazon, Apple, and AOL. Amazon developed as an online bookseller, but integrated into countless other product lines, leveraging its ability with its initial platform. Competing with eBay and other online competitors, it has created wide and deep efficiencies. While accused of excluding independent vendors, it has consistently expanded its appeal to third-party sellers who now dominate the platform, which was the reverse of when Amazon started--almost completely Amazon-provided product. This accounts for Amazon's great market success.  </p><p>In this, it is always attempting to vertically integrate and to complete with a nonintegrated or less integrated rival, eBay. The business model competition between them improves consumer welfare. Apple has long relied on vertical integration and its quest for competitive superiority. This nearly bankrupted the company in the 1990s. But, in 2003, it rescued the chaos in the digital music market with its great innovation, iTunes, overcoming viruses, spyware, and illegal copyright infringement issues that had plagued the early internet ma--with a Mad Max dystopia.  </p><p>Users got happy and artists got paid, yet the vertical links between iTunes and Apple's iPod, exclusively configured to create a curated ecosystem, drew the ire of EU antitrust authorities. The authorities were wrong to see iTunes/iPod as suspect. It was a great leap forward.  </p><p>AOL pioneered the mass market in internet service in the 1990s, attracting 20 million users to online services, providing not only access but a walled garden of proprietary content. The investments in original programming complimented the easy-to-use approach to ISP subscriptions. As the rise of alternative models developed, including for AOL itself, with unrestricted access to the open internet, this evolved into something quite different. It was a great inovat--i--i--innovation along the way to what we perceive as the internet today. </p><p>In short, entrepreneurial firms disrupting markets often supply multiple levers of the innovation stack. Categorically suppressing such activity in the prod--in the production of compliments is highly likely to reduce competition, suppress innovation, and harm consumers--perverse outcomes reducing economic growth. Thank you very much. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Reed. </p><p>REED: Good morning, Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, and members of the committee. Thank you for this hearing and an opportunity to hear from the voice of small business. The app economy in America is thriving. It has grown from virtually nonexistent in 2007 to $1.3 trillion dollars today. It has created 5.9 million jobs and is revolutionizing tradition industry verticals, making everything from agriculture to healthcare better and smarter.  </p><p>My written testimony contains facts and figures that help to define the breadth and scope of the app ecosystem and how platforms have benefited my community. But more importantly, senators, there are nearly a dozen developers from around America sitting behind me right now, including Vemos from the Twin Cities in Minnesota and our friends at Topic from St. Louis. They all are companies that have benefited from the explosion of platforms like the Apple App Store, Google Play, Amazon Webservices, and Microsoft Azure.  </p><p>And do you know who else benefited? Consumers. Here on the table, I have a copy of OmniPage Pro. In 2005, this was the software you bought if you needed to scan documents. Its price? $450 dollars. In this hand, I have an app called Readdle Scanner Pro for my phone. Almost all the same features, and the price for it? $6 dollars. 1 percent of the old price. And what's more interesting for this hearing, there are dozens of competitors to Readdle's platform.  </p><p>How have platforms made this radical change possible? Simply put, they've provided three things--a trusted space, they've reduced our overhead, and they've given us nearly instant access to a global marketplace with billions of customers. Before the platforms, to get software on a store shelf, companies had to spend years and thousands of dollars just to get to the point where a distributor would agree to handle your product. And, if you chose to go it alone, then you needed to print boxes, manuals, CDs, process credit cards. If you wanted to sell abroad, you needed to pay for translatiors--translators and customs agents.  </p><p>In the 1990s, it cost at least a million dollars to start up a software company. Now, it's about $100K and sweat equity. And, thanks to these changes, the average cost for a consumer software has dropped from $50 dollars to $3. For developers, our path to market is a hundred times faster. Our costs to market have dropped enormously and the size of our market has expanded globally.  </p><p>But, are there bumps along this yellow-brick road? Absolutely. This hearing is focused on harmful self-preferencing. In some cases, by the very same platforms that I was just lauding. And it should be monitored by both Congress and the relevant teams at DOJ and the FTC because we need to ensure that we prevent self-preferencing that harms competition and, Senator Lee, I would say harms consumers.  </p><p>To be clear, my members are not scared of competing with apps made by the platform. A quick look through today's major app stores finds the following apps either built in or part of the platform's offering. Stock market trackers, calculators, alarm clocks, mail, video editing, music editing for your dubstep needs, voice memos, cloud services, movie trailer apps, and much more. In each one of these categories, I have members that are successful and thriving.  </p><p>There's another form of self-preferencing we actually depend on, like preinstalled software to make sure the camera works, that music and sounds play, and that the web is accessible. At this point, the app stores--that's my domain--give the smallest of my members the same amount of space on the screen, the same terms of service, and the same rules of the road. That's an important value and one we hope to see maintained.  </p><p>A world where government requires platforms to preference bigger developers actually hurts us. Platforms need to improve in important ways. One area where platforms have fallen w--woefully short is transparency. Platforms need to communicate with our developers on their guidelines and any changes they make to them. Clearly, they need to explain to us what they mean for us as developers.  </p><p>Another is safety and security. Some platforms have control over device security and--and others don't, but all of them should strive for security practices that protect everyone who uses the platform. And, lastly, platforms have a role to play in removing pirated apps. Platforms should diligently respond to even the smallest developer where the centerpiece of their business--our intellectual property--is stolen by someone else.  </p><p>We're not here today asking for an antitrust complaint or a change to antitrust law to resolve these issues. Antitrust cases tend to lock everyone in place while a snapshart (PH) as (PH) the market is scrutinized. Companies tend to role up their drawbridge and close the castle around their data when an antitrust threat is--is moved forward. </p><p>Right now, platforms are competing for our business, and this is an adi--ideal state of affairs and a sign that competition is alive and well in the app economy. As long as platforms are working to outdo one another, developers and consumers will benefit from the innovations that result. What we can't afford is for platforms that engage in harmful or even deceptive self-preferencing. Thank you, again, for the opportunity to participate and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Lowe. </p><p>LOWE: Good morning, Chairman Lee, Ranking Senator Klobuchar. My name is Luther Lowe. I'm the senior vice president of public policy for Yelp. I'm here today on behalf of Yelp's CEO and cofounder, Jeremy Stoppelman, who unfortunately had to stay in San Francisco and manage our company's response to the coronavirus outbreak. We appreciate the subcommittee permitting us to have a presence in light of these extraordinary circumstances.  </p><p>Yelp exists to empower and protect consumers. The service allows people to share detailed and passionate ratings and reviews about local business. In turn, local businesses providing exceptional service can establish and promote themselves online.  </p><p>A common way Yelp is first accessed is when users discover the service through a gur--Google search result. This story is true of millions of websites and apps. Google was the original gateway to the web. I'm here today to speak about how Google betrayed the web through its self-preferencing and how this conduct both stifles competition and directly harms consumers. </p><p>Today, when a mom does a search for a pediatrician in Salt Lake City on Google, instead of being matched with the best information from across the web, she's unwittingly steered into an objectively lower quality set of information hosted on Google's secondary pages. Local searches like this are the most common type of search on Google. Americans encounter this form of deceptive self-preferencing on Google at least a billion times a week. </p><p>Google once touted itself as a turnstile to the internet, an intermediate step before users arrived at their ultimate destinations on the web. Just before Google's IPO, Larry Page was--the co-founder was asked what he thought about walled gardens and portals of the earlier internet. Page said, \"At Google we take the opposite approach of the walled gardens. We want to get you out of Google into the right place as fast as possible. In fact, that's the whole point.\"  </p><p>Google's approach made it the engine that oxygenated the web, as we once knew it, and unlocked incredible investment in innovation. It's, in fact, difficult to decouple the rise of Google the turnstile from the rise of Web 2.0, the term Tim O'Reilly popularized, which describes the rise of social and longform user-generated content services like Wikipedia.  </p><p>In roughly the first decade of its existence, Google was the anti-self-preferencing agent of the Internet. It served as an unbiased and impartial matchmaker sitting between consumers and all the web had to offer. Google grew on this promise of a web-shaped Google, but instead, we got a Google-shaped web, to everybody's de--detriment.  </p><p>Google search results used to contain only two types of information--the organic ten blue links and ads. Around 2007, it rolled out a new category of information--answer boxes, which lived above the ten blue links. Sometimes bypassing information's source from the web to populate an answer box made sense, like when a user searches for 2 plus 2, showing a 4.  </p><p>But it became clear that in serving answers for local search results like auto mechanic Minneapolis, the strategy was designed to hobble competition while providing a veneer of consumer benefit. This isn't purely speculative. A leak of internal company documents to The Wall Street Journal in 2015 showed Google developed an algorithm that ran alongside its primary organic algorithm to observe the ten blue links results and inject Google's house products above the organic results when services like Trip---Trip Advisor or Yelp appeared in those ten blue links. In other words, the algorithm functioned effectively as, if Yelp's the best result, then show Google instead.  </p><p>The Wall Street Journal story left many puzzled as to why the FTC chose not to prosecute such flagrant self-preferencing at the expense of consumers and competition. Regardless of how one may have felt at the time, today it's probably safe to say the FTC's decision in early 2013 to end its 18-month investigation into Google's conduct instead of taking meaningful action has not aged well.  </p><p>Google's deceptive self-preferencing, especially in the local search market, is creating clear anticompetitive effects. Consumers are paying the price. Ending Google's abusive local search practices will not only result in a better experience for consumers and small businesses, it will erode Google's dominant control over the way people find and connect to information online. </p><p>We faced challenges like this before, and antitrust law and policy is proven up to the task. The efforts of this subcommittee and enforcement bodies across the globe to reign in Google's self-preferencing and restore real competition to local search are paramount. Thank you, once more, for the opportunity to testify. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. I'm going to reverse our ordinary order. Senator Klobuchar has duties as the ranking democrat on another committee where she'll need to go in a moment. So, gonna have her do her round of questioning before she has to leave. Senator Klobuchar. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, I want to thank you, Senator Lee, for your kindness. This is the Rules Committee. We have a FEC issue and Senator McConnell himself is going to be there, and I have a feeling they're not gonna wait for me, so I want to--I'm gonna try to come back for a second round.  </p><p>Enforcement of the section 2 of the Sherman Act, which--as we know--allows monopolization--Mr. Kimmelman--and attempts to monopolize against exclusionary conduct in the tech ind--sector and in other industries, has been relatively rare. We don't see a lot of enforcement. People have been complaining--as we know--about--for good reason--about self-preferencing by digital platforms for years, but we haven't seen any big increase in enforcement.  </p><p>As a practical matter, I think part of this is because the courts have basically rendered that section of the antitrust laws toothless. Do you agree that it has been ineffective? Why do you think that is? Would this legislation help? </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Thank you, Senator-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --And I'd ask you-- </p><p>KIMMELMAN: --Klobu-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --The same thing, Ms. Hubbard. </p><p>HUBBARD: Thank you. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Senator Klobuchar (PH), I hope it isn't toothless. It was what was used in the Microsoft case, so it should be alive and well. But, as you point out, the--the courts are very demanding in terms of finding monopoly power and precise levels of evidence of competitive harm in an area that usually is much more predictive than precise. So, there are extreme hurdles for prosecution in this area, especially in highly dynamic and complicated markets. </p><p>So, I think your legislation, most importantly, shifts to the appreciable risk standard and the presumption with 50 percent market share and above to lower the burden of what the prosecutor has to bring before the court, and then give the defendant the opportunity to rebut that and demonstrate that they're not monopolizing or seeking to expand their monopoly position. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Very good. Ms. Hubbard. </p><p>HUBBARD: Part of the problem with Sherman Act, section 2 is the bad case saw (PH) that's made it more difficult for enforcers to bring their--to win their cases, but another big part is a lack of political will to bring those cases. That's-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Mm-hmm-- </p><p>HUBBARD: --The other part of the story. And, you know, obviously the (INAUDIBLE) of whether you can win in court effects whether you bring a case, but enforcers need to be more willing to take a risk and try to evolve the caselaw in the right direction. Caselaw is to--is meant to evolve, not stay fixed forever in one spot. So, by bringing strong cases, they could start to push the law in the fight direction. </p><p>However, I do think Congress has a role to play in speeding up that process, helping to overcome some of the difficult precedent. And, so, your bill is a step in the right direction in that way. I think Congress should aim to remove the complexity and make antitrust cases easier, faster, and cheaper so that they can be properly enforced. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Very good. And I know, Mr. Lowe, you believe that some of the complaints that Yelp has against Google could be addressed by current law. Would it be helpful to also have additional legislation? </p><p>LOWE: Yes, Senator. I think--while we believe that the existing framework--a case could be brought today. In fact, as it relates to local search in Google, the evidence is very strong and I think a U.S. verse (PH) Microsoft's (PH) style case could be brought, we support the use of any new tools that help empower enforcers to bring these cases. And I agree with a lot of the earlier remarks made about ju-- there's just a culture of--of underenforcement of--and, so, we would, I believe, support that. We want to study the legislation more closely, but-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Uh-huh-- </p><p>LOWE: --We're--we really appreciate your leadership on that. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. So, the way I look at this is you've got more enforcement and some of this could be with additional resources than I raised. You've got the idea of trying to change the laws--the antitrust laws to give more tools. And then, the third thing, would be some of the ideas that either of you have raised.  </p><p>And I wondered if you could articulate those, explain them a little more, so--additional things with the digital platform regulator and the like. And then I--one other thing I've been thinking is, as the European Union and Great Britain is looking at doing their own--and they've done a lot of work in this area--do you think we should be concerned--I ask the two of you--if we don't consider regulation that other countries are going to set the global standards? And it seems to me that we should be--not only do we have these leading companies, we should also be leading on how to make sure we still preserve competition. You want to comment that and then your ideas in my remaining time? </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Thanks a lot, Senator-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Yeah-- </p><p>KIMMELMAN: --Klobuchar. That's a lot. I certainly think you shouldn't defer to the Europeans. They can make good decisions, but they can make bad decisions, and they shouldn't be defining where our law goes. There's plenty of opportunity to take those issues on--head on in this country and we sh--and we should do that.  </p><p>On the issue of--of monopolization, I think the problem here--the reason I raised the idea of additional tools to promote competition is because you have these enormous networks. And however they got to that point--they have enormous power, they have the benefit of troves of data that are impossible for anyone else to come--pull together--entry directly against them requires enormous scale and it just isn't happening. The most likely way that competition will develop is through the compliments that Professor Hazlett mentioned before--that sometimes those additional services--extremely valuable--can grow to be alternatives. </p><p>What if your voice assistant could actually compete all the way across search? What if travel services, or financial services, or local search can growed (PH) and combine through contract with others to actually take on the dominant player? I think, besides antitrust enforcement, what would be useful is requiring that people can move their data around with data protections, that they can interoperate across platforms.  </p><p>Senator Hawley has a bill with Senator Warner that gets at that--that point. The idea is to make sure that those enormous economies that we benefit from in efficiency can be shared across the platform so more players can compete head to head. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Very good. And Ms. Hubbard, you have some unique ideas as well-- </p><p>HUBBARD: --Right-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --On this front. </p><p>HUBBARD: So, I agree with Gene that we should not see leadership on these issues to other countries. These are our companies and they're a huge part of our economy, and we need to take a leadership role. I think that structural separation is a more effective way than going after every individual instance of self-preferencing, and that's because there are limitless ways that these companies can self-preference.  </p><p>It's almost not administrable from an enforcement and a regulatory perspective to monitor every possible way that this is happening. And, actually, but structurally separating and m--eliminating those conflicts of interest, government w--could actually have less of a h--a hands-on role in monitoring the day to day of these businesses. So, I think that's more administrable--more effective--and that will open up competition more effectively. </p><p>In addition to antitrust, I think we need to have stronger privacy regulation so that we can--because d--because the data is such a source of dominance. So, privacy regulation would help with that side--that aspect of the--of fortifying the monopoly power. Stronger merger enforcement, as well a--as going against the conduct because we have the acquisition of competitive threats that's fortifying the monopoly power. And, also, interoperability as Gene mentioned, and a neutrality nondiscrimination standard. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay, thank you very much. I think Mr. Blumenthal is gonna move over here and I may return, but I want to thank all of you. This is--more to come on this and we're glad we are able to introduce the legislation today. </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Professor Hazlett, I'd like to start with you. There's some who have recommended that Congress enact legislation that would sort of shift the burden in this area, on that would effectively place the burden on platforms to demonstrate that their conduct is, in fact, procompetitive. In other words, rather than requiring the government to show that a platform's conduct is anticompetitive, the company would have to demonstrate that its actions are not problematic. What do you think of this approach? </p><p>HAZLETT: Thank, Chairman Lee, for the--for the question. Yes, and that's really the key because we do have--in terms of the burden of proof--we do have law. We do have a rule of reason right now in the courts. And, in fact, the regulatory agencies--the expert agencies--participate fully in that. Sometimes they bring cases. They can contribute to the cases and so forth.  </p><p>And the fact is that shifting the burden is suggested here in fers--in terms of s--structural separation and so forth, and--and in terms of the legal standard, because efficient integration is ubiquitous. It's--it's all over the place. It's very complicated to separate the few cases that would be anticompetitive, but that speaks to the idea that you want the default to be competition amongst business models, many of which are highly, vertically integrated.  </p><p>Take, for example--Gene Kimmelman mentioned correctly that the section 2 Sherman Act has been used to litigate agai--the antitrust case of the century--I guess that was last century--the--the antitr--trust case filed in '98 against Microsoft. And, in fact, the government won that case, but i--it was not a good case. It--it--it--it actually did not achieve the competition that the theory of the case promoted.  </p><p>The--the--the--the Netscape browser did not develop with job (PH) of programming into a competing operating system. And, in fact, the--the browser market remained dominated--over 80 percent--by Microsoft for 10 years. What ended up happening in that case is that there was integration by other companies that entered that market and took away that dominance--specifically, Google integrating from search to Gmail to Chrome--the--the--the browser system--an--along with--w--with--w--with--w--with other companies that--that--that were competing in--in--in that integrated fashion. And, in--in particular, Apple that--that not only got a big boost with the smartphone revolution, which it pioneered with--with iPhone, but with Safari coming in as--as a competing browser, and iOS in the mobile space.  </p><p>And this has made that--that world very competitive, and it owes to vertical integration and what some people would call self-prefacing (PH). That is--there is a dynamic to firms creating platforms that i--i--indeed allow lots of partners to come into the marketplace with them in an ecosystem and uproot the alternatives. And sometimes those alternatives are incumbents and sometimes they are other competitors or other incumbents, or entrants into the market.  </p><p>You don't want to hamstring through structural restrictions--competition to the approved members of the group. And I--I just--I throw out as--as an example of that the long history of common carrier regulation on AT&amp;T that was very anticompetitive through law and was, in fact, attacked in nineteen seventy throw--four through the other antitrust case of the century, U.S. versus AT&amp;T. </p><p>LEE: Thank you to--I--I want to turn to Mr. Reed on this. And, Mr. Reed, I--in addition to other comments you may want to add to what Professor Hazlett said, I'd love to get your commentary on how vertical integration among tech--tech f--platforms and self-preferencing within them specifically might have effected, in some ways for the better, your member companies and especially consumers. </p><p>REED: Well, I actually want to follow up with something that Professor Hazlett and Ms. Hubbard said, which really kind of worried me. She said, well--she said that if we do it in the way of shifting the burden then government can have a handle of what companies are doing, and if there's a motto that we find in our industry, it's that nobody wants technology at the speed of government. And the idea that we would be--the speed of innovation that helps consumers would actually be put on a regulator that we now see how it goes forward--I would say is devastating to the innovative path. We know that.  </p><p>When a large company with deep pockets gets told by a regulator not to do certain things, they build walls. They don't build bridges. They take that capital and they use it to market to people, and they use it in a way that helps them preserve everything that they have, and their innovation slows. What my colleague, Mr. Luther, was saying I thought was--with--Mr. Lowe was saying, which was interesting, is he was talking about deceptive self-preferencing where their actions are not transparent and not clear. That's something that we--that we see as often harmful.  </p><p>But you asked a really important question. How does self-preferencing is (PH) actually benefit us. And I--I talked about one really easy example, but I want to explain. Camera, right? You have a phone.  </p><p>It's ostensibly a phone, although my 14-year-old has never actually made a call on her phone, so she doesn't think of it as a phone. She thinks it of (PH) as a digital communications device. But if I said to her, why don't we have a camera? She'd say, no, I have a camera. It's on my phone.  </p><p>Now, that you all use for taking pictures and posting it to Insta and doing selfies, but my members actually take the software that underpins that camera and design things to take a picture of this room to measure the distances, maybe allow you to superimpose a different color on your cabinets if somebody wants to do a kitchen refor--refurb. Well, we use features on the phone capability to do QR readers. We use photo--photo capability to do reading of images for medical devices.  </p><p>So, the software that is \"self-preferenced\" on the device is absolutely critical for us building niche or specialized products that do the unexpected. Apple is building a product that has a nice camera. We do the unexpected and take it into a place that no one's ever thought of before--to take a product consumers didn't even know they needed, but now desperately love. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Mr. Kimmelman, I w--I want to turn back to you for a minute. I'm interested in--in what you say in your ristro--written testimony, particularly with regard to Google. I believe it's at pages 9 through 10 in your written testimony when you talk about Google's use of self-preferencing in the ad exchange. Can you briefly summarize your concerns here and e--and explain how the alleged anticompetitive conduct might translate into consumer harm? </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Y--yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. W--what we're seeing as Google grows in the digital advertising market--it has a number of important tools of power in its arsenal f--great services that it provides. It--it does search, and it does display advertising on--on a banner advertising on search. It has YouTube, an enormously attractive video service.  </p><p>In the ad market, you--Google has gained a very powerful position in the tools used by advertisers to go into the exchange and auction to get placement of their ads, and for the publishers--the content companies that need to get advertisers placed in their cont--ye--on their--on their--on their services. And that exchange is then also a very important part of--of that business is run by Google. And they have analytics. They have tools. They appear to be requiring a lot of the players who want to participate in advertising on YouTube to use their tools and services.  </p><p>Now, when you have these benefits working for you, that may be fine. There may be some self-preferencing that isn't dangerous. But the difficulty here is they have the analytics. If you want to understand the placement of your advertising, if the quality is right, if the price is right--if you're the content company and you want to make sure you're getting a fair price for your content, it appears increasingly they're all dependent on Google. I don't think that's a healthy environment. </p><p>LEE: It sounds like it might be an interesting topic for a future hearing in and of itself. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Absolutely. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Okay. We're now going to go--since Senator Klobuchar and I have switched order, I'm told that the appropriate protocol is for us to go next to Senator Hawley and then we'll go to Senator Blumenthal.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here. Mr. Kimmelman let me just start with you. I--I think that the points you make both in your oral testimony today and your written testimony about the need to think beyond traditional antitrust tools--not that we shouldn't use those, which I applaud and indeed I, today, sent a letter with Senator Blumenthal and--and others urging DOJ to take a hard look at Google Search--but to augment those tools--and, Ms. Hubbard, you made the same point I think--to--with more pro-competition policy, I completely agree with--including the need for a data--an agency that is focused on these issues.  </p><p>I think that's what the FDC ought to be doing with its time, rather than engaging in these turf battles that Senator Lee mentioned at the--at the beginning, which is a complete waste of time, and actually slows down antitrust enforcement. So, we ought to speed up antitrust enforcement. We also ought to get the FDC, I think, focused--to give them the requisite authorities to get focused on things like data, interoperability, as you've been saying, on privacy protections, as you said, Ms. Hubbard. I think that every consumer ought to have the right to--to get their--all their data back from these tech companies.  </p><p>And I also think we ought to look at--we need to seriously consider about how we compensate consumers for their data because both of you have spoken to the network effects--the big data effects. Of course, that depends on data in the aggregate. Consumers--that's consumers' data, ultimately, and it's being taken from them.  </p><p>They have no say in it. It's being sold without their permission. That's a huge problem, I think, from (PH) people who believe in property, as I do, and--and data is property. So, there's lots to think about there. Thank you for your--your testimony and I think all of that is--is very well placed. </p><p>On the--on the issue of--of self-dealing, self-bias, and self-preference, it seems to me there's a little bit of a strawman here--this argument that we have to accept either no product integration as all or total self-preferencing and self-bias. This just seems to me to be not actually true. To me, the key distinction is between productive integration of services, on the one hand, and predatory exploitation, by mature platforms. Like for instance, one might argue that Google, is doing. And, Mr. Reed, you know, you've made the point, taking Apple as an example, that the Apple iPhone, particularly when it was first introduced, was introduced as an integrated device, that seems to of been a healthy development. </p><p>It created an ecosystem that other app developers could use. And now indeed, we're told, it's reported, that the next iOS will actually allow other app developers, system-level access, to their own functionality. Which--which, you know, seems like an all in all, a very good thing. Contrast that with Amazon, for instance, which in order to--which--which gives third-parties, other sellers, access to its platform. But then Amazon uses its own tools to track their sales and then to deliberately undercut them. That seems qualitatively different to me. </p><p>Or Google, for example. So, let's just talk for a second about Google. We know that Google sometimes creates its own content, but often, it just leverages its market position, to take the content of other people. Now Google maintains that it's search engine, simply returns, and I'm going to quote now, \"the most relevant, useful, results\". That's what they say that they're doing. </p><p>Mr. Lowe, let me just ask you, is that your understanding of how Google search, actually operates? That it merely returns the most relevant, useful, results? </p><p>LOWE: Thank you for the question, Senator. The answer is it depends. I think, you know, when Google originally started, roughly the first decade of its existence, it was powered by this sort of page rank, quality score style, algorithm. And then, around 2007, introduced Answer Boxes, which are physically above the page. And, there may be instances where, kind of commodity style information, makes sense to put in that box, like a sports score or weather or the sum of 2+2. </p><p>But when you're talking about, you know, the--what is the best pediatrician, in St. Louis? It probably makes sense to scour the whole web, and source that information. And today, that process is not being done for the most common area of search. </p><p>HAWLEY: It--tell us why Google's local content now, tends to show--its own local content, tends to show up, at the top of Google results. That was not always the case. Can you explain to us what changed? To your understanding, to your knowledge. </p><p>LOWE: Sure, I mean, the--in--in 2009, Google actually attempted to acquire Yelp. For a variety of reasons, we decided to stay independent.  And, this--this is--there is a little bit of a back story, where Google was actually taking Yelp content and displaying it, as if, it were its own. Thankfully, they're not doing that anymore. </p><p>But the problem today, for consumers, is that they have been habituated to assume that the stuff at a top of the--at the top of the Google page when they perform a local search, is the quote, unquote, \"best\". And, it is sourced from across the web. And, most are clicking into those boxes, especially, on smartphone devices, where the form factor is much smaller. So, you know, this is problematic, because they are seeing an objectively, lower quality, set of information. </p><p>HAWLEY: It--so, Google, if I've got this right, Google chose to de-index its local content, to take its reviews out of the normal use of content, ranked by its own algorithm, and then to privilege, its content, right? Automatically, at the top of search results, do I have that correct? </p><p>LOWE: That's correct, Senator. It's a bit technical, but basically, every website on the Internet if it wants to get--be discovered and crawled by search engines, like Google and even Bang and DuckDuck Go, creates a set of instructions on the--on robots.txt. Google has actually gone through its own robots.txt. And instructed the Google organic search engine or the--the organic algorithm, to not look at its own content. So, it actually, completely sidesteps this merit-based process, that every other website, on the web, has to go through. </p><p>HAWLEY: Which is funny, because we're always told that, the very value of Google, is its algorithmic relevance determinations. And, as it turns out, it's manipulating those, to privilege its own content. Now, when the FTC was looking into Google in 2012, this is interesting, it drafted a report, some of which later leaked. And, that report stated that Google created an 'if-then' coding statement. </p><p>So, Google instructed its own algorithm, that if the algorithm would return normally, a result from a competitor company, then the engine should instead, switch and preference Google products, Google associated pages, Google content, first. That doesn't seem neutral. I mean, would you say that it is, Mr. Lowe? </p><p>LOWE: That's correct, Senator. I--that is, exclusionary. And, it--it harms competition, but worse, it--it gives consumers, lower quality results, when they've come to expect, high-quality results. </p><p>HAWLEY: It gives consumers, lower quality results, it actively misleads consumers, who are told by Google, itself, that it returns always, the most relevant results. Whereas we know, again from the same FTC report, Google's internal document, said that Google's deter--Google's purpose was quote, \"to bias ourselves\". Which is, in fact, what they've done. </p><p>Now, this seems to me to be an example of self-biased, self-preference, that is hugely problematic. Not least because it is deliberately, misleading to consumers, and seems to lower consumer welfare. I mean, it does not seem to actually give consumers the most relevant results. So, the devil is in the details, I think.  </p><p>This is my point when it comes to self-preferencing, it's hard to evaluate this at a--at a generic level. You've got to look, case-by-case. But I think the idea that you either have to give up, you either can have integrated products or you can have rampant self-biased and self-preferencing, but you can't stop one, without the other. It just seems to me, to be a false choice. </p><p>The real question is, are we going to allow mature platforms and product lines, to exploit--to exploit and engage in exploitative practices, of competitors, in a way that harms consumers? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>LEE: Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thanks, Mr. Chairman and thank you, for having this hearing. Senator Hawley and I have indeed written today or this week, to the Department of Justice, urging that it ensure that the anti-trust probe include an examination of Google's practices on search, not just, online advertising. And, I agree completely with him, that the data that belongs to consumers, should be regarded, as their property. They should be protected and rewarded, when it is used and often misused, by these big companies. </p><p>And, the self-preferencing, that we're discussing today, is part of a larger picture, but would you agree, Mr. Lowe, that it's important that the Department of Justice probe, look into both online advertising, as well--the use of search, and, as well as, online advertising? </p><p>LOWE: Thank you, for the question, Senator. Yes. I, you know, I--I've read the same stories that you have, Senator, regarding the nature of the scope of the investigation. If they are to be believed, then our view would be that, that's simply too narrow. That you can't look at Standard Oil without looking at oil, and you can't look at Google without looking at search. The a--it's not to say that there are not perfectly valid theories of harm, in the ad Tech space, but we believe that it needs to be expansive, and search should be included. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And, I think what you have, what you're seeing, from this panel, is really an over-arching, a very vigorous feeling, that the current system isn't working, on big tech. I think it's bipartisan. I think it spans other ideological differences. Whether it is the need for change in the laws or the standards or stronger enforcement, consumers are at the mercy and often are harmed, by the current practices. Because they reinforce the bigness of big tech. And, in fact, increase the powers of big tech, over consumers, not in a good way. </p><p>And, you have been a frequent critic of Google. I'd like to know whether it's yourself or others, have you felt there has been retaliation, as a result of your criticism? </p><p>LOWE: Thank you, for the question, Senator. I know that in our case, you know, I wished Jeremy could be here today. And again, I apologize that he, our CEO, was not able to attend, but he is--has been, a bit of a canary in the coal mines, and fearless on these issues. And, you know, I'd like to think that by being vocal, it is in some ways, a signal to Google, that they are, you know, that by doing this, they know that we're--are willing to, make hay of it.  </p><p>And, are willing to raise, you know, raise it, with the antitrust authorities. But, I know dozens and dozens and dozens of CEOs, that are terrified of retaliation, and--and, I know that many who participate in the House Antitrust Subcommittee, who responded to questions, that want to stay confidential, many that are participating in the DOJ proceedings. So, the fear of retaliation is real, Senator. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I'm glad that you made that point. Because, as a former Attorney General and the United States attorney, I know that enforcement, is hampered, by not only the market power but also the threat of retaliation. And, it may be implicit, it may be disguised, it may be somewhat invisible, but it certainly prevents effective enforcement. And, it is more prevalent, than perhaps the public is aware, and I--I thank you, for your candor. </p><p>Without ascribing any specific conduct, to a specific company, as I know you are careful not to do. I want to ask a question of the panel, more generally, because we're talking about enforcement. Apparently, Attorney General Barr has taken control over the antitrust investigations ongoing into the big tech platforms.  </p><p>It's been reported that the Attorney General has centralized oversight over these cases, by giving them to a handful of political appointees, sidelining the current antitrust Attorney General, Assistant Attorney General. I understand that there is a feeling that there is a need, for his recusal, but I think--I'm concerned about the politicization, in the Department of Justice, under this administration, it's a cause for serious concern. </p><p>I've been speaking out about it, for some time. Not too long ago, the antitrust division announced an investigation into four automakers, because they struck an emissions deal, with the state of Florida. This investigation appeared to have absolutely, no basis, in antitrust law. And it looked very much, like retribution, from the Trump Administration, against these companies for working with California, to comply with higher fuel admission standards. And, lo and behold, in February, of this year, the Department of Justice, dropped the probe. </p><p>I'm concerned that political control over these investigations, is a harbinger, of a result, that fails to serve, the interests of consumers. Very simply, I know of no other precedent for a major investigation of this type, being centralized under the direct control, of the Attorney General. So, I'd like comments from the panel, on that point. Go ahead. </p><p>REED: Senator, I'll--give an example. I hesitate to use the word politicized, I would say that involvement in cases of the FTC, we've been outspoken supporters of the Federal Trade Commission's investigation of QUALCOMM, on the issue of standards-essential patents. For the first time ever, the DOJ weighed in on a case, where a bipartisan FTC had moved forward, on an issue.  </p><p>And, I think it's--it was incredibly disappointing, because standards are absolutely critical to our industry, and the DOJ, stepping in, was something that was unfortunate. And, it's an example of where look, let the FTC's case run its course, let the courts determine, and we--we'd--we'd relish not seeing the F--the DOJ, muddy the water. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Ms. Hubbard. </p><p>HUBBARD: I'd like to see more distance between, you know, the Attorney General, and antitrust enforcement, because the more antitrust enforcement is viewed, as politically motivated, the less legitimacy, it will have. So, even when the DOJ does the right thing, it is going to be tainted, and it is going to be questioned about, what were the motivations. So, I think it's best to house the enforcement, in the DOJ itself, and not with the Attorney General. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, as a former member of the New York Attorney General's office, you know well, that the credibility of these investigations, depends not just on the reality, but also the appearance. And, I agree with you, completely, that the appearance here, is one of political interference. Any other comments? </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Senator Blumenthal, in my time working at the antitrust division. This never happened. And, I don't think I ever experienced any political interference. I hope that you are wrong, as to what the motivation is, or how. But I--all I can say is that there is enormous skills in the antitrust division, whether it's in the economist and the attorneys, who investigate these cases, and--and decide what to bring forward. And, I certainly hope that, if the Attorney General is overseeing this, that he is fully utilizing all of those skills, as they should be used. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And, I should make clear, that I am not impugning the integrity of those dedicated professionals, that are--there are hundreds of them, maybe thousands, by this point, and I've worked with them, in fact, in the Microsoft case. I have great confidence in their ability, as well as, their honesty, but at the very least, the integrity of the Department of Justice is impugned, when the appearance is of, political interference. </p><p>And I just want to finish on this note, Mr. Hazlett, I was the--one of the Attorneys General, who helped to lead the Microsoft case. I recognize your questions about it. We won the case on the violations of law, but not on the remedies. Which I think, goes to what happened, but I think overall, I would be interested in your feeling and others, on the panel, whether there are lessons to be learned, from the Microsoft case? </p><p>HAZLETT: (OFF MIC) So, yes, thank you, Senator and congratulations--oops, the other way--yes, thank you. Congratulations, on winning that case. I think you were up against a worthy opponent, in court, and I thought they had a much better case than they presented, and I thought you did a very good job and obviously, won-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. </p><p>HAZLETT: --there was a DC circuit, overturn the structural separation, but the fact is, that there were great efficiencies in having Microsoft competing in the browser market. And, and--and that has played out. It has not played out because of the protocols that were opened up, so to speak, by the remedies that were adopted.  </p><p>And, and you--you have seen this entry, particularly by Google and Chrome, on the one side, which was vertical integration, by an upstart competitor, that was doing just fine, with search, on the Microsoft platform. And then on the other, you had a vertically integrated platform, in Apple.  </p><p>That really changed the world, with the smartphone revolution, and--and--and--and extended that vertical integration approach, that they've long had in computers, and then in iTunes, iPhone and so, this idea that there should be the structural separation, I have to say, here, it really looks like Microsoft was--was competing in a market that; I--I let me say if they had rules about what could go on the--what the computer makers could put, on the startup screen, on the computer.  </p><p>Netscape could be on there, but it couldn't have a bigger icon, then Microsoft. If they have excluded, all those other applications, I think you would've had, a much better case, and there would've been something there, but their--Netscape and some of those other applications, have done very well, on that platform. And, I think that that is something, that should be learned. </p><p>LEE: Senator Blackburn. </p><p>BLACKBURN: (OFF MIC) Well, thank you, sir. I was about to leave. I thought maybe we had missed something. I do have a couple of questions, that I wanted to get on the record, that we've had a lot of discussion, about the issue of privacy. And, I know you all are aware that, this year, I've led the Technology Task Force, here in the Judiciary Committee. And, one of the things we've looked at, is the issue of privacy and having a federal standard.  </p><p>So, as we--we talk about antitrust and DOJ and FTC and oversight and governance and what can be done with antitrust, I want you to talk about having a federal privacy standard, as a way to rein in, some of big tech's abuses. And, Mr. Kimmelman, Ms. Hubbard, I would address it to you. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Yes, thank you, Senator. I think it would be very wise, and our organization supports a strong federal privacy bill. But I would say, I wouldn't do it in isolation of consideration, of competition, because you don't want privacy to be a tool to favor one kind of company, versus another. We all need privacy protections, but it doesn't matter whether it's sale or first-party manipulation of the data, we need the same protections, across the board. </p><p>BLACKBURN: So, one set of rules, for the entire Internet ecosystem, with one regulator. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Yes, Senator. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. Ms. Hubbard? </p><p>HUBBARD: Yes, I think a strong privacy law would help address some of these issues because it could level the competitive playing field. A lot of the sources of dominance are the data acquisition, and the refusal to share data with--with competitors, but that's why, like, I agree with Gene, you need to look at privacy and competition together.  </p><p>We're starting to see some of the tech platforms using privacy, as a pretext, for acting anti-competitively and cutting off competitors, from their APIs. So, these two are not incompatible, you can empower consumers to have control over how their data is shared, but without cutting off competition. </p><p>More importantly, any federal privacy laws should operate as a floor, not a ceiling. And, the state should be free, to protect their citizens, and should not be preempted, by a weaker--a weaker law, that takes away, you know, the will of California voters, for example. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. Mr. Reed? </p><p>REED: Yeah, as I said earlier, we have 12 developer companies, right behind us here, including we have some great ones, from your home state, as well. Unfortunately, I couldn't disagree more, with Ms. Hubbard's comment, about floor, not a ceiling. What my developers tell me is that the patchwork of state laws is actually one of the most anti-competitive things that can happen. Before this very committee, I believe, Google, AT&amp;T, and others described that they were spending hundreds of person-hours of legal work, to get into compliance with GDPR. </p><p>Now, imagine a 50-states law, plus GDPR, plus California, plus Washington state, plus the possibility of your home state, doing another bill. And, my small businesses don't have the legal resources, to serve, all of those needs. So, we fully support, as you said, a single standard, a preemptive law, that comes out of Congress, that gives the smallest companies, the same rules of the road, for privacy, as it does for the behemoths, and their giant legal teams. And, I think, that's the most important aspect, if you want to encourage, small innovative businesses. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay, let me ask you this, I had a great conversation, last fall, through the task force, with the--an executive from FreeWill. And they are, I guess, the last man standing, you would say. And, competing against Google, when it comes to online video advertising. And, the  Googles expansion, in the way they're limiting, the diversity of content, was something that came up through that. And then, this week, the Wall Street Journal had an article about, SNAP, and their CEO and some of the strong-arm tactics, that came from Facebook, when he refused to sell to Facebook. So, let's see, Mr. Kimmelman, let me come back to you, on this one. </p><p>Talk a little bit about that ad ecosystem and Googles dominance, in that. And, the lack of ability, Mr. Reed says he has 12 innovators, that are sitting behind him. What we want to do is, make certain that it is a level playing field, and then it is open to innovators. We've got a tremendous amount of that work, being done in Tennessee, with healthcare, healthcare informatics, financial service delivery systems. So, if you just touch on that. I only have a minute-fifty left. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Sure, thank you, Senator. I'll also say that I think this is a problem with Facebook, as well. With their enormous reach. They have their own ad system. Extremely valuable for advertisers and publishers to be there, and Facebook can control, exactly, all the data and how it's used and how information is presented. So, it's worthy of consideration, too.  </p><p>In the Google environment, I think the big problem is, it's like a stock exchange, where we're having real-time bidding and trading, we usually don't think we want the people who are running that process, to also have a major stake, in the broker business, and the selling, and the buying portion, as well.  </p><p>Now Google happens to have that here, and the danger is that if there aren't enough players, and if they actually have too much market power, everyone becomes more dependent, on using their products, on the ad side, and on the publishing side, and their data analytics, because you have to use them when you use their products. And then, they control your information, about whether you're getting efficient pricing and--and fairness. So, I think we need to review all of-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Which is one of our concerns is, you know, the self-preferencing, and there is so much that we have said about this. But Google then begins to own, what I call your virtual you, which is you and your presence, online. Because it's like, predictive diagnosis in medicine, they know what your next step is going to be, and then they preference, to that next step.  </p><p>You know, it drives me absolutely crazy, when I get in my car, at a certain time of day, and Google maps tells me how far it is to my house, and how long it's going to take me, to get there. So, my time has expired. Thank you all, very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Senator Blackburn. Mr. Lowe let's go back to you. You acknowledged in your written testimony, and in response to some questions from Senator Hawley, about the scenario in which you type in 2+2. And, if I am understanding your argument correctly, you're saying that's totally fine for them to say, yeah, the answer to that is four, rather than just including a series of links, to websites, that--that have calculators, attached to them.  </p><p>But then when it comes to other searches, including, in many cases, a search for a local business of some sort or another, that it might be different. And in some cases, you might end up with search results that are degraded, in terms of their value, to the searcher or in other cases, might be deceptive. So, help--help walk me through what Yelp considers deceptive or a degradation of the quality, of a search result. </p><p>LOWE: Thank you, for the question, Mr. Chairman. It's not as Senator Hawley just said, I think the devils in the details. And, I think this is why antitrust laws important and we support the use of antitrust law, to balance and I think, in the case of the Federal Trade Commission's investigation, ultimate conclusion, this was frankly what they got tripped up on. Is this idea that the introduction of these Answer Boxes, also known as Win Boxes, did have anticompetitive effects, which--which were acknowledged.  </p><p>But on balance, they found that it led to consumer benefit. And I think, you need to engage in this, sort of, vertical-specific balancing. So, I talked to economists about this topic, a lot. I think, the, you know, one way you could imagine it is sort of a spectrum of, you know, on one side is sort of a mutable fact-based information, commodity, utility-like, it's almost an analogous to the flashlight example, in the app store, that was discussed earlier.  </p><p>On the other side is sort of, the most subjective information you can imagine. And, in the case of local search, the core information that is surfaced, is this amalgam of user-generated content. And so, I think that you know, asking the question, does it make sense to bypass the entire World Wide Web of candidates, for potential relevant results, in serving up an answer, and having a totally exclusionary box, with no other third-party services allowed, to even participate, in this merit-based process, you know, I think these are fair questions, to raise. </p><p>LEE: What--tell me what Yelp does, in response to, Internet search query, that's different than how Google does it. </p><p>LOWE: So, Yelp is a vertical search engine. And that's distinct from general search, in that there is a geographic coefficient. So, if I search for dentistry on Google, Google has the challenge of returning relevant content, for the person looking for dental school, or the history of dentistry or maybe their--maybe they've got a toothache, and they are looking for a dentist. If I do a search for, dentist in Provo, on Yelp, that's a very specific type of search. And, we know that that person is looking for a local business. Yelp-- </p><p>LEE: You will get a ton of results; I don't know why, but we have a ton of dentists in Provo. </p><p>LOWE: Yelp, not unlike Google, serves--surfaces ads, and that's not what--I don't think that's what we're discussing today. I think people should have the right to run advertisements. But unlike Google, we--and like Google, we also, surface organic results. But unlike Google, we do not surface this distinct, third category of information, which is an Answer Box, where we're steering people to, you know, the dentist that is on Yelp's payroll or-- </p><p>LEE: That's what differentiates your results, from theirs, separate from your structure, your vertical search structure.  </p><p>LOWE: Right. </p><p>LEE: Yours are differentiated, in that, you have sponsored ad search results and then you have non-sponsored ones, but not the third category, of this Answer Box. </p><p>LOWE: That is correct, sir. </p><p>LEE: By the way, what--what percentage of Yelp's overall traffic, including what you get from your modal app--your mobile app, does--does Google account for? </p><p>LOWE: If you include the mobile app, I think that gets a bit bigger(ph), because there are many times, people, Google is one of the key ways, if not the keyway, that people discover services, third-party services, like Yelp and TripAdvisor and others, and then ultimately, download the app. So, to bring that in, somewhat muddies, the calculation. I don't know the exact number, in the last month or so, but I think we're still about 80 percent of web traffic, is a--that comes to Yelp, comes through Google. </p><p>And sometimes, it's navigational search. People who have already decided that they want to go to Yelp and they're almost using Google, as a--they're typing in the search, you know, dentist Provo, and the word Yelp. And, sometimes, they've never heard of Yelp before, and they're just discovering Yelp, through Google. But increasingly, that is becoming more difficult, because most people are doing these searches, on smartphones.  </p><p>The majority of smartphones search these days, is local search, and the majority of those local search results, served up on smartphones, are being siphoned into this, walled garden, so to speak, this sort of Google ecosystem. </p><p>LEE: By the way, that percentage that you referred to, and I understand why that's an elusive number to identify. Has that number increased? Has it waxed or waned, over the last few years? </p><p>LOWE: It's been relatively stable, but the number, sort of, to keep your eye on, in terms of understanding the impact of this conduct, in the market, is how many, number one, how many total search result pages have been generated, since the last time we had this hearing, or 2004, when Google was a pure turnstile. And, what percentage of clicks, are going into Google secondary products, versus going to the web.  </p><p>And, within the last six months or so, according to a very high-quality, third-party data, there's been a tipping point, that today, so, if you imagine, about 15 years ago, virtually 100 percent of traffic going to Google, was diffused out into the web. And, that was--unlocked all this innovation and investment.  </p><p>Today, the majority of traffic going to Google, either stays on Google or either terminates on Google or goes to Google secondary pages. So, you think about the slope of growth, of Google's own products, relative to the slope of growth, of the web itself. That's where you're seeing that type of foreclosure effect. </p><p>LEE: Interesting. Thank you. Professor Hazlett, other search engines like Bing, and DuckDuck Go, tend to provide, if I understand them correctly, targeted answers to consumers searches for local information. And in that respect, are similar in the way they provide search results to what Google does. What is--what does that suggest to you, about this kind of conduct, about the way they provide them? </p><p>HAZLETT: Thank you, Senator. That is the relevant consideration. And, I'm--I'm glad you mentioned the rival search engines because you want to compare, not a perfect or idealized world, or some kind of hypothetical, you want to see, actually, what's happening, in a dynamic sense, with competition, amongst real-world alternatives. And, it has been mentioned that Google comes out of, a search market in the 1990s, with stock to be solved.  </p><p>There was not a new opportunity, that was apparent, but it created a much cleaner project and much better answers. And, I guess that was called the turnstile approach, is that what it was? That just passing it along, to the best, the best answer, but you know, search was being gained obviously, by websites, and you know, pornography sites, and all kinds of stuff, people, in general, didn't want, figured out that these algorithms would, you know, could be manipulated. And--and, Google solved that problem. And, has made enormous capital, out of the fact, that it has created, this credibility.  </p><p>Now, that's what's, you know, that that is--is the question, now, is that continued? And, to find out, you want to compare, and to see how this evolution, has continued. I mean, in--in 2002, AOL actually offered and was paid, by the upstart, Google, to get the default search engine slot, on the AOL software. Because it was such a great application and--and, Google, was the upstart, paid for that. And, that was self-prefacing, by AOL, but by contract they--they sold and made money on that. They were the number one ISP, in the world. Internet service provider.  </p><p>And so, that was a market power issue, and it didn't work, so well, for AOL, which went out with competition. But it certainly worked well, coming up, to get more customers, for Google. And, it is constantly competing, then, with Inc. to Me (SP), now with--with Bing, and other upstarts and--and--and they--they can gain, by self-preferencing, but of course, they could also lose by that, as well. And--and, you know, in a competitive context. We have to see if--if there is any--any room to think, that this is not the best, that consumers can do. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Lowe, what is your response to that? </p><p>LOWE: So, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for--for raising--being in DuckDuck Go, in nondominant general search engines, do not have the luxury of degrading the quality of their services when it comes to local search. So, if I do a search for hotels, Salt Lake City, on Bing today, as much as I, you know, don't like it, TripAdvisor powers that--that Answer Box experience, and when I click on the information there, I'm sent out to TripAdvisor.com.  </p><p>Now, if you tweak the search, and do a search for restaurants, Salt Lake City, on Bing, you get Yelp content. And, you are sent off to Yelp. DuckDuck Go does the same thing. So, you know, the--the--it is very technically trivial, for a general search engine, to provide a nondiscriminatory and interoperable local search experience, but, you know, I find it telling that the non-dominant general search engines, don't engage in this activity, because I think that they have to fear that users will switch, and use alternative services. Whereas, Google is so dominant, that it doesn't have to experience, that same fear, of switching. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Reed, let's turn to you for a minute. There are members of Congress and sometimes some tech companies, who will, from time to time, raise concerns that platforms are enabling app developers--app developers, to take advantage of consumers, by collecting their data, and they'll go after them, in that direction. But then, turn around and criticize, those very same platforms, when their efforts to solve that problem, might end up harming competitors. How do your members think about this issue, and think about how policymakers, should go about finding the right balance? </p><p>REED: Well, I think you're talking about, basically, the dichotomy between how do we meet the consumer where they are, to provide them with what they're want--what they want, but also meet their privacy expectations? That is, kind of the golden goose, that everybody's looking at, right now.  </p><p>I think one of the most interesting things for this hearing, is that you are, in fact, seeing major platforms that I--I deal with, the app ecosystem, really competing on privacy, as a consumer value add. That to me, is surprisingly refreshing, that companies are spending, millions of dollars, to say, here's the way that we protect it. The interesting way that flows down to us, in the developer world, is it changes our terms of service. </p><p>It changes the expectations of our behavior. Do you remember the very beginning, I said there are 3--3 factors, that we need, from a platform? We need--we need them to create a trusted place. We need them to offload our overhead and we need them to create a global market. Well, that first one, trust, is absolutely critical. So, what we're seeing in the antitrust space, right now, is we're seeing that there is real competition, to establish trust, with the end-user, so that, they will buy my app, or use my app. </p><p>I think the difference here, is that, for Ms. Hubbard and Mr. Kimmelman, there is the idea that we need additional government agencies, to move forward, or housing our net tribunal, but at the end of the day, what I think, Ms. Hubbard commented on, which was critical, was this, I think you used the word will; the will to actually, move forward, on these cases.  </p><p>And so, Senator Lee, if there are examples where privacy is being abused, in an anti-competitive manner, then that's exactly where the FTC, with its current jurisdiction, can move forward. Especially, as Mr. Lowe pointed out if it's deceptive. </p><p>I guess the difference here is, what's the tool, to solve the problem? Is it, additional government agencies, or is it, will and resources, to the existing agencies? Right now, we tip our thumb on the scale of, existing agencies, with additional resources and will, more than new government forces. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Ms. Hubbard let's--let's turn to you next, if I understand it correctly, to deal with many of these problems, that you've described today, with the--the issues involved, in self-preferencing, by tech platforms. You support proposals that have been introduced, by some of my Democratic colleagues, to break up, some of these large companies. I do worry that regardless, of what one might think about what that could achieve, it could also create some problems.  </p><p>For example, let's say if Amazon, were to be forced to stop selling its Amazon basic--Amazon basics, line of products, or at least stop selling those products, on its own platform. And, it could sell them only on another platform, separate from this one. Isn't that likely to increase the cost of both the Amazon basics line of products and the remaining products, that are sold on the Amazon platform? And, if so, doesn't that harm consumers? </p><p>HUBBARD: Thank you, for the question, Senator. So, the proposals are more to divest that rule. So, it wouldn't be Amazon, still selling Amazon basic, on another platform. It would be other companies acquiring that--that functionality. So, Amazon is no longer, in the business, of selling products. It's only in the business of running a marketplace, that removes structurally, the conflicts of interest. </p><p>LEE: I--I--I get that, but doesn't, by offering its own products and those of its rivals, and its competitors, on the same platform, in close proximity, doesn't Amazon, by doing that, provide consumers with--with a benefit, by permitting and ensuring, price competition? Price competition, that would be, in many ways, diminished, if that weren't to occur. </p><p>HUBBARD: Unfortunately, the examples that I've looked at, where Amazon has kicked out other competitors, other retailer competitors, and favored its own products, we haven't always seen lower prices. In fact, there was a study that I did, looking at water filters, where it removed all other sellers of water filters, and the price actually went up. So, I don't think we should take, as a foregone conclusion, that it is prefacing its own products, is actually leading to lower prices. </p><p>But I also think we need to look at--at the issues that were talking about today. The other roles that consumers play as citizen--as entrepreneurs, that want to have a fair opportunity, to compete, by offering the best product and service. And, having that best product and service, have a shot at fair competition. And, consumers benefit, when fair competition delivers the best choice and innovation, and prices. </p><p>So, I think, you know, competition on an equal, level playing field, will be the best for consumers. Both in their role, as consumers, and as in their role, in fact, consumers are human, so, they also are, entrepreneurs, and they are also employees of companies, that are currently being, very much squeezed, by Amazon, with its extraction in anticompetitive practices. </p><p>LEE: Okay, I wanna drill down on this answer, you provided, a moment ago. So, the studies you referred to, of instances where the owner of a platform withdrew its own or did not withdrawal its own products, and prices went up, aren't you referring to instances in which, they excluded competitors, and then their prices went up? </p><p>HUBBARD: Right. So, Amazon does a few different things, for preferencing its own product. So, it has its own lines of products, like the Amazon basics, and all the brands, that it has. And it prefers those, on the platform, by giving them premium pricement--placement, in search results, premium advertising, they have access to data that their competitors don't have, and they have a superior ability, to target Amazon users, with advertising, about their products. </p><p>There also is a practice of self-preferencing, involving Amazon selling, as a first-party seller. That's when Amazon, is the retailer of a product, that it buys from someone else, at wholesale. And so, in the water filter example, what had happened was, there was a bunch of sellers, selling water filters, Amazon kicked off all those third-party sellers, from selling water filters, and became, itself, the exclusive seller of water-- of the branded water filter, that belonged to a different brand. And the prices, actually, went up, drastically. </p><p>LEE: When that happens, given that the distance between, say Amazon and something else, is just going to another website. If prices do go up. Doesn't that drive competitors--customers to a different website, where they'd find lower prices? </p><p>HUBBARD: You know, I would really love to see some data about switching, between alternatives. I think for a lot of Amazon Prime members, there's not a lot of comparison-shopping. They're kind of in a habit of just, you know, using Amazon as their everything store. So, I have not had access to data. </p><p>I'm hoping that's something that DOJ and FTC, are looking at, is switching data, between Amazon's platform and other competitors. I know from the marketplace seller side, from, you know, the vantage--the businesses that are being disadvantaged, those third-party sellers, I've spoken to them and they've told me, that selling on another platform, is not an option for them, to be viable business. They can't--they have no choice, but to sell on Amazon. If they tried to sell on eBay or Walmart, it's not going to be enough of a sales volume, for their businesses to exist. That's on the other side of the market, from the seller side. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>HUBBARD: There's not switching, on that side. I haven't seen the data on not switching. </p><p>LEE: Walmart is too small of a market for them? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>HUBBARD: Yeah. Online. For on-- e-commerce. </p><p>LEE: So, The mom-and-pop operations? </p><p>HUBBARD: For e-commerce. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. </p><p>HUBBARD: I'm talking about. </p><p>LEE: How does this differ, meaningfully, from let's say, Costco? You go to Costco, you can find a number of branded products, in some circumstances, you'll find Costco's own private label branded product, Kirkland. How does the set of scenarios, you are describing, differ meaningfully, from Costco's own pricing and physical placement of its Kirkland branded products, relative to those of--of others? </p><p>HUBBARD: The difference is that Costco is not nearly as dominant, as Amazon is. And so, you know, for Sherman Act Section 2, you need to have both monopoly power and exclusionary conduct. And, which can do--when you don't have monopoly power--you can't do legally when you do have monopoly power.  </p><p>So, because Costco is not as dominant, any brand that makes a product, has alternatives, to selling on Costco. They can choose not to sell on Costco. That's not the case with Amazon. Nearly every major brand has no choice, but to sell on Amazon, and therefore they can't protect themselves, against that self-preferencing, conduct. They can't choose alternatives. </p><p>LEE: But you mentioned, a few minutes ago, that one of the reasons for that, I think, the lead reason you mentioned is, because of habit. That it is a pattern, of consumer habit. Is that something that can translate, into anticompetitive conduct, under our antitrust laws? </p><p>HUBBARD: That's just to go to, whether there was switching or not. You were asking about switching, and switching is what we use, for analyzing whether there's monopoly power. We use the hypothetical monopolist test. We say if there's a small, but significant non-transitory increase in price, do a significant number of consumers, switch to alternatives?  </p><p>If they don't, for whatever reason that may be; whether it's habit, or you know, whatever the reason is if they don't, and the other, you know, then the companies are not, the alternatives are not included, in the relevant product market, for determining monopoly power. The alternatives, if they're not switching to them, are not included in the relevant product market, for determining whether monopoly power exists. That's why switching, where switching, comes into play, in antitrust analysis. </p><p>LEE: Sure. In the case of an online retailer that offers a broad array of services, that makes it somewhat unique. Does that present an interesting challenge, for figuring out, what the relevant market is? </p><p>HUBBARD: Yeah, I mean, I think there's lots of different relevant product markets. We are talking about Amazon. There's Amazon as a whole, you could go-- drill down into a particular product category, you can be looking at, like a product line, like consumer products.  </p><p>So, I think, you know, unfortunately, when I stopped being an antitrust enforcer, I lost the subpoena power, I don't have that--insights to, really do that robust analysis, that's needed, to identify that switching data. But I think there's probably a lot of different markets, at play here, not just one. </p><p>LEE: Professor Hazlett what's your response, to Ms. Hubbard's answer to my questions, about the Amazon basics line of question? </p><p>HAZLETT: (OFF MIC)Well, well first of all, yeah, thank you, very much-- </p><p>LEE: Yeah, push the button, thank you. </p><p>HAZLETT: Thank you, very much, Senator. The--the trend with--with--with the argument, that Amazon is mistreating third-party vendors, and using their data, and undermining them or throwing them off the platform. The fact is, that the platform started in the mid-to-late 90s, as an Amazon sales platform. And, if you go to 1997, the year of the IPO, I think it was 97 percent of all products, were Amazon products, that were sold by retailers' sales volume. </p><p>Now, it's down, the latest data I've seen, it's down to 42 percent. And, it's a third-party platform. That's what emerging. It is extremely profitable, for Amazon to make the platform lucrative for the third-party vendors. That's what it is.  </p><p>That's what this enormous value creation has been about. Where we've seen Amazon become, rotating, for the prize of, most valuable company in the world. At the same time, they have completed their entire corporate existence, against a non-vertically integrated platform, in this sense, which is eBay.  </p><p>And, eBay was much larger, of course, at the start. You go back to the mid-2000s. I think it was about three times, the market capitalization, of Amazon. And, eBay, specifically takes the other approach in its business model, which has some salience here and is advocated as a rule, but you don't need the rule, to see what happens, in the marketplace. You have the opportunity, for a non-integrated platform owner, to make the platform, excellent, for the third-party vendors. </p><p>And that--that works very well, too. Now, Amazon has come, come on, you know, with a lot of momentum here and actually outcompeted, in the sense of volume. So, that they have more third-party sales now, but it's not as though, eBay does not exist. It's not as if other sites, have not launched, and exist, to compete. And, in fact, the great story about one product that was thought to be suppressed, Diapers.com, on Amazon, there's a story about this. </p><p>In fact, it--it--it was bought by Amazon, prices did not go up, this interestingly enough, and in fact, the people who had this entrepreneurial venture, competing on the platform of Amazon, made a very large capital gain, from that, but they left Amazon and started their own venture, Jet.com, sold that for $3 billion, that was acquired by Walmart. And, now, the head of Walmart, previously at Amazon, is competing, running the e-commerce division.  </p><p>That is an intense rivalry, where both sides, are competing to create platforms, for all kinds of branded, integrated, self-preferential, and independent products. And, that is what consumers should want. We benefit from that. We find new efficiencies. And, that's the way these competing business models, are returning social value. </p><p>LEE: In the mid-1990s, my wife and I had twins, during my first-year law school. At the time e-commerce, hadn't really become a thing, but we knew exactly which store had better prices, on diapers, which store had better prices, on formula, and so forth. And, I wish some of these services have been around then. If nothing else, it made price comparison easier.  </p><p>Mr. Kimmelman let's go back to you for a second. You proposed a nondiscrimination framework, as a way to address, some of the problems, that you see, with self-preferencing by these platforms. I'm not sure how some of this would work in practice, though. For example, how would that work for a firm like Apple? What--what would iOS look like, if Apple couldn't bundle various apps and other components, into the iPhone?  </p><p>So, would a consumer, end up with a phone, with no apps installed, just hardware and something that when taken out of the box, would open up to a blank screen, when it turned on, and then the customer would have a litany of choices, to be made, regarding what operating system it should run, what apps to install, and, so forth?  </p><p>So, I mean, virtually any--any platform component, can be modularized, and open to competition, by third parties. It--it and so, if that's true, then where would you draw the line and why? Where would you draw it? And why would you draw, choose to draw the line, where you do? </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Senator, the first line that needs to be drawn is, who would be subject to some kind of a nondiscrimination standard. And, what I've been proposing is, we look at companies or elements of the market, where we have no entry, or we have bottlenecked power, we have gatekeeper control. So, not to--not to--to divert from your hypothetical, but I'm not sure Apple, totally fits in that framework. </p><p>But, let's assume that it does, I'm not suggesting that they have to separate everything out. There are various ways that we could have an expert agency look at, what is fair treatment of yourself versus third-party players, on your platform. In cable, it was prices, terms, and conditions. We've done similar things in telecommunications. </p><p>So here, I think, it's not about prohibiting bundling or prohibiting the offering of vertical services, except maybe in the most extreme cases, I would be much more cautious, then Sally was. But it's enabling the opportunity for others to be, for example, in the app store, offering similar choices, for consumers. </p><p>LEE: Let me tell you, what worries me about that if we are to imagine a very benevolent and efficient federal agency, something that I get to see, that exists, not that the government doesn't serve the role, it does. But when I look at different industries, I see the most dynamic, successful, areas of our economy. Areas where there's been more competition, rather than less, over the last couple of decades, and where jobs, most of our net job growth, has occurred.  </p><p>It tends to be in industries, that are, what I describe as, being born into freedom, as opposed to, being born into captivity. We have the benevolent regulator model, for many decades, in place with common carriers, for example. Airlines. This kept prices quite high. So, what worries me about that model, is that when someone has to go to a regulator and do a 'mother may I', every time they want to make a change.  </p><p>You don't and you can't have, the type of dynamic market environment, that you've had, with the development of the Internet, of a smartphone, where people can respond, in real-time, to changing market circumstances, without being told in advance, as if, through a sort of, technical analog to prior restraint, what they may or may not do, what may or may not be, considered fair. So, that worries me a little bit. Professor Hazlett, do you have any response, to Mr. Kimmelman's analysis, there? </p><p>HAZLETT: Well, I--I mean there's--there's obviously some reasons to think that you want, and the arguments been given here, to want more ability, to attack anti-competitive activities. But, there's a cost to that. There is a tremendous opportunity for dynamic competition to evolve, as it's evolved. I think that's what you're referring to, in some of these open markets. And so, we're impressed by that. And, when we see how common carrier control of AT&amp;T for 40 years, really had a very stultifying effect on competitive entry, even though it was designed, and in some poetic retrospectives, is actually given credit today, for keeping the market open.  </p><p>It was--it was doing exactly the opposite. And in fact, the antitrust action against AT&amp;T, was as much an action, if not more, as some economists have stated, against the regulatory structure. Which was keeping out, what was supposed to be able to come in, by design, by open access, through common carriage. And so, obviously, that regulatory system is very suspect. We've done better to--to move past that. There's not a lot of debate about that. People of various stripes, certainly, agree with that.  </p><p>But I remember the introduction of the iPhone. And it was attacked, for its vertical control, platform owners, want the platform to be successful, and they want to assert some control over that, generally speaking. And, Apple came in, with this integrated product. And, Professor Tim Wu (SP) at Columbia, is very well versed, on this. I've assigned one of his many books, to students, there's a student of mine here, who was forced to read that book.  </p><p>But he--he called it, what he said, \"the iPhone, is iPhony\", because of the vertical structure and its exclusive agreement, originally with AT&amp;T, to provide service, in the United States. That has become a tremendously productive platform. Whether you're talking about the app space or the consumer acceptance. And, in fact, the competition it promulgated. It eliminated Blackberry and Nokia, which were the pre-existing platforms, that were great, in their own time, and in their own way.  </p><p>But it--it--it--it really was disruptive to them. And, they had a lot of complaints, but it moved on and created the opportunity for the Android, Google Play, which was the competing space, that rose up in direct competition, in its own, sort of controlled space, which is now, being criticized as well, because it's not just as open, as Google claimed it was.  </p><p>There were some linkages and some self-preferencing when you use the Android operating system. Yes, the default is, Google search. And, Google benefits from that, even though they licensed the software for free, in an amazing stretch, really became the biggest software platform in the world, particularly in the mobile space, by this open mechanism, of not charging for the license.  </p><p>It--it--that kind of creative disruption, really is, what you want, in these high-tech markets. And, to say that you have to go through a process, that's going to tax innovation, by running it through a \"mother may I' is--is very costly. So that has to be the offset, that people are very concerned with. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Mr. Chairman, I'm not suggesting a 'mother may I', and I'm asking for something much more limited. I agree with a lot of what Professor Hazlett says, but the main point here is, that a lot of what we're talking about, antitrust has not been effective, at getting at. And so, while there is a cost to regulations, and I'd be very careful and targeted about it, there's also a bigger cost, of doing nothing. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Reed? </p><p>REED: I just have a brief note. I think it's important that we don't mix our history. The interesting part about the release of the iPhone is, that when it first came out, you couldn't have third-party applications on it. Steve Jobs intended it to be only web apps. And, it was supposed to be a pristine environment, filled with only Apple--Apple applications. And, everything else had to be web apps.  </p><p>It wasn't until Apple, kind of took a page from Microsoft, and put developers on the forefront and did those three things, of creating an environment that actually gave us space, to utilize the features that were on the device, that you saw this explosive growth. He mentioned Blackberry. Blackberry tried to have an app store, but they didn't--they didn't put the developer first. They didn't create this, equality space, that we can put our apps in.  </p><p>And that's what gave birth to it. It wasn't the iPhone itself, that took some time. It was the birth of the app store, and the ability of third parties, to participate, on that. That really change the landscape and opened the door, as you said, to other platforms, to compete. So, it's really the involvement of small businesses and--and the ability of platforms, to nurture that, and make that possible, that helped Apple, become one of the biggest companies out there. </p><p>LEE: That's a good point. I hadn't thought of that, in a while. Plus, Blackberrys got annoying after a while. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I don't know what they did, but one day they--their new phone, just became impossible to use. And, their, but their app platform, was very unwieldy, and you couldn't access it. The iPhone platform, by contrast, I--I've gone back and forth, for years, using different mapping apps and different search engine apps, depending on who's gets better.  </p><p>So, sometimes at the--Apple map app, is better. Sometimes it's Google or Waze. Anyway, I know you didn't come here to hear me opine, on my favorite map apps. This has been really helpful. I really appreciate each--the expertise, each one of you, has brought to this, as we are going to wrap up the hearing.  </p><p>Before I do so, I just want to thank a member of my staff, Sean Pugh, who's been with me for a couple of years. He's done an extraordinary job. We're going to be losing him on Friday. I--I--I've threatened to wear black, in mourning all week, this week, to cover all mirrors, in the office, as a result of it.  </p><p>We're losing him to the private sector, but he's been absolutely phenomenal. I'm grateful to him, for all he's done for me, for my staff, for the development of antitrust law, and in putting together this, and so many other hearings. The record is going to remain open until Tuesday, March 24, and we stand adjourned. Thank you. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YFF-5DX1-F15W-H1C6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

KAMALA HARRIS (D-CALIF.) </p><p>[*]GRAHAM: The purpose of the hearing today is to talk about the problems associated with encryption of social media devices, phones, and how to strike a balance. So the point, for me, is I appreciate the fact that people cannot hack into my phone, listen to my phone calls, follow the messages, the texts I received and how I use the phone. I think all of us want devices that protect our privacy. </p><p>Having said that, no American should want a device that becomes a safe haven for criminality. The only people--we're not the only people who use these devices. Criminals use these devices. Terrorists use these devices. You've got encrypted apps out there that child molesters use. You've got encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Messenger that terrorists use. So here's the deal for me. I want the average American to be protected as much as possible, but when law enforcement believes that a crime has been committed or is in the process of being committed and they get a court order, I want the government to be able to look and find out all relevant information. </p><p>There is no place safer, more sacred in American politics and legal systems than one's home. You know, the king of your--queen of your castle. Having said that, if the government gets a search warrant to go into your home, they can. If you lock the door, they can break it down. So in American law there is no place that's immune from inquiry if criminality is involved. You have to go through a legal process to get into one's home, the warrant process. And I'm not about to create a safe haven for criminals where they can plan their misdeeds and have information stored in a fashion that law enforcement can never be allowed to access it. That is a bridge too far for me. How we do this, I don't know. I hope the tech community working with law enforcement can find a way to do it. If you all don't, we will. Senator Feinstein. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to put my formal remarks in the record, and I just want to say a few things from the heart. I want to take everybody back to December 2, 2015. The place is San Bernardino, California. What happened was a mass murder. 22 people--excuse me--14 were killed, and 22 more were injured, but a cell phone was found at the scene of the crime. As part of the investigation, the FBI was unable to unlock it. And despite a lawful court order, the phone's manufacturer refused to assist the FBI in unlocking the phone. </p><p>I was called and asked to help, and I learned the detail of this. And I learned the cost of what it took to eventually unlock that phone. Gentlemen, remember, 14 people lost their lives, were killed, and 22 more were injured. I am determined to see that there is a way that phones can be unlocked when major crimes are committed. It is a vital piece of evidence, whether that's liked by you or not, at the scene of a crime. </p><p>This time, on the state I rep--at the state I represent a lot of people killed and a lot of people injured, and what was there? A cell phone. I know what it costs to unlock it. I've been asked not to say it. I'll respect that. But it should not have happened, and I've learned, my colleagues, even when a United States senator calls and asks for help for law enforcement, that help is denied. So we need to take action. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, I could not have said it better. I didn't say it better. I associate myself with everything Senator Feinstein just said in terms of my view of the problem and what we need to do to fix it. The panel today is Cyrus Vance, Jr., district attorney for New York County; Matt Tait, independent cyber security expert and consultant, Austin, Texas; Erik Neuenschwander--that's pretty good--director of user privacy, Apple; Jay Sullivan, project--product management director for privacy integrity, Facebook. Mr. Vance. </p><p>VANCE: Good morning, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. On behalf of my office and law enforcement around the country, particularly local law enforcement, I thank the committee for its attention and for its invitation to me to address the issues of local, state and national public safety around encryption. </p><p>The single most important law enforcement challenge in the last 10 years, in my personal opinion, is the expanded use of mobile devices by bad actors to plan, to execute and to communicate about crimes. Just as we ordinary citizens rely on digital communication, so do people involved in terrorism, cyber fraud, murder, rape, robbery and child sexual assault. Until the fall of 2014, Apple and Google routinely provided law enforcement access to their mobile phones when they received a court ordered search warrant, just as you suggested, Senator Feinstein, but that changed when they rolled out their first mobile operating systems that, by design, often make the contents of smart phones completely inaccessible. And in doing so, Apple and Google, in my opinion, effectively upended centuries of American jurisprudence, as you suggest, Chairman Graham, holding that nobody's property is beyond the reach of a court ordered search warrant. </p><p>So how has this affected law enforcement and crime victims? Let me answer these questions with two brief examples from my office. The first involves child sexual abuse. A babysitter at a local church in Manhattan was identified as having shared images of child sexual assault online. Pursuant to a warrant that was issued by a judge, his encrypted mobile devices and other devices were seized. Over time we opened the devices using technology from a paid consultant, which we'll discuss in a bit. We then discovered that the suspect was not only sharing images of child sexual assault, but himself videotaping his own child sexual assault activities and recording that abuse as well. Based on this evidence, which we finally accessed, we convicted him of predatory sexual assault. </p><p>In a second example we weren't so lucky. My office was investigating a case of sex trafficking and obtained an encrypted phone from a suspect who at the time was incarcerated on a different case. In a recorded telephone call from prison that suspect, speaking to an accomplice outside prison, told the accomplice that he hoped his phone had the newest encrypted operating system from Apple, and this inmate said to his friend, and I'm quoting, Apple and Google came out with these softwares that can no longer be unencrypted by the police. If our phones are running on iOS 8 software, they can't open my phone. That may be a gift from God. </p><p>In fact, we were never able to view the contents of that phone, and as a result, our investigation of sex trafficking was blocked by encryption. And to be clear, we are in some able--in some cases able to gain entry to these phones by using hacking tools we've paid private companies to obtain. I want to be clear about this, though. Such third-party workarounds are cost prohibitive for all but a handful of local law enforcement agencies. They are simply out of reach for many of the smaller and rural communities that you represent. And in addition, these workarounds in many cases do not succeed due to security mechanisms put in place by Apple and Google. </p><p>I think it's also important to note that in a number of cases our ability to open and access phones has led to exonerations of people wrongly suspected or arrested for crimes. So our ability to access devices enables us to protect our twofold obligations, to hold the guilty responsible and to protect the innocent from injustice. </p><p>Finally, I anticipate that Apple today will tell you that it is impossible for them to open their devices without creating a hole for crypto criminals themselves to gain access. I have two brief responses to this. First, in 2016 at House hearings in which I participated, Apple's then general counsel acknowledged in written testimony that the company's process for unlocking phones in response to warrants prior to the introduction of iOS 8 in 2014 had never led to a security breach of that process. Second, this new tech--this new criminal justice problem is, in my view, a direct result of these private companies' decisions to reengineer their projects. Now I'm not a technologist, but I'm confident that the problem can be solved by a company redesign, as well. </p><p>[*]VANCE: As President John F. Kennedy once said our problems are man-made; therefore, they can be solved by man. The right balance between privacy and public safety can be achieved I believe by one requiring a court-ordered search warrant and two, limiting the information sought to data at risk, what Senator Feinstein was talking about the photos in the messages and the data that is on the phone. I am not talking about surveillance of discussions or other communications while they are in progress because I believe this is a middle ground on encryption and the position most likely to result in fruitful compromise and a position endorsed by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But this middle ground will only be achieved through federal legislative action which is why I am here today. In our view allowing private companies in Silicon Valley to continue to insert themselves as the unregulated gatekeepers of critical evidence is dangerous, it is bad public sub policy and in our view warrants legislative intervention. Thank you. </p><p>TAIT: Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein, members of the committee thank you for inviting me to this important hearing today. For as long as this country has existed society has always struggled to maintain a balance between individuals rights to privacy versus the rights of victims of crime to obtain justice through law enforcement's ability to collect evidence and prosecute the crimes committed against them. Time and again the inevitable progress of technology shifts this balance in one direction or another and we are here again today because technology has once again shifted this balance. Encryption makes us undoubtedly safer online from hackers and foreign government surveillance. Without it the internet would not be the thriving hub of commerce that it is today. Encryption has made it possible to communicate securely with one another, to build business is online and enables us to access global communities and shared interests that were previously very hard to access. </p><p>The internet and the technology market today is as it is precisely because encryption enables us to operate securely online. As with all technologies encryption comes with the inevitable collaterals in this case to law enforcement. It is right that we ask hard questions about what we can do to mitigate these collaterals without undermining the huge benefits to society that encryption gives us all. We should not be coy here. Encryption does affect law enforcement in practically all domains from counterterrorism, financial crimes countering child abuse as well as ordinary device searches for local law enforcement and given the sheer scale and complexity of these domains it is hardly surprising that the conversation around encryption need some work itself to decipher. </p><p>As I understand it encryption meaningfully hinders law enforcement in three key areas that need to be taken separately device searches, wiretaps and so-called cyber tips whereby distribution of child abuse material can be detected and investigated. Perhaps surprisingly the way encryption relates to these domains is not similar to one another and the approaches for technology companies, law enforcement and regulators to address these collaterals have surprisingly little overlap. </p><p>The first of these three domains says ordinary device searches which is impacted by device encryption. Device encryption in tangles the user's files with the passcode of the user in order to prevent unauthorized extraction of those files. This has the collateral effect of presenting law enforcement from searching devices that have been physically seized during an arrest or property search. If the owner cannot enter their passcode perhaps because they are dead at the scene of a crime either as a victim or as a perpetrator the device provides no alternative mechanism to access the content of that device. </p><p>The second of these domains is traditional wiretaps between two individuals known to law enforcement to be planning or committing a major crime. This is impacted by end to end communications encryption which hides all content but not necessarily all meta-data of the conversation taking place so that even the communications provider cannot see it. The third domain is what law enforcement calls cyber tips in the context of detecting when child abuse imagery is shared over a communications platform. </p><p>At the moment many technology companies voluntarily scan shared images against a huge database of known child abuse material and alert law enforcement if a match is discovered. Although this domain is very different to traditional wiretaps it is also affected by end to end communications encryption because without access to the content being transmitted technology companies are more limited in their ability to scan that content for abuse material. </p><p>Each of these three domains impacts law enforcement in very different ways and the ability of technology companies, law enforcement and regulators to counteract these are surprisingly different. For example the use of zero day vulnerabilities has in effect becomes the excepted default mechanism for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to conduct wiretaps on end to end encrypted platforms. A few months ago for example a recent hacking campaign attributed to China made the use of iPhone zero day vulnerabilities to access some amongst other things the contents of WhatsApp and I message encrypted communications from targeted devices. These vulnerabilities are not cheap but at least for now wiretaps via hacking remain an attractive practical and proportionate method for federal law enforcement to conduct wiretaps without the need for proactive regulation or to help from technology vendors. </p><p>Cyber tips have a harder challenge to bridge. Here the use of zero day vulnerabilities to break into devices would clearly not be safe or proportionate but other approaches do exist that do not require the alteration or removal of end to end encryption. For example technology vendors can scan abuse images as they are sent and received on the device itself rather than as it traverses the communications platform. In short, options do exist for conducting wiretaps and retaining cyber tips without the need for substantiatively alter during or regulating into end encryption. </p><p>These options are not easy to be sure but they do exist. Uniquely amongst the problem domains only device encryption which thwarts device searches would be amenable to what law enforcement calls a front door access mechanism. This is because device searches uniquely can be predicated on the knowledge if not the consent of the owner and the technology to do so can be built around law enforcement's physical access to the device which doesn't exist in the case of wiretaps. Because these factors are not available in the context of other searches there will always be dangers to extrapolate options for one of these domains to other domains. </p><p>In summary encryption remains an important tool for enabling the internet to operate as the hub of commerce and communication that is increasingly the center of all of our lives. There are externalities to law enforcement investigations but many of these externalities can be mitigated entirely or substantially without reference to the encryption itself. </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and I look forward to answering the committee's questions. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Good morning, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today about how encryption works and the important role it plays keeping electronic data and records secure. </p><p>My name is Erik Neuenschwander and I have been a software engineer at Apple for 12 years. I worked as the first data analysis engineer on the first iPhone, manage the software performance team for the first iPad and founded Apple's privacy engineering team. Today I manage the team responsible for the technical aspects of designing Apple's privacy features. I am proud to work at a company that builds great products that improve people's lives. </p><p>Today iPhone is used for much more than phone calls. Around the world people use them every day to store and send sensitive and important data, personal financial information, or health data, communications with our colleagues and even information about the location of our family members. And as the internet is making the world even more interconnected people use their iPhones to remotely control things like home security systems, vehicles and appliances. Your iPhone needs to be protected from hackers and criminals and that is what strong encryption helps to do. </p><p>Encryption is the underlying technology providing information security in all modern systems. We do not know of a way to deploy encryption that provides access only for the good guys without making it easier for the bad guys to break in. Encryption not only protects a person sensitive data it is also one of the most important mechanisms we have as a nation to safeguard an increasingly interconnected future. Every day over 1 trillion transactions from financial transactions to the exchange of healthcare records occurs safely over the internet because of encrypted communications. Utilizing 5G networks connected devices will play an even larger role in the operation and maintenance of our critical infrastructure running our electric grids, transportation networks and healthcare and financial systems. </p><p>Encryption is needed to protect from malicious actors whose and tax are growing exponentially in scope, frequency and sophistication. And encryption will become even more important as more devices are added to the internet and attack surfaces expand. Encryption is woven through our software, hardware and services for maximum security. We also challenge ourselves to collect as little customer data as possible including through the use of tools that process data only on a person's device rather than on Apple servers. If we don't have your information then nefarious insiders or malicious actors who gain access to apples networks won't either. And our use of secure enclave a hardware-based key manager that is isolated from the main processor provides an extra layer of security overall our approach to design improve security reducing points of vulnerability and risk. </p><p>We understand that rapidly evolving technologies by their very nature can create challenges for investigators. At Apple we share law enforcement's goal of creating a safer world and we work closely with law enforcement every day. We have a staff of professionals including former law enforcement personnel on call 24 hours a day seven days a week to assist law enforcement with lawful request. </p><p>This work is significant. Over the past seven years the company has responded to over 127,000 request from U.S. law enforcement agencies for information that we have been told is critical to helping prevent or solve crimes. In addition our teams have fielded and supported thousands of emergency request from U.S. law enforcement typically taking action within 20 minutes of receipt. And the number of U.S. government request has increased over 100 percent indicating that the information we are providing is valuable to investigations. </p><p>Given the pace of innovation and the growth of data in recent years we understand that one of the biggest challenges facing law enforcement is a lack of clear information about what data are available, where they are stored and how they can be obtained. That is why we publish a comprehensive law enforcement guide that provides this information and our team has trained law enforcement officers in the United States and around the world to these processes. We will continue to increase our training offerings in the future including by deploying online training to reach smaller law enforcement departments. </p><p>Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to participate in this important hearing. </p><p>SULLIVAN: Chairman Graham, Ranking Member--sorry. Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein, members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. My name is Jay Sullivan, I am a director of product management for Messenger and Facebook and I lead our efforts relating to messaging privacy, safety and security. Before coming to Facebook I spent more than 25 years in the industry working on a variety of software products and platforms including several years working to protect safety and security of people online. </p><p>At Facebook we believe that people should be able to communicate securely and privately with friends and loved ones without anyone including Facebook listening to or monitoring their conversations. People should be able to send sensitive medical or financial information with the confidence that it won't fall into the hands of identity thieves or others with malicious intent. Journalist, dissidence and civil society should be able to communicate without fear of surveillance or retaliation from repressive regimes. </p><p>End to end encryption is the technology that secure messaging systems use to achieve these goals and has already established technology used all over the world encrypting--encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, Telegram and others are used by billions of people around the world every day. We think it is critical that American companies lead in the area of secure encrypted messaging. If the United States rolls back its support for privacy and encryption foreign application providers will fill the vacuum. These firms will be largely out of the reach of U.S. law enforcement and will not be as committed to order capable of preventing, detecting and responding to bad actors. </p><p>We understand that there are people who attempt to issues our services and do. This is my we will continue to be a leader in detecting, preventing and responding to harm in our messaging services. Technology eve(ph) falls and the tools we use to keep people safe can and must as well but our resolve remains unchanged. </p><p>Facebook invest immense resources on safety and there is a lot that we can and will do to keep people safe while providing secure private communications. First, working to prevent harm. We take down millions of fake accounts every day, almost all of them proactively detected by our systems. We find these accounts primarily by looking not at the content of their messages, but at their patterns of behavior. We're also working to better understand how bad actors connect with their victims so we can prevent that initial contact and give people more control over who can contact them online. </p><p>Second, we'll continue to use all unencrypted information available to us, including group names, profile pictures, and other information from the--the--the Facebook app and the Instagram feed detect abuse. We're also using what we learn from those apps, which remain unencrypted, and we can stop a lot of bad behavior in our messaging apps from those public spaces. </p><p>Third, we're working on encouraging and making it easier for people to report messages that concern them. When they do so, they do share that unencrypted information back to Facebook so that we can act on them as we always have done. </p><p>Facebook has in his immense respect for the work that law enforcement does to--to keep America safe. Our commitment to partner closely remains unchanged. We will continue to respond to all lawful requests with metadata, content that users to share with us through reports, and the unencrypted content from the Facebook family of apps, including the spaces of Instagram and Facebook. </p><p>Law enforcement's ability to retrieve direct messages stored on a device continues. Some have called for the building of backdoors and otherwise secured systems. We oppose intentionally weakening the security of encrypted systems because doing so would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere and leave them vulnerable to hackers, criminals, and repressive regimes. Instead, we're working to develop ways to use information that we can access to support law enforcement when it is lawful and appropriate. </p><p>Ensuring that encryption is implemented across our services is an--an effective and responsible manner will require continued dialogue. We're not flipping a switch tomorrow. We're taking our time to make sure we get this right. We announced our plans early so that we can work to address legitimate and reasonable concerns and find solutions through partnership and collaboration. </p><p>Thank you, and I--I look forward to your questions. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you all very much. Mr. Vance, you described a scenario that--some of us have been prosecutors and defense attorneys. The bottom line is you--you got information that Person A, as you described in the church scenario, was involved in child abuse, and you had a reason to believe that some evidence of that child abuse was on his phone. Did you go to the court and get a warrant to look into the phone? </p><p>VANCE: Mr. Chairman, in every case where we try to access the content of a digital device, we first go to court and-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Who do you serve the warrant on? </p><p>VANCE: We'll serve the warrant on the owner of the device. It depends on--on where the device is and where the owner of the device is. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. What if the person's dead? </p><p>VANCE: Well, then you can't serve anybody, which is the--of course I think the--the example that the ranking member gave. It is-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --So, do you serve the warrant on Apple, who developed the phone? </p><p>VANCE: Well, we--we have served--well, historically, up until the end of 2014, this is what happened. If we received a warrant for this device left at a crime scene, we would go to the judge. The judge would agree or disagree with us whether or not there was probable cause. If the judge gave us a warrant, we'd send the phone with the warrant to Cupertino, California. They would go down into the secret room in the bottom of Cupertino, California. They would unlock the device using the key-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Is this Apple? </p><p>VANCE: This is Apple, using the keys that--Apple, yes, sir. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. </p><p>VANCE: Using the keys that Apple maintained I think quite secretly, they would download the content that was called for and we would get back. Now, September 2014, that stopped. Apple stopped because it reengineered its devices so that it could no longer open them. And--and I would just--the--the statistic I'd like to just emphasize again is Apple has never really explained what the vulnerability was prior-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Well, let me ask them. Mr. Neuenschwander, is that right? Okay. When you made this change, what were you trying to prevent? What problem were you trying to solve? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Correct, sir. And--and if I may first just clarify on the process of this, it's frequently shorthanded as device opening, as though we were using a key that we possessed to read the data off the phone. In technical terms, that is not the process that we used. Instead, at that time, for devices running iOS seven and earlier, a majority of the data stored on that device was not encrypted with the users passcode, and so it did not require a key in Apple's position--possession to be able to de-encrypt the data. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, what happened if it was encrypted in 2014? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Even--even in years prior to that, the data that was encrypted with the user passcode was not--because we were unable, was not being turned over to law enforcement. What we did in the data extraction procedure was continue to, up until-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --So, you never really had a key? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: We--we never had that key. And sir, in--to respond to the question about for what reason did we make that change, we became aware of entities other than Apple, boxes easily available-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Are you willing to try to fix this problem? Because somebody needs to. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Absolutely, Senator. And that's part of why I'm here today and part of why I think this conversation is so important. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, real quickly, how do we fix it? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: And, Senator, I apologize, but I don't have a real quick answer. I don't have a good answer. </p><p>GRAHAM: Mr. Professor, how do we fix it? </p><p>TAIT: With enormous difficulty. The--when it comes to opening devices, it is possible to have the device be encrypted but to have the encryption key for the device also secured another ways so that potentially law enforcement or Apple could-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Mr. Neuenschwander, do you agree with that? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: I don't agree with that, sir. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. Mr. Sullivan, do you agree with that? </p><p>SULLIVAN: I think this is a very complicated technical--technical topic. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, it ain't complicated for me. You're going to find a way to do this or we're going to do it for you. We're not going to live in a world where a bunch of child abusers can have a safe haven to practice their craft period, end of discussion. You're either the solution or you're a problem. </p><p>Having said that, I appreciate all your doing to protect our data, our privacy. I don't want people listening to my phone calls or reading my messages. I get all of that. But being an American, I also don't want a situation where criminals can exploit this technology, to hide behind it and do all kinds of dastardly things to kids and maybe the country itself. So, I've been following this for a year. My advice to you is to get on with it. </p><p>[*]GRAHAM: Because this time next year, if we haven't found a way that you can live with, we will impose our will on you. Mr. Sullivan, Facebook, does it routinely provide information to Child Exploitation Protective Services about potential child abuse activities? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Yes, Senator. We-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --How many did it do last year? </p><p>SULLIVAN: In 2018, for the full year, we reported between about 17 to 18 million pieces of content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. </p><p>GRAHAM: Apple, how many did you report? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: 185, Senator. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. Somewhere between 185 and 18 million is probably where we need to be. Thank you. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: The case that I used was an actual case, a lot of people killed, a lot of people injured. The cost to open the device by law enforcement--and it was given to me in a classified way--is obnoxious, it's so high. And so I have formed a very strong opinion that these devices have to be able to be opened when a crime is committed, and this is evidentiary. </p><p>Let me ask you a question, if I might, Mr. Vance. For a long time you've been an advocate for federal legislation to better allow lawful access to encrypted information. Can you provide some specific examples of how being unable to obtain encrypted information has hindered prosecutions, and would you say that the problem of criminals using technology like encryption to evade prosecution has gotten better or worse over the last several years? You are a very respected district attorney of one of America's most major cities, so your views are very important to me. </p><p>VANCE: Thank you, Senator. If I can respond to the second half first, this is the data, and we submitted extensive written testimony, and I think this data summarized--data summarized in it. We receive about 1600 devices a year in the lab that we built in the Manhattan DA's office. It doesn't account for what police do with the devices they have, but in our lab we have 1600 devices. About half of those are Apple devices. And the devices that are Apple devices 82 percent of the time are now locked when they come into our lab. That was about 60 percent four or five years ago, so the increase in devices locked has raised substantially. </p><p>Using technology, our own and that which we purchase, we are able to get into about half the devices. So there are about 300, 400 phones, Apple phones, that we cannot access, even using the technology that we have. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: No matter what the reason is? </p><p>VANCE: No matter what the reason. And I would just like to say also, I think we need to put this in the context of law enforcement. We operate under speedy trial rules and statute of limitations. So if an Apple device comes in and we try to unlock it, we may unlock it in a week. We may not unlock it for two years, or we may never unlock it. And that's really not a way that we can manage this often critical information in the justice system that moves on a time clock where we have to get the evidence within a specified period of time. </p><p>In response very briefly to your first, there are--the range of cases, murder, rape, robberies, sexual assault, I'm not--I do not mean to be dramatic, but there are many, many serious cases where we can't access the device in the time period where it is most important for us to access it. Your examples, San Bernardino, this happened in other recent terrorist attacks in Dayton, Ohio and in Texas, I believe. This is a problem that all law enforcement has, and we really are asking the Senate Committee for your help and for your suggestions on legislation because in my personal view unless--I'm not sure that local, state law enforcement is going to be able to bridge the gap in technology without--without congressional intervention. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, let me ask this. I hope everybody sees how serious this problem is, and I would say I have never been more exercised over a problem because I've seen what has gone behind it in terms of evidence that's not usable, and it seems to me the industry has a responsibility to respond. So I would like to have the representatives from the industry--you heard a very prominent district attorney from New York explain what the situation is. I'd like to have your response on what you are going to do about it. That will determine the degree to which we do something about it. Professor, you don't represent a company now? </p><p>TAIT: I don't, no. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Please, go ahead. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Senator, we're going to continue as we have to work with law enforcement to find ways through this. We have a team of dedicated professionals, as I said in my opening statement, that is working on a daily basis with law enforcement, providing them all the data in our possession to help them prevent and prosecute crimes. At the same time, we understand that the changes-- </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Could I interrupt you for one moment? My understanding is that even a court order won't convince you all to open the device. Is that true? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Senator, I don't think it's a matter of convincing or a court order. It's the fact that we don't have in our capability today the ability to give this data off of a device to law enforcement. We've been in a number of conversations about techniques and evaluating techniques whereby that might be changed, but ultimately we believe that strong encryption makes us all safer, and we haven't found a way to provide access to users' devices that would not weaken security for everyone. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Mr. Sullivan, quickly, do you have a comment? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Thank you, Senator. Well, Facebook--it's important to point out Facebook does not build mobile devices, nor a mobile operating system, so we're less relevant to this particular issue. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, thank you very much. Mr. Vance, do you have a quick answer? </p><p>VANCE: (OFF-MIC) observation. Apple, as indicated, it does not currently have this capacity in its phones. That's because it engineers its phones to no longer have that capacity. If they want to redesign their phones back to a state where it has that capacity to open the devices to permit us to send the devices along with a search warrant to Cupertino, California, for them to open it in their basement in a secure location with a key and download the information, that takes us back to where we were in 2014. </p><p>Today that's impossible, but it's impossible only because Apple decided, without focusing, without seeking intervention from or ideas from congressional leaders or law enforcement, that they were going to reengineer the devices. And what they created, I think they can fix. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thank you. Thank you, Ms.-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Gentlelady yields back. Senator Grassley for five minutes. </p><p>GRASSLEY: I'll start with Mr. Vance. Obviously we've been talking about encryption since it probably reached its boiling point with those terrorist attacks in San Bernardino. However, now in 2019 it's unclear if this debate has changed or if we made any progress. I guess that's the discussion you just had. Assessing this issue is important given what happened at Pensacola over the weekend. It's essential to understand what can and should be done. Since 2015, in your opinion and experience, has investigations and prosecutions that involve digital or electronic evidence improved, particularly with encryption being involved? </p><p>VANCE: I believe that law enforcement, particularly those that can afford it--and that's I think a key point not to forget--our office has continually tried to improve its ability to lawfully hack into Apple devices that are blocked by Apple's redesign. That has cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars. As I indicated earlier, it may be successful in roughly 50 percent of the cases. So we have tried to adapt to be better at accessing the devices, but to use--in all your states they have counties which have resources and counties that don't have any resources at all. </p><p>The amount we spend on accessing these devices in our office is probably the entire law enforcement budget for two thirds of the counties in New York City--New York State. So you have two different systems of justice for victims, one where a prosecutor's office has the resources to use these lawful hacking methods to gain access to devices, maybe, and other counties who don't have the resources and who simply have to outsource the phones to be opened maybe by the state lab, maybe by the FBI, and maybe they'll never get anything at all. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Let me continue with you because I don't want to be talking about this issue four or five years from now. </p><p>[*]GRASSLEY: In other (INAUDIBLE) areas we often see industry stakeholders, academics and government officials coming together to develop workable solutions to any problem. To all, besides you, anybody else that wants to join in, do you think that there could be a more coordinated effort among all stakeholders to identifying existing roadblocks and discuss solutions to the encryption issue? Would it be helpful? </p><p>VANCE: I--I wrote to Mr. Cook and to Larry Page in 2014 after the device encryption had changed, and asked for the opportunity to meet with them and talk with them about our concerns. Those 2014 letters remain unanswered today. </p><p>In my view personally, and--and our--our suggestion, Senator, is that without moving toward legislation, we're not going to solve this problem. And you need legislation. This is so--it's getting so complicated and it's so pervasive that we--and--and in involves victims rights all over the country. It's not just law enforcement, but we're here on behalf of victims. </p><p>And because the problem is so broad, because the parties are so far apart--I think there is a path forward. I believe it's focusing on data at rest, because I think that the concept that is very important to state and local law enforcement, that's where the data that's very important to us resides, and does not get into the more complicated issues of data in motion, which I think need to be tackled in separate legislation. </p><p>So, Senator, I would focus legislative efforts on data at rest today, and I think the parties will come together because you'll be forcing us to come together in order to help you create legislation that would be workable for the country. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Anybody else want to join in that conversation? </p><p>TAIT: Sure. So, I think one of the big problems in this particular debate is we need to decouple the--the data at rest, the--the phone encryption storing from the app encryption story. I do think that we have good potential options when it comes to device encryption, but this is a--ultimately it's a market failure. Nobody in--nobody goes into a store and buys a phone because it's more assessable to the FBI than the one next to it on the shelf, certainly not overseas and--and not even in America. Nobody--that's not a feature for a phone for customers. </p><p>And a consequence of this is that when the--this is an externality. When there's no incentive, no external incentives through regulation to actually mandate that, there is no ability for Apple to say, well, we're going to build our solution, which is a more secure version of allowing law enforcement to access our device than our competitors. At the moment, there's just no incentive at all to sort of engage on that debate at all. </p><p>GRASSLEY: My time's up. Thank you all very much. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Senator Durbin? </p><p>DURBIN: At the heart of is a question not of whether people should be above the law, but whether they're beyond the reach of the law, as I understand Mr. Vance's explanation of what we're discussing here today. And I listened carefully about why encryption is a positive thing, and I can understand that in general terms. And the specifics given by our witnesses are it protects us from hackers and foreign government surveillance. And Mr. Sullivan said it protects us--some Americans from authoritarian regimes. </p><p>But we are not talking about any of those categories here. We're talking about American law enforcement. We're not talking about hackers and foreign governments and authoritarian regimes. We're talking about our government protecting our citizens from such things as trafficking, child photography, and the like. </p><p>The one thing that--and that really took me aback, I guess, was Mr. Sullivan's notion that if--if you get tough and you in Congress decide to establish some standards here, be prepared for foreign app providers to step in and to take over this work. They're not going to be governed by our laws, or supposedly think they can be above our laws, and that just means that the problem has been off shored, sent overseas. Is that what your conclusion is, Mr. Sullivan? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Thank you for the question, Senator. There are messaging apps provided by different providers all over--all over the world, and they are not all provided by American companies. So, if the--if someone wants to--to message their friends and they want an encrypted system, they are likely to switch to something like Line or Viber or one of the other apps that's developed overseas. </p><p>So, when we receive law enforcement requests, we have a whole process. We respond very quickly. We've been very active, and we've also been very proactive especially in the area of child exploitation of imagery and child grooming. If you have to go to another company outside of the U.S. because that's where users go because that's where the services are that they want, then it will be, I believe, harder for you to actually do the types of things that Mr. Vance is referring to. </p><p>DURBIN: Thank you. And I want to get back to you with another question. But Mr. Vance, it really does raise the question as to whether we're going to offshore this problem. </p><p>VANCE: Senator, there are--there are going to continue to be problems and--and as--as technology evolves. </p><p>But back to my point, Senator. Acknowledging everything that the Facebook representative says, what I still want is to get access to whatever's on that device at the murder scene or in a--in a suspect of child abuse. If there is an app on this phone, I can't--that--that we--can't be opened, so be it. But I don't--I will never know anything until I can get into the phone and find out. </p><p>DURBIN: A fair enough. Mr. Sullivan, when Mark Zuckerberg appeared before this committee last year, I asked him about Facebook's Messenger Kids app that allows kids 6 to 12 years old to send video and text messages through Facebook as an extension of their parents account. I have significant cern--concerns about how the data gathered by Facebook Messenger Kids might be used or sold. </p><p>I asked Mr. Zuckerberg at the hearing, \"What guarantees can you give us that no data from Messenger Kids is or will be collected or shares and--shared in ways that violate the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act?\" He responded, and I quote, \"In general, that data is not going to be shared with third parties.\" I said his use of the term in general was provocative and worrisome. </p><p>I followed up in writing, asked him to describe any information collected via Messenger Kids that is shared by Facebook with any third party. Here's his response. We have no plans to include advertising in Messenger Kids. Moreover, there are no in app purchases, and we do not use this data in Messenger Kids to advertise to children or their parents. That wasn't the question I asked him. I said describe any information collected via Messenger Kids shared by Facebook with any third party. </p><p>According to your testimony, you lead Facebook's efforts relating to messaging privacy, safety, security. When it comes to kids using online messenger apps, I'm very concerned about all three of those. I'll ask you the same questions I asked Mr. Zuckerberg. Please describe any information collected via my--Messenger Kids that is shared by Facebook with any third party. </p><p>SULLIVAN: Thank you for the question, Senator. We don't sell data or share data outside of--of--of Facebook. We have messaging communications. We have the Kids app where parents are very involved with who can connect with kids, and they are able to manage their children's messaging so that they can learn how to be online without having to be in one of the systems for adults. </p><p>DURBIN: So, is your answer--and I wanted to be as clear as possible. No information collected via Messenger Kids is shared by Facebook with any third party. </p><p>SULLIVAN: Yes, we don't sell or share data with third parties. </p><p>DURBIN: I'm--thank you for a direct answer. I wish Mr. Zuckerberg had given me that. </p><p>I'm out of time. I have another question, but thank you very much, Madam Chair. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Senator Blackburn? </p><p>BLACKBURN: Senator Cornyn, (INAUDIBLE), sir. </p><p>CORNYN: Thank you. Mr. Vance, I'd like to figure out how we can help law enforcement. I don't know any other realm in which a private company gets to decide unilaterally whether or not to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. This unique, it seems to me. </p><p>And frankly, I don't believe any company ought to be able to unilaterally decide whether to cooperate with law enforcement or not. That's not a decision that we--that they--is theirs to make. It's up to a court ultimately, and we, being a nation of laws, we need to follow--everybody needs to follow lawful court orders. </p><p>And I'm sympathetic to your statement that Apple has intentionally designed their product in a way to make it unavailable to law enforcement. Of course, they market that around the world, and that's one of the--the attributes that--that they use to sell their product. </p><p>But it strikes me that we're in a race to the bottom here. Let's say we've waved a magic wand. You can get access to all of the phones that you wanted for law enforcement purposes. It seems to me like the--and the apps that--encrypted apps, people would migrate to those, and indeed even to things like TikTok, which is run by the Chinese government and ultimately collects data on all of us and really is a threat for all sorts of reasons. But why--it seems to me that this is a race to the bottom, and I--I just don't know. How do we get our arms around it? </p><p>VANCE: At the direction of the leaders of this country, you and your colleagues, I believe that the technology companies can be asked to help answer that question in ways that a simple DA, who doesn't have technological experience, cannot answer it. </p><p>But I would say, if I can, Senator, your first point, these are--obviously these are massive companies. These are our biggest consumer companies in the country in the world. And in--in my experience or my recollection of history, when companies get so big that their products are integrated into our lives, criminal start using those products as well because that's how it works. </p><p>When the Senate passed the CALEA legislation in 1994, the telephone companies were opposing the idea of law enforcement getting access to fiber cable lines after they moved away from copper. But the Congress found a way that enabled law enforcement to gain access in order to conduct Title III wiretaps. That was successful. It's been tested over time and been constitutional. So, the idea that these large problems can't be solved when big business interests are involved, I think the history says that's not correct. </p><p>CORNYN: Well, what--I guess what I can't figure out is what's the incentive of the Facebook and the Apples to cooperate in the solution. Mr. Neuenschwander, are we to conclude that Apple simply does not care whether a victim of child exploitation, whose condition might be discovered through sharing encrypted data on an Apple phone, that Apple simply doesn't care and has no responsibility toward that victim of child exportation? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: You should not conclude that, Senator. </p><p>[*]CORNYN: Right. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: And that's part of why we have our dedicated law enforcement liaison team, to work with law enforcement and provide all of the data that we have. What we see is that that data is effective in finding and in preventing crimes. </p><p>CORNYN: Well, you--you say all of the data you have but do you agree with Mr. Vance's characterization that you intentionally engineered the Apple phone to prevent even apples access to encrypted data? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Well, with respect, Senator, that is not what he said. He said we intentionally engineered it to lockout law enforcement and that characterization I would disagree with. </p><p>CORNYN: Will let me ask--let me ask another question. Did Apple intentionally design their phone, operating system in a way to prevent access by law enforcement or anyone else including Apple to encrypted data? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: With respect to the Apple part I would agree, sir. Given the attacks we solve where entities other than Apple were accessing the phone. Our use says data all around the world the way to do that was to design out the capability which had that data, had the device able to provide that data to Apple or to anyone. </p><p>CORNYN: So Mr. Tait you--Professor Tait you said there has always been a balance between privacy and public safety but I am having a hard time seeing the balance here. </p><p>TAIT: It is certainly true. It is--it is difficult because the problem is that when these tech companies are talking about security they are often talking about security in a very narrow domain. They are not necessarily talking about security including some of these things which are external to their products that perhaps affect other aspects of society as well and that is quite problematic because it is no (INAUDIBLE) necessarily there is no sort of incentive for them to take that into account as well and so when we look at things like device encryption there are some of these externalities that come out that lockout law enforcement. I don't think these tech companies necessarily thought hard enough about how they can get both, how we can have full device encryption but also engineered these devices so that in these you know (INAUDIBLE) circumstances when there is a court order that Apple can still gain--regain access. </p><p>CORNYN: So what Congress--what can Congress do to incentivize these companies to come to the table and come up with that solution? </p><p>TAIT: On device encryption specifically and I want to sort of emphasize that this is different with end to end encryption. Device encryption in the event that Congress regulated to mandate that there was--that access would be provided in the event that there was a court order then what you would see I think is you would see all of the tech companies looking for how they can build that in the most secure way possible and you would have some companies that, companies like Apple and companies like Google outcompeting each other and saying well, we are going to comply with the court order but we are going to do it in this way that we think is safer and their competitors would look at their solution and they would say well, there is this aspect here which I think is a little bit less safe, we are going to engineer our product to be more safe and they could compete on that. But in the absence of any such regulation it would be insane for any of these tech companies to build that kind of a solution because then they would be attacked by their competitors. </p><p>CORNYN: Thank you. </p><p>BLACKBURN: The gentlemen's time has expired. Senator Whitehouse, five minutes. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Vance you mentioned the issue of harm to victims' rights when a car--a crime of which they are the victim goes on prosecuted and they don't get justice. Is there not also an even more dire situation here in a hostage situation, in a kidnapped situation, in a traffic situation, and a terrorist situation in which there is actually the prospect of harm and loss of life to individuals as a result of law enforcement's inability to penetrate these devices? </p><p>VANCE: Absolutely and I--Senator Feinstein alluded to San Bernardino. I alluded to Dayton and the other recent terrorist attack in southern--southern United States where the full information of who those individuals were and who they were communicating to is still not known to federal law enforcement or state law enforcement. So yes. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: And by traditional legal causation standards of but for causation the potential loss of life in a situation of the type I have described could be attributable to these companies encryption. </p><p>VANCE: Yes, absolutely. There are certain urgency-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: So let me ask the two companies who are here. You have both indicated that you believe that your company's believe I should say that there is more good than harm that comes from the manner in which you have encrypted your products and services, correct? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Correct, Senator. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: So you can see that there is harm, correct? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: I concede that there are trade-offs them that there are challenges to law enforcement and of course my heart goes out to the victims-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: I am not so interested in your heart actually because you have a business model that allows you to make a lot of money out of the good that comes from encryption. You market the good that comes from encryption. My question to you is are you also willing to be liable for the bad things that happen if indeed as a results of apples encryption of a device someone dies? Are you willing to accept liability for that death? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Senator, as a software engineer my focus is on trying to provide the strongest security for all of our users and protect them in all cases. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Let me make that a question for the record then. See if you can get me an answer on that. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Certainly, Senator. We will get back to you. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Because to me it is bad enough when the case here is that there's good and there's bad and we are going to make money off the good and we are going to accept liability for the bad even though there is real harm to law enforcement and two other principles and interest involved. That is not great but it's really bad if what you are saying is our companies, Apple and Facebook are going to make money off of encrypting our products and services but when the harm comes to pass we want protection from that. </p><p>We don't want to own that. That is somebody else's responsibility. That is as Professor Tait described it an externality whose consequences we would like to dodge. Where I come from that's not only morally wrong, that is economically wrong. So if there is one thing that I think we should take away from all of this it is if you are going to go down this road of unreachable encryption then you recognize will cause both harm and good you have to be willing to own up and take responsibility for the harm. Thanks. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Senator yields back. Senator Lee, five minutes. </p><p>LEE: Thank you Madame Chairman. Mr. Neuenschwander I would like to start with you. We have been talking about this from a public policy standpoint about what we wish were the case. We have to accept the fact that number one, this technology emerged in response to consumer demand, correct? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Correct, Senator. </p><p>LEE: People wanted a device on which they could securely communicate and you have to operate in a world where the consumer demand is saying one thing and--and a similar thing is being said actually by policymakers when we are talking in the context of privacy protection. We frequently hold hearings where we rail against companies that fail adequately to correct weaknesses in their system that could leave users of technology vulnerable to having their data disclosed, isn't that right? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: That is my understanding, sir. </p><p>LEE: Is it technologically feasible for you to provide a back door even if it's a back door that is perhaps accessible by law enforcement personnel or as Mr. Vance has suggested could be accessible only by in your case Apple, by personnel at Apple headquarters without creating a vulnerability that could lead to a breach of data privacy on the part of a user including a child who happens to be a user? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Senator, my experience and this goes not only through my work at Apple but also my involvement personally directly with conversations on ways to investigate this concept of backdoors or a master key or these sorts of ideas and at this time we can't think of, we have been unable to identify any way that we could create a back door that would work only for the good guys and in fact our experiences the opposite that when we have weaknesses in our system they are exploited by nefarious entities as well. </p><p>LEE: Event if the practice of law enforcement became one in which they would send you the device and you had to open it up creating the ability for you to open up would also create a vulnerability for someone on the outside to reverse engineer it and hack it? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Correct, sir, and that is as I said before we did not have the key to read the data before so we have actually never possessed that key. We always thought that that would be a grave weakness and a point of single attack for many well-resourced entities. But if we were to revert back to the way that it was in 2014 we would be back in the state where, and street criminals could get devices, plug them into cheap equipment and dump the data off of anybody's phone to steal their identity, commit financial fraud or otherwise harass in the customer. </p><p>LEE: This would in turn lead to exploitation of innocent victims including children in many circumstances would it not? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: That is my view, sir. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Vance, what is your response to this point that if we were to enact a law requiring the creation of such a tool that that tool would result number one in exploitation of vulnerabilities within that system and number two just as importantly would resort to--result in people resorting to other technologies, other devices perhaps manufactured outside the United States, not subject to the same regulations or using a device manufactured in the United States using a third-party data encryption app? You seem to acknowledge a few minutes ago on that latter point that we still wouldn't be able to get around that. </p><p>VANCE: Senator, breaking down your question I apologize if I overlooked something. When the telephone companies were told that they had to (INAUDIBLE) change their--agree to a law that enabled law enforcement to have access for title III wiretap they didn't leave the United States. Competition didn't stop. When we told banks in the 1970s that they had to have know your customer regulations and electronic filings and data that they had to provide to law enforcement so that we could identify what criminals were using banks where that didn't end competition in banking. So the statement by companies that if you do this it is game over we are going to be essentially I would say economically hurt to the point where it would be bad for the American economy I think history thus far says that's not the case. </p><p>LEE: Mr.--Mr. Vance it strikes me that the comparison you just made I mean it is a little bit like comparing a pen register with a full-blown title III wiretap. That would actually be understating the difference between the ability to get a wiretap court order and gain access to somebody's device, a device on which they carry their personal information, their health information, their personal communications, their financial transactions and in many cases these are devices that are now held by children however--however advisable or inadvisable people might regard that children routinely have these things now and don't you think the comparison is strained a little bit by that? And do you think it is fair for (INAUDIBLE) to say that the comparison between a pen register and a title III wiretap understates the difference of disparity that you are talking about here which is the difference between a wiretap and gaining access to somebody's personal device? </p><p>VANCE: Well, with regard to ending that encryption, Senator if I am understanding your question, apologies if I am not. I believe this--I believe this requires longer work and direction from this committee and others with regard to the issue to data at rest or what the professor calls device data I--I would--I have these points. We still don't have an answer to why the lawyer--the lawyer for Apple in 2016 said that with regard to the practice that the company used up until they moved to IOS eight that there had never been a breach of that process by which--by which they got access to the devices and if there was a breach, Senator, which I think goes to another point the question is what's the risk? </p><p>Did it happen--did the breach happen once? Did it happen 10 times? Did it happen 1000 times because you really can't measure which is more important until you understand actually what the harm would be and what the harm was if there ever was a breach at Apple because I respectfully can say that on the other side of the equation there is enormous harm to victims of crime around the country by the inability of law enforcement to access these devices. So was Apple breached when it had iOS seven? If so? How many times? If non-why can't we return to that state? Again I am not a technologist but I am just going through the experience that I have gone through working this issue over the last 10 years. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. I see my time has expired. I would love to have Mr. Neuenschwander be able to respond to that. Perhaps I could take it up in a subsequent round door maybe one of my colleagues will ask it and allow him to answer. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Without objection. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. </p><p>BLACKBURN: We will do that later. Senator Coons, five minutes. </p><p>COONS: Thank you, Senator Blackburn and thank you to the members of this panel. As--as we wrestle with the appropriate way to balance the encryption to protect individual data and to provide protection for human rights advocates, minority politicians and people's privacy overseas with the understandable frustration of law enforcement who seek access to data and images and messages that are essential to solving crimes. </p><p>Just a few questions, if I might. Mr. Sullivan, I worked for years to protect victims of child abuse and am concerned child predators will continue to use Facebook products like Messenger to harm the most vulnerable. Once that service is end to end encrypted, what new and affirmative steps is Facebook planning to take to ensure your products aren't favored by individuals looking to exploit and harm children? And will Facebook be able to verify that images that would have been reported prior to end to end encryption are not being transferred on Messenger once that happens? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Senator, thanks for the question. First, I should say we believe there is no place for these activities on our products, and because of that we've built a team-- </p><p>COONS: --So you're against child pornography and child abuse? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Absolutely. </p><p>COONS: Thank you for clarifying that. </p><p>SULLIVAN: Well, it's important to point out that we have about 35,000 people working on enforcing these standards and trying to keep our communities safe. When encryption comes we have basically three areas that we're looking at, what we call prevention, detection and response. Prevention is the idea that we can prevent a bad actor from even reaching a child in the first place, and there are many ways that we can do that because, remember, the Facebook app and the Instagram app are still fully available to what people post, what they say, and we can identify bad actors. And this is something we're partnering with NCMEC and others to discuss good ways to be able to do that. On the response side, when someone receives a piece of content in Messenger, even after it's encrypted, they can report-- </p><p>COONS: --I only have three minutes, so let's get to the (INAUDIBLE) of it, if we can. </p><p>SULLIVAN: It's an important point. They can still report that content, and we will then receive the content of those messages because a user has chosen to--to--to say hey, this is objectionable, there's something wrong with this. And we'll continue to be able to flag those images-- </p><p>COONS: --(INAUDIBLE) someone who is actively engaging in the trade of child pornography. They're not going to complain about it. </p><p>SULLIVAN: No, well, yeah, so what happens is some of these bad actors, they attempt to contact many people. So we understand their playbook a little better. When they do that, all it takes is one person to make a report, and then we can find a bad actor that would have reached out to many, many, many people. So what I'm trying to say is a lot of our techniques are what we call behavioral based on the people and how they interact and not necessarily 100 percent reliant on content. I'm sorry for the long answer. I wanted to really explain-- </p><p>COONS: --Thank you for the answer, Mr. Sullivan. Professor Tait, if I might, broadly speaking we seem to be at an impasse between industry and law enforcement. You mentioned in your opening comments good potential options to overcome device encryption. Could you briefly be more specific about the options you see? </p><p>TAIT: Sure. I've written in the past about a couple of options that are available, which in the interest of time it might be better to submit for the record. But when it comes to end to end encryption, that's very different. Device hacking I think remains the most plausible option with regard to conducting wiretaps of end to end encrypted apps, and for retaining cyber tips, I think sort of on device scanning remains a potential option. I don't want to overstate how--you know, that is quite a difficult task. and I know that many tech companies have invested in looking at that. But those do remain options to avoid damaging their end to end encryption on apps. </p><p>COONS: And Mr. Neuenschwander, you, if I understood you correctly, disagree that a solution exists that would allow any access to encrypted data on iPhones. Why are solutions such as what Professor Tait's referencing not possible? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: So first of all, Senator, we have never represented, and certainly in my declarations I never represented that it's impossible. What we think is that the weakness that it would cause for everyone's devices is a bad trade-off. So in our investigations of it, and again I want to stress that we never had this key that has been referred to back in 2014 that we decided to get rid of, and so creating a system where that key would be created and held by Apple, we think is something that would put all devices at risk. But I agree with Professor Tait; it's an issue of many different dimensions, and we welcome continued conversation an investigation to find balances. </p><p>COONS: Well, I think the general sentiments expressed by many of my colleagues should be clear that there is a great enthusiasm for finding a solution that allows law enforcement timely, reasonable and affordable access to critical evidence of crime, and we hear your argument that this may simply push to overseas providers the provision of encryption services, but I'll be interested in following up on what Mr. Tait submits for the record and then seeing whether there is some balance possible here. But frankly, most of us are concerned about protecting the most vulnerable Americans. Thank you. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Senator Ernst, five minutes. </p><p>ERNST: Thank you, Madam Chair. I think you've heard time and time again just how important this topic is in protecting those that need to be protected. I'd like to go back just a little bit in time, Mr. Vance. If you could talk to me about how was child pornography distributed before the advent of the internet? </p><p>VANCE: Before the advent of the internet it was distributed through mail, through interpersonal communication and through photographs. </p><p>ERNST: And it could be prosecuted, correct? </p><p>VANCE: It could be prosecuted, and in those instances, assuming we knew where the child sexual assault images were, we'd execute a search warrant on someone's home, or car or safe-deposit box, and we'd access it. </p><p>ERNST: And no opposition to going after child pornography when it was distributed in that way, correct? </p><p>VANCE: None. </p><p>ERNST: Okay, so how about now? Talk to me about how are ways that these predators are distributing child pornography? </p><p>VANCE: Well, like so many things, unfortunately the--I believe the amount of material that's being created and disseminated has gotten much bigger because there is a global market for photographs of child sexual exploitation and assault, and as in the case that I referenced from our office, many times these are tragic circumstances where children are abused by the person who is photographing them, or someone is photographing the child abuse and it's put online. It may be shared in the dark web, but there is a very active, big industry globally around the dissemination of child sexual assault images on the internet. </p><p>ERNST: And we have the end to end encryption now. Can you talk about how that affects your ability to prosecute? </p><p>VANCE: It's--it's very difficult. What we see actually in this space is the movement toward encryption, as in--as in--for example, as in sex trafficking and prostitution that people are moving to apps in order to order or to access, you know, access information to communicate between people who are sharing these images. So it has gotten much more complicated, and I understand what Professor Tait says, and I agree with him. The situation around the apps, this is something that I don't--we may not figure it out today, but I think we're going to have to figure it out over time. I do think we can figure some things out today. </p><p>ERNST: Which we need to. I think you've heard time and time again. And to you, Mr. Neuenschwander and Mr. Sullivan, you have stated that you'd like to work, like to work with us, right? You are appalled at child pornography and other nefarious activities out there? Can you say that you will proactively change the way you do business without an act of Congress? Can you say that? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Senator, speaking on behalf of Facebook, we've been steadily beefing up our efforts in this area to around 35,000 people who are monitoring content, making reports. And we're actively developing new systems to identify bad actors before they can spread that imagery. So we have a lot of things we're working on, and the reason we're here and the reason we announced our plans to encrypt Messenger around two years in advance was to have these working sessions, and I feel like we will be able to find better ways to keep children safe. </p><p>ERNST: Yeah, I understand the prevention aspect of it. I think that's very important. But bad actors do find a way around that. So how are we going to enable the good guys to access that type of information if they have a valid warrant? </p><p>SULLIVAN: I should state that Facebook is not a provider of the devices or the device operating systems. I think it's important the distinction that Professor Tait made on the device side is the most likely avenue for law enforcement to, to have a--to (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>ERNST: Okay, thank you. Let's hear from Apple, please. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Well, Senator, we also find that the information that we are providing today in our work with law enforcement as much as there is a device component, there is also a cloud and cloud services component, and this is a case where we are able to be responsive to law enforcement and are on a continual basis, both for child sexual abuse material as well as for other crimes. And so, we're going to continue to staff up and increasingly train law enforcement, and train and be trained by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on better ways to approach this problem. We can and should do more, and we will. </p><p>ERNST: Yeah, absolutely. I would agree with that. You have made this statement, Mr. Neuenschwander, that--that the good guys, you want to encrypt for--for people that are using it for financial transactions, etc., but the bad guys will try and infiltrate. Well, I would say the bad guys have already infiltrated because they're exploiting the system for nefarious activities already. </p><p>And so, we really do need you folks to step up and really help us out in this area. Too much has gone on for way too long. Did you want to follow up, Mr. Vance, or are you-- </p><p>VANCE: --Well, I--I--I want to say that where we are today, having not address this issue, grabbed--you know, grabbed the collar and said this--we are moving forward with it, it's a coin toss whether we get into phones. It's a 50 per--it's a 50/50 flip. </p><p>And we are the most resource--resourced prosecutor's office in the country on this issue. We have our own lab. We have our own technicians. But I can only get into if--of the Apple devices that come in, I can only get into 50 percent of them, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of technology to do that which other people can afford. And that may--I may be able to get in in a day or I may never be able to get in. </p><p>ERNST: Um-hmm. </p><p>VANCE: This is where we are-- </p><p>ERNST: --Certainly-- </p><p>VANCE: --Five years after this--the hearings in 2015. And--and I think we're also here today because the tech companies roles in accessing private data, they're--they're--they're real positions around privacy are--are different, perceived different. </p><p>ERNST: Right. My time is expired, but I--we do need to see folks coming together and do this without an act of Congress, because if you are not--you've heard the chairman, you've heard the ranking member, that if it doesn't happen by you, it--it will happen by Congress. I think you'd rather find the solution that have Congress do it for you. Thank you, Madam Chair. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Senator Blumenthal? </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Madam Chairman. Thank you all for being here today. Thank you especially, District Attorney Vance, for your consistent and constant effort on this topic, which goes back--your leadership goes back years. </p><p>On November 18th, Senator Hawley, Cornyn, Graham, Hirono joined me in a letter to the tech companies, 36 of them. We wrote to ask about their efforts to detect, remove, and report child sexual abuse material, CSAM. From the initial responses we have received, there is a very wide variety of commitment. Facebook wrote us a lengthy and very detailed letter. Mr. Neuenschwander, we have yet to hear from Apple. Why is that? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Senator, I--I couldn't say as to exactly why. I was informed of your letter as part of my preparation for this hearing, and I believe our government affairs team will have a response back to you very shortly. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I'm sure they will. I am disappointed that in preparation for this hearing Apple, with all its resources, couldn't explain to us what it is doing to address this problem in response to a bipartisan letter. </p><p>This letter was prompted by a report in the New York Times that showed, in effect, the internet has become a den of child exploitation. According to the New York Times, Facebook was responsible for 12 million of the 18.4 million reports to NCMEC in 2018. In contrast, Apple sent 43 reports. I have a hard time believing that's because there is less child-abuse involving iPhones. What do you think? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Well, Senator, we have been working to increase our scanning and working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, including working through our law enforcement team. We field additionally dozens of requests per month regarding-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --Would you agree with me you're not working fast enough or hard enough? That disparity is absolutely staggering. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Senator, I--I absolutely agree that we can and will be doing more. Our businesses are different, however. We don't have forms for strangers to contact each other. We don't have a platform for people to widely disseminate content. And our business doesn't have us scanning material of our users to build profiles or (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, I agree with you there are different business models, but I see no excuse here, either technical or operational. IMessage is end-to-end encrypted, but so is WhatsApp. Facebook is still able to ban 250,000 accounts a month for child exploitation. I've seen the numbers from companies a fraction of your size, and they vastly exceed Apple. </p><p>Mr. Sullivan, what is it you're doing that Apple is not? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Senator, thank you for the question. I think the--the thing that drives it all is the feeling of responsibility we have. Someone asked earlier a question about, you know, how do we view our responsibility in--in the world, and are we just trying to follow a--a--a narrow legal thing. </p><p>We've--we have a platform that serves billions of people around the world, and we view part of our responsibility as keeping them safe. And we're in this world where we want to give them security and privacy and safety. For us, it's--they're not in opposition. It's--it's one package that results in trust. </p><p>And, you know, we know, especially now, how hard we have to work. So, that commitment results in 35,000 people working on this issue, a great increase in our hearing effort, to give one example, artificial intelligence tools to scan these images. The bad actors will make small changes to these images, and we keep working on our tools so that we can detect them over time and continued the reporting that we do. </p><p>So, I think it's just a matter of commitment that results in people, money, engineering, and ultimately hopefully results, although we have more to do. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: So, you're suggesting that the disparity in those statistics is a lack of responsibility. </p><p>SULLIVAN: I'm--I'm only going to speak to what we do and what our responsibility is. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, I think that's the inevitable-- </p><p>SULLIVAN: --I don't want to criticize-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --Conclusion of your explanation. And I just want to drive home the point that my colleague, Senator Whitehouse, was making. Right now big tech enjoys uniquely, and I want to emphasize uniquely, almost complete immunity from legal responsibility by virtue of Section 230. And that will end because the American people are losing patience, as you've heard around this table. </p><p>So, I hope you take the message back, Mr. Neuenschwander. And it's not only you, it's others in the industry, who are using this shield without a sense of responsibility that comes with it, that that kind of immunity will be short-lived if big tech isn't able to do better. And I hope that you will respond to the letter that we wrote you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>BLACKBURN: The gentleman yields back. Mr. Neuenschwander, I want to come to you first. I--I think that it is fair to say that each of us on this committee--as you hear, we value privacy and an individual's right to privacy. We also want to use every tool available to catch every criminal out there, especially those that are exploiting our children. </p><p>But it is troubling to me to hear you say that giving the key to law enforcement would cause a weakness in the device that would be a bad trade-off. Catching criminals is never a bad trade-off. And what you're doing by negating the access to the key, which did exist, is it you're shielding criminals. And basically what you're doing is creating a sanctuary cloud where these criminals say this is our safe harbor. This is our sanctuary. </p><p>And that is why, on a bipartisan basis, you are hearing us say, you know, we've slapped your hand enough and you all have got to get your act together, or we will gladly get your act together for you. But this is not going to continue and you can't approach it that way. </p><p>So, let me ask you this so that we have some clarity for the record. What type data is Apple making available to law enforcement? And where do you draw the boundary when it comes to iMessage and iCloud and individual devices? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Yes, Senator, and thank you. In terms of what data that we provide, I'll give you a list which I'm sure is not exhaustive. And we can refer you back to our public guide. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Well, then let's do this. </p><p>[*]BLACKBURN: Let's have you, for the record, give that exhaustive list because as we look at what we are going to do to police this, you all like to say we are the new public square but guess what the public square has a cop on the beat and if you all can't do that we will do that, but there will be a cop on the beat. So let's have you submit that for the record, and then let's also have you talk a little bit about when I cloud is turned on and that key is in the cloud how you expect to make that available to individuals like Mr. Vance who are trying to protect the public. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Yes, Senator, and we-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay, thank you. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: We will submit that document. It is public, and so that will be very easy to do. We in fact want-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: That would be great. That (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: --everyone in law enforcement to know about this, and it does include cloud data. You ask where we draw the line and senator, where we draw the line is that we will provide after our legal team has reviewed for lawful process we will provide all data in our position. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. Then let me ask you this. Mr. Vance, does he have the line in the right place? </p><p>VANCE: Senator, focusing on your question around the cloud this is why-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Do you agree that the cloud has become a sanctuary for bad actors? </p><p>VANCE: I think the cloud and other areas where data is stored can become a sanctuary but let's remember that if you are a smart criminal, you don't back up to the cloud. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. </p><p>VANCE: Number one. Number two you can turn off various elements of the phone that you don't want backed up to the clouds. Second, the cloud your--your device now comes with 64 GB admin iPhone and you only-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Let me--let me move over from that because I do want to come to Mr. Sullivan and give you the opportunity to correct the record from your previous statement about Facebook not sharing or selling in the of the data on children. </p><p>I did a very quick Google search, and I see that you all have paid children $20 for sharing data, and then also when it comes to Messenger Kids the way you are collecting data there. So if you would like to speak to that because we are concerned about the exposure of children and what is happening to children. </p><p>You know we can say social media and the Internet does a world of good. Yes, indeed, it does but you also are providing some avenues that shield criminals that give them sanctuary, that give them more inside into a child's life than they would ever have been able to get. So would you like to speak to that? </p><p>SULLIVAN: First of all I wasn't aware of this $20-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: I will be happy to share it with you. </p><p>SULLIVAN: I will--I will--yes, please do because I will--I want to take that on and understand that and--and go back with the team and understand what that program would possibly be. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Well, let me just inform you Facebook has been paying teenagers to turn over almost everything about themselves. The program is open to people ages 13 to 35, but ads that ran on Instagram and Snapchat specifically ask for participants to be 16 to 17 years old. I will be more than happy to share this with you because it was a Google article. My time has expired. Ms. Hirono, you are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. Mr. Sullivan, so you have been nowhere we are all concerned, of course of child predators, exploitation, etc. So according to the Justice Department, 16.8 million of the 18.4 million reports to the U.S. National Center for missing and exploited children in 2018 were made by Facebook, and two-thirds of those reports came from Facebook messenger. How many of those Facebook Messenger reports were the results of Facebook's analysis of the contents of the message? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Thank you for the question, Senator. For both our private messaging systems and for our public square what we call face--Facebook and Instagram we run algorithms on--on those images, and there are two things that happen. We can sometimes find an image that is a previous--a copy of a previous child's exploited native image or we detect new ones and we have been working on this program since 2011, 2012 and we scan images, upload new ones and find matches of existing ones is how it works. </p><p>HIRONO: So you are talking about content, though, but how many of those millions of reports were based on your content analysis? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Those--those are-- </p><p>HIRONO: The majority? </p><p>SULLIVAN: I'm sorry, those are the images that people are sending to each other, so those are message content and content in the Facebook app. </p><p>HIRONO: I am waiting for an answer to my question because I wanted to know, are you saying that most of the reports from Messenger were based on your content? </p><p>SULLIVAN: I'm sorry, yes, those are message content, yes. </p><p>HIRONO: And I understand that Facebook believes that it will still be able to identify communications involving child sexual abuse material even after it encrypts Facebook Messenger. Can you explain what steps Facebook plans to take and are you going to make a--an analysis of the--your ability to--to make these kinds of reports based on your content and then what happens if--once encryption takes place? Are you going to be able to get to the content? </p><p>SULLIVAN: That's a great question, Senator. So we are taking action in a number of areas. First of all, we are trying to prevent bad actors from even making contact with people so what we call working upstream of the basic problem of how predators contact people and how they share images with each other because we will still have access to the Facebook app which is unencrypted, the Instagram app which is unencrypted. So we will have many sources of information. </p><p>In Messenger itself, one of the ways that we receive the--the unencrypted message content is when people report messages that violate our community's standards and we have been working very hard to increase that user-generated reporting. We are seeing some promising early results so I believe that we will be able to help prevent people from making these contacts in the first place, detect them and then have reporting and continued action thing proactively with law enforcement and with child safety groups going forward but it is going to take a lot of work. </p><p>That is what it sounds like because right now you are able to get into the content, but with encryption you are not going to be able to and since most of the reports that are made are based on content I don't know how you are not going to see a pretty significant decrease I would say in the number of reports that you are able to make. So are you pretty much committed to encrypting your Messenger service, or will you review the impact on reporting of the encryption and if it--if--if the reports drop by 50 percent or 75 percent or some other large number would you reconsider encrypting? </p><p>SULLIVAN: The current plan is you know we provide messaging systems for billions of people, and we want all of them to have the privacy, safety and security that we all enjoy when we send messages to each other so that--the plan is to cooperate over the next couple of years to keep working through this problem until we get to a point where we feel like we have new mechanisms that are going to help keep people safe. That is why we announced this so early and didn't just drop it on the world so that we could work through this issue with all of the relevant stakeholders and you know I just want to zoom out a little bit like the--the reason those reports are in those numbers and the one report is terrible obviously, the reason they are at that level is because of the commitment and the effort that we put into that. Now we are shifting that effort and saying, hey, what are the methods that we can use as the whole world has moved to encrypted messaging so that we can continue to be the leader in keeping people safe there? </p><p>HIRONO: I am out of time. I--I will submit some other questions for the record but obviously, the--the time that it is going to take for you to be able to identify these--make these terrible images and get rid of them it is going to--it seems very daunting considering the billions of messages that are being put out there. Thank you. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Senator Tillis, five minutes. </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Neuenschwander--might I pronounce that right? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Yes, Senator. </p><p>TILLIS: Can you tell me a little bit about the steps that Apple has taken to be compliant with Australia's encryption laws? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Senator, I am not--from these software engineering standpoint where my focus is I am not aware of any steps that we have had to take under that law. </p><p>TILLIS: I mean it's a law that is basically focused on your platform, so I was just curious your--your--I don't know how you deal--or--well, let me put it a different way. Let's assume that that is model legislation we implemented here in the United States, would it be problematic and why? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Senator, so we--we oppose that legislation as it was being drafted and I do think it could be problematic. </p><p>TILLIS: For what reasons? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: I think that it attempts to have language to avoid what they call a systemic vulnerability or requiring that to be put into a device, but that's a difficult and ill-defined concept in that legislation and my overall fear would be that if some of the capabilities of that legislation were imposed on any provider that that provider would have to weaken encryption just by the nature of the technology for all users and it (INAUDIBLE)--I wouldn't say necessarily it was focused on our platform. Encryption is wide-ranging across a large number of platforms and I don't see anything in that act which would leave any provider potentially out of weakening their systems and services. </p><p>TILLIS: Just a--just for the record I know that Mr. Cook has stated publicly that there has been no accommodation, in the foreign jurisdiction including China in terms of providing access to information for say Chinese consumers is that correct? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Correct, Senator. We have never built a back door for anyone. </p><p>TILLIS: And I think maybe for Mr. Tait or--or for the entire panel to what extent can we really rely on industry? I think Mr. Vance mentioned 2015 is when we took this up for the first time, and quite honestly this sounds a whole lot like that hearing in terms of working on things but what can we do to provide a solution to this that does not require a congressional or a legislative solution? What can you tell these members that you are working on as an industry, Mr. Tait as an observer to where we are going to see progress fairly quickly and not have another hearing in 2024 that sounds a lot like this one with child exploitation and a number of horrible things that we hear (INAUDIBLE) now continuing to occur? </p><p>TAIT: Well, I think for device encryption, that is a very difficult thing; that is, there really isn't incentives for technology companies to be proactive on this topic. There is-- </p><p>TILLIS: Mr. Tait do you agree though if--if we don't get this right if every device looked like it was wide open or potentially gaining access to it or having a back door that it would undermine a lot of the valid commerce and uses of these devices? </p><p>TAIT: Sir, I don't think anyone is suggesting that we roll back to a state where these devices are unencrypted and where common criminals on the streets can gain access to these devices. </p><p>[*]TAIT: In the event that Congress required, of course, that--with a court order that these devices had to be accessed, you know, it's possible that Apple might say well we're going to have an unencrypted device, but then Google could say well we have a better solution; we're going to encrypt it with a key that we control, and then Apple would lose out in sort of the marketplace of ideas there that, you know, they wouldn't be able to sell that product as easily. </p><p>So I think that when we're looking at device encryption, there really isn't a good solution at the moment absent a regulatory solution. When it comes to end to end encryption, I think that regulated solutions are much less, much less useful. The app companies in question are very much smaller. They're very often overseas. </p><p>TILLIS: Well, that was going to be my next question. We can--we have to look at this as a global threat in jurisdictions that are not necessarily subject to U.S. law, which is why we've got to figure out how to fix this and have platforms here that are reliable and not just see this move offshore and the criminal enterprise continue. </p><p>TAIT: Sure. So when we look at device encryption, the three main companies that are providing device encryption are Microsoft, and Apple, and Google. All of them have operating incomes of like $35 billion or so, or in Apple's case much more. They're all big U.S. companies. If Congress chose to regulate them, they could. When we look at app end to end encryption apps, WhatsApp at the point where it was acquired by Facebook had 200 million users and 50 employees. When we look at Telegram, it has 300 million employees--or 300 million users. It has about 15 core members. It's based overseas. When we look at Wire is an end to end encrypted Messenger. It's got roughly 50 employees as of 2016. It's based in Switzerland. So the opportunities to regulate there I think are much harder. </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Senator Hawley, five minutes. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Sullivan, I've seen the news reports this morning about your boss' letter to the attorney general, which he says that Facebook is very committed to end to end encryption, is very committed to its users' privacy. I have to save a question or two about that, however. You said earlier in response to Senator Durbin that Facebook doesn't share data outside Facebook, but yet the FTC has reported, and indeed Facebook has been fined--not enough in my view, but fined--for doing precisely that. Let me just remind you the FTC has reported that Facebook in 2014 told developers on their platform that they could continue to collect personal data for a year. After that period elapsed, Facebook continued to provide developers with access to data for years to come. FTC says it took Facebook at least until June of last year to stop providing access to data to--this personal data--certain third-party apps. So maybe you could clarify. </p><p>SULLIVAN: I'd like to clarify. I'm sorry, what I thought the question was was do we sell messages from Messenger Kids is what I was trying to answer earlier. So I'm--I'm--I didn't mean to conflate that we don't have a developer program where third-party developers--and I understand the, you know, what you are referring to with the FTC. So I was referring to the Messenger Kids message content only. </p><p>HAWLEY: But just to be clear, Facebook has collected and shared personal data outside of Facebook, correct? </p><p>SULLIVAN: I wouldn't want to rehash the whole FTC thing you're talking about, but what I can tell you is that over the last several years, but especially recently, the way that we collect and manage metadata is really changing, and I appreciate--I just want to refer to a letter-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Actually, that's all--I'd rather you not. And I would just note for the record that at this late stage, after all that we have been through with the FTC, after the fine, which I say again I think was not nearly enough that was levied, you still won't answer that question yes. It just amazes me. I mean, do they send you to school to evade our questioning? Why can't you just say yes, Facebook has collected data, you have shared it with third-party developers? You were fined for it and probably should have been fined more based on your answers today. </p><p>Let me ask a few other questions. Will you commit to me today that Facebook will not use any metadata from your supposedly encrypted messages for purposes of targeting advertisements or building profiles on users? Yes or no? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Senator, the question of metadata is what we're actively working on. I read your letter of--of May 14, I believe, and our response to that letter, and I think-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Your response was equivocal. You wouldn't commit one way or the other, so I'm giving you a chance now. </p><p>SULLIVAN: It's still--yeah, it's still--it's still early, so when we announced that Messenger was going to be encrypted, the reason we did it around two years ahead of-- </p><p>HAWLEY: So it's still early, meaning you haven't decided? </p><p>SULLIVAN: It means--so let me lay out what I think kind of the core, the core trade-offs and issue-- </p><p>HAWLEY: No, that's okay. I don't want to hear the trade-offs. I just want to hear where you are. So have you--have you decided? It sounds like to me you're keeping open the possibility of collecting metadata and using it even on supposedly encrypted messages. </p><p>SULLIVAN: Metadata--part of what is the metadata is what's going to help us keep children and other people safe. So when we have encrypted communications, part of the metadata is what we will use to prevent bad actors from contacting children in the first place, from detecting, say someone's tried to contact multiple minors in a short period of time. We can immediately ban them from our platinum to keep children safe. So there is a balance we have to-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Okay, I'm going to take that as a--sounds to me like that's leaning to yes. How about this? Will Facebook swear off any other future or present efforts to find workarounds to get information about the nature of users' encrypted communications for ad targeting purposes? </p><p>SULLIVAN: So Senator, take Messenger, which is what I focus on. We don't use the content of people's messages today to target ads, even though Messenger is unencrypted. </p><p>HAWLEY: And you won't try and--and figure out what links they're sending in order to target ads? You won't try to gather other information? </p><p>SULLIVAN: No, I mean, we won't even have--sorry to interrupt you. </p><p>HAWLEY: No, that's okay. </p><p>SULLIVAN: Once it's encrypted--so today we have the ability and we don't use it for targeting. In the future when it's encrypted we won't even be able to see people's content, which is part of the goal of encryption is people don't want Facebook looking at their messages either. </p><p>HAWLEY: And you won't attempt to--to, for instance, reverse engineer what links people are sharing over encrypted messages? </p><p>SULLIVAN: They'll be--we won't be able to. We won't be able to see the message content. </p><p>HAWLEY: Will you promise not to target ads based on information you can retrieve from shifting AI to the device from the cloud onto devices? </p><p>SULLIVAN: So within Messenger we won't be seeing the content in the cloud or in transit, as we call it. Nor will we be scanning the content on the device. So we won't--we won't be able to--we won't have access to it to run any algorithm on it because we believe that we're trying to create an end to end system of trust, not just on the server. So we don't plan to look at content on the client either. So--and that would include, you know, any uses. </p><p>HAWLEY: I see my time is expired. I'll submit as a question for the record the question for Professor Tait and maybe for all of you, which is that when it comes to building backdoors onto the devices as you've talked about, Professor Tait, as one possible solution, I think my big question is, how does one do that without making it easier for entities like Beijing, or Russia to gain access to that device? I think that's a big concern. Thank you, Madam Chair. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Senator Kennedy, five minutes. </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you, Madam Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here. Mr. Sullivan, Facebook isn't scared of Congress, is it? </p><p>SULLIVAN: I guess what I would say is, you know, let me explain where we're at. We take our responsibility to the American people and--very seriously. </p><p>KENNEDY: I understand, but that was a simple question. Let me--let me preface it by saying we've been talking for three years about the fact that our large social media companies, most of which originated in America, about which I am very proud, we've been talking about the fact that our large social media companies are no longer companies; their countries. They've got more power than most countries. And we've been talking about ways to protect people's privacy and when there should be exceptions, and we've been threatening to do something. We haven't done anything. When it comes to social media and privacy, we couldn't pass gas. So Facebook isn't scared of Congress, is it? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Senator, first of all, let me give you a very direct answer to your question. We have the utmost respect for what we're trying to do here today to make our services more private, but I would be happy to tell you what we're doing in the area of privacy. </p><p>KENNEDY: You can tell me. We'll talk afterwards. </p><p>SULLIVAN: Okay. </p><p>KENNEDY: Apple's not scared of Congress, is it, sir? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Senator, I think that we're respectable of Congress, and it's part of why I'm pleased to be here to answer your questions. </p><p>KENNEDY: All right. Let me ask you, Mr.--is it Neuenschwander? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Certainly, sir. </p><p>KENNEDY: Apple has been--has been an advocate of encryption for a while. Is that correct? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: That's correct. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay, and Facebook is sort of--just got religion (PH), right? </p><p>SULLIVAN: The WhatsApp messaging app has been encrypted since-- </p><p>KENNEDY: You just started to embrace encryption? </p><p>SULLIVAN: The WhatsApp messaging app that we provide-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Have you just started to embrace encryption? </p><p>SULLIVAN: If I may just finish the one answer, WhatsApp has been encrypted since 2016, and we preannounced Messenger's plans about two years in advance. </p><p>KENNEDY: Didn't your--didn't--isn't the reason that Facebook decided to embrace encryption because of your competition with Apple and the criticism from Apple? </p><p>SULLIVAN: No, Senator. </p><p>KENNEDY: You just did that on--out of the goodness of your heart? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Our users want to be able to share messages and communicate with their family, loved ones, without anyone, not even Facebook, getting access to their messages. So it's driven by our customers. </p><p>KENNEDY: And I understand that. I mean, what role for--to the both of you--what role do you think that people's distrust of not only bad guys hacking into their--their information, but what role do you think people's distrust of government plays? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Senator, I don't know really what's in the mind of our customers, but I think-- </p><p>KENNEDY: You haven't done market studies? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Not to my knowledge, sir. But if I just-- </p><p>KENNEDY: So you haven't done any market studies about, about the impact on your business of going to encryption and throwing away the key as you've just talked about? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Not to my knowledge, sir, and certainly not with respect to anything around fear of government. If I think about most customers, I think that they shouldn't have a fear of government. They should have a fear of those criminals and the increasing threats. And that's why as we put more-- </p><p>KENNEDY: You haven't seen it from the inside? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Pardon, sir? </p><p>KENNEDY: You haven't seen government from the inside, have you? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: No, sir, I have not seen government from the inside. But I would just say, sir, that I think with the increasing sensitive data and the reliance and the move into areas of national security and national infrastructure, that we remain committed to encryption because we think it will keep us all safer. </p><p>KENNEDY: Do you sell Apple phones in China? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Yes, sir, we do. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay, and--and are they encrypted? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Sir, the phone is the same across the world. The encryption is the same across the world. </p><p>KENNEDY: And--and you're--look me in the eye now. You're telling me that China allows you to sell your devices in China without you allowing them to breach the encryption and gain information about their users? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: That's 100 percent correct, Senator. </p><p>KENNEDY: Do you believe Jimmy Hoffa died a natural death? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: I--I wouldn't speculate, sir. </p><p>KENNEDY: I don't. </p><p>Let me ask one last question. Am I last, Madam Chair? </p><p>BLACKBURN: Well, we've had a request for a second round-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Okay-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: --But I think Senator Lee is the only one that would want-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Can I have 30 seconds-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: --To question in a second round. Yes, sir. I yield you 30 seconds. </p><p>KENNEDY: Let me--let me ask my friend from--Mr. Sullivan. Isn't it a fact, Mr. Sullivan, that there are people at Facebook that could go to my Facebook page and actually put a name to all my data if they wanted to and find out the--all the information that you have about me and put name to face? </p><p>SULLIVAN: You're talking about employees? </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah. </p><p>SULLIVAN: Senator, we have very strict what we call access controls. </p><p>KENNEDY: Are there people at Facebook--don't--don't dodge and weave. I've only got 30 seconds, man. Just tell me. Are there people at Facebook that can go in and--and match my data to my name? </p><p>SULLIVAN: We really restrict when and how any employee whatever look at a customer's data-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --But you can, can't you-- </p><p>SULLIVAN: --To lawful--well-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --You can, can't you? </p><p>SULLIVAN: --To be able to respond-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --You can, can't you-- </p><p>SULLIVAN: --To lawful requests we would. </p><p>KENNEDY: Can you do it? </p><p>SULLIVAN: Yes, sir, to respond to lawful requests. </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you, Madam Chairman. </p><p>BLACKBURN: The gentleman yields back. And there is a request for a second round, Senator Feinstein. If there is no objection, I think Senator Lee is-- </p><p>FEINSTEIN: --No objection-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Senator Lee is the only one who wanted a second round. Senator Lee, you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>LEE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Mr. Neuenschwander, I wanted to give you a chance to respond to Mr. Vance's point a few minutes ago. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Thank you--pardon me. Thank you, Senator. I think that what I hear is an incorrect inference that if Apple's process, by which we used to extract data for law enforcement had not been breached, that customers had not been breached. And what we were aware of it and has now is that customers are breached and their data is taken by common criminals. </p><p>LEE: Okay. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: And so, the step that we took was to actually shore up the device security for all people and stop the threats that we were seeing in the attacks against our customers. </p><p>LEE: Okay. So, in fact those breaches do occur. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: To customers-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah-- </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: --Without--without making a comment about Apple, absolutely. </p><p>LEE: To customers and--and people, including children, can be harmed when those breaches occur. </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: I agree, Senator. </p><p>LEE: One can be very concerned about children and about children--protecting children from things including child sex--sexual exploitation by being concerned about their data privacy, is that not right? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: Certainly, Senator. I mean, we are very concerned about that. We find the material and the people who traffic in it abhorrent, and we want no place for them on our platform. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Tait, you acknowledged a moment ago briefly that, if we were to start mandating this for devices, people would quickly move to apps. You mentioned Facebook is one app they might migrate to. Let's suppose that Facebook changed its practices. Would they not migrate to other apps using end to end data encryption within the same phone? </p><p>TAIT: So, sir, I think it's very important to distinguish device encryption, which is related to device searches, which is software that manufactured by-- </p><p>LEE: --I get that-- </p><p>TAIT: --The phones. </p><p>LEE: I get that. But people would still have a way of using encryption on a phone. </p><p>TAIT: For--for app--for end to end communications, certainly there's a possibility that people might choose other apps. There are several different communications apps. There's very few device encryption apps, because they are essentially the--of the operating system of the device itself. And when we look at those device manufacturers are, they are overwhelmingly multibillion-dollar U.S. phones. They're--there's--there's not many overseas providers that have device encryption software. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Mr. Vance, you're a prosecutor, and a--and a good one. You're also an iPhone user, from what I could tell a minute ago when you held up your device. Do you prosecute drug cartels or people affiliated with drug cartels? </p><p>VANCE: Our office has a special narcotics prosecutor that sits next to our office and particularly prosecute those cases. </p><p>LEE: In--including some of the big cartels like the Sinaloa drug cartel-- </p><p>VANCE: --Yes-- </p><p>LEE: --Gulf cartel and so forth. </p><p>VANCE: Yes. </p><p>LEE: The other entities that, based on my understanding, have a--have annual revenues that are staggering, that any U.S. company, any large blue-chip U.S. corporation, would envy. As entities with a lot of money, these enterprises could invest a lot of money in reverse engineering a backdoor. They could, if given the time and the resources, break into a backdoor system created through an Apple device. Would you be comfortable with your phone or that of your colleagues being hacked into by the Sinaloa drug cartel? </p><p>VANCE: Well, of course I wouldn't, Senator. But I still haven't heard the answer, I think, to the question or a factor that are raised. Yes, I understand that Apple is telling us that consumers' data was taken. It happens every day. I mean, that happens when people's--click on the--an attachment or go up to a--a website and malware is loaded. Of course devices and individuals have been compromised. </p><p>The question is, in the process of unlocking the device when we sent it to Apple historically, did that process create a vulnerability while it was at Apple and before they extracted material and send it back to us? General counsel for Apple in 2016 said no. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Neuenschwander, What's your response to that? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: I would certainly agree with my former general counsel that we are aware of no breach of that process. But again, that process relied on a state of the device for which we are absolutely aware that there were breaches of customer data and harm to our customers around the world. </p><p>LEE: Okay. And--and that device is--is now operating on a different platform, one that doesn't permit that. What would happen if you were to take your current platform and engineer it in such a way that it could work like the previous system did? </p><p>NEUENSCHWANDER: I--I think, Senator, there are two major options for that one, and Professor Tait alluded to both of them. One of them is that we can roll back to that prior state of 2014 and begin to leave customers around the world again evolved--or, sorry, exposed, even though the threats would have evolved and grown stronger over the five years, six years. And I think that would leave everyone the worst. </p><p>The second possibility is that we could do something which we never did, which is try to hold in our possession a key that would read the passcode protect the data on customers' devices. And as a technologist, I am extremely fearful of the security properties of such a system. </p><p>LEE: I've appreciated the thoughtful exchange we've had from our witnesses today. I want to be clear about the fact that I--I don't regard this as an easy set of problems to solve. I think we do ourselves, and the Senate as an institution and those we serve, a grave disservice when we allow this conversation to send into a contest over who loves children and--and--and who acts with reckless disregard for them. </p><p>You can always tell when a conversation is descending into a bad area when people start invoking extreme examples like that. One of the reasons people use them is that, in some circumstances, they work. You can demonize someone if you can make someone look calloused, recklessly indifferent toward the needs of children. Then you can make them an enemy and you can disqualify them from everything they say. </p><p>This is the opposite of this sort of stability that we need in our society. And I--I worry a lot about some of the discussion we had today because much of it has focused on this sort of ad Hitlerum strategy that attempts to demonize certain individuals, when in fact we--we are not dealing with something--with a circumstance where we can easily identify one way that protects children and one way that disregards them. If we open these things up, there are consequences. There are consequences to children. There are consequences that will result in more children being abused and exploited and the--and having other horrible things done to them. </p><p>So, I hope, Madam Chair, that in future conversations we can have more respect for each other and for our witnesses in approaching difficult concepts like this one. Thank you. </p><p>BLACKBURN: The gentleman yields back. That is the end of the member questioning. We thank each of you for being here with us today. </p><p>Members are reminded that we are going to keep the record open until the stated time, and we will have the opportunity to submit questions. We ask you all, for the questions that have been submitted for on the record answers, that you would reply quickly. </p><p>I do want to ask unanimous consent to submit for the record the two articles I referenced, one from TechCrunch on Facebook paying the children, the other from The Hill on looking at Messenger Kids and the bug there that I hope you all have fixed, that allowed unauthorized adults on to that. </p><p>We thank you so much for being here to participate and work with us on this issue. We look forward to continuing the conversation and finding a resolution that is going to allow us to keep the Internet safe, to keep it open and free and innovative, but to make certain that protections are there for our children, and that needed data is there for law enforcement. The hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPS-57D1-F15W-H02Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

And I'm sure we'll have more come in, throughout the morning. </p><p>We've got four witnesses: Mr. Craig Carpenito, is that right? Okay good, U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey; Bill Hughes, Associate Deputy Attorney General; Calvin Shivers, Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division, FBI; Michael D'Ambrosio, Assistant Director of the Office of Investigations, United States Secret Service. </p><p>So, we talked about this before, fraud related to the CARES Act, scams out there against seniors, selling masks that don't work, trying to play on peoples' fears. Unfortunately, when you try to do some good in the country, people take advantage of it. </p><p>And we're going to hear from our folks, today, about what's going on out there and some ideas about how to make sure it stops, if we can. </p><p>Phase IV will be coming. There's a need, in my view, for Phase IV. So, I'd like to learn as much as we can about the Paycheck Protection Program, the economic impact for individuals and supplemental unemployment benefits, how those programs are, sometimes, being abused. And generally, about what people are doing out there to scam Americans, particularly, our seniors. And that's the purpose of the hearing. </p><p>With that, I'll turn it over to Senator Feinstein. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I'll put my statement in the record, so you can proceed. Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Anything from anybody? Okay. Let's start with Mr. Hughes. </p><p>HUGHES: Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to appear before you, today, with several of my colleagues, to discuss the federal law enforcement efforts to deter, detect and prosecute those who violate federal law, by exploiting the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic dislocation it has caused. </p><p>Before I focus on the topic of the day, I want to take a moment to address the tragic killing of George Floyd. As Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosen have previously said, the video images of the police conduct in this instance are incredibly disturbing.  </p><p>As the Attorney General previously announced, the Department is conducting a parallel and independent investigation into this incident, in collaboration with the FBI, to determine whether federal civil rights laws were violated. </p><p>We intend to conduct that investigation, as swiftly as possible, and are not sparing any resources. We know that George Floyd's death was not the first of its kind and it exposes concerns that reach far beyond this specific incident. </p><p>The outrage that Mr. Floyd's death has triggered is real, legitimate and deeply rooted. While the vast majority of police officers do their job honorably and in accordance with the law, we see instances like this one that erode confidence in the American criminal justice system. </p><p>America takes great pride in the rule of law being a bedrock principle and, as the nation's leading federal law enforcement agency, the Department of Justice is committed to doing its part to seek justice for Mr. Floyd and his loved ones and to secure the confidence of all Americans in law enforcement. </p><p>I know these issues are important to you. They are important to us. We welcome the opportunity to have discussions on the subject, in the days ahead. But for today, for this hearing, our subject is the pandemic, the related economic disruption and those that wish to exploit others for their own gain, during tremendously challenging times. </p><p>The Attorney General has made clear that, notwithstanding, the operational challenges the pandemic presents, it is critical that the Department is vigilant in detecting, investigating and prosecuting wrong doing, relating to the crisis. </p><p>This has become a high priority for us. Since the early days of the pandemic, we have been receiving reports of individuals and businesses using the crisis as an opportunity to exploit, both Americans and government programs, designed to assist Americans that have been hard hit. </p><p>Leveraging the public's concern about the pandemic, fraudsters utilized many schemes to separate Americans from the money in their bank accounts, from their government benefits and from there personally identifiable information. </p><p>Other fraudsters and unscrupulous opportunists have gotten into the personal protective equipment trade, looking to defraud and price gouge health providers, first responders and other essential workers, who have no choice but to pay astronomical prices for protective equipment that their health depends on. </p><p>We're also seeing schemes that target taxpayer backed relief programs that provide Americans and American businesses financial help, as they weather a disrupted economy. </p><p>In particular, fraudsters are targeting the Payroll Protection Program, the Economic Impact Payment Program and its state unemployment benefit programs. </p><p>The pandemic has also changed the cyber threat landscape. Child predators on the Internet see widespread closing of schools, stay-at-home orders and the reliance on Internet platforms, as the primary means of communication, as an opportunity to prey on children. </p><p>Cyber criminals also see the widespread work from home posture of many American businesses, as an opportunity to attack and infiltrate business computer networks, to disable systems, or steal or hold hostage, valuable data. </p><p>As I'm sure you will agree, it is reprehensible that anyone would use this crisis as an opportunity to profit, at another person's expense or, otherwise, prey on the public. </p><p>The Department of Justice will not tolerate it. And our resolve is demonstrated by our efforts to coordinate a cross Department offices and components to collaborate with other government agencies and to engage with industry and the public. </p><p>We are already bringing cases to hold fraudsters accountable and to disrupt their schemes. And we will be doing so, for the foreseeable future. </p><p>I thank you, again, for the invitation and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>CARPENITO: Good morning, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. I am Craig Carpenito, the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. I was appointed by Attorney General Barr to lead the Department's Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force. </p><p>We are grateful for the privilege of appearing before you, today, to discuss the Department's efforts to detect and prosecute those who, for their personal financial gain, seek to exploit the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic dislocation it has caused. </p><p>The Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General our leading those efforts and we are honored to help them in that vital task.  </p><p>We want to thank the committee for its attention to these issues and to the good work at the Department of Justice to protect the safety and security of our nation, during this unprecedented crisis. </p><p>Before I answer your questions, today, about price gouging, hoarding and COVID 19 fraud, however, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the senseless and tragic death of George Floyd, at the hands of the Minneapolis police. </p><p>I am proud of the people of New Jersey, who have raised their voices in peaceful protest, seeking justice and reform in the name of Mr. Floyd and the other victims, like him. </p><p>I hear and appreciate their call for change. In New Jersey, we have witnessed productive community and law enforcement partnerships in cities like Newark and Camden. </p><p>These partnerships have lowered crime and restored trust. While we in New Jersey are proud of these efforts, we recognize that we must and we will do more. </p><p>Now, let me turn to the reason I'm here, today. </p><p>We've seen a broad range of illegal conduct, throughout the country, in these past few months. Our strategies and responses have evolved to meet new challenges, as they arise. But our core philosophy has not. The Department will investigate and prosecute those who treat--seek to treat COVID 19, as an opportunity to defraud the public and the government. </p><p>The Department has received many reports of individuals and businesses, using the crisis to seek windfall profits, at the expense of public safety and the health and welfare of the American people. These reports range from the sale of fake cures of COVID 19, online, to hoarding and price gouging of critical medical supplies, to defrauding the CARES Act economic programs. </p><p>The Department is, aggressively, investigating those reports and has already commenced prosecutions. </p><p>The Department's attorneys work side by side with our partners at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Secret Service, as well as other federal, state and local agency partners. </p><p>Make no mistake, the fight against COVID 19 is a fight to save precious lives, every day. Our medical professionals and first responders put their own lives at risk to stand between the virus and each of us. The personal protective equipment that they wear is the only shield they have to protect themselves, as they bravely go face to face with the virus, each day. </p><p>It helps ensure our heroes do not fall victim to the disease. It also helps ensure that they do not bring it home to their families and their broader communities. </p><p>Hoarding and price gouging, in particular, have inhibited front line healthcare professionals, essential workers and the public from acquiring the supplies the need to protect themselves from contracting the virus. Hospitals, first responders and retail consumers have been targeted by individuals who view the scarcity of critical medical materials, as a path to get rich quick. </p><p>This conduct has disrupted our supply chains and markets and jeopardized the safety of our communities. In response, Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosen, assembled the Departments hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force to combat and prevent hoarding and price gouging. </p><p>The task force is comprised of over 100 experienced federal prosecutors, throughout the nation's 93 U.S. Attorneys offices and Department components, here in Washington. </p><p>The task force's primary mission is to identify, investigate and prosecute illegal hoarding and price gouging of crucial medical supplies, including personal protective equipment, such as face masks, that are essential to preventing the spread of the virus. </p><p>We do so in the larger context of the current public health crisis. The decision the Department makes to open investigations, or to bring charges, are intended to help the public health response. Accordingly, the task force is focusing on profiteering, especially, by market participants, who sell scarce materials for excessive prices that far exceed their reasonable cost. </p><p>The task force also is investigating counterfeit, misbranded and defective medical supplies, imported into the U.S., from abroad. These flawed products are entering our stream of commerce and creating safety hazards. We will use all of our tools at our disposal to identify these products and those who transaction them here and abroad and hold them accountable. </p><p>The Department's efforts are ongoing but they have already yielded substantial results. We've brought several federal criminal cases, across the country, alleging price gouging, fraud, misbranding and other charges. </p><p>Just last week, the task force commenced the Department's first criminal prosecution against a foreign manufacturer for sending defective and misbranded N95 respirator masks into the United States, during the pandemic. Instead of protecting our medical professionals, these materials would have, silently, put them in harm's way. </p><p>We've also seized hoarded materials and worked with agents and partners to distribute them to those on the front lines to fight COVID 19. </p><p>Thank you, again, for inviting us to address these important topics and I look forward to answering your questions. </p><p>GRAHAM: Mr. Shivers. </p><p>SHIVERS: Good morning, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. </p><p>My name is Calvin Shivers and I'm the Assistant Director of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division. </p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you, today, to discuss the FBI's response to COVID 19 related fraud. </p><p>As head of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division, I oversee the FBI's financial crimes and fraud against the government programs. In my role as the Assistant Director of the Criminal Division, I also oversee civil rights, color of law and hate crime investigations. </p><p>I believe it's important that I take a moment to address the recent events, which have grabbed our nation's attention, before I focus on the issues, surrounding today's hearing. </p><p>I, along with my colleagues at the FBI, offer our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of George Floyd. The FBI civil rights program has a long and proud history of protecting the rights of the American people. </p><p>As the primary federal agency responsible for civil rights investigations, we at the FBI are committed to utilizing our full set of investigative and intelligence capabilities to address violations of federal civil rights laws. </p><p>In pursuit of justice, we are conducting a thorough investigation into the actions that led to George Floyd's death. The FBI recognizes the rights of citizens to exercise their first amendment rights and we will continue to work to protect our citizens and their ability to exercise those rights, free of violence. </p><p>Now, I will shift back to the topic at hand. </p><p>These are unprecedented times for most Americans. Due to COVID 19, people are, understandably, worried about their health and their livelihood. Although we are coming together in various communities and throughout the country, unfortunately, there are individuals who seek to exploit our anxieties and fears, by selling fake COVID 19 cures, or vaccines. </p><p>They are also peddling fraudulent investment opportunities in companies, purportedly, working to develop cures and vaccines for COVID 19. These were some of the earliest COVID 19 fraud schemes the FBI identified. </p><p>When the attorney general issued a memorandum on March 16 of this year, directing U.S. attorneys to prioritize COVID 19 related fraud investigations and prosecutions, the FBI was ready. </p><p>Within days, all 56 FBI field offices began working a wide range of investigations, related to COVID 19 fraud schemes. </p><p>As we began our investigations, we saw a number of different criminal schemes. We saw subjects hoarding personal protective equipment, or PPE, and attempting to sell it at exorbitant prices. We also saw people selling counterfeit, or substandard PPE. </p><p>The FBI worked closely with the Department of Justice and other law enforcement partners to conduct price gouging investigations, or seize counterfeit PPE. </p><p>The CARES Act was designed to provide fast and direct economic assistance to families, American workers and small businesses. However, there are individuals who seek to steal money from the people the CARES Act was designed to help. </p><p>With the passage of the CARES Act, we began to see fraudsters shift their efforts towards exploiting the various programs created to relieve the severe economic effects of COVID 19. </p><p>To effectively target this growing threat, the FBI formed a Payroll Protection Program Fraud Working Group, in coordination with the Department of Justice's fraud section and the Small Business Administration's Office of Inspector General. Through this effort, 116 investigations have been initiated and over $126 million in potential fraud has been identified. </p><p>We're also beginning to see healthcare fraud. We are seeing fraudulent billing for services not received, charges for unnecessary procedures and fraud related to telemedicine. </p><p>In addition to fraud schemes, we are seeing crimes targeting our children. School closures have increased the presence of children, online. In addition, social distancing restrictions and the isolation of children at home may afford terminal actors with an opportunity to sexually exploit vulnerable children. </p><p>We are, proactively, countering this threat, through active investigations. We're also working to educate the public, regarding the warning signs and the danger of online sexual exploitation. </p><p>Although these threats are numerous and evolving rapidly, the FBI has and will continue to be vigilant in addressing these crimes and holding the individuals who commit these crimes, accountable. </p><p>We rely, heavily, on public education and awareness. When the general public is made aware of fraudulent schemes and criminal activity, they are better situated to report them. For that reason, I am incredibly appreciative of the opportunity to speak with you, today. </p><p>I thank you, Chairman Graham, and Ranking Member Feinstein, for bring attention to these issues and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Thank you. </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: Thank you, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and distinguished members of this committee. </p><p>Before I begin, like my colleagues, I'd like to express my deep sadness and frustration with the tragic events of recent weeks. </p><p>Having served in government for nearly 29 years, nothing troubles me more than police misconduct. It severely erodes the essential trust necessary for law enforcement to, effectively, protect and serve our communities. </p><p>Law enforcement must be held to the highest standard. Racism and discrimination in any form is totally unacceptable. </p><p>The Secret Service is committed and, indeed, oath bound, to ensuring that all Americans are afforded their constitutional rights to equal treatment, under the law, and to freedom of speech and assembly. </p><p>Those rights are unalienable and no duty is higher for a law enforcement officer then to protect them. </p><p>Returning to the subject of this hearing. Thank you all for inviting me to speak about the current wave of COVID 19 related crime and the work of the United States Secret Service to counter it. </p><p>As early as February of this year, the Secret Service identified individuals and groups, seeking to exploit the pandemic for illicit profit. </p><p>We quickly took action to build the capacity and strategy necessary to combat what we anticipated would be a surge of criminal activity. </p><p>Major disasters have long invited fraud. From the terrorist attacks on 9/11, to hurricanes Katrina and Maria and, indeed, well before, criminals throughout history have used public emergencies, as opportunities to defraud the public. </p><p>However, the fraud associated with the current COVID 19 pandemic presents a scale and scope of risk we have not seen, before. Enabled by the Internet, criminals all over the world are defrauding anxious citizens, distressed businesses and government stimulus programs, alike. </p><p>Since we released our first alert on March 4, we observed the significant proliferation of criminal schemes. In particular, we have seen a surge in crimes targeting various economic relief programs, such as those provided by the CARES Act. Countering this fraud has become a core focus of investigative work and I expect our investigative efforts will continue, for years. </p><p>The Secret Service, in addition to our protective mission, is responsible for the investigation of criminal violations of U.S. law, pertaining to the U.S. financial system. </p><p>As the Assistant Director of the Office of Investigations, I lead the, over 160 field officers of the Secret Service, which includes our network of electronic and financial crimes task forces, which conduct specialized investigations of cyber and financial crimes. </p><p>The immediate investigative focus of the Secret Service is to disrupt and deter criminal activity that could hinder an effective response to the pandemic, by assisting organizations at risk of fraud and working to recover any funds stolen from Americans. </p><p>Longer term, we will ensure that those who have criminally exploited this crisis are arrested and, successfully, prosecuted. </p><p>I am pleased to report that the Secret Service has already seen tremendous success emerge from our investigative efforts, to date. We have initiated over 100 criminal investigations and prevented, approximately, $1 billion in fraud losses. </p><p>Among other law enforcement actions, the Secret Service has, successfully, disrupted hundreds of online COVID 19 related scams, halted the illicit sale of stolen COVID 19 test kits online and is leading a nationwide effort to counter a vast, international scheme to defraud U.S. state unemployment systems. </p><p>We have also released regular threat intelligence and alerts to provide industry, consumers and our law enforcement partners with the best practices to defend themselves from the latest criminal threats. However, we are not achieving these results by ourselves. We can credit much of our success to the close partnerships we have built, with a range of government and industry partners. </p><p>In particular, we are working closely with the various agencies of the Department of Treasury, with the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency and Homeland Security investigations, as well as various offices of the inspector general, particularly, from the Department of Labor and Small Business Administration. And of course, my colleagues to the right, within the Department of Justice, their COVID 19 Task Force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, have all been essential partners. </p><p>I am committed to ensuring the Secret Service is doing our part, on behalf of the American people, to counter criminal activity exploiting this pandemic. I look forward to answering your questions on how we can work together to address this threat.  </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, thank you all. I'll start with the Secret Service. Can you give me some examples of how people are taking advantage of the Paycheck Protection Program? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: We primarily, right now, our focus on the unemployment-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Okay, I'm sorry. Let's, tell me about unemployment. </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: So, right now, it's mainly stolen identity, theft investigation in which criminals are utilizing stolen PII, things that they have acquired on, whether it be the dark web, whether it be network intrusions. And they are using that stolen information to apply for Social Security benefits and probably across, right now, about 29 states, across the country that we have seen. </p><p>It's not a very complex fraud. It's the availability of PII out in public that allows for this to occur. </p><p>GRAHAM: Got you. Is there anything this committee can do to help you in this endeavor? Do you have all the tools you need in current law? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: We have the tools, right now, that we need for this particular-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Do you have the resources? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: We have the resources with the partnerships that we created, whether it be the Department of Labor, as well as-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay, the answer is yes, right? Okay. </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: The answer is yes. </p><p>GRAHAM: Mr. Shivers, I appreciate what you all are doing at the FBI. When it comes to consumer fraud, what are you seeing most of? </p><p>SHIVERS: (OFF MIC)  </p><p>GRAHAM: Your mic, please. Thank you. </p><p>SHIVERS: So, as I mentioned in my opening, on the consumer fraud, initially, private citizens were targeted through a number of schemes. Many of those schemes included offers to sell counterfeit COVID-19 cures, or vaccines. And as I mentioned in the opening, also, investment opportunities. </p><p>And so, what we see is a wide range of citizens being targeted, through a number of means-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Is that problem getting better, or worse, or is it about the same? </p><p>SHIVERS: It's continuing--I think, COVID-19, obviously, has shined a light on an opportunity for criminals to take advantage of a specific type of scheme.  </p><p>And so, what we see is a number of ways that they're reaching individuals, through unsolicited phone calls, or through unsolicited emails. So, there's a wide range. </p><p>And what we ask the public to do is to make reports to IC3.gov. and that gives us greater visibility on the nature of threats and the number of threats. </p><p>GRAHAM: Is there anything the committee can do? Do you have the tools you need to deal with the problem? </p><p>SHIVERS: We do, sir. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay, thank you. Mr. Carpenito, is that right? </p><p>CARPENITO: Carpenito, sir. </p><p>GRAHAM: Carpenito, I'm sorry. Tell us about the fraudulent sales going on out there. What's going on, in terms of overseas activity? </p><p>CARPENITO: So, what we're seeing, sir, with regards to hoarding and price gouging is the trends have indicated to us that, initially, what we had was fraud relating to a spike in the prices of the materials. </p><p>In this country we, essentially, had a supply chain that consisted of six major suppliers of these masks, the N95 mask, three-ply mask, just like these that were commoditized products that were sold at, relatively, cheap prices, pennies, to our first responders and our medical professionals. They were easy to obtain and they were something that, I think, were taken for granted, as part of our system. </p><p>What happened was, just like any scenario we've seen in our country's history where we have a national crisis, there's always going to be that dark underbelly that rises to the top and tries to profit, illicitly, from the fears of folks that are most impacted by the pandemic. </p><p>And what happened here was, a bunch of interlopers in the market came in, obtained mass quantities of these materials and held on to them, raised the prices and price gouged. These masks went from being $0.50, $0.60 apiece, to selling for $7.00, $8,00, as high as $25.00, in some cases. </p><p>What we've done is we've gotten the word out about the invocation of the Defense Production Act, the fact that it makes it illegal to do that, to price gouge. And we've opened up a series of investigations. </p><p>So, we've been getting out there to try and find any stockpiles, if they exist and get that material back into the supply chain-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Do you have the tools you need to continue down this path? </p><p>CARPENITO: We do, sir. The Defense Production Act gives us the ability to bring this conduct to light and to remedy it. </p><p>GRAHAM: Mr. Shivers, very quickly, can you tell us a little bit about the Paycheck Protection Program? What kind of problems have you seen there? </p><p>SHIVERS: Yes, what we've seen are fraudulent filings from individuals who are, either exaggerating the number of employees that they may have, within their business, or perhaps, they don't have any employees. </p><p>And so, what they're doing is taking advantage of-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --How do you find out about these cases? </p><p>SHIVERS: It's a wide range. Part of it is outreach that the FBI conducts with the banking sector and with the private sector. And one of the things that we do is we formed relationships with financial institutions and provided them with training, having an idea of what to look for, some of the fraud indicators. </p><p>So, part of it's a relationship. The other part of that relationship is with the Small Business Administration's Office of Inspector General. And so, through coordination with SBAs, OIG, we're also receiving information that helps us open cases. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay, Mr. Hughes, finally, I'm sorry to go over here. We're looking at a Phase IV and I'm sure we'll do one. If you could get back to the committee, you don't have to do it now in 30 seconds, but if there's anything you don't' have, in terms of being able to deal with this, let us know. </p><p>If you need more resources, let us know. But generally speaking, how do we stand? Do you have the resources and tools necessary to oversee these programs, at this point in time? </p><p>HUGHES: I think the answer is, yes. And you know, Chairman Graham, we really appreciate the committee's support. There are a number of legislative proposals that have been in discussion, one of which is increasing deterrence by increasing sentencing guidelines for fraud committed, during national emergencies. </p><p>We look forward to continuing to discuss that proposal-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, you get us a list of things you think would help. </p><p>Senator Feinstein. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: In my 26 years on this committee, Mr. Chairman, I've never seen anything quite like this. If I understand it, the Federal Trade Commission has reported that, as of June 7, consumers have lost nearly $48 million, due to coronavirus related fraud. </p><p>And this includes scam offers for vaccines, test kits, cures, air filters that were falsely advertised. That there's been unacceptable price gouging on basic items, like hand sanitizer, sophisticated schemes targeting state governments. </p><p>I understand, in Washington state, for example, criminals used stolen personal information to file fraudulent unemployment claims. And it goes on and on. And then, you have the Nigerian fraud ring, known as Scattered Canary, that's used personal information, likely, obtained through prior consumer data breaches to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars. </p><p>And it's bizarre. Why is this so unique to have all of this? What is there in this program that attracts this kind of fraud effort? </p><p>HUGHES: Thank you, Senator, for your question. I think there's two things going on, here. One, you have a pandemic, which is rightfully a major concern and, basically, every American's life. There's a lot unknown, still, about COVID 19. </p><p>And you also have an economic disruption, which, rightfully, sparked serious response, from the federal government, in the way of economic relief. </p><p>And so, those two events, simultaneously, created a situation where you have many consumers out there, who are anxious about their own health. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Yeah, but you are so broad-based in your comments. Nothing is specific. Let me ask you, specific. Apparently, Washington state was able to recover the $300 million that it had paid for fraudulent claims, related to one scheme. </p><p>What other big fraud cases are out there? And what is being done to stop it? </p><p>HUGHES: We're doing several things. First, is that we have hundreds of investigations open, all over the Department of Justice. We're working every single law enforcement agency in the executive branch. </p><p>We are pursuing separate courses, investigations, monitoring trends about each, criminal conduct regarding each one of these programs. And some of the case-- </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, talk to me for a minute about Scattered Canary, this Nigerian fraud ring. </p><p>HUGHES: So, Senator, I'm unable to discuss the specifics of any particular matter, or any particular potential target. What I will say is that, especially with respect to unemployment benefits fraud, there is a strong indication that some of the perpetrators are overseas entities, or organizations and that they are using money mules and other standard mechanisms to transfer money outside of the country. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Is this the Nigerian fraud ring? Is Scattered Canary a Nigerian fraud ring? </p><p>HUGHES: So, Senator, I'm not, personally, knowledgeable, as to that organization. I'm happy to take-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Does anybody know about this? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: Yes, Senator </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, tell us about it. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thank you. </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: There has been some reporting on the Scattered Canary being Nigerian. But I have no specific information to confirm those particular activities. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Could you tell us what you know? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: What I do know is that the fraud again is, as you stated, Senator, is essentially stolen PII that is out already in public, or whether it's, particularly, bought off the dark web for these particular crimes. And then, they are utilized to file fraudulent unemployment claims. </p><p>And that money has been seen transiting through money mules, as has been already said. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, have these consumer data breaches fraudulently obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in unemployment benefits from state governments? Could you gentlemen answer the question, yes or no? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: I can't answer as to the exact amount, Senator, that's been claimed. I can tell you that the Secret Service, based on an alert that we published in late May, the information that we received back from working with over 100 financial institutions that mitigated the loss of about $500 million in payments. </p><p>And so, that's anecdotal information that we received from the financial institutions. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: So, how did Washington state recover the $300 million that it had paid in fraudulent claims, related to one of these schemes? Can anybody answer that question? </p><p>HUGHES: Senator, I don't think we have that information at our fingertips. We can take it back and discuss with our colleagues. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Because you know, I've been here for a while. And Mr. Chairman, I've never seen anything like it. It's a program riddled with fraud. </p><p>GRAHAM: Here's what I believe. If you put $3 trillion out there, people will take advantage of it. And we had to do it. And I share your frustration. It's been a lot of generalities, here. We'd like to know, what can we do, what's going on, who's doing it, how widespread is it. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: That's right. </p><p>GRAHAM: Yeah. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: And could any of you gentlemen summarize what is going on and what it's going to take to stop it? </p><p>HUGHES: Senator, that's an incredibly broad question. If you're talking just about CARES Act fraud, there is targeting the Payroll Protection Program by fraudsters, misrepresenting their small business, or the characteristics of their small business, or misrepresenting that there's a small business, at all. </p><p>There are fraudsters who are using PII that they've accumulated, or bought on the Internet to apply for unemployment benefit programs that are state-sponsored. And there are a number of schemes, relating to economic impact payments, again, relying on PII to apply for these payments, or to defraud recipients of those payments to hand those over to the fraudsters. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, that me ask you this. The FTC reported that, as of June 7, consumers have lost nearly $48 million, due to coronavirus related fraud. And that includes scams for vaccines, test kits, miracle cures, air filters that were falsely advertised as capable of removing COVID 19 from the air in peoples' homes. </p><p>So, there are all these fraudulent business practices out there, apparently. What is being done to stop them, to arrest and convict? </p><p>HUGHES: I think we're, vigorously, investigating and using the tools that we have, both criminal and civil. When you bring a prosecution, you have forfeiture powers, should there be a guilty plea, or a verdict at trial of guilty. </p><p>On the civil side, you have a number of different statutes, which allows you to make the fraudster forfeit his ill-gotten gains. In order to disrupt, we have a statute that allows us to seek a TRO, a preliminary injunction and, ultimately, an injunction. That is a quicker solution to stopping some of these schemes, many of which involve an online website, which is the major marketing mechanism of some of these fraudsters. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: The information I have before me, I've never had before me, in any program in 26 years. And I wonder if it's worth continuing. </p><p>How do you stop this fraud? </p><p>CARPENITO: So, Senator, maybe I can help respond by what the Department of Justice has done to try and police these programs. </p><p>First, I can tell you-- </p><p>FEINSTEIN: -- Could you indicate to us, how many cases have been brought, convictions sought and convictions obtained? </p><p>CARPENITO: What I can tell you is, we've received thousands of referrals, through the network of task forces that have been put up. </p><p>Right away, right when the pandemic came to be, Attorney General Barr, I think, showed very swift leadership in forming two task forces, specific to COVID 19. One, relating to general fraud relating to COVID 19. The other, my task force, relating to the hoarding and price gouging, which was meant to stand up very quickly to try and get the valuable PPE to the individuals who needed it, as quickly as possible. </p><p>Those programs each have, approximately, 100 prosecutors in each of them that are focusing on the COVID related crime. It takes some time to work a white-collar case and it has to be done, covertly, because we don't want to do anything to disrupt the network of criminals, before we can get a hold of where the money is, we can trace everything, especially, for overseas cases. </p><p>So, we're working them, expeditiously. I can tell you, there are hundreds of investigations in my task force, alone, and thousands, nationally, related to COVID fraud, in general. </p><p>We've also formed partnerships with our state attorney generals to share information. Sharing information in white-collar cases like this is critical to being able to get to the money. Because at the end of the day, that's what this is about. We want to prevent individuals from sending payments, or from having their bank accounts pillaged.  </p><p>We want to prevent government programs from the same. And where it's already happened, we need to cooperate with law enforcement to work with financial institutions to trace those transactions. </p><p>And I know it can be frustrating, at times, that we can't get into specifics. But one of the reasons we can't is our, you know, our network operates, you know, through the ability to stay covert and find these resources, this money, before we pounce and we go into court and go public on it. We have to have everything locked down, if we're going to be successful. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Feinstein, we'll have a round two. But I think Senator Grassley, you're next, sir.   </p><p>GRASSLEY: Thank you. I've heard, thus far, that you've got the resources you need and you've got the tools that you need. I hope that that's right. Time will tell. If that's true, that's very nice. </p><p>I want to start out with a compliment to the Justice Department and some things that are related to the pandemic and some things that might not be related. But I want to complement the people that have filed price fixing suits against Pilgrim Pride and Claxton Poultry because I've always felt there isn't enough competition in agricultural industry. </p><p>And also, last week, the Department of Justice announced that it had issued what they referred to as civil investigative demands to the nation's four largest meatpackers. And those four largest ones have about 80 percent of all the packing industry and slaughter industry in the country, as a whole. And there's plenty of reason to believe that there might not be things right there, when a month ago, the price of beef to the farmer went down about 60 percent. The price to the consumer went up about 25 percent. </p><p>I sent a letter on March 31 to the secretary, or to General Barr. And I've done that, over a period of 20 years, under both Republican and Democrat administrations, hardly getting any results, whatsoever. So, you can imagine how surprised I am but thankful for this administration taking those moves to make sure that the marketplace is working in that industry because farmers are very depressed by some of the things that are happening in that industry. </p><p>So, let me go to questions. </p><p>On April 7, Senator Klobuchar and I sent a letter to the Attorney General Barr, expressing our serious concern about price gouging and hoarding of essential medical supplies. We asked for information from the Department's implementation and enforcement of the president's executive order. We've not received a response from the Justice Department, so that I hope we'll get it soon. </p><p>It's important that Congress have this data, as we figure out how to best address the problems we face. </p><p>We appreciate when agencies are quick to share information with us on our request for that information. For example, the Secret Service has been very good about giving us periodic updates on their COVID 19 related fraud efforts. I encourage the Justice Department and the FBI to follow that example. </p><p>So, to any one of the three from the Justice Department that can respond, can you tell me when Senator Klobuchar and I will get a response to our April 7 letter? </p><p>HUGHES: Senator, thank you for your question. I do not know the answer to that question. All I can assure you is that, when we receive letters, they're reviewed and work starts on replies, promptly. Replies have to go through a rigorous process. So, sometimes, it can take longer than we'd all like. </p><p>I'd defer to Mr. Carpenito on any substance that that letter was seeking to elicit. But we have your letter and I understand it's being worked on. And I can check with OLA, after this hearing, as to the status. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Also, to anybody from the Justice Department and or the FBI witnesses. I'm interested in what difficulties, or obstacles, have you encountered when investigating and prosecuting these cases. </p><p>CARPENITO: So, thank you, Senator. As I said, previously, thankfully, because of the invocation of the Defense Production Act, it has given us the tools that we need to investigate and prosecute price gouging. </p><p>As you know, the act is what made the act of hoarding with the intent to sell materials that were designated scarce, by the Department of Health and Human Services, at exponentially higher prices than pre-pandemic prices, criminal. Without that act, we wouldn't be able to operate. </p><p>The challenges that we have are the same challenges that you have in any sort of a disaster relief related fraud situation. We faced it in New Jersey, after Hurricane Sandy. As Senator Graham correctly stated, when you put this kind of money out into the ether because you have to take care of society and, you know, take care of those who are desperately in need of it, the cockroaches are going to come out of the dark and into the light. </p><p>There's always some underbelly that's going to try and defraud these programs. We are using our traditional tools and our traditional partners to root out those frauds. It takes a little bit of time because what you see there is, there's a delay in the exposure, right. </p><p>We have to follow trends, follow the money, to be able to root it out. With regards to hoarding and price gouging, I think that we showed a very aggressive stance. We brought our first prosecution, within a week of the invocation of the Defense Production Act. </p><p>The president put it into play on March 23. On March 25, HHS designated scarce materials. On April 1, we had arrested the first person for selling exponentially higher priced PPE. </p><p>The charges we filed there were for making false statements to the FBI because he was trying to hide his conduct and assaulting a federal officer because the individual coughed in the face of the FBI agents, who were looking to interview him and told them he had COVID 19, to back them away from him. </p><p>But we were able to recover close to a million pieces of PPE and distribute them, within 48 hours, to frontline medical professionals. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Could I ask one more question. I don't know which one of you can answer this. But I believe that China's decision to halt exports allowed criminals to sell fake and faulty goods to our hospitals, putting the health and safety of our workers at serious risk. </p><p>Is it reasonable to believe that the increase in fake and faulty medical supplies were a direct result of China's decision to stop exports to the medical--of medical supplies? And if not, why not? And whichever one of you can answer that. </p><p>CARPENITO: I'll take that question, Mr. Senator So, Senator, we can't talk about any of our investigations that are nonpublic. What I can tell you is, if you, I don't know if you noticed but on Friday, we filed a criminal complaint against a Chinese company for the importation of fraudulent N95 respirators. </p><p>In that case, what we alleged is that a Chinese company sent to the United States, knowingly false materials. How were they false? They purported to be N95 respirators that were licensed by the FDA and by NIOSH, which is the licensing body for these materials that make them the most attractive to medical professionals. </p><p>The N95 respirator has been so important here because what medical professionals say is that you need that 95 percent filtration to protect our doctors, our nurses, our first responders from interacting, directly, with the virus. </p><p>These materials were imported into the U.S. with the intent to sell them to medical professionals. And when we seized them, they didn't look to us as though they were authentic materials. We worked with the FBI, the FDA and Customs and Border Patrol. We had the materials tested. They failed that filtration test. </p><p>And we do intend to continue to investigate any importation of fraudulent materials. And I think you can plan to see additional cases coming in the future. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator. </p><p>DURBIN: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Carpenito, you talked about putting $3 trillion on the table and lunching the cockroaches come in. In your testimony, you have identified six, six prosecutions, under the PPP Act, so far. </p><p>Four and a half million loans have been issued, so far. So, let me ask you, are you just getting started, or is that it for cockroaches? It strikes me that, unless you have a pretty powerful statement, pretty early on, some of the adolescent efforts being made to qualify for PPP loans are just going to continue at pace. </p><p>HUGHES: Senator, if you don't mind, I'll address the PPP. So, with that program, there are a number of ways that we get referrals of cases to investigate and, potentially, prosecute. </p><p>One is just walk-ins, as the FBI will tell you. They have field offices, around the country and complainants will walk in saying that they're aware of some wrongful conduct, with respect to the program. A second source is data that we share, among federal agencies. I can't get into more specifics on that. </p><p>DURBIN: I have a limited amount of time. How you collect it and get your leads is important but not critical to answering my question. Is this pace of six prosecutions, after several months and four a half-million loans, indicating you're just getting started, or this is the pace that you think will warn America not to try to cheat the government? </p><p>HUGHES: I think we're just getting started. For the foreseeable future, we will be bringing these cases. There's limitations periods on this conduct, are anywhere between five and 10 years. And we are engaging, extensively, to ensure that the public understands the serious consequences of exploiting this program. </p><p>DURBIN: I certainly hope, whatever you do, you continue this effort but do it more publicly, with more volume, calling attention to it. This exploitation that's spelled out in your testimony of six is almost laughable. </p><p>HUGHES: I can assure you, Senator, there are plenty of investigations currently going on. </p><p>DURBIN: These are not thoughtful, conniving individuals. They are just silly efforts to exploit the government in the belief that it's an easy thing to do. I mean, to invent companies, invent payrolls.  I mean, that seems to me to be fairly traceable. </p><p>So, let me go to another aspect. The Chairman just stepped back in. I'm glad he's here because I want him to hear this. </p><p>When I got briefed, a few years ago, by major corporations in the United States, they told me that retail theft was so massive in this country that products that were made, exclusively, by one company, were being sold in volume on the Internet by sellers that went unidentified. And they had to be stolen. They were only made by one company. They had to be stolen from a warehouse or in the chain of commerce somewhere. They were being sold by the hundreds. It wasn't just a casual sale. </p><p>And that when these companies went after this theft ring, they were stopped cold by Amazon, Facebook and eBay, who said, we have no obligation to disclose the names of our sellers, even if they're fencing stolen goods. No obligation to disclose the names of our sellers. </p><p>You made a reference, Mr. Carpenito, to profiteering online with marketplace platforms like Amazon and Facebook. On March 25, a group of 84 state attorney generals wrote to these, those three companies and other online marketplaces to urge them to do more to crack down on price gouging on their platforms, including urging the companies to create mechanisms to allow consumers to report suspected price gouging. </p><p>Question's simple. What kind of cooperation are you getting from Amazon, Facebook and eBay, when it comes to those who are using the Internet to sell products that are misrepresenting their health qualities, or their application in COVID 19? </p><p>CARPENITO: Thank you, Senator. I can tell you that, from day one in the formation of the task force, we engaged with private corporations, including online retailers, to talk to them about what their policies were, with regards to price gouging, how they identified those instances and sought to create a referral relationship with those retailers. </p><p>DURBIN: How are you doing? </p><p>CARPENITO: Without getting into specifics, because there's nothing public I can tell you that we have been cooperating and that we have received referrals from those platforms. </p><p>DURBIN: And so, now they're disclosing sellers when you believe that they have violated the law? </p><p>CARPENITO: Again, I feel constrained by Department policy on talking about nonpublic investigations. But what I can tell you is that we have had contact with them. We have engaged and that we are working, cooperatively, with them on referrals. </p><p>DURBIN: They stonewalled us for years on retail theft saying it's, eBay in particular, it's none of your damn business who's selling what, even if it's clearly stolen goods. And if you're telling me we've got a breakthrough here, when it comes to this pandemic and national emergency of those who are trying to sell, misrepresent products on the Internet, that you now have the cooperation of these sales places, these marketplaces. I think we need to know one way or the other, whether you do, or don't. </p><p>CARPENITO: What I can tell you, sir, is, I don't know if I would use the term breakthrough, what I can tell you is that we have had contact with these companies. We have sought their cooperation and asked them to make any referrals of anyone who is hoarding or price gouging the designated materials, underneath the HHS order, and we have active relationships with, at least, some of the companies that you mentioned. </p><p>DURBIN: Mr. Chairman, I'm going to quit here. I went a little longer than I should have. But let me tell you, Senator Cassidy and I have introduced a bill called the Informed Consumers Act. And it gets to the bottom line here to Amazon, Facebook, eBay, have to disclose to law enforcement when there's the obvious sale in their marketplace of goods that are either stolen, or being misrepresented to the consumers of America. </p><p>For example, NIOSH cleared products and it turns out it's a big old lie. Some of these places, in the past, would not even tell you who the sellers were. The claimed it's confidential and private. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, I think it's a good question. So, let's--Carpenito. </p><p>CARPENITO: Senator, what I can tell you is-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Would the bill help, that he's talking about? Is it a problem? </p><p>CARPENITO: In my experience, the Department of Justice can use process. We can send subpoenas. We have mechanisms to obtain that information, when justified, where we see indications of fraud, or any indications that there has been wrongful conduct. </p><p>DURBIN: This is a new development, if you do. And I will tell you, Home Depot came to me, no small company, and said, stolen goods with our brand made only by us, sold on eBay in volume and they won't tell us who's selling it. </p><p>If that's changed, this is a breakthrough. And I-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Yeah, I agree. So, see if you can follow up. </p><p>CARPENITO: Will do, sir. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Tillis. </p><p>DURBIN: Thank you. </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here and the work you're doing. </p><p>I--I was actually pleased to hear you all bring up and a number of the members focusing on counterfeit, the threat of counterfeit goods. That's something I've focused a lot on, as chair of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee. This is not something new to the COVID response. </p><p>I literally saw a biking helmet that was marketed as one of the most protective, if you bought it from specialized, it did the job. I saw somebody just put their foot on this helmet and it crushed before us in a committee. </p><p>There are a lot of counterfeit products, coming from China, that are clearly a threat to our public health. And now, it's only on steroids, in response to the COVID pandemic. </p><p>One question, or a couple questions I have. You've talked about the PPEs and the N95 masks. Other personal protective equipment is something that we've got to focus on. But I'm also worried about counterfeit medications, potential when we have breakthroughs on therapeutics, counterfeit versions of those. </p><p>They may, actually, fit the bill but not being distributed, according to licenses. In other cases, they may just be inadequate, or ineffective. I think the same thing, the same risk could hold true, in terms of test kits and some of the other materials that we're putting together for the COVID response. </p><p>Can you tell me a little bit about how we are, specifically, focusing on that and whether, my suspicion is China is the greatest threat, but any other jurisdictions that we should be looking at? </p><p>HUGHES: Let me just address, briefly, pharmaceuticals and testing and I'll allow Mr. Carpenito, or the rest of the panel to address PPE. </p><p>We're working very closely with the FDA. They've taken a more flexible regulatory approach to help spur innovation in the medical device and the pharmaceutical space. </p><p>The types of crimes in that area that we are focusing on are the obvious scams, clearly fraudulent products, or medications. We are trying to disrupt those quickly, largely, by bringing in an injunction, while a criminal investigation is still going. </p><p>Some of the cases that we brought, so far, have stopped a scam selling ozone gas, as a treatment, unregistered pesticides, colloidal silver, and other treatments that were sold and marketed as either cures for, or effective prevention measures for COVID 19. </p><p>TILLIS: If I was to be one, I'd chime in, is this a China problem, or do we have other jurisdictions that we have an equally, we have a similar threat, in terms of counterfeit products? </p><p>HUGHES: The cases I was referring to are domestic cases. But I'll defer to Mr. Carpenito on the PPE. </p><p>CARPENITO: So, once again, I could tell you what we see trend wise. And what we see trend wise is, we have numerous investigations and we've seen trends that there is the importation of materials that are either counterfeit, misbranded, or just completely fraudulent. Those are the three buckets that I would put them in. </p><p>TILLIS: Primarily from China? </p><p>CARPENITO: What I can tell you is that we have one publicly available prosecution that I can talk about, where we have filed a criminal case in the Eastern District of New York against a Chinese company that we believe, intentionally, sent fraudulent materials. </p><p>TILLIS: And the Chinese company is a government owned enterprise? </p><p>CARPENITO: I believe that's the case in China, sir. </p><p>TILLIS: Yeah. I want to move on to something else. I want to keep to my time. I have a committee markup I have to run to. </p><p>But Mr. Shivers, right? I want to make sure I got that right. I butcher names, repeatedly, here. First off, I want to thank, I want to thank you for the work. And I did get to listen to your testimony in my office. But can you tell me about other things? I was talking about some of the test kits, other things.  </p><p>Can you see any patterns, specifically, from foreign jurisdictions? We've talked about domestic production. That's important for us to look at but foreign jurisdictions that we should be focused on and, potentially, create consequences coming out of legislation from the Senate? </p><p>SHIVERS: So, our investigations are not focused on importation. We are, primarily, looking for hoarding and price gouging of PPE and, also, counterfeit PPE. </p><p>So, through the course of investigation, we may discover that the PPE that we've seized is either substandard, or counterfeit. So, we would address it after that. </p><p>So, we work with, not just our federal partners but state and local partners to develop those investigations. And so, again, what we've seen is some of the PPE that we've seized has been counterfeit. </p><p>TILLIS: Well, I want to keep close to the time. This is just a request. You don't have to respond to it. But I want to thank Senators Blumenthal, Cornyn and Sasse, who joined on a letter to the FBI and CISA give us a briefing on hacking. I don't know if you've seen that letter but I think it would be very helpful for us to figure out, particularly, with Chinese affiliated hackers, some of the threats that we have there. </p><p>That may be, Mr. Chairman, something we could do, as a committee. But if not, I know there are a number of Senators who would like to get together and get a briefing of the committee on that and the threats that we should be, should be updated on. </p><p>GRAHAM: We can coordinate that. </p><p>TILLIS: Yeah, if we can get that done, sooner rather than later, I'd like for the FBI and CISA to be represented in that meeting. Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Whitehouse. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Chairman. If somebody could dial down my volume. There we go. That's more like it. </p><p>I want to ask about unemployment insurance. But before I do, I have to react to Mr. Hughes, your statement about your policy for answering letters. I don't know what is going on over at the Department. But I detect a policy of not answering questions for the record from this committee and not answering letters from this committee. </p><p>When we had Mr. Rosenstein down in the hot seat there, a few days ago, I pointed out that, in 17, I think it was, hearings with the Department of Justice witnesses, not one question for the record from a senator was answered, afterwards. Not one. That's not a coincidence; that's a policy. </p><p>When we get questions for the record answered, it's because it's a nomination hearing. And the nominee doesn't go forward, until the QFRs are answered. Outside of that, the policy seems to be, we the Department of Justice, don't answer committee questions, for the record. </p><p>I have a similar problem with letters. So, I don't believe what you said about there being a responsible policy for getting letters answered. </p><p>We have letter after letter after letter to DOJ and FBI that have gone completely unanswered. We finally got a letter out of the antitrust division, recently, by putting a hold on a piece of legislation that the antitrust division wanted. And the answer we got from the antitrust division was a blow off. It was a nonsense answer. It did not answer the actual questions. </p><p>So, I would ask you to take back to the Department, what the heck is going on? Because this exceeds the partisanship that I see out of the Department. This is a persistent failure of response to oversight and it is not always going to be a Republican attorney general. It's going to be, it's not always going to be a Republican chairman. Something is wrong. There is a policy some place about not answering QFRs and not answering letters. And I am sick to death of it. </p><p>So, please take that back. And I see the chairman nodding his head over there. So, this is a bipartisan concern. The letter that was raised was from Chairman Grassley. This is a bipartisan concern. This is not the time to get into this. We're going to get into this further. But somewhere, there is a policy and I want it rooted out because it is a wrong policy. </p><p>Now, on unemployment insurance. Mr. Shivers, in your testimony, in the headings of the different elements of your testimony, you don't even mention unemployment insurance. It's not one of the topic areas.  </p><p>Mr. D'Ambrosio mentioned, briefly, unemployment insurance in his testimony but described it as just simple fraud. I don't know that that's accurate, gentlemen. </p><p>Just in Rhode Island, we've had 3,000 fraudulent unemployment insurance applications. Our U.S. attorney is looking into it, after the Rhode Island State police began an investigation because they seem to be coordinated. </p><p>The damages could be in the billions. The theft could be in the billions of dollars. IP information links entities to common fraudulent claims and also, to fraudulent common claims in the state of Massachusetts, in the state of Connecticut, in the state of Washington. </p><p>I think you need to step back and take a look at this, as a very significant common scheme, very likely, a foreign led common scheme and take a much harder look at this unemployment insurance fraud than you are, appear to be undertaking, from your testimony here, today. </p><p>I think we are dealing with, what may prove to be the crime of the decade, if not the crime of the century, in terms of the amount of money that was stolen, through a common scheme, run very likely by foreign crooks.  </p><p>And I would ask you, also, to take the message back that it would be really helpful if the Department of Justice and the FBI would support the bill the Treasury supports that former Chairman Grassley and Chairman Graham support, that will peel back the ability of foreign entities to hide behind shale corporations in America. </p><p>Because what happens, as I think you know, is that they steal billions of dollars, through these schemes and then, they under the proceeds through shale corporations. We've seen it over and over and over again, the Department, the FBI, the Secret Service, have all testified about the role of American shale corporations and hiding criminal assets. </p><p>And when you look at the extent of the theft from our states, through this unemployment insurance problem, into which federal money was poured in abundance, as part of the COVID response, I think it's a better bet than not that, at the end of the day, those proceeds of theft end up behind shale corporations, where it's harder for you to root them out and run them down. </p><p>So, I'd be eager to have any response to the point about unemployment insurance and what you're planning to do to ramp up your response to this. </p><p>SHIVERS: Senator, there was no ill intent in not mentioning unemployment insurance. I'm sorry, it's on, I'll pull it closer. </p><p>All right. There was no ill intent in not mentioning the unemployment insurance. Just with the limited amount of time, I wanted to give an overview of some of the fraud-- </p><p>GRAHAM: -- But here's the question that's got my interest, now; 3,000, that's a lot. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: That's just Rhode Island. Massachusetts, Connecticut, Washington, there are a dozen states that have this problem, and probably more. </p><p>GRAHAM: From the Secret Service point of view, do you, Senator Whitehouse's question is, is there organized effort in the country, outside the country, to exploit this program versus just, you know, a handful of people misidentifying themselves. I think that's the question. What do you see, from the Secret Service point of view? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: So, Senator, first, just to your first comment, where you said it's a simple fraud. That really referred to the tactics and the techniques, as opposed to the scope of this particular investigation. </p><p>I can assure you that the Secret Service is looking at unemployment fraud, as a massive amount of fraud. We do see it as an organized group. We do see connections, when it comes to transnational criminal activity, overseas. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, you should have said that. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: There you go. That feels better. Thank you. Now, let's make sure that these agencies respond, according to that, and not to the, not mentioning it, or calling it just like simple fraud because it was, potentially, billions of dollars in fraud. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Hawley. </p><p>HAWLEY: Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd also be interested in further responses to Senator Whitehouse's questions. And I'm going to come back to that, actually, in just a second. </p><p>Let me start, though, by asking about the recent controversy involving 37 Planned Parenthood offices, applying for and receiving funds, under the Paycheck Protection Program, despite their ineligibility. Just a quick review of the facts, here. </p><p>The CARES Act states that nonprofits are eligible for the program, only if they and their affiliate organizations have no more than 500 employees. Now, Planned Parenthood has 60,000 employees, nationwide, which is 37 times the threshold. And there's no doubt that each of the 37 Planned parenthood offices, who applied for the funds knew that they were affiliated because their own documents claim that they're affiliated. </p><p>In fact, Planned Parenthood's most recent financial statement describes it as one national branch with 55 Planned Parenthood affiliates, 110 ancillary entities that are, and I'm quoting now, \"controlled by those Planned Parenthood affiliates.\" </p><p>Despite knowing all this, 37 separate Planned Parenthood entities applied for and received and, therefore, divergent $80 million from actual small business, during this global pandemic. So, let me just ask you, Mr. Hughes, I'm not going to ask you to comment, or reveal any details of any ongoing investigation, but let me just ask you, generally, if an organization that knows it ineligible for a program and, nonetheless, applies, falsely certifies its eligibility and receives tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer money, meant for somebody else, do we have a criminal conduct issue? </p><p>HUGHES: Thank you, Senator, for your question. And again, you're right, I'm unable to talk about specific investigations, or the existence of specific investigations. </p><p>However, the way the Department is approaching these cases is, the application for these loans is pretty simple. In fact, the part you fill out is, literally, just two pages. And there are a number of representations on that about the number of employees you have and your monthly average payroll and the nature of your business. And then, there are a couple of certifications, such as criminal charges and convictions, over the last five years. I believe that's the time period. </p><p>There are some other information on there but those, those inputs were, specifically, designed to be objective measures that could be quickly looked at and scrutinized, for the purposes of determining whether an applicant intentionally misrepresented something material about their business that would allow us to proceed with charging and prosecuting, swiftly. </p><p>So, we go with the facts and the law command us to go in each of our investigations. And so, this is just an area that, like unemployment benefits programs, we are focusing the Department's law enforcement and prosecutorial resources. </p><p>HAWLEY: What you're telling us is that the application is designed to be simple, it's designed to be very factual, right. I mean, it's not supposed to be a matter of interpretation. Do you comply, or not comply? Here are the standards. Tell us what the facts are. Do you meet the threshold, or not? </p><p>Have I got that right, I mean, that's the basic design of the application? </p><p>HUGHES: Generally, and it is not an application, which receives a lot, needs to receive a lot of due diligence on the part of the lender, from the beginning. Again, so really, all the misrepresentation, the burden of that on the applicant. </p><p>HAWLEY: What about executives of the organization, or other decision-makers, who may have known about, or signed off on any fraudulent application? When I say the organization, again, I'm not asking you to talk about any particular investigation, to confirm it, or deny its existence. But in general, if you have an organization where you have top executives who've signed off on this, would there be potential liability for them? </p><p>HUGHES: I think the traditional--the traditional legal standards that apply to corporate liability and individual liability for corporate actions apply with equal force in this, with respect to prosecutions of this program. </p><p>HAWLEY: Very good. Well, thank you for that. I look forward to seeing the progress of your inquiries, over time. </p><p>Let me come back to the unemployment question that Senator Whitehouse was asking about. Mr. Hughes, I'll direct this to you, or Mr. D'Ambrosio. </p><p>Do you have any sense of how much money has been lost, through fraud, in the unemployment insurance piece of CARES? And has the DOJ had any success in recovering any of those funds, to date? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: Senator, I don't have a specific amount of what, essentially, has been lost. I can tell you, I spoke, previously, anecdotally, from some of the financial institutions that we're working with, over about 100 of them. We've been told that an alert we put out in mid-May prevented over about $500 million fraud, alone. </p><p>So, so that just kind of gives you a sense of the particular scope. We have been successful in recovering some money. We have-- </p><p>HAWLEY: You have been, did you say? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: We have been successful. We returned, approximately, through an investigation, about $30 million to the state of Michigan. So, there are cases where this has been, we've seen some success and we're continuing to work very diligently on these cases, one, to identify, two, to recover the funds and then, eventually, prosecute these individuals for this activity. </p><p>HAWLEY: Does anybody else have anything to add to that? </p><p>HUGHES: Senator, the only thing I'd add is that, you know, this is a big and growing focus for the Department. We're coordinating in Senator Whitehouse's district, the U.S. attorney's office there, the U.S. attorney's offices in other jurisdictions, including Washington. We are coordinating, closely, with both, the Secret Service, the FBI and other law enforcement. </p><p>We're also coordinating with the financial industry. As the Assistant Director noted, some of the quickest, the quickest tool is to get the financial institutions, where these payments that are, the rails through which these payments travel, to identify this activity and to work with us and state authorities to stop these payments, especially, when they're traveling, overseas. </p><p>HAWLEY: Very good. My time has expired. I've got some additional questions on this front, which I will submit to the record. Thank you, all, for your service and being here. Thank   you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this important hearing. </p><p>I think what we do know from this pandemic is that this has brought out the best in so many people that put themselves on the front lines but it also has brought out the worst, in terms of the kinds of scams that we're talking about, today. </p><p>Senator Grassley has already mentioned the letter that he and I led, back in April, April 7. And we are still, Mr. Carpenito, waiting for an answer to that. And if you could, that's a long time, convey that. So, I'll just ask some of the questions because we are concerned about what's happening and what investigations have, actually, been opened. </p><p>How many investigations has the task force opened? </p><p>CARPENITO: With regards to hoarding and price gouging, we've opened several hundred investigations that are ongoing. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And has the task force brought charges against violators in how many cases? </p><p>CARPENITO: With regards to hoarding and price gouging, the task force has already filed eight criminal cases. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay, alright. And our there 100 lawyers assigned, is that right? </p><p>CARPENITO: Each--the way the task force is structured is, I lead the task force with the assistance of Mr. Hughes. We have three regional coordinators, one for the West, out of the LA, U.S. attorney's office; one in the central, out of the Chicago, U.S. attorney's office and one for the East, out of my office. </p><p>Each U.S. attorney's office has one representative, at least as, obviously, some districts are busier than others, there are additional lawyers working on it. And each of the Department components also has a representative. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Are they full time then, the hundred lawyers? </p><p>CARPENITO: I would not say they are full-time. Some of them are. For example, in the early states-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: -- Okay, that's okay, I have a lot of other questions. So, I just, we can, if we got this back in writing we'd figure out. Again, we're just trying to push for some actual results, here. </p><p>Another way to do this, in addition to what you're doing, state attorney generals, is as you know, are doing a lot. Attorney General Ellison and I have done some work together on this, since the pandemic started. And are you coordinating with them on the price gouging? </p><p>CARPENITO: We have encouraged all of the members of the task force in each 93 U.S. attorney's office and components to coordinate. I can tell you, personally, in New Jersey, we have a very good working relationship state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal. </p><p>We have formed a joint task force with the state attorney general. I know some other districts have done that, as well. And we have had virtual daily contact about referrals. And we've worked on cases and decided which cases fit more with the state's purview or the federal government. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Your testimony indicated that the Department focuses on sellers charging, \"substantially higher prices, than traditional market participants.\" I have a bill that I introduced and cosponsoring that bill, Senators Blumenthal, Hirono and Cortez Masto. And it would prohibit price gouging, during national emergencies and target price increases of more than 20 percent, above the pre-emergency services. </p><p>And states with these kinds of price gouging laws have, say, targets of 10 percent to 25 percent. </p><p>What are the--is there that amount, or is there a minimum amount you are looking at for a target price, by the task force and would it be helpful to have this federal law? </p><p>CARPENITO: I think it would be helpful to have that federal law, as well as, as Mr. Hughes previously stated-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: -- You made my day. Thank you. </p><p>CARPENITO: I'm sorry. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: That made my day. </p><p>CARPENITO: I think, as Mr. Hughes said, too, a sentencing enhancement for those who try to take advantage of situations like this national disaster is, I think, would also be a very useful tool. </p><p>With regards to thresholds, I think that the target range you're talking about is the target range that we are talking about. The state attorney generals, the practices that I've looked at, the state price gouging laws are usually in the 10 percent to 20 percent range. We're certainly looking for markups of that amount, or greater, in our investigations. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Last, Mr. Hughes. In your written testimony, you mentioned the antitrust division joint statement with the FTC on monitoring employer collusion, during the pandemic. I'm very focused. I'm the ranking member on the Antitrust Subcommittee with Senator Lee. And I am really concerned about what's going on, like the proposed Huber, Grubhub merger that there's been some discussion about, I shall say. </p><p>And the fact that we're seeing more and more consolidation, during the pandemic. And on May 1, I sent a letter to the Antitrust Division and the FTC with a number of other senators, emphasizing the need for vigorous antitrust enforcement. The letter included a number of questions and we received a response from the FTC. But we haven't received anything from the Antitrust Division. </p><p>Given the importance of this issue, right now, when can we expect a response? </p><p>HUGHES: Thank you for the question, Senator. I do not know the status of that particular letter. I understand and agree that the subject of it is important. And I can go back to my colleagues at the Department. </p><p>But I do assure you that the Department of Justice takes these letters seriously and we understand that accommodation is important to the legislative process. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: It is just making sure that we make this a major, major piece of our consumer work, right now, because it's easy just to turn an eye, with these major companies saying, hey, let's merge, times are tough when, in fact, what's happening is that they are squeezing out smaller and smaller companies. And we're going to have less competition, which is the whole reason we have the antitrust laws, to begin with. </p><p>And last thing, I'll ask this on the record. So, I know my time's expired and I will ask it later but about this bill that Senator Moran and I just did on protecting seniors from scams. And we also know that a lot of seniors are targeted. And I will ask that later.  </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Blackburn. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank our witnesses for being there, today. </p><p>One of the first cases having to do with price gouging, was two brothers outside Chattanooga. And they were buying up hand sanitizer. And then running the price up online from $8.00 to, I think, $70, per container. </p><p>So, if you would, talk to me a little bit about your participation with local and state officials and how you work with them. And I think, Mr. Shivers, this probably is best coming to you. And if you all will talk just a little bit about how you work with your state and local law enforcement partners. </p><p>SHIVERS: So, one of the FBI's strengths is working with our federal, state and local partners. And obviously, working in the COVID 19 environment has been very challenging but that has not deterred our ability to coordinate with our state and local partners. </p><p>There are a number of ways, and I think one of the previous questions is, how does the FBI receive information, relative to some of the fraud schemes. Obviously, there's a wide range. But through coordination with our state and local partners, we are receiving a lot of information, relative to COVID 19 fraud. </p><p>So, because we operate in a task force environment in many of our offices, whether that's our safe street task force or violent crime task force, a lot of our task forces have pivoted to address the threat of COVID 19 fraud schemes that we're seeing. And so again, for us, it's just a continual practice of working very closely with our state and local partners and addressing whatever crimes are being committed, within their jurisdictions. </p><p>BLACKBURN: All right, that sounds great. And then, when you are working with big tech and trying to get the information for online for fraud with some of these companies and, primarily, dealing with China and the fraudulent inferior merchandise and PPE that was coming out of there. </p><p>How are you working with some of our allies in this virtual space, in order to get this information to shut these entities in and does big tech respond quickly to your request to shut down some of these entities and then, to block them off their server system? </p><p>SHIVERS: So, as previously mentioned, our focus is not the importation of the PPE. We're primarily dealing with PPE on the front end, as it pertains to hoarding and price gouging. </p><p>And through the course of our investigations, we are coming across PPE that may be substandard, or counterfeit. </p><p>As it pertains to working with our international partners, there are a number of fraud schemes   that I think we've talked about, today. Some of those fraud schemes are Internet-based. And so, as appropriate, we work with our international partners to develop information leads that may have a nexus to the United States, or leads that we may disseminate to our international partners. </p><p>So, the international partnership is very important in dealing with COVID 19 because, again, a lot of these fraud schemes are emanated, from all across the world. </p><p>We have a relationship with various entities in the private sector. And I spoke, a few minutes earlier, about a relationship with the banking industry. We also worked with the tech industry but, obviously, you know, that requires a legal service, in order to receive information that may be relevant to our investigation. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask our two Justice Department representatives. Have you, are you familiar with Project Airbridge? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes sir. I'm familiar with the fact that Project Airbridge exists. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: A number of us, Senator Warren and I began an investigation, some time ago, asking questions of the six major distributors involved in Project Airbridge. And our inquiry has shown that there was cronyism and political favoritism that led to, tragically, misallocated supplies and government seizure of equipment that were going to providers that very much needed it.  </p><p>The cronyism and incompetence that was exemplified in this program had real-life consequences and, clearly, this Project Airbridge, which was a kind of pet project of Jared Kushner was, in fact, the bridge to nowhere for the healthcare providers, who needed that equipment. </p><p>At the very least, there was incompetence, confusion and even possible corruption. Is there any ongoing inquiry, within the Department of Justice, relating to Project Airbridge? </p><p>CARPENITO: Unfortunately, Senator, I'm not at liberty to discuss any ongoing nonpublic investigations of the Department. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Will you commit to reviewing this inquiry and making it part of your investigation, if there is one under way? </p><p>CARPENITO: Unfortunately, Senator, doing that would be acknowledging the existence of an investigation. And I'm just not at liberty to discuss investigations of the Department. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, you'll at least read the results of our investigation, correct? </p><p>CARPENITO: Once again, sir, I mean, I would be remiss to comment about an investigation. What I can tell you, is we're committed to rooting out fraud, in relation to any of the CARES Act programs and anything related to COVID 19 hoarding and price gouging. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, Senator Schumer, Senator Warren and I will send you the results of this investigation and, hopefully, you will follow up on it. Thank you. </p><p>Let me ask you about the fake cures, which are part of that, I think, $48 billion total number that Senator Feinstein mentioned, which is an astonishing and appalling number.  </p><p>If Americans have lost close to $50 billion, we need really aggressive and proactive law enforcement in this aera. I know you've said that you have enough resources and authority but I think America is going to be looking for results, at some point. So, I would suggest that maybe, you would want to review whether, in fact, you do have enough authority and resources because there can't be too much, when you're investigating this kind of fraud that, directly, impacts people. </p><p>In a recent report, the Center for Science and the Public Interest found that, at least, 49 dietary supplements on Amazon with antiviral claims were making false and misleading statements. Do you have any such fake cures under investigation? </p><p>CARPENITO: I would yield to Mr. Hughes. </p><p>HUGHES: So, Senator, we have several investigations that relate to misbranded, or mis-marketed pharmaceuticals-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: -- Have you brought any action against? </p><p>HUGHES: We have. And we have brought a number of injunctions to stop the marketing of such conduct. We have filed criminal complaints against the individuals who have been marketing. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Could you provide the details to my office, please? </p><p>HUGHES: Yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Let me move on because my time is limited. In terms of unemployment insurance, you were answering some questions, posed by Senator Whitehouse. What exactly, is the modus operandi of these potential scams? And are you finding actual criminal violations in any of these scams impacting Connecticut? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: Senator, as we've seen, what it primarily is, the scam itself, is acquiring PII, stolen PII, whether it be purchased on the black market, or through network intrusions and being utilized, using that information and applying to the different states for the unemployment insurance. </p><p>Yes, we are finding violations and we're pursuing those cases. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: How close are you to bringing action? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: I don't have the specific information, as to how close we are to prosecution. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Do you have a dollar amount, in terms of what the impact is? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: I have already stated, previously, Senator, is that we published an alert in mid-May and working with the financial institutions. The financial institutions are the natural chokepoint for these payments to go. They were able to prevent, according to them, over $500 million in payments. </p><p>We've also been able to recover and return to the state of Michigan, about $30 million of fraudulent payments that were made. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Do you have suspects, specific individuals, under investigation? </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: I don't, personally, have that information. I know we have active investigation. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, when I say you, I don't mean you, personally, I mean your agency. </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: I would have to go back and get specific information, sir. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Could you provide more details to my office, later today? I'm out of time, right now. And you need more information from your agency. So, I would appreciate additional information, later today. </p><p>D'AMBROSIO: Yes, I will provide what we can, these are ongoing investigations. So, it would be limited. But yes, Senator </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Hirono. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was very interested in the line of questioning by my colleague, Senator Durbin. Mr. Carpenito, you indicated you are now getting cooperation from Amazon, Facebook and eBay, about the selling of items. So, have there been any prosecutions, based on the information that you have gotten from the cooperation from these three entities? </p><p>CARPENITO: I don't have any specifics about any investigations in front of me. What I can tell you is that we have done outreach with those outlets and that I am unaware of any situation, where we have sought information and haven't obtained it, pursuant to legal process. </p><p>HIRONO: Well, apparently then, according to the way the situation was described by Senator Durbin that this goes on in quite a blatant way. And if you can get information from these entities that are platforms for the sale of these stolen goods, that would be a good thing. </p><p>And so, I would suggest that you look at the Informed Consumers Act that Senator Durbin referred to, which is bipartisan, supported by Senators Durbin, Cassidy myself and Senator Perdue, that may give you more tools to go after these kinds of crimes. </p><p>I think all of the panelists, you referred to hundreds of prosecutions, thousands of investigations, as a result of all the scams and fraud perpetrated because of the opportunities presented by COVID 19. And I think, Mr. Hughes, you indicated that there are serious consequences for people who commit these kinds of criminal acts. </p><p>So, I'd like to know, has anybody gone to prison? Are you seeking prison time? What kind of fines are you imposing on the people that you prosecute for these crimes? </p><p>HUGHES: Thank you for the question, Senator. I think for the frauds, the standard penalty of incarceration length applies, that normally applies, under non-COVID 19 related circumstances, with respect to some of the PPP fraud, for example. Again, a lot of factors need to be, need to necessarily affect how long a particular defendant's prison time would be. And whether they plead and take responsibility, or convicted at trial, also affects it, as does the sentencing judge. </p><p>Back of the envelope calculation, just for PPP, would be anywhere, the average would be between 50 months and 100 months. And that is, you know, typical for the types of frauds we're seeing, where the proceeds are in the millions of dollars. </p><p>Again, there are a number of different tools we bring to bear to address these problems and disrupt these schemes. </p><p>HIRONO: So, Mr. Hughes, I am running out of time. But do you think that we should create higher consequences, or steeper consequences for people who take advantage, during a national crisis and a pandemic? You referred to the usual fraud kinds of consequences. But maybe we should be looking at, you know, higher levels of consequences. What do you think? </p><p>HUGHES: Senator, I think there is an honest and important debate, as to the level of consequences for offenses, during a national emergency. </p><p>There have been discussions about proposed legislation regarding sentencing guidelines. Those discussions, in the Department's view, should continue and we'd be willing to have discussions about other proposed legislation in that vein. </p><p>HIRONO: You've been asked about the UI scam involving a Nigerian entity. So, apparently, a number of these kinds of frauds are perpetrated by foreign entities. And I'm wondering, how easy is it for you to, effectively, prosecute foreign entities. And do you need more tools, any of you, to go after these foreign criminals? </p><p>HUGHES: I think, from a prosecution standpoint, I'll defer to our law enforcement investigative colleagues, with respect to investigations. </p><p>But from a prosecution perspective, we have a number of tools, jurisdictional hooks, which permit federal prosecutors to charge and, effectively, prosecute foreign criminal organizations. And those tools, in many respects, are as robust as they can, given certain jurisdictional and constitutional limitations. </p><p>I'll defer to my federal investigations colleagues for the investigations piece. </p><p>SHIVERS: So, as I mentioned, previously, working with international partners is very important for us. And so, whether these fraud schemes emanate from a foreign country that touch our American citizens, we work very closely, through our legal attache offices, around the world, to develop information, work in conjunction with our foreign law enforcement partners to bring charges. </p><p>Obviously, one of the potential obstacles that we would face would be matters of extradition. So, those are some of the things that we have to work through. But again, these fraud schemes, because many are Internet-based, have a foreign nexus. </p><p>And so, with the FBI, one of the things that we've done, and this was through our elder fraud initiative that we work with the Department of Justice, over the last two years, is we have assigned Assistant legal attache's in various countries, where we know some of these fraud schemes emanate. </p><p>And that gives us greater visibility, greater connection with our international partners and enhances our ability to bring those individuals to justice. </p><p>HIRONO: May I just ask one more question, follow up, Mr. Chairman? </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Senator Hirono. We'll make sure you get to do that. Okay, thank you. Let's see, Senator Booker. </p><p>BOOKER: I think Senator Hirono said she wanted to ask one last question. </p><p>GRAHAM: Oh, I'm sorry. I misheard. Senator Hirono-- </p><p>HIRONO: --I'm sorry. </p><p>GRAHAM: No, no, I apologize. Yeah, ask anything you want to ask. I apologize. </p><p>HIRONO: I think it is really hard to prosecute these kinds of crimes when the perpetrators are foreigners and our panel explained the difficulties. </p><p>And so, a lot of this kind of information is still information that's already out there is going to be personally identifiable information. So, is there something more that states and individuals can do to protect themselves from the sort of fraud that comes about from stolen identities? </p><p>GRAHAM: Good question. </p><p>SHIVERS: I would say, just kind of a basic 101, there are a number of services, where individuals can have access to their credit report. And I would imagine that reviewing your credit report for anything that may not, you know, you may not have knowledge of would be important. </p><p>But also, I think also taking preventive measures. And that is, obviously, the Internet, there's a way that, you know, the criminals approach individuals, sending these unsolicited emails. So, I would just say, just using, for the lack of a better word, basic common sense and how the public deals with some of these opportunities that these criminal organizations take advantage of. </p><p>So, it's obviously, a very difficult thing but, again, unsolicited emails, unsolicited phone calls, where individuals are actually providing some of the PII. But again, as we talked about, some of that PII may be stolen. </p><p>So, I would just say, just using some basic preventive measures. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Booker. </p><p>BOOKER: Mr. Chairman, I think the rule of the committee should be, it's better to ask for forgiveness, than permission. I know Senator Hirono knows that rule. </p><p>But I'm grateful to be here. And if I can, I want to direct my questions to Mr. Carpenito, not just because he's from New Jersey, not just because he is bald, not just because Anthony Ambrose has said, who is both of those things, and said generous things about him. </p><p>But obviously, these issues are really impacting our state. And I would love to get some of his insights. And so, first of all, we've seen numerous instances of retailers taking advantage of the global pandemic and gouging, charging outrageous fees for medical supplies, personal protective equipment, things that are really, we've deemed essential and are critical to the life, safety and well-being of so many of our first responders and others. </p><p>This behavior is immoral, frankly, and reprehensible. My team and I have introduced the Prevent Emergency and Disaster Profiteering Act on May 7. There is no federal law against this kind of reprehensible price gouging on essential items that are deemed critical to the health, safety and lives of so many Americans. </p><p>And so, Mr. Carpenito, I'm curious what you think of the power of having a federal law against this kind of gouging. If you can comment on that and then, talk about the prevalence of this in New Jersey and how have you, without that law, been successful in trying to combat these issues? </p><p>CARPENITO: Thank you, Senator So, I agree with your characterization. I think New Jersey is one of the states that had one of the largest impacts from this type of conduct because, as everyone knows, New York, New Jersey, were two of the most impacted states in the country, by COVID 19. </p><p>We also have some of the most vulnerable victims for this because we have a very large elderly population. And we have a very large healthcare system. </p><p>So, thankfully, because of the invocation of the Defense Production Act and the swift movement by Attorney General Barr to set up the task force to enforce the act, we have had the tools to address hoarding and price gouging of scarce materials, those designated by the Department of Health and Human services. </p><p>And that's how we've been able to operate. I have not felt constrained, as a task force leader, in our tools there. But as you mentioned, there is really a history and a record here, of folks trying to take advantage of national disasters like this. </p><p>We saw it in Katrina. You and I so it in New Jersey, after Hurricane Sandy. And we've seen it, throughout the country, on a scale that we've seen never before, with COVID 19, because it's the largest health crisis we've had, since the Spanish Flu. </p><p>We have been unable to address certain types of price gouging because there's not a federal statute. For example, things like toilet paper, things like, you know, meat, things like food, things like other materials that personal consumers need are better suited, under the current statutory scheme, to be prosecuted by state attorney general's offices. </p><p>What we have done is, I've worked with Mr. Hughes, Mr. Shivers, and we made sure that we make those referrals to state AG's, where we think they have the better tools to prosecute those individuals because the most important thing is always, is just to make sure that these people are brought to justice, not who does it. </p><p>BOOKER: I'm grateful for that response. And I do really believe there is an urgency to give on the federal level, more tools to deal with that. </p><p>You know, on March 20, of this year, you announced the creation of the federal state COVID 19 fraud task force, with Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and our Comptroller Walsh. The task force bridges the prosecutable efforts of the state and federal agencies in a kind of coordination and cooperation, I think is really needed in circumstances like this. </p><p>And so, I just want to hear a little bit more about the federal state task force, what kind of fraud schemes you guys have uncovered, since its creation, and what challenges have you all encountered in combating that fraud that you see out there? </p><p>CARPENITO: Sure. And you know, we are very blessed in New Jersey. I can't speak about every state but I think that we've heard, as task force leaders myself and Mr. Hughes, have heard similar success stories, throughout the country, in forming partnerships, here. </p><p>We've had a very good relationship, during my entire tenure with Attorney General Grewal's office. And in particular, working with his first assistant, Jen Davenport, and his executive assistant, Andrew Bruck. They've been in, almost, daily contact with our task force folks in New Jersey, sharing referrals. </p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot get into specifics of referrals because the cases that I have on my mind are not ones that are publicly available information, at this time. But what I can tell you is, we haven't really seen a lot of hurdles because we've put egos aside and we focused, most importantly, on making sure these cases are brought. </p><p>With regards to tools, like I said, the Defense Production Act has been a powerful tool for us. And it's given us the, you know, the authority to investigate price gouging and do so pretty vociferously and quickly. </p><p>BOOKER: I'm over time and I'm going to submit more of a lot of our pressing questions for the record for QFRs. I do have one last question for you to put you on the spot. And I apologize for during this, in advance. </p><p>But my question simply is, Anthony Ambrose, is he a great police director, or is the greatest police director? </p><p>CARPENITO: He's a national treasure. I've been saying this, since I came into office. And we've seen it, during these riots. </p><p>The fact that Newark stayed together, as a community, and were peaceful in their reaction to the death of George Floyd, is a credit to Director Ambrose, for his handling of law enforcement and a credit to Mayor Ras Baraka, for his community engagement. </p><p>And I saw, first-hand, for the past 8 to 10 days, as other cities struggled with these protests, Newark thrived. And they're doing so because of the work that was done, through the Newark consent decree, with the leadership of Anthony Ambrose. And as I said, the community engagement and support that Mayor Baraka is showing for his police Department. </p><p>And quite frankly, the support that both have shown to me, since I've been U.S. Attorney and focusing on violent crime, throughout Newark, through not just prosecutions but by education and community engagement. </p><p>BOOKER: Well, I appreciate your reference to consent decrees. I wish that the current attorney general would actually engage and use them. They were a constructive force in the city of Newark. I appreciate you saying things about the extraordinary leaders, both Ras Baraka and is 100 percent true.  </p><p>And Anthony Ambrose is a treasure. He takes better care of the city of Newark than he does himself. So, I hope that you will, again, I say this on the record, encourage him to get out there, exercise and, you know, be more healthy, so we have him for a few more decades. </p><p>CARPENITO: He's down 70 pounds. We're looking good. </p><p>BOOKER: He is, he is, all true. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. I need to call him. I'm trying to lose some weight, myself. </p><p>So, here's the deal, you all. I appreciate you coming to the committee. I asked you, do you have the tools necessary, the resources. Seems like there's some tools that maybe, we could utilize that you don't have. So, if you can kind of get your collective wisdom. I think Senator Durbin had a bill, Senator Klobuchar. I think, Senator Booker introduced legislation. </p><p>So, get back with us about what we can do to help you. I mean, what can the committee do to change laws, or supplement laws, sentence enhancing, whatever. Just let us know. </p><p>We thank you all for being on the front lines. And we'll hold the hearing open for the requisite amount of time for additional questions. </p><p>Thank you. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6040-MF61-JDPT-T01M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Thank you all for attending this what I think is going to be a very important hearing and Senator Blumenthal, I want to thank you for the hard work you have put into drafting this piece of legislation. Senator Feinstein is on the way. She said it would be okay if we got started. </p><p>I normally don't say a whole lot in opening statements, but I might take a bit of time today. I want to introduce into the record my full statement, that I will introduce into the record without objection and kind of remind people what brought us here today. </p><p>In July we had a hearing about sexual exploitation of children, social media applications, technical companies having data about child exploitation and I am trying to find a way to childproof these systems and make sure innovation continues and that the people in the business know what they need to do to earn liability protection when it comes to preventing sexual exploitation of children. </p><p>Section 230 was passed years ago, which basically gives blanket immunity to the tech companies, social media sites that are subject to this hearing to make sure that they could get started, grow, and flourish. That has been accomplished. Now it is time for us as a nation to figure out about how to rein in some of the problems associated with these industries. </p><p>Number one, I have come to conclude that the technical systems available today have been--are a dream come true for child predators, that for every good thing that has happened with the Internet for lack of a better term there are dark forces that need to be dealt with and what I have done with Senator Blumenthal is come up with a system to create best business practices for companies in the arena to follow and if they follow these best business practices they can keep their 230 liability protection, and the reason we are here with a different approach is because Senator Blumenthal and myself believe the current system is not working. </p><p>In the July hearing, the--the regulatory system in place is just simply not working. It has become in the minds of many a joke. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, also known as NCMEC in 1998, the NCMEC cyber tip line was first created. There just over 4000 reports of online sexual exploitation. By 2014 there were 1.1 million reports in a year, 2019 there were almost 17 million reports to the tip line in a single year. The 2019 reports included more than 69 million images, videos, and files related to child exploitation. There was a particular increase in video last year. Of the files reported, 41 million of the 69 million were videos.  </p><p>A 23-year-old daycare worker pleaded guilty to child exploit--exploitation and child pornography and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. She sexually abused a five-year-old child, and filmed the abuse, shared the abuse material mainly using an app called Kik with men she met through other apps and forums, including Craigslist. A 23-year-old man sexually abused a 16-month-old toddler. He took photos and videos of the abuse and shared them on an app. He said he chose the toddler because she couldn't communicate her abuse. </p><p>Section 230 has failed in my view to incentivize the companies in question to do a better job dealing with this horrific problem. Company reports of child sexual exploitation to the cyber tip line. Social media companies reports in 2019. Out of the total 16.9 million reports to the cyber tip line, Facebook was 15.8 million. To the people at Facebook, thank you. You are doing a pretty good job. Doing a good job. Twitter 46,000, Snapchat 82,000, Apple--Amazon eight and 205 for Apple.  </p><p>So something is wrong here. I am not convinced that all of the problems are on the Facebook system. I am convinced that other people are not finding what Facebook is able to find if you look. And here is the question for the country, should we be looking--should the companies in question be looking and reporting? The answer is yes. What role do adults have been protecting the children of one's society? What role do politicians have in aiding parents to protect their children from sexual exploitation? What is the duty to allow commerce to grow unimpeded to its highest and best use?  </p><p>All of these are things that we are grappling with, but let me tell you where I am coming down. I am coming down on the side of looking and trying to find out and put these bastards in jail and stop it. I am on the side of parents who really don't have the tools that home; it's just too complicated for any set of parents, a single parent, or anybody to protect their child. You need help. </p><p>What is the role of the Congress? To provide the help, to find a balance between business, free thought and expression, and protecting children who are being filmed daily, their abuse and everybody who watches it is part of the abuse. This has got to stop. You will never stamp it out. It has been around as long as man has been around, but the technologies today have created an explosion in terms of sexual exploitation of children being widely viewed and shared, and it is now time for us to do something. </p><p>I have had lunches, I have had dinners, I have talked, I have ble--begged and pleaded my good friend Senator Wyden we have talked. I'm tired of talking. We are going to start voting. We are not going to sit on the sidelines anymore. So all we are asking is that we come up with a system voluntary in nature, set out among ourselves as a people, and find out what are the best business practices and encourage you to use them, and if you do, you are home free. If you don't, you run the risk of going to court maybe you win, maybe you don't. This is the only area in society I know where you have absolute blanket protection, and it made sense back then, it doesn't make sense now and particularly in this area. </p><p>So where's the other chart? This one here. This is where the reportings come from, 15 million reports by Facebook, Google 449,000, Amazon eight, Apple 205. Clearly, Facebook is looking and finding something. Other people are not looking for, or it is there you have just got to look. So Facebook is talking about end to end encryption, which means they go blind. This bill is not about the encryption debate but the best business practices I am dying to find out what they should be, and the Congress under our bill has to approve them for them to become the law of the land. </p><p>So we are having the attorney general with other cabinet officials to set up a commission of 19 people to try to figure out what are the best ways to protect children from sexual exploitation and it being shared with millions and millions and millions of people and regulating the sites. And once the commission has decided what to do, Congress has to approve it before the companies in question decide whether or not they want to embrace these practices. </p><p>It is bipartisan. I have got ten cosponsors. I think if we voted we would get a lot of votes. My goal is to fix the problem understanding the complexity of it not to put anybody out of business to not to stop innovation but to do something about the fact that children on a massive scale are being abused by groups of individuals and the abuse is being shared to millions of people which incentivizes the abuse. </p><p>So Senator Blumenthal, thank you for working with me to come up with a balanced approach that gets us off the sidelines as a nation. I will end with this. I am not going to stay on the sidelines any longer. Facebook is doing a damn good job of finding out sexual abuse on their platform, and they are reporting it, and prosecutors are acting. The other sites not so much. We are not going to go blind as a nation. We are not going to go blind and let this abuse go forward in the name of any other freedom. Any society that fails to protect its children and do all of this within reason to do so has lost their way. America is not going to lose its way.  </p><p>Senator Blumenthal? </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Senator Graham. I want to thank you for that very powerful statement and even more so for the profoundly important work that you have done, and your leadership on this bill has been invaluable. I want to thank also our colleagues on this side and the other side. This bill, as you mentioned, is truly bipartisan. We are joined by Senators Whitehouse and Feinstein and Durbin on this side and Senators Hawley and Ernst on your side, and I hope that we will be joined by many others because the more people understand what's at stake here the force of this effort is simply indisputable and I want to pay tribute to the survivors and their families who have come forward.  </p><p>The strength and courage that it takes to be the face and voice of this problem is simply unimaginable. Anyone who has seen these photos and images has to be absolutely repulsed. You won't see them here. We have charts, but those images are gut-wrenching, vile, unspeakable in their cruelty, and their betrayal of basic humanity. So we are here about values, about basic human decency, about images that are not only a betrayal of basic humanity now but haunt those victims and survivors for years, indeed for decades throughout their lives because the Internet is infested with these images that simply don't go away. For children who become adults, they are a continuing menace. </p><p>I began this effort some 15 years ago when I was Attorney General in the state of Connecticut when I sought to stop predators from exploiting children on MySpace, a name that is more for the history books now than current parlance. This problem is as old as civilization, but it has been given new vile force by an Internet that not only spreads but preserves those images and then I learned 15 years ago is that there's a section of law, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that provides unique near-absolute immunity from legal responsibility for certain companies and activities and we are not proposing to eliminate the kinds of protection from liability that are deserved and earned by companies that follow good basic practices to stop those predators from exploiting children and exploiting also the Internet and the power that it provides. We are simply seeking to crack down on child abuse and exploitation and to enlist those companies in this effort and to make sure they follow good practices. </p><p>Over the past decade, in fact, technology has advanced, and it has provided tools that preserve privacy and enable encryption but at the same time afford these tech companies the opportunity to do tremendous good simply by reporting child abuse and exploitation material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement authority. This problem can be solved, and yet shockingly, these tech companies, some of them among the largest with more than ample resources, have failed to meet their social and moral obligation.  </p><p>There was a shocking New York Times investigative report tremendously valuable and powerful that indicated that employees provided 2545 reports to NCMEC last year even (INAUDIBLE), not exactly a paragon of online virtue provided 1380. Amazon provided eight. That's right, eight. NCMEC sent to Amazon 69 reports of services hosting suspected child abuse material. NCMEC found nearly nine times more abuse material on Amazon's services than Amazon found on its own. </p><p>In response to a letter that we wrote, Flickr gave us a thoughtful description of meaningful efforts to build safely into their platform using automated tools. Amazon said they were thinking about it but no plans. Apparently, the company that can get you packages almost before you order them provides a little more slowly when it comes to preventing child exploitation.  </p><p>So this bill is not about ending encryption; the tech community has told us that both are possible, that encryption is fully compatible with preventing child abuse and exploitation material on these Internet sites. WhatsApp is end to end encrypted, but they still managed to remove two--250,000 accounts each month for suspected child exploitation. That is 6 million accounts deleted per year without degrading the privacy of their app, and meanwhile, Apple has several unencrypted products, including its iCloud backups and its email service, and they just made 250 reports of offensive material last year.  </p><p>So this bill is not about ending encryption, and it is also, and I'm going to be very blunt here; it is also not about the current Attorney General William Barr. We are quite clear here. William Barr gets one vote on the commission that is established under this bill. Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi each appoint four representatives. The tech companies have representatives as well. The votes on the commission have to be by 14--a 14 majority out of 19, so there is clearly a need for consensus. The attorney general, whoever she or he is, has a power that is purely negative, she or he cannot promulgate any best practice not supported by this bipartisan consensus on the commission and a majority in Congress. </p><p>And I want to say finally, many technologies already are doing the right thing, many of the smallest tech companies are following best practices trying to do the right thing. More resources should be provided to law enforcement. I am all in favor of more resources to the department of justice and to NCMEC and to others that help the tech companies do the right thing and enforce against these predators, but this blanket near absolute immunity is not an absolute right; it's not a gift. It should be earned and deserved and certainly should not be continuing if these companies fail to observe and follow the basic moral obligation that they have under the law but as a simple matter of simple morality.  </p><p>One of the companies doing the right thing is going to testify today, and I applaud the Match company's leadership. Mr. Sine is here. I have been heartened by their willingness and again some of the smaller tech companies, some of the innovators and startups to engage with me and Senator Graham and together, I look forward to continuing these conversations. I want to thank all of the witnesses for being here today. </p><p>I don't want to look back in 15 years from now and say we could have saved lives that have been damaged or destroyed in the meantime. We need to do something now. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Feinstein, would you like to (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Just a personal comment, and I will put my remarks in the record. I am a mother and a grandmother Mr. Chairman, seven children. Nothing enrages me more than sexual abuse of children, and the tech companies of the state I represent that I'm so proud to represent cannot use this method of promotion to do this kind of thing, and it is horrendous, it is destroying young children. The New York Times just said that the number of reported photos, videos, and other materials related to online child sexual abuse grew by more than 50 percent last year. Case closed.  </p><p>Mr. Chairman, I am proud to support this legislation. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. We will begin the hearing now. Nicole, if you would come forward, please. Have a seat, ma'am. Nicole was-- </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Tell us her how harmless we are just to relax. </p><p>GRAHAM: Yes. You are in good hands, Nicole, here. Nicole is the mother of a survivor whose sexual exploited images have been widely circulated on a variety of Internet websites and social media platforms. Nicole was able to seek invaluable emotional support from NCMEC's Team Hope, a peer support group composed of parents whose children had been missing or exploited. Welcome to the committee, and if you would mash the red button. Thank you for coming to talk with us. </p><p>NICOLE: Thank you for having me. </p><p>GRAHAM: If you could get a little closer and talk into the mic. Thank you. </p><p>NICOLE: Thank you for having me. Good morning Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. I am pleased to be here to provide a parent's perspective on the introduction of the EARN IT Act and why this bill is crucial in addressing child sexual exploitation that affects so many children and their families, including my own.  </p><p>My name is Nicole, and I am the mother of a survivor whose sexually exploitive images have been widely circulated on a variety of Internet websites and social media platforms. I am here today because I have firsthand knowledge of how child sexual abuse material impacts children and families. My child's biological father produced sexually abusive photos starting when our child was five years old and shared these images on the Internet. We are fortunate that my child's abuser was arrested and will serve the rest of his life in jail. Not all children are lucky enough to see justice served. </p><p>Through this experience, I learned about the world of online child sexual exploitation that I never knew existed. At first, I did not comprehend the repercussions from my child's abusive images being online. My initial reaction was relief that the images would prove what he had done and would help prosecute him. It never occurred to me that just because he was gone, the images were not.  </p><p>It was devastating to learn that my child's abuse continued to be redistributed online, re-victimizing my child every single time. I've been told that at one point, these images were the most highly traded in the world, and even today, a decade later, the images are still being treated and seen in new cases. I do not understand how with all of the technology available today, there are not safeguards to prevent distribution and redistribution of a child's sexually abusive images. How can these images continue to be uploaded and shared, distributed for years on the Internet without companies doing anything? And more so, why are they companies not held accountable for what is occurring on their sites?  </p><p>According to the terms of service of most sites, they own all content uploaded by their users. They need to be held accountable for that ownership. Every single company who hosts user-uploaded content is responsible for identifying, removing, and reporting all child sexual abuse material known and unknown. Companies who do not do this are complicit in the abuse and need to be held accountable just like an individual person would be. </p><p>I am hopeful the EARN IT Act will get companies to be more responsible and do more to protect children and will punish companies that refuse to step up. I am also hopeful that companies will also take steps to identify the live streaming of child sexual abuse and the grooming behaviors. There is a need for this. Technology could actually be used to prevent future child abuse. </p><p>I am so appreciative that these sponsors of this bill are changing the term from child pornography to child sexual abuse material. It makes it clear to society what this crime really is, the sexual abuse of a child, and the harm that it causes. Thank you, Senators Graham and Blumenthal, for introducing this bill and thank you to the committee for supporting it and being here today. This bill is about the safety of kids, and there is nothing more important than protecting them. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. I think you have done the committee a great service. Thank you very much, ma'am, and we will try to act on your suggestions. </p><p>NICOLE: Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I--I want to thank you as well. It is profoundly meaningful that you are here today, and I don't want to prolong your appearance, but I think there are a couple of points that are very much worth making that only you can make. </p><p>NICOLE: Okay. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I was horrified to learn that your child was found on 168,474 files in possession of thousands of offenders before it was stopped. These images were captured over seven years of abuse. Those images should never have been on Facebook, Instagram, or Wikipedia. There should be no place on the Internet for this kind of truly repugnant material, and just as important, your child's abuse should have been caught and flagged for law enforcement with the very first image. That is the standard that we should aim to meet in my view. </p><p>So our goal today is to find better ways to stop the scourge that affected you personally, and I wonder if you can tell us a little bit more about how the prolonged life of these images has an effect on individuals who are victims and survivors. </p><p>NICOLE: Every time the images are distributed, redistributed, viewed the child is re-victimized, and just because the abuse is over and in our case, the perpetrator is behind bars he is serving a life sentence doesn't mean it stops. They are afraid for their safety, they are afraid of being recognized, they are afraid of it harming their future because these images as widely as they can be distributed are always there, they never go away, and there's always the fear that they are not safe anymore. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: So it is not just stopping the abuse or the exploitation, the images have a life of their own unless-- </p><p>NICOLE: Yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --the companies do more to crack down on them. </p><p>NICOLE: Correct. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. Thank you very much. </p><p>GRAHAM: (INAUDIBLE) appreciate very much, and we will have the next panel come forward, please. Thank you, Nicole. If you can all rise, please. Raise your right hand. Do solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give this committee is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes. </p><p>GRAHAM: So we have four people on the panel. Mr. John Shehan, the vice president for the Exploited Child Division at NCMEC. He is responsible for NCMEC's operations relating to sexual crimes committed against children, including online child pornography, enticement, and other instances of child sexual exploitation. Jared Sine. Mr. Sine currently serves as the chief legal officer and secretary of Match Group, where he is responsible for all legal, compliance, and government affairs functions for Match Group on a global basis. Mary (INAUDIBLE) is that right?  </p><p>LEARY: That's right. </p><p>GRAHAM: Leary, professor at Catholic University, where her scholarship examines the intersection of criminal law, criminal procedure, technology, and contemporary victimization. She focuses on the exploitation and abuse of women and children and the marginalization of that group. She serves as the chair of the Victim Advisory Group to the United States Sentencing Commission. She is a former federal prosecutor and director of the National Center for the Prosecution of Child Abuse. Elizabeth Banker is deputy general counsel at the Internet Association. Ms. Banker has advised technology companies for more than 20 years on content modernization, online safety, law enforcement response. She spent a decade at Yahoo Inc., where she was VP, associate general counsel for Global Law Enforcement, Security, and Safety. Welcome to you all. We will start with Mr. Shehan. </p><p>SHEHAN: Good morning, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. Thank you for inviting the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children or NCMEC to appear before you today. I look forward to sharing my perspective on the state of child sexual exploitation online and NCMEC's support for the EARN IT Act. </p><p>My name is John Shehan, and I am the vice president of the Exploited Child Division at NCMEC. NCMEC is a private nonprofit organization that serves as a congressionally designated clearinghouse on missing and exploited children issues. Our mission is to help find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation and prevent child victimization.  </p><p>One of NCMEC's core programs is to combat child sexual exploitation through the cyber tip line, which receives reports on child sexual exploitation from the public and electronic service providers. Every day NCMEC bears witness to the constant flow of horrific child sexual abuse material flooding into the cyber tip line. Since we created the cyber tip line almost 22 years ago it has received more than 65 million reports.  </p><p>The volume of reports has increased exponentially over the years and the images, videos and other content in these reports has also increased. In 2019 NCMEC received almost 17 million reports containing over 69 million suspected child sexual exploitation images, videos, and other reported content. As the volume of reports and abusive content has increased so has the complexity of the reported content.  </p><p>Between 2017 and 2018 videos of child sexual abuse reported to the cyber tip line increased by 541 percent. Last year 41 million videos of children being sexually abused and exploited were reported. Increased use of chat and messenger services has led to reports that combine offenders enticing children online for sexual acts with the distribution of child sexual abuse material, and often those cases involve the infliction of sexual blackmail or sextortion. NCMEC has seen that any online service that enables members of the public to share content can and will be misused by offenders to abuse children and distribute their sexually abusive content online. </p><p>In NCMEC's experience, some leading technology companies such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Snap engage in voluntary and proactive efforts to detect and report child sexual exploitation, but too many companies are not proactive in fighting this problem. They engage in half measures, fail to participate in voluntary initiatives or information sharing opportunities. They too often put child protection second to organizational, financial and broader liability concerns.  </p><p>In NCMEC's view, voluntary efforts are not sufficient to combat the overwhelming volume of online child sexual abuse. Too many companies fail to participate. More is needed to incentivize tech companies to adopt consistent best practices to detect, report, and remove child sexual exploitation. These guidelines should incr--include screening effectively for child sexual abuse material using commonly available technology and best practices to detect and report this content, being legally responsible to child victims when ESP recklessly second circulates sexually abusive content online and increasing the number of ESPs registered and consistently reporting to the cyber tip line.  </p><p>It is also important to note that funding to combat this issue has failed to keep pace with the explosive volume and complexity of online child sexual abuse. Congress must ensure that each entity that handles, analyzes and investigates reports of child sexual exploitation is funded adequately. This includes NCMEC and the (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>The EARN IT Act is a child protection bill. It addresses many gaps, shortcomings and inconsistencies in how online child sexual abuse is currently combated. Most significantly this bill will create a unified roadmap of specific up to date consistent best practices developed by an expert commission. These best practices will guide ESPs in combating online child sexual abuse. The current piecemeal approach used by ESPs has failed to adequately respond to the problem.  </p><p>It will require that child sex trafficking and the online enticement of children for sexual acts will be reported by ESPs to the NCMEC cyber tip line, and it will also ensure the sanitized term child pornography is replaced with child sexual abuse material in the criminal code. This revision is incredibly significant to the families and survivors that we serve. </p><p>So, in conclusion, I want to thank you for giving NCMEC the opportunity to appear before the committee and allowing me to share my experience in combating online child sexual exploitation. NCMEC is proud to support the EARN IT Act, which will incentivize companies to adopt consistent best practices in the fight against online child sexual exploitation. We look forward to working with the committee on efforts to keep children safer from sexual exploitation online. </p><p>SINE: Good morning, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. Before I begin, I ask that my full statement be made part of the record, and I will briefly summarize my comments here.  </p><p>I am Jared Sine, chief legal officer for Match Group, a Dallas-based online company that owns a portfolio of companies that operate a variety of popular online dating sites in the U.S. and abroad. Some of the brand's members of the committee, or in many cases your single staff members may be familiar with are Tinder, match.com, OkCupid, and Hinge.  </p><p>I appreciate the bipartisan invitation to be here today to discuss our support of the EARN IT Act. Match thanks Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein, Senator Blumenthal and the other supporters of this legislation for the courage and foresight to develop the constructs of this bill. We are supporting similar legislation in the UK, and we think this is a construct that effectively promotes collaboration between industry, law enforcement, leading experts, and others. It is not only workable, it has the ability to both foster innovation and act aggressively and actively against child online exploitation while protecting the privacy rights of the users. </p><p>The EARN IT Act is a serious attempt to have the entire Internet ecosystem tackle big, complex societal issues in a way that balances protecting kids with legitimate privacy concerns. This bill takes on the right central question, how will all of us in the ecosystem keep users safe from bad actors while ensuring their privacy? The consequences of doing nothing are both unacceptable and terrifying.  </p><p>The advent of smartphones and apps has coincided with skyrocketing rates of depression and suicide among the country's young people. It is time that we recognize the impact that the Internet and digital--and a digital native generation are having on all of our nation's families regardless of their shape or size. Unlike other services, our business does not rely on the monetization of user data or viral posts. Our business depends on our users having a safe and enjoyable experience.  </p><p>Match Group recognized the dangers of online communities where minors and adults are allowed to co-mingle. That is why we voluntarily made the choice to restrict the use of our platforms to only users 18 and older and is why we need to employ extensive resources to block underage users and identify and remove bad actors and bad content from our platforms. </p><p>Kids are not equipped to sniff out the groomers from the gamers or the traffickers from the tweeters, and while we laud the efforts of technology companies across the globe who are working to try to address these problems more must be done. The EARN IT Act will not single-handedly solve all of these issues, but it serves as a clarion call to action for all technology companies because there is one unavoidable reality at the core of the Internet today. All platforms can and must do more to protect our children. </p><p>Section 230 has been a critical part of the Internet's rise in success and must be kept strong and vibrant however we do not believe that companies who do nothing to stop child exploitation should receive the benefit and trust that section 230 has long granted them. Match Group takes the privacy of our users seriously, which is why all of our brands are required to meet the rigorous standards of the general data protection regulation in the EU.  </p><p>Like all Internet companies, we grapple with the same inherent tensions that exist between privacy and safety. We believe that these issues are not mutually exclusive, especially when it comes to our support of the EARN IT Act. There are technological solutions that balance safety for our children and privacy, and we need to work to enable the commission and help develop those solutions.  </p><p>That is the point of the commission, its ability to collaborate to solve these issues taking into account the ecosystem, its needs, and the rights of its users and providers to drive a solution that works for everyone. We do not take our support of this proposal lightly, and I look forward to sharing with the committee ideas for strengthening the proposal.  </p><p>However, we believe the proposed legislation has the ability to do just that by balancing those needs of safety and privacy through collaboration. As part of the standard-setting process, the commission established by the EARN IT Act must be empowered and instructed to take these tensions into account. It is time that we all have some skin in the game to protect our children. Platforms, gatekeepers, app stores, social media, browsers and the rest of the Internet ecosystem must do more, and we at Match Group want to do more as well which is why we are rolling out newer and better technology to address the threats of today and look around the corner at the safety challenges of tomorrow. My full statement details the safety initiatives that Match is rolling out. Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Ms. Leary? Professor Leary. </p><p>LEARY: Thank you. Good morning Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the Judiciary Committee. Thank you for inviting me to join you today to be involved in this important discussion about child sexual abuse material. It has indeed grown in severity and numerically over the last several decades and merits the attention that this committee has given it over the last several years. </p><p>Let me be clear; I am not here to testify either in favor of or against the EARN IT Act. I appear as a witness who has studied the issues of exploitation of children as an academic and has worked directly on them as a former prosecutor in both the state and federal level, and I hope to offer some historical and practical context for the problems of child sexual exploitation. </p><p>I first want to commend the committee for elevating the voices of victim-survivors. The experiences survivors of this type of exploitation really captures the full scope of the horrors, and it is my belief having studied the issue that 15 or 20 years ago if that experience had been heard rather than acknowledged and moved on to other business concerns, we wouldn't be in the position that we are today. </p><p>I would first like to comment on the term child sexual abuse material. I want to be clear that from an academic perspective as well as a prosecutorial perspective, this is more than mere semantics, and I want to commend you for having the United States join the rest of the world in that kind of a label. Not only does it remove the sanitized label child pornography that previously existed, but it does something else very important in the criminal law. As this committee will know, reflecting on their first year of law school, a crime is a voluntary act that causes a social harm. </p><p>This label indicates clearly what that social harm is, and as Nicole's testimony earlier indicated, this is a uniquely pernicious harm. I used to say to victims when I talked with them it is a crime in perpetuity unlike any other crime, and this label captures that, and it also reflects the social harm that the Supreme Court has said since its earliest case in this space as well as the United States Congress. The sexualization and eroticization of minors encourages societal perceptions of children as sexual objects leading to further sexual abuse and exploitation. Congress said that in 1996 and it was indeed prophetic. </p><p>I would like to touch quickly on the mens rea discussion in this bill. Let me disabuse anyone of the notion that recklessness is a low standard. In the criminal law recklessness remains a very difficult standard to meet as a victim-survivor must establish that the actor consciously disregarded a risk that his conduct would cause this pernicious harm and moreover are not in the risk will suffice, the risk must be substantial and unjustifiable, and that risk is evaluated by considering the nature and purpose of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to the actors at the time. </p><p>And further, the recklessness standard involves a gross deviation of the standard of conduct from the law-abiding person. Given the need for deterrence in this space, the practice, and the practice that appears to disregard known identifiable risk of children, this seems a very obvious step forward. </p><p>I would like to highlight one unresolved challenge that may be present in this legislation and is worthy of further discussion, perhaps. As this committee well knows, Congress acted in 2018 in similar issues regarding sex trafficking, and that step in on the part of the United States Congress was due to an issue that was taking place on the ground in the courtrooms. Victim survivors were being denied access to justice because bad actors and backpage(SP) is the worst example of this, but I will use it as an example were using Section 230 not for what Congress intended it for, not as a shield but as a sword. And those of us who studied the issue feel that it was a strategy designed to not let their internal documents be made public, and that was that the motion to dismiss stage a stage in litigation where discovery has not yet taken place the cases were getting dismissed.  </p><p>Congress stepped in, and as a result of that has resolved that problem. That being said, it should be noted that under this legislation, a party will obtain--obtain protection if they can establish a reasonable basis to conclude that review does not reveal any material noncompliance with best practices. I would argue that that is a fairly easy standard to meet, and if that standard is met, we run the risk that once again at the motion to dismiss stage, we will not ever be getting access to internal documents, which may, in some instances show criminal activity. </p><p>With regard to my further comments, I welcome any questions. Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you very much. Ms. Banker? </p><p>BANKER: Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to testify today at this important hearing. My name is Elizabeth Banker. I am deputy general counsel at Internet Association. I ask that my full statement be included in the record.  </p><p>IA appreciates that you have made eradication of child exploitation a priority. It is also a top priority for our member companies. These horrific crimes against children, our most vulnerable and precious population are unconscionable. I would also like to acknowledge Nicole's incredibly brave testimony. Thank you for sharing your family's story. It is an important reminder of the human cost of the crimes we are discussing today. </p><p>I have worked on these issues within industry since 1999, collaborating with NCMEC, law enforcement, industry, and nonprofits dedicated to solving this problem. My work required that I review images of child sexual abuse for reporting purposes. It is difficult to express the immediate and fundamental change I experienced from seeing evidence of these crimes.  </p><p>Any person with even an ounce of empathy feels the pain of the child pictured on a visceral level. It was an extremely difficult part of my job, which I could only continue because I believed that by doing so, I could play a role in protecting if not that child than other children from those crimes. Similarly, thousands of people working on these issues at IA member companies are extraordinarily committed to fighting this content. Despite company support, they pay a personal toll, and they would not do the work if they did not believe it plays an important part in safeguarding children. </p><p>Today IA member companies alongside governments, civil society, and other stakeholders continually work to stop the spread of child exploitation. For example, IA members dedicate engineering resources to the development of tools like photo DNA and CSAI match. They donate tools to known profits and others in industry and engage with law enforcement. Many companies proactively detect and then report instances of child exploitation to NCMEC. </p><p>IA has concerns the bill would hinder existing efforts by Internet companies to keep their platform safe or worse it would undermine the efforts of law enforcement to hold bad actors to account. Our chief concern is that the bill would exacerbate a growing trend among criminal defendants charged with child exploitation in which they attempt to suppress evidence by arguing that providers who proactively detected child exploitation and reported it to NCMEC acted as agents of the government for fourth amendment purposes.  </p><p>Today courts generally view those efforts as voluntary. If a government-led commission adopts best practices which require companies to take specific actions or else face a heightened risk of liability, it becomes more likely that courts will find the companies to be acting as agents of the government. This would create a worst-case scenario in which criminal defendants could not be prosecuted using the child exploitation evidence found through provider detection efforts.  </p><p>It would make material discovered on companies' services useless as evidence. Even if that does not occur, this litigation diverts important enforcement resources that would otherwise be able to take on additional cases. Similar concerns related to the First Amendment are outlined in my written testimony, and I would be happy to discuss any of those with the committee. </p><p>The EARN IT Act also leaves open the possibility that the commission could be used as a vehicle to regulate encryption, an issue with a broad set of stakeholders, and such significant impacts for the national interests that only Congress in an open and transparent manner should set policy. </p><p>With respect to ending child exploitation, IA member companies believe that Congress can pass legislation with an immediate positive impact on the fight against child exploitation without taking on constitutional issues, the specter of encryption regulation and concerns about disturbing the wide balance that Congress has struck. We see many vehicles to do that in the EARN IT Act, including allowing for the development of new tools for detection, improving the quality and consistency of cyber tips, and assisting law enforcement investigative efforts, and we would like to continue work with the committee to address those.  </p><p>IA and our member companies stand ready to work with this committee and other willing partners to end child exploitation. I look forward to taking the committee's questions. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. I will just pick up where you ended. I've been talking and talking, and nothing has happened, so I don't buy anything you just said about the tech companies and the Internet ecosystem really caring. All they care about is just not getting sued. So if you had a choice--if you had a choice between losing your 230 protections or the EARN IT bill which one would you want when it comes to child sexual abuse, Ms. Banker? </p><p>BANKER: Chairman Graham, I don't think that we need to make a choice in order to protect children. I think that there are things that we can do today-- </p><p>GRAHAM: I think the current system is failing. You think it's working, right? </p><p>BANKER: I believe that it needs improvements. </p><p>GRAHAM: Do you think that the current system is working? Is it working? </p><p>BANKER: It needs improvements. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. Well, why does Facebook have 15.8 million reports, and who is it--Amazon has eight? </p><p>BANKER: Chairman Graham I can't speak to what any particular one IA member company-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Mr. Shehan, can you explain that? </p><p>SHEHAN: Well, certainly, Facebook is the gold standard. They are taking tools and implementing them across their entire-- </p><p>GRAHAM: So what would you say Amazon is in terms of medals? </p><p>SHEHAN: Well, they are at the bottom of the barrel because in many cases, even if the example you gave earlier 69 notices from NCMEC to Amazon regarding child sexual abuse content they were hosting, they submitted eight reports, so they are at the bottom. They may not even be complying with 2258; the mandatory reporting law let alone taking in the voluntary measures-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Do you believe the current system is working? </p><p>SHEHAN: There is a ton of room for improvement?. There are a small number of companies that are going above and beyond, but the vast majority could be doing much more. </p><p>GRAHAM: Mr. Sine, you are in this business. What do you think? </p><p>SINE: I think there is a lot we can and should be doing, and the reality is I think if companies are worried about these standards, that worries me. Ultimately I think companies should be taking it on themselves to do this, but we are not worried about a commission of like-minded and like-focused folks getting together to try and tackle these issues. </p><p>GRAHAM: You do this on your own, right? </p><p>SINE: We did. </p><p>GRAHAM: Do you actually welcome more input? </p><p>SINE: We do. We actually have our own Match Group advisory council of which the members from NCMEC are--are part of, the members of RAINN are part of that commission as well as Ms. Tarana Burke, who is the founder of the MeToo movement. We actually take their input and advice, and we are able to use that to roll out new features for our users to keep them safe like a recent feature we rolled out called noonlight(SP) which is actually an in real-time panic button that helps to protect our users if they find themselves in an emergency situation. </p><p>GRAHAM: Professor Leary, you said something really stuck out to me. You said if we had listened in 1998 and actually done something about victims, we may not be here. Is that--is that what you said? </p><p>LEARY: That is what I said. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. This is 2020; I am listening. Should we do more? </p><p>LEARY: Well, I think it is clear that we should do more and I think the best example of that would be this committee's hearing this summer where I think that most of the panelists made it very clear that the problems and the explosion of child sexual abuse images are not a collateral side effect of the Internet, but in fact, some have argued, some scholars have argued it is in fact because of the business model of some of these companies that it incentivizes--incentivizes this kind of behavior and there's money to be made when one does not pay attention to these issues. </p><p>GRAHAM: Mr. Shehan, the National District Attorneys Association, the National Sheriffs Association all support this effort. Do you believe law enforcement needs help in this area? </p><p>SHEHAN: Absolutely. Yes, they do. They are under-resourced. These are very technical crimes to investigate. They are emotionally draining on law enforcement as well. We need to take care of them from a number of standpoints. Mental health, they need to have those services. So you have longevity for law enforcement in these careers, and they also need the training and expertise know how to handle these. But they are overwhelmed as it is now and we know that there are only more instances to find by the tech companies using these tools. We need to invest in law enforcement and have them ready to respond to these cases. </p><p>GRAHAM: Ms. Banker, I appreciate what you've done. I don't mean to be rude to you, but there's just a real disparity between what's happening in your industries, and I want to work with you to fix it. Is Section 230 a constitutional right? </p><p>BANKER: Section 230 plays an important role in allowing certain circum- </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, that wasn't my question. Is it a constitutional right, or is it something Congress gave and can take away if it chooses? </p><p>BANKER: It is a law passed by Congress. </p><p>GRAHAM: And we can change it if we would like. Thank you. Senator Feinstein? </p><p>FEINSTEIN: I guess I just have a hard time understanding how people defend this. Last month the New York Times recounted that the number of reported photos, videos, and other materials related to online child sexual abuse grew by more than 50 percent. How does this happen in this country? Mr. Shehan? </p><p>SHEHAN: Well, it is certainly a global problem. Many of these platforms are used by individuals all around the world, so it's not just U.S. citizens who are uploading child sexual abuse material onto these platforms. It is people all around the world, even the 17--almost 17 million reports that we had to our cyber tip line last year 93 percent of those involved individuals outside of the United States exploiting these U.S. platforms, and as such we are providing these reports to law enforcement all around the globe.  </p><p>But we truly are just starting to scratch the surface. If you move away from the top 10, top 15 companies that are reporting it really nosedives and there are some major companies that could be doing a lot more. So what we are looking at now could only continue to grow if all of the companies truly harnessed these technologies and start looking and finding and removing this content. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Mr. Sine, would you like to comment on that? </p><p>SINE: Look, we agree with Mr. Shehan that companies can and should be doing more which is why in our platforms many of our platforms like Tinder, Hinge, etc. we don't even allow private image sharing, private image distribution because we would prefer-- </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, let me ask (INAUDIBLE) are you comfortable with the way things are? </p><p>SINE: No, definitely not. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Okay. That is what I wanted to know. So you would be open to this bill? </p><p>SINE: We--we--we support this bill. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Good. Thank you very much. I thought your--Ms. Leary, I thought your comments were very, very good and right on point. What is amazing to me is that anybody should have a resistance to this. This is children we are talking about. They have every right or should have to be protected. Why do you think this has been taken such advantage of? Just because it sells? </p><p>LEARY: Well, I will say that I think early on if I--if I could date myself a little bit to back when I was a prosecutor explaining to courts, to jurors, to the public the uniquely pernicious harm of child sex abuse material required some work. It wasn't really understood. We had situations where judges would say things well, it's just looking at pictures.  </p><p>I think we've come a long way now, and part of that is because the images are so egregious, so to quote Senator Blumenthal so stomach-turning that it has captured people's attention. Why does it continue? It continues--I will use a line from my closing arguments criminal activity in--in this space is limited only by the perverted imagination of offenders, and in this case, the child sexual abuse then is amplified and magnified by a business model that profits directly or indirectly from the exchange of these images. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: I thank you for that, and I thank you Mr. Shehan for what you are doing. I think it is very, very important. </p><p>I understand that you've received nearly 17 million such reports in 2019. Is that correct?  </p><p>SHEHAN: Yes, it is. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Does the center staff process the volume? How do you do it?  </p><p>SHEHAN: We're doing the best that we can and we are understaffed, underfunded in this regard. There are less than 30 analysts there working their tail off to--to process and analyze these cyber tip line reports. You do the quick math and it's impossible. It's impossible to put eyes on every single report. The vast majority of internationally-based reports, the ones that need to go overseas unfortunately we are not putting eyes on.  </p><p>Our first priority, our domestic cases, and those are in the hundreds of thousands. We also use technology. There are companies like Palantir that come in. They make sure that from a data perspective, there's nothing that slips through the cracks. We're always trying to identify children that are at risk or highest priority but the volume to staffing ratio is of great concern and we certainly welcome additional resources in the future to address it. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, I appreciate that and I'd like to make myself available to help in any way I possibly can and I just want to complement you, Mr. Chairman, and the senator on our side that is headed this. It's a giant step forward and very important. So thank you very much. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you very much. Senator Kennedy. </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for calling this hearing and thank you, Senator Blumenthal, wherever you are, for--for offering this bill. I just asked my officemate to sign me up as a co-author.  </p><p>I want to move past the issue of a commission and talk about possible solutions. I'd like you to answer my question, respectfully, with specificity. We understand the problem. I want to talk specifically to the point, meat on the bone about specificity. Ms. Banker, if you could tell me and 30 seconds the specific things that should be done to solve this problem. </p><p>BANKER: Thank you, senator. I believe that the most impactful thing we can do now is to pass legislation that was would specifically allow companies to use what is otherwise criminal material to develop new detection technologies using artificial intelligence and machine learning. </p><p>KENNEDY: Anything else? </p><p>BANKER: I think resources for NCMEC, law enforcement, and victims assistance programs is also very helpful. </p><p>KENNEDY: Anything the companies can do better? </p><p>BANKER: Well, the companies want to build better detection technology and currently there--they would be prevented from being able to do so. In addition, I think that the changes to the reporting statute that are in the ordered act would be helpful-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Let me stop you because I want to give everybody a chance here. I'm--I apologize for being rude. Specifically, Mr. Shehan. </p><p>SHEHAN: I think we need greater widespread adoption of the tools that even currently exist. There are tools to detect images-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Well, I agree with that-- </p><p>SHEHAN: --Videos and text-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --How do we do that? </p><p>SHEHAN: With greater transparency. </p><p>KENNEDY: I love transparency. How do we do that? </p><p>SHEHAN: Well, I mean, that's the that's where we have to get to. I mean, when the New York Times covered the fact that the creators of photo DNA don't even use it across their entire platform, we need to know those. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay, I know the problem. I'm not trying to be rude, I'm--I wanted to hear specifically what we should do in the next 30 days to fix this. </p><p>SHEHAN: Well, I think we're headed in that direction to give the incentives to use those tools. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay, Mr.--I'm sorry. Sine. </p><p>SINE: Sine. Like the trigonometric function. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, sir. Specifically </p><p>SINE: Yes, I think what we can do is pass a law like this-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Other than that-- </p><p>SINE: --Pass an appropriate act-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Other than that. </p><p>SINE: You know, other laws that require technology companies to use AI assisted review. That's what we use at our--our company. </p><p>KENNEDY: What if we said to our friends in the--in the--in the broadband Internet community, look, were going to give you a reasonable amount of time to fix this problem or substantially reduce it using the authority that you have and, if you don't, we're going to pull section--your section 230 protection. Would that do it? </p><p>SINE: I think a lot of people would move a lot faster. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. And maybe we could do it in stages. </p><p>SINE: Sure. Sure, I mean, companies will need-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Well, I'm not talking--I'm not talking years, I think--I think some of our companies are doing good job. I think some could do a better job, but you know, some people respond to light, others respond to heat and I bet if we took away the 230 protection, they would both feel light and heat. Professor? </p><p>LEARY: Thank you, senator. I think there's a robust discussion about a lot of things that could be done, and you've touched on the spectrum of them. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay, tell me specifically. </p><p>LEARY: Well, specifically, one is to revisit 230 in its entirety. Whether or not it should exist at all in a modern age or if it should be substantially adjusted to reflect the current space in which we live. </p><p>KENNEDY: How would you substantially adjust it? </p><p>LEARY: Well, I would share with you one suggestion from the National Association of Attorneys General to deal with the state law issue and they have suggested over the years, and I may--I don't work for them, so I may get there quote not exactly right, but to clearly allow not just a carveout, but enforcement of state laws across the board as not being affected by section 230.  </p><p>I think that would be important because in the area of child sexual exportation, we need multiple pressure points. This is a complex problem. So state, private rights of action, federal action are all helpful. I think in that context, it would also solve a side effect of section 230-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Okay yes, ma'am. Let me stop for a second because I don't want to go over. Look, I'm all for the commission. I think it's a great idea and I sense that some of our companies are doing a better job--doing a good job maybe we should change the law, counselor. And we can give them more authority. But I think some are stalling and re-stalling and I think it has to do with money and that's not acceptable.  </p><p>And I've been--we've all been part of these hearings. We can all sit here and talk about the problem all day long. We know there's a problem. I'm willing to give the commission a shot. I think, again, the senator wasn't here when I complement them. I think this is a great idea. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I've already heard about it and I appreciate it. </p><p>KENNEDY: You're welcome. I am going to cosponsor it. </p><p>GRAHAM: Good news travels quicker, I think. </p><p>KENNEDY: But--but I'm ready to do something and I bet if we say look, here's the deal, either show meaningful progress, we'll define that for you, and--and in this period of time, and be specific, or we're going to yank your 230 immunity. I bet we'd get some progress. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, I want to associate myself with what you just said. This bill is kind of a balanced approach, but I'm very open-minded to other ideas too. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, sir.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Leahy.  </p><p>LEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I--I am glad you're having these hearings. I applaud what you've done and Senator Blumenthal has done. And incidentally, I am--I had expressed my--my worries that the Department of Justice wasn't here, but I understand you're going to have a--a law enforcement panel and they will be here because they have to be heard from. The number of instances of CSAM reported by the tech companies to NCMEC has exploded in recent years. I think it's 40 to 45 million last year. Is that correct? I believe. </p><p>UNKNOWN: 17 million reports, but 45--the files are 45. </p><p>LEAHY: Thank you. Leads referred to the national task forces increased by 400 percent between 2010 and 18. The rest have only on a very slightly. They actually decreased some in 2018 and that same year, only 660 criminal defendants in the whole country were federally prosecuted for sexual abuse offenses against minors and I think there are probably an awful lot more cases than that.  </p><p>I--I would ask, Mr. Shehan, what accounts for the disconnect? I mean, what can we do in Congress to ensure that growing number of CSAM tips and referrals received by law enforcement, not all over the country, make sure they actually go into prosecution? I must admit, as a former prosecutor, I'd kind of like to see, especially if it involves minors, that the hammer comes down. </p><p>SHEHAN: Absolutely. And by and far, there needs to be more resources for law enforcement to investigate these cases. They are inundated with cyber tips alone and often times, you'll hear the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force members mentioning how they can't do proactive work or their struggling to respond to--to other cases in their locality because of the cyber tabs, and so they need more funding for training and mental health care as well. </p><p>LEAHY: I know that the commission created by this legislation is going to go into--Mr. Chairman, it's a pretty difficult issue we've wrestled with for years, encryption innovation as Senator Blumenthal knows, competition, privacy, free speech online. Yet, the commission fails to agree on best practices than the standard civil liability drops from, as I understand, from knowledge to recklessness. </p><p>And with technology, which is changing by the day, no case law to guide the courts, I'm worried that what the what constitutes recklessness for a tech company is only going to be a guessing game. So, Mr. Sine and Ms. Banker, how would this practical recklessness standard affect you or your members businesses? Whichever one what wants to start. </p><p>SINE: So from our perspective, and we've spoken with the staff of the chairman and Senator Blumenthal about this. We do believe the appropriate standard is knowledge. However, we believe that a reckless standard is one that in this instance, you know, I'm a father of five kids. I got a two-year-old at home and a 13-year-old teenager. I think it's something we should be able to mitigate the risk of liability associated with that. This is a really important topic. </p><p>LEAHY: Ms. Banker? </p><p>BANKER: Thank you. We do have concerns that the recklessness standard would be unpredictable in this space. I think we would all agree that anyone instance of this type of material being found on a provider's system is too many and, in light of that, it's difficult without having any case law or other references available to understand what--what reasonable measures would be and what would be considered reckless by a court. </p><p>LEAHY: Well, let me look at 10 circuits acumen decisions then Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote it. If tech companies are effectively acquired by government backed commissions to search private consumers information, any evidence derived from that may be ruled admissible under the fourth amendment absent a warrant, which also concerns me as senator and as a former prosecutor. I understand many of you may have differing views, but were going to do--how do we have the people answer to people who are concerned the commission could run afoul of Justice Gorsuch opinion Ackerman (SP)? Anyone want to try that? </p><p>LEARY: I'll take a stab at that. A couple of points on the fourth amendment. First of all, the Ackerman case stands alone in a sea of case law and it is squarely focused on the national center. I think it's important to note that cases across the country in general as to the ISPs have not found them to be state actors. </p><p>A special point about the fourth amendment issue, and it's a complex one, is the fourth amendment, not very--the very question, which is such a good one deals with that tension that we always have with the Fourth Amendment between privacy and security. Therein lies the tension. But the Fourth Amendment is designed to help us inform policy when we are in this place, not to say well, this will be difficult. </p><p>And I know this is not the source of your question, but I--I've seen this in the debate. Well, we can't even talk about it because there is no case law. I think that as I read the bill, that's exactly what the commission will be discussing as well as many other implications, technology, et cetera, to figure out if there will be fourth amendment issues. But I think it is far from certain that this will transform provider into a government actor if they voluntarily choose to follow best practices that they helped to develop with their colleagues in the field. </p><p>LEAHY: I have other questions, Mr. Chairman, if I might submit them for the record. </p><p>GRAHAM: Absolutely. And maybe the simple thing is to let the civil justice system work this out. Just sue and if you win, you win. If you lose, you lose. Senator Cornyn. </p><p>CORNYN: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for convening this important hearing. We've done, as some of you have noted, important work illuminating the back pages of the world, the protect--the PROTECT our Children Act that Senator Blumenthal and I lead on and was--as well as the cyber tip line for NCMEC Senator Feinstein and I worked on. But I understand, Professor, that you addressed a question with regard to the outright appeal of Section 230 immunity and I had to be in the Finance Committee. Could you address that again? Why not do that? </p><p>LEARY: Well, I did not offer an opinion as to why not to do it or do it, I simply in my prior answer try to say there's a full spectrum in the academic and advocacy world about how to address this problem. And they extend from Section 230 absolutists who had taken the view that we can never touch it all the way to those who say we should completely repeal it. </p><p>Section 230 was created at a time and the purpose was--there were many purposes, but it was particularly unique and there was a nascent Internet in its infancy and the desire was to not impede its growth, but at the same time, importantly, another equally important goal was to reward good Samaritans and to shield children from objectionable content. </p><p>CORNYN: But you will agree with me, the Internet is no longer nascent enterprise. </p><p>LEARY: Precisely. </p><p>CORNYN: It's quite mature, as we've seen from some of the numbers here and Congress has already passed some exceptions to that immunity, correct, and the area of child exportation, terrorist incitement? We've seen foreign actors use our Internet for information warfare and active measures to create dissension and discord in our democracy in the last election of 2016.  </p><p>So I--I think that's a real question. Why not just repeal the immunity and let the appropriate legal standard apply whether it's ordinary care or whether it's what we would apply to a publisher? Most of the platforms now have admitted I think Facebook in particular has admitted that it no longer they no longer consider themselves to be a neutral platform. They actually--they edit their newsfeed and, just like--I just don't understand why they shouldn't be treated like a publisher, for example. Do you have any observation about that? </p><p>LEARY: Well, senator, I would say my focus today is on the child exploitation issues as it relates to this question and I think what I would say in that space is you're quite right. We know where we are now and when one looks at the purposes and findings that Congress had in section 230, as well as the unique history that this particular provision was part of a larger bill, this particular provision was put in an order to balance the larger bill. The larger bill was later found unconstitutional and, ironically, the tech industry was left with a bonus, just the protections. So I do think it's fair to revisit that now these over two decades later. </p><p>CORNYN: Thank you. Mr. Sine, I--I appreciate Match being based in Dallas. You talk about the measures you have undertaken or that your company has undertaken to protect children against exploitation. My simple question is if you're doing it, why can't everybody do it? </p><p>SINE: We think they can. We think they can we do think section 230 is important for smaller to medium size companies who may not have their resources and, clearly, we are not opposed to the larger companies having the protection as well, but we think everyone can do it. The technology is out there and it's something that can readily be either shared from other technologies or patchwork built within the companies themselves. </p><p>CORNYN: Well, maybe--maybe this isn't the appropriate time and place to find out, but I'd like to know exactly what those financial and other obstacles might be to smaller companies to prevent them from doing what companies like Match is doing. </p><p>SINE: And would be happy to come meet with your staff and help share if that would be helpful. </p><p>CORNYN: You know, in Texas, as in most states, if you observe or witness a child abuse, you have a legal obligation to report it and you are guilty of a crime if you don't. Why should not apply to the Internet? </p><p>SINE: Is that a question for me, senator? </p><p>CORNYN: Yes, sir. Or anybody else who would like to take a stab at it. </p><p>SINE: You know, I think the way we look at it is the technology is good and it's developing, but it's only so good in terms of absolutes. We can't absolutely guarantee that every image that might cross this threshold would be picked up. We, again, have technologies that we believe does a really good job of that. It's homegrown, unbuilt, but it's not--it's never foolproof.  </p><p>CORNYN: Right. And since my time has run out, I won't ask the others to comment on it, but I think certainly there is a way for Congress to craft a standard that would protect people who act in good faith to try to eliminate the risk. And I'm not talking about absolute liability in the event something happened to slip through. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>HAWLEY: Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you--thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I think that Senator Cornyn has just articulated a feeling that most parents, most citizens would share, that we ought to be able to craft a standard as legislators, some of us as former attorneys general, as Senator Hawley and Senator Cornyn are and technology is available to provide better detection so that companies that see something ought to say something. That's a basic obligation of good corporate citizenship, but basic human decency. </p><p>And I want to touch on an aspect of this problem that I think is very important for people to understand, Mr. Shehan. The Internet Association says well all we need is more resources. I agree. More resources devoted to this problem would be beneficial. But perhaps you can tell us why more resources alone are not the answer. </p><p>SHEHAN: Well, I think in many respects, the resources exist. There are a number of tools out there right now that companies can use to detect child sexual abuse images, videos, and the grooming of children for sexual purposes. What it comes down to is do the companies want to implement those tools across their entire ecosystem? </p><p>You know, the New York Times recently did a number of series, you mentioned them earlier, and in there, they discovered that the creator of photo DNA, the company that created photo DNA hasn't even utilized it in their search. It's not used in their cloud services. So what is preventing that adoption within the companywide atmosphere? You have companies like Facebook they're doing it and proving that it can work. The tools exist. They just have to be rolled out. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And perhaps you could--I think that's an excellent answer. The technical technological resources exist, they're just not being used by these companies. And what we're trying to do here is incentivize the companies to make use of resources that exist right now. Maybe you can also tell us a little bit about how information in real time can help NCMEC better stop this abuse as it may be ongoing. </p><p>SHEHAN: Absolutely. So better reporting into the cyber tip line. We provide a number of structured fields that are there, and there are ways to escalate reports, elevate real-time situations when a child's life is believed to be in danger, but many of the companies are using those fields. They're not properly reporting. There were two companies last year that we had to threaten that basically they couldn't--improve their reporting with within 30 days, we were going to remove their automated access. They cleaned it up, they got it back on point.  </p><p>There are some companies where thousands of reports are coming in on the same individual. The same suspect, and law enforcement is being burdened with having to review 1000 reports instead of 1. There are much better ways to transmit that information, flagged the situation when a child's life is believed to be in danger and so we can go in and get that information to law enforcement so the child can be quickly recovered. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And these are lives in danger in real time. </p><p>SHEHAN: Absolutely. Everything all day. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: It's not past violation of law, but in real time, you can help save lives and stop predation.  </p><p>SHEHAN: Yes. Every week, their cases are coming and where those types of situations are escalated. We're giving it to law enforcement and they're making arrests within hours and pulling children out of sexually abusive situations. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. Ms. Pinker, in response to the letter that Senators Hawley, Cornyn, Graham, Hirono, and I sent to dozens of tech companies on their efforts to police child sexual abuse material, Facebook wrote us the following. And I'm quoting. \"We are committed to designing strong prevention detection and reporting systems to ensure that private and secure messaging services provide users with industry-leading privacy and security while safeguarding them and others from online abuse.\"  </p><p>In other words, Facebook has told us end to end encryption can coexist with preventing child exploitation. I'd like to ask you, and I think it's answerable by a yes or a no, I don't think it's a terribly complicate question, and I have limited time. Is Facebook telling us the truth? Are they telling us the truth? Can end to end encryption coexist with strong safeguards and enforcement against child exportation, yes or no? </p><p>BANKER: There are other mechanisms that can be used to detect inappropriate action-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --But they are telling us the truth, correct? Or are they lying? </p><p>BANKER: Well, I haven't seen the response, and I can't speak to any one company, but I do know from my own experience working on detection of this type of material that the content is--is one piece of it. But there are-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --I'll take that as a yes. I'll take that as a yes and you're nodding, so I will definitely take it as a yes. And it's what I understand the truth to be. I've been reading in the press that the EARN IT Act is a secret trick to ban encryption, a backdoor to a backdoor. This bill says nothing about encryption. Have you found a word in this bill about encryption? </p><p>BANKER: No, I haven't. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Except it makes absolutely clear that privacy interests and cyber security experts are at the heart of this commission and, apparently, the argument has been made by big tech and its allies that any commission that cares about child exportation will necessarily ban encryption. What you just told me, I think, is very important. That strong law enforcement is compatible with strong encryption. I believe it, big tech knows it, and either Facebook is lying and I think they're telling us the truth when they say that law enforcement is consistent with strong encryption, or big tech is using encryption as a subterfuge to oppose this bill.  </p><p>And I don't think it is all of the tech industry. In fact, Match is here today to refute that myth and I believe strongly that, in effect, big tech doesn't want to lose this absolute blanket immunity and they don't want to have to do anything to earn it. So I understand. I get it. But at the same time, I don't think the American people want this to be a fight about encryption.  </p><p>I think they want the truth, and the truth is encryption can coexist with strong law enforcement. I have other questions, Mr. Chairman. I don't want to take more time. Maybe we'll have a second round. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. Senator Lee. </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to all of you for being here. CSAM is devastating. It's sickening. It's one of those things that we wish didn't exist in our society, but one of those things that harms so many people in so many ways that are so personal and so devastating it can't be ignored.  </p><p>I think every one of us shares that appalling reaction to it. I think there are efforts that we, all of us, Congress, members of the public, members of the tech community, everyone can and must do to stem the tide, to stem the tide of CSAM and protect our children, protect the public from all the havoc that it creates. As a Congress, we ought to be looking for solutions to the problem and we ought to be looking for solutions that can both do the job and withstand constitutional scrutiny and make sure that whatever we do causes no harm.  </p><p>The last thing we want to do is undertake something that could unintentionally create more problems or lead to more of the same problem that we want to create. I'm always reminded of the example of the British government when it was operating in India would sometimes do things that had counterintuitive results. For a while, they would purchase cobras. People were dying from cobra bites. When they would pay money for cobras thinking that would solve the problem. They could kill all the cobras. They found that people were breeding cobras in order to create at new profit center. We don't want to breed cobras here.  </p><p>Ms. Banker, let's start with you. In your testimony, you raise some concerns--some potential fourth amendment issues related to the Ackerman line of cases. You've said that increased government regulation, and voluntary efforts made by companies may actually result in sex offenders walking free. And, you know, there is a state actor issue that we really do need to address and I also think it's important that we focus on the fact that what Congress can't regulate--Congress shouldn't intuitively respond to by saying well, if we can't regulate it, directly, we can threaten to do this or that in order to coerce whatever we want. That can create some of the same institutional and public policy related concerns. Can you further elaborate for us the fourth amendment implications of this legislation? </p><p>BANKER: Absolutely. And--and first, I'd just like to say that for IA's member companies, the prosecution of these crimes is a priority and that is the reason we are voicing this concern. Today in the wake of the Ackerman case, which was about NCMEC being a state actor, criminal defendants across the country have filed motions to suppress evidence in their criminal prosecutions because they are arguing that the providers who proactively detected the material and then reported it to NCMEC were acting as agents of the government, and it's an illegal search.  </p><p>Our concern is that this act would exacerbate that problem and, to date, we've been lucky in that I'm not aware of a court that has suppressed evidence of these crimes, but we are concerned that, one, the renewed vigor with which criminal defendants will pursue this will pull important resources of investigators, prosecutors, and even the company personnel who work on these issues to address that litigation at the expense of other cases that could be prosecuted. But also, that a court may go the other direction and decide to suppress evidence, and that really is the worst case scenario where one of these sexual predators would essentially get off scott free. </p><p>LEE: I don't have a lot of time remaining, but in the time remaining, can you tell me, just give me your take in response to the encryption issue. Tell me what you think, what impact this bill could have on the security event of end to end encryption. </p><p>BANKER: Thank you. I believe the concern that is being raised about encryption is an understanding of the types of best practices that are likely to be recommended by the commission, which, as we discussed here at this panel, are likely to include at best practice to screen content, which may require that content be available to the provider in plaintext, and therefore, a provider would not be able to implement end to end encryption and still be able to do the certification and potentially also wouldn't be able to qualify through reasonable measures and, I think worst-case scenario, would potentially be thought to be reckless and having adopted that security technology. </p><p>From IA's perspective, we think encryption is a vitally important issue as is protecting children, and what we would prefer is to see this committee continue its work holding hearings and address this issue in an open and transparent way that can take into effect--into account the--all of the significant factors and that nation's interest as a whole with regard to this encryption question. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>HAWLEY: Senator Blackburn. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Nicole, I want to say a thank you to you for coming and being with us today and sharing your story and, of course, the heartbreak that goes along with that. We appreciate that you are here. And Professor Leary, I have to tell you, I appreciate your long-term view to this. This is a--a problem that has grown.  </p><p>We know that bad people are going to use every available avenue they can to do bad things. And with the advent of technology and especially, and I think you hit it right talking about 98, going from analog-to-digital, which enabled so much of this. And I was leading my state through the analog-to-digital transition in the mid-90s and I remember full well exactly what you are talking about.  </p><p>I--I think that you all see our intent to deal with platform liability and responsibility and accountability as we talk about protecting children. I'm a mother, I'm a grandmother. That is how I look at these issues and I think shielding these bad actors and criminals is despicable, absolutely despicable. And Ms. Banker, we don't mean to be up on you. I hope you don't take it that way. You're the messenger. We realize that, but I think we do realize also that the companies in the Internet Association play a little bit of turn the other I and there are technologies that could have been used and should be used every day that are available to you all.  </p><p>And you fought privacy actively and have pushed back on our efforts to work on privacy and data security. Not you individually, the Association. And member companies. So tell me very quickly, have you structured any best practices as an association for protecting children? Have you all put anything down? Are you actively working with any parent-teacher groups, any church groups, any school groups to protect children? What are you aggressively doing to protect children? </p><p>BANKER: Thank you for the question, Senator Blackburn. And I'd--I'd like to start by noting that IA doesn't support that measure that you have cosponsored, the end child exploitation act, which we think will that will greatly benefit this area because it will allow for the creation of new tools as well as give law enforcement more time. </p><p>BLACKBURN: And let me introduce interrupt you right there. And the end child exploitation online child exploitation act, Senator Hawley is a cosponsor and Senators Cortez Masto and Hassan. So, that is something we're doing. I'm asking you all as an association, do you have any best practices for protecting children? Do you have a toolbox you give parents saying we want to be a partner in protecting your child's online, yes or no? Have you done that or not? </p><p>BANKER: IA's member companies engage in many of those efforts. In fact, the recent announcement of the five countries voluntary principles related to child sexual exploitation material-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: --Are you conducting any training or any engagement with parental groups to shield children? Let me do this a different way. Mr. Shehan, NCMEC. Are they working with you all to educate parents? Mr. Sine, are they working with you all to educate parents? What kind of participation and support are you getting voluntarily from these companies? </p><p>SHEHAN: I'm not aware from the Internet Association using some of the material we have, but there are a number of companies that take our educational material and promote it both online. As you know, we have the net smarts and are kid smart material that are in the schools. We actively engage the community to better educate around these topics. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay, so some of their companies are working with you in that front? </p><p>SHEHAN: Yes, yes. </p><p>BLACKBURN: And Mr. Sine, I know that the tech task force that I'm leading and Senator Feinstein is working with me on this, it's right here in judiciary committee, Senator Blumenthal has been an active participant in this and we've had some great--great discussions and Senator Blumenthal and I have sent a letter to the FCC on a--on a couple of things. But I know your chief privacy officer was before us and we talked about the dating apps and the Match companies and he talked about some of the proactive steps that you all as a company have been taking.  </p><p>And one thing I wanted to follow up with, and I know my time is now expired, but I know you all had--were taking some steps to provide more tools for women so they could report people that were a scam artist, things of this nature. If you'll just give a quick update on what you're doing to make that a safer environment for women in the online space. </p><p>SINE: Sure. Thanks, Senator. Through our Match group advisory Council, we continue to take feedback rolling out tools like the new light tool that I mentioned, which is an emergency panic button that our women users can use when they find themselves either in an uncomfortable situation or an emergency situation to dispatch emergency responders directly to them. That came directly from our work with match group advisory Council, including NCMEC. So we have a number of tools and initiatives like that that are currently either rolled out or in the process of rolling out. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Excellent. My time is expired. I yield back. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Senator Blackburn. I want to start my questions by saying to Nicole, thank you for being here. Thank you for sharing your story, and I'm sorry that you had to endure, as the mother of the victim, what you had to endure in your family. And I think part of the hope, the aim of this legislation is to make sure that other people don't have to go through that. But thank you for being an advocate and for being here. </p><p>The way I see it, this legislation is really simple. It's really simple. It says that if you want, if these tech companies want, broad blanket protections of section 230, and make no mistake, section 230 is how these companies have gotten big, it's how they've gotten powerful, it's how they got rich. They've done it with this special immunity that the federal government has given them. </p><p>So if they want that, then they're going to have to actually do something for it. They're going to have to actually take some steps to protect our children online. So people like Nicole, parents like Nicole, I say this as a father myself of two small boys, don't have to go through what your family went through. They're going to have to actually, as the title says, earn it.  </p><p>And you know, it's interesting to watch these tech companies and their fleets of lobbyists in this building and their many dark money groups out there screams that the sky is falling and the Internet is going to break. We heard all these same arguments with SESTA/FOSTA. All the same--in fact, it's almost sometimes the lines are repeated verbatim. You can just read the same script over and over.  </p><p>Last time I looked, the Internet was still working even after SESTA/FOSTA and, in fact, it's a better place now that we have taken on human trafficking online and we can make it a better place by taking on child exploitation online and it is not too much to ask for these big tech companies to do their part in order to earn this blanket immunity that they have enjoyed as a gift from this government for so long. Professor Leary, I think you--you very ably have pointed out that the original bargain, if you will, to the tech companies was that they were supposed to, in turn, for moderating certain content, they were supposed to then get the section 230 immunity.  </p><p>But of course, the content they were originally supposed to moderate is--is now gone. The Supreme Court struck that part down. So they had basically free immunity for all of these years and they've used it to their own purposes. So my message on this is common to all of those tech companies out there who have been saying for years now that you can't possibly such touch section 230, that if you do that, you will end the Internet as we know it, this is a bipartisan bill with bipartisan support in the days of this Congress giving out free stuff to big tech without asking or expecting anything in return are coming to an end. They are coming to an end.  </p><p>And rightly so because the people of this country, the parents of this country are demanding it and that's exactly how it should be. Ms. Banker, let me come to you. I thought I heard you say to Senator Lee, and maybe--maybe I misheard you, I thought I heard you say that--that part of your opposition to this bill is it would make it too hard to prosecute child abusers. Did I hear you right? </p><p>BANKER: Yes, senator. </p><p>HAWLEY: And why is that? I mean, so you're telling me that your--you're opposed to a bill that is to crack down--give law enforcement potentially new tools to crack down on child sexual exploitative material because it would actually be a gift to those who are--who are committing the exploitation. I mean, is that the--is that the logic? Walk me through that. </p><p>BANKER: Absolutely. Right now, there are numerous criminal defendants who have filed motions to suppress the evidence of their crimes that were detected by--through the proactive efforts of IA member companies. The concern we have is that today when the companies go to court and explain in those suppression hearings how it is that they came to report this material with a say is that it was completely independent as a decision and it was completely voluntary. </p><p>HAWLEY: Are you aware of any court that's actually suppressed any evidence on these grounds? </p><p>BANKER: No, because the--the companies are saying this was independent. This is a voluntary decision that we made. Our concern is that-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Don't you think there's a little bit of tension between arguing that this is actually going to make it too difficult to prosecute child abusers, essentially, and saying what so many of your members have said that this gives too many tools to prosecutors, that this is a giveaway to prosecutors? For instance, here's a--here's a statement from one tech group. It says that the EARN IT Act would give DOG--DOJ prosecutors a shortcut, would present Congress with legal mandates that lawmakers would never pass on their own.  </p><p>That doesn't sound like something that is worried about being too--too--too lenient the child abusers, itself like they're worried that it's going to be give law enforcement to many tools. So I mean, which is it? </p><p>BANKER: Well, I'm not familiar with the statement that you're reading, Senator Hawley. </p><p>HAWLEY: Let me ask you then--let me ask you just about whether you think that this is right. What--what--is your view that the EARN IT Act would give DOJ a shortcut and present Congress with legal mandates that we would be obliged to adopt? Because I've read that criticism on a lot of places that it's--whatever the commission says, it's going to automatically be enacted. Is that your understanding of this bill? </p><p>BANKER: My understanding of the bill Is that it contains what would be an expedited approval process for Congress to approve best practices submitted by the attorney general after approving the commission's work. </p><p>HAWLEY: But it is an approval process, right? In other words, it has to go through the normal presentment process. Congress has to actually vote on it. It not automatic. Isn't that right? </p><p>BANKER: Yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: And so the commission makes recommendations. There an advisory panel that this Congress has the ability to adopt them or not adopt him. Is that right? </p><p>BANKER: Yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: Let me ask you about encryption. Senator Blumenthal touched on this. I also heard it said by the repeated in some of the--some of these tech groups usually funded, I might add, by our usual friends, Facebook, Google. They say things like if the AG wants to ban encryption, there's no way to stop it. Do you agree with that? Do you think that's what this bill does is bands encryption? </p><p>BANKER: I think it's difficult to predict given the breadth-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --But do you think this bill bans encryption? </p><p>BANKER: I do not believe the bill bans encryption. What I--I believe the bill does is it creates a--the government led commission that is tasked with addressing a broad range of matters and that encryption and its impact could very well come up within the scope of the matters that the commission is charged with addressing. </p><p>HAWLEY: Here's--here's what it sounds like to me is that we've got our friends in the big tech world who will grasp at any straw to oppose this bill. Either it's too prosecution friendly or no, it's not persecution friendly enough because it's going to make prosecutions tougher. Either it's going to undermine privacy or maybe it's going to make privacy to tough so the prosecutors can't go after these people. I mean, it's just--the logic doesn't really hold.  </p><p>And I will say I think that there's--it's a little bit rich to hear from the big tech companies, not you personally, Ms. Banker, but some of these companies say that privacy now is such a high value after they have spent years building a business model that takes our data without telling us, sells it without our consent, monetizes it, and we get nothing for it. So like Senator Blumenthal, I'm a great advocate of end to end encryption.  </p><p>I think that end to end encryption must be able to exist with robust law enforcement and I'm not going to support anything that does not protect the integrity of encryption for users. I can promise you that. But we've got to find a way to be able to protect children online and I think this bill is a great step forward. Senator Blumenthal, you have additional questions. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I do have some additional questions and I think Senator Hawley, you have stated very powerfully the points where there is strong bipartisan agreement here, that end to end encryption is compatible with the best practices that would be adopted by this commission. And Professor Leary, you stated very, very well the initial reasons for section 230.  </p><p>I recognize Ms. Banker, you are the messenger here. You're not to be held personally responsible, but I think you should take back to your clients a message here. And you're hearing it, I think, loud and clear that the tech companies, big or small, can be part of the solution or they will be part of the problem. And they will lose all section 230 protection if they don't become part of the solution here.  </p><p>We are dealing with a challenge that ought to engage every responsible member of our society. Every parent, as Mr. Sine is, and we are, every law enforcement official, every responsible corporation. And I think you'll see a whirlwind of opposition to section 230 writ large across the board unless we deal with this discrete and very solvable problem.  </p><p>I want to address this myth of companies becoming government agents simply because they follow responsible practices. You know, I--I've been a prosecutor, I've also been a defense counsel. If some criminal defendant comes into court with a suppression motion saying that a company is acting as a government agent and needs a warrant simply to do what every responsible citizen ought to be doing, if that's the best they've got, bring it on.  </p><p>You know, I can tell you, criminal defendants make all kinds of motions. Some of them totally preposterous, and I would put this one at the preposterous end of that spectrum. And as you said, there's no--there's been no decision that anybody's a government agent simply because they report this kind of wrongdoing.  </p><p>Let me ask you, Mr. Shehan, if any organization on earth would want to avoid fourth amendment concerns that could hamstring--hamstring law enforcement, it's probably the one you represent. And I'd like to give you a chance to respond to this kind of argument because you are in this business of protecting children. </p><p>SHEHAN: We certainly are. And I appreciate you taking the time to ask that question because, as the representative who often testifies on behalf of NCMEC in the suppression hearings, I certainly am attuned to these types of discussions and potential arguments. And I can assure you that NCMEC spent a great deal of time exploring that particular topic as we were reviewing earn it. And if we had any innate inclinations or concerns that it could go down this path, we wouldn't have supported the bill. And--and certainly, if it helps the committee, we could have our office of legal counsel meet at another time to dive deeper into this, but we do not share those concerns. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I think that is an excellent answer and, Mr. Sine, you don't regard Match as a government agent when you use your best practices to report child predation or abuse, do you? </p><p>SINE: No, senator, we do not. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Let me ask you. Ms. Banker, because you know, I--I think we are at risk of unfairly impugning a whole industry here and as Mr. Sine's presence here and they're active engagement, match has been a very constructive partner here and so have other Internet companies that have come forward to--I think we're in danger of sort of impugning and--and painting with too broad a brush. The Internet Association holds itself out as representing the entirety of the Internet economy or at least large companies. </p><p>We've referred to big tech, but obviously, I can't help but notice that Mr. Sine representing one of those companies is here in effect opposing your position. So let me ask you, did all of the companies that you mentioned at the beginning of your testimony review your testimony here today? </p><p>BANKER: I think IA member companies have very shared and strong commitment to protecting children from these types of crimes and I think that there's probably more in common with what I am here to say today than there are differences with--with what Mr. Sine is saying. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: But you're guessing at that or have you taken a survey among your members? </p><p>BANKER: Before IA engages, we allow our members to know what we are doing and to play a role in shaping our messages. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, let me ask the question again. How many of those companies affirmatively approved your testimony today after reviewing it? </p><p>BANKER: I don't have that number with me at the top of my head. I'm sorry. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Did all of the companies you listed in your testimony affirmatively approve that testimony? </p><p>BANKER: I don't know that they affirmatively approved, but they were provided an opportunity to review and-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --Well, let me ask you another question. Obviously, Match is here today. They're a member of your association. Would you agree that there are probably other members of the Internet Association who disagree with your position? </p><p>BANKER: I would be disappointed to find that out because, obviously, we do try to represent the 40 plus companies that are part of our membership in a way that reflects the varied interests, varied business models, the varied sizes of all of those companies to the best of our ability. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I'm not going to take too much more time, but I--I do want to ask you this question. The Internet Association and its members have held themselves out as leaders. You've indicated today that you have no sympathy for this kind of child abuse and exploitation. Senators Hawley and I along with Senators Cornyn, Graham, Hirono wrote 236 companies. I think they're all members of your Association asking fundamental questions about this topic.  </p><p>From the responses to our letters, I agree. Some companies do take the problem seriously. Again, I don't want to paint with too broad a brush here. And I am appreciative of those efforts. Senator Graham initially at the outset talked about Facebook and the number of reports that they are responsible for giving. </p><p>But some of what those few companies do our, in effect, being used as cover, in my view, for some very disturbing failures. As I mentioned, Amazon made just eight reports. Eight reports last year of child sexual abuse material. None included images or video. In fact, during that same time, NCMEC sent 69 reports to Amazon that its services were suspected of posting that kind of child abuse too real. And NCMEC not responsible for patrolling Amazons services. Amazon is responsible.  </p><p>NCMEC is sending nearly 9 times as many reports to Amazon as Amazon is sending to NCMEC. Something is wrong with this picture in my view. And frankly, I regard Amazon's response as indefensible and insulting and downright dangerous. They provided terse, non-responses to important questions that their peers and much smaller companies, smaller companies startups, innovators were able to answer.  </p><p>Amazon claimed that because it is isn't Facebook, it doesn't have a child sexual abuse material problem. But it's tiny competitors, like Go Daddy and Digital Ocean provided NCMEC more reports than Amazon did. So my question to you is do you think that Amazon's reporting only eight such instances is appropriate? </p><p>BANKER: Thank you, senator. I cannot comment on any one specific company. I would--I would simply note that the reason we are here today is because, one, we're committed to protecting children, and two, we want to work with this committee to find the best solutions that we can today to this problem and I speak for the entire IA membership when I say that.  </p><p>With regard to any one company and how much they report, I don't have the information to know whether or not that reflects the whole of that activity on their service. But we are here today to work with you and we do see opportunities to create new and better detection mechanisms that can improve the ability of all IA member companies to report. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And I welcome your cooperation. Sincerely hope that you are Association and other companies, including Amazon will cooperate with us. We have no monopoly on wisdom. I hope we have a common goal. But your suggestion that we have more hearings is not the answer. Believe me, it is not the answer.  </p><p>We have hearings and hearings and hearings. And meanwhile, children are victims of the kind of viral, stomach turning criminality that Nicole told us about earlier and Nicole is not alone. She's had the courage to come forward and describe her experience.  </p><p>So I really don't want to be here. Fifteen months let alone 15 years from now again, and in the meantime have children go through this kind of experience. And Congress is notorious for hearings and to delay on this kind of issue, I think what you're seeing is a sense of urgency. And I want to thank my colleagues for joining me in that sense of urgency, and I hope it will be shared by the companies that you represent. And I want to thank all of our panel members for being here today. This--this hearing has been very valuable and I appreciate your service. Thank you. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you to all of the witnesses for being here. And with that, the hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YG9-2641-JDPT-T15G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

I think Senator Lee is going to introduce our nominee. </p><p>UNKNOWN: He's on his way. </p><p>GRAHAM: He's on his way. But in the meantime, why don't we just go elsewhere Miss Rao in. Please, stand. Please, rise. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give for this committee is the--the truth, the whole truth and nothing but truth, so help you God? Thank you. So chill out. Okay. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Introduce your family. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: You're going to make some remarks, aren't you? </p><p>GRAHAM: Lee's going to introduce her. </p><p>RAO: Thank you, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members this committee for your consideration and my nomination. I thank the President for nominating me to be a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. And I'm grateful to be here today.  </p><p>I just wanted to begin by introducing my family. With me here today is my husband, Alan Lefkowitz, and my two children. Isabella and Ezral My family is, quite simply, my greatest joy. I'm also fortunate to be joined here today by my father, Dr. Jahnung A. Rao (SP) and many members of my extended family. I'm grateful to so many friends who have come from foreign near to be here to support me today. </p><p>And at a moment such as this, I recall my mother, who passed away some 10 years ago, but I know that she is with us and in my heart, providing the good strength and counsel that she always did. </p><p>I was born in Detroit, Michigan, to parents who had immigrated from India, coming to America in the early 1970s with their medical degrees and little else. They started with almost nothing but through hard work built successful medical practices and small businesses. My parents faced their share of difficulties, but they always emphasize the amazing opportunities in this country and the good people they befriended along the way. </p><p>My parents raised me and my brother to be open-minded and we had friends from all different walks of life. Through their words and actions, my parents reinforce goodness, and kindness, the essential importance of family and friends, and the values of hard work, honesty, and integrity. I strive to live these values each day. </p><p>I also cannot help but take notice of another funny coincidence, which is that Aditya Bamzai is a nominee in the next panel. My grandfather and his grandfather were the best friends in India. And so today, Aditya and I, the two grandchildren of two old friends in India, are nominees at the same hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, only in America. </p><p>So I consider it a great privilege to be nominated to this position, and as Alexander Hamilton explained in Federal 78, \"Uniform adherence to the rights of the Constitution and of individuals is indispensable in the courts of justice.\" If confirmed, I would adhere to the law and in each case, strive for the good judgment required for the exercise of the judicial power. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Lee. </p><p>LEE: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. So sorry to Ms. Rao that I wasn't here to introduce her at the beginning. I had a conflicting committee assignment and rushed down here from that committee.  </p><p>I'm very pleased and--and honored to introduce our nominee for the DC circuit, Naomi Rao. Miss Rao is well known and as a distinguished scholar and prominent attorney across the country. Although she certainly has very big shoes to fill, having been nominated to fill Justice Kavanaugh's seat on the DC Circuit, I'm more than confident that she's up to the task. Ms. Rao is where was focused on administrative law for virtually her entire career, which happens to be excellent preparation for a nominee who is set to serve, if confirmed, on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, whose docket is complex, it's dense, and it's vitally important to the development of administrative law in our system.  </p><p>She's currently the Administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which serves a very important role in our government as the clearinghouse for all executive branch regulations. She's also a law professor at the Antonin Scalia School of Law, where her scholarly work focuses on administrative law.  </p><p>In 2015 she funded--she founded the Center for the Study of the Administrative State, which focuses on - you guessed it - administrative law. She also served on the Governing Council of the American Bar Association Section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice, as well as on the Federalist Society's Regulatory Transparency Project. </p><p>Before her life has a law professor, Ms. Rao served in the White House Counsel's Office and also serve on this committee, on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She was a law clerk to two very distinguished jurists, Justice Thomas on the Supreme Court, and Judge J. Harvey Wilkinson on the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. She's a graduate of the University of Chicago Law School, where she was on the Law Review and she did her undergraduate studies at Yale College.  She grew up in suburban Detroit, the daughter of two recent immigrants from India and lives in Washington with her husband and her two children.  </p><p>Ms. Rao, welcome to the committee. We look forward to hearing from you and to hearing your answers to our questions. Thanks so much for being here.  </p><p>RAO: Thank you, Senator Lee.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Thank you, Senator Lee. My congratulations to the nomination and to your family. Thank you very much for attending. I know this is a big day in your professional and personal life. And with that, I will turn it over to Senator Feinstein for any statements she'd like to make.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. As you have said this morning, we're going to consider three nominations, including the person before us, Naomi Rao, who is being considered for the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.  </p><p>I think most of us regard the DC Circuit as the most powerful appellate court in the country and we find it true, in part, because the DC Circuit here's challenges of actions taken by the federal government. For example, most federal regulations when challenged are heard in the DC Circuit. This is a particular note since the nominate before us has spent the past several years leading the office that decides which regulations to implement and which to rescind. Writings that have-- </p><p>Specifically, since July of 2017, Ms. Rao has been in charge of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. In this role, she has led the Trump Administration's regulatory agenda, where she worked on repealing the Clean Power Plan Regulation, repealing protections that address paid discrimination on the basis of race and gender, and weakening the CAFE standards bill that I authored with Senator Snow. As noted, the DC Circuit hears most challenges to federal regulations. Thus, if confirm Miss Rao could be in a position to decide cases about many of the very regulations that she has personally worked on.  </p><p>There's also been press coverage about a number of positions Ms. Rao has taken in her writings. While the writings have--that have received the most attention are from when she was in college, several are relevant to the work she has led at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and to cases, she could well hear if confirmed to the DC circuit. Miss Rao has also expressed views on the unitary executive and on President Trump's ability to oversee Special Counsel Mueller's investigation and fire the special counsel.  </p><p>All these topics are important for this committee to examine. I have a number of questions for the nominee on her writings and her regulatory work and I look forward to hearing from her and asking these questions. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you very much. </p><p>Your background, very impressive. You worked--you were a clerk for two judges, Justice Clarence Thomas, Supreme Court, and Justice Wilkinson on the 4th Court, who I know very well, 4th Circuit. You served as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, who did you work for?  </p><p>RAO: I worked for then-Chairman Hatch. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. And you served as Associate Counsel and Special Assistant to President George W. Bush, what did you do there?  </p><p>RAO: Well, in the--in the White House Counsel's Office I--I oversaw a number of important legal issues in different agencies. I worked on judicial nominations and--and a variety of other--other issues.  </p><p>GRAHAM: What did you learn from your time as being a staff member of the Judiciary Committee? </p><p>RAO: I learned a great deal. I'm very, very pleased that I had the opportunity to spend about a year in Congress with this committee. I learned much more about the legislative process, how things work. I learned about how Congress takes seriously its--its obligation to make sure that statutes are constitutional, that was part of--part of the--the role that I play there. And--and so I just learned about the whole legislative process and--and rule-making and lawmaking here in Congress.  </p><p>GRAHAM: So you went to college at Yale, is that correct? </p><p>RAO: That's correct.  </p><p>GRAHAM: So tell us about some of the writings that you engaged in while you were at Yale, I think you know what I'm talking about. So tell me what you were thinking then and what do you think now?  </p><p>RAO: Sure. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Graham.  </p><p>You know, when I was in college, it was a--it was a time of exploration. I spent a lot of my time at Yale studying political philosophy and reading social commentary. And perhaps, like many of my--my colleagues and classmates at Yale, I--I enjoyed commenting on some of the--the narrow events that were happening at Yale. We were very focused on--on campus events. To be honest, you know, looking back at some of those writings and rereading them I--I cringe at some of the language that I used. And you know, I was young, it's over two decades ago now, but you know, I think I was responding to things that were happening--happening on campus at that time and--and, you know, in that--you know, in the intervening two decades, I like to think that I have matured as a thinker and writer, and indeed, as a person.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, specifically, about the situation with the intoxication and sexual assault. Can you explain to us sort of what you were thinking then and where you're at now?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, Chairman Graham.  </p><p>So in some of my writings I talked about the issue of--of rape and sexual assault and I emphasized that--that rape and sexual assault are crimes for which men should be held accountable, and that no one should blame a victim of--of sexual assault or rape. I also attempted to make the--the common sense observation that there were some actions a woman could take to make it less likely to be a victim of those horrible crimes. And so that's--that's what I was expressing in some of those pieces.  </p><p>GRAHAM: In 2013 you wrote a--a piece titled The Trouble With Dignity and Rights of Recognition, about the--the DOMA Debate. Could you tell us what you're thinking was then? </p><p>RAO: Yes, that was about the Supreme Court's decision in Windsor. And--and one of the things I was writing about there was different conceptions of dignity. I've--I've done scholarship on competing conceptions of dignity and constitutional law, both within the U.S. Supreme Court and in constitutional courts from other countries and--and the Windsor case raised some particularly interesting questions about the use of the word dignity. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, you'll be going on--have you ever been a judge before?  </p><p>RAO: I have not.  </p><p>GRAHAM: So if approved by the Senate, you will be on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. What--what can you tell us about your ability to do that job, never having been a judge before? </p><p>RAO: Thank you, Chairman Graham.  </p><p>I think the--the experience that I've had over the past 20 or so years fits very well with a specialized docket of the DC circuit, which, as was mentioned, hears a disproportionate number of cases about administrative law and challenges to agency action. I've--I have extensive practical experience with those issues, currently, as the administrator of OIRA, where I oversee regulatory policy in the executive branch and </p><p>as counsel for this committee, working in the White House Counsel's Office. I also have a lot of scholarly experience with the types of issues that arise, as I've spent over a decade studying constitutional law, administrative law, separation of powers, and--and the like. So--so I believe my practical and scholarly experience fits well with the--with the responsibilities of-of that court.  </p><p>GRAHAM: And finally, you were chosen for your current position by President Trump to implement his agenda of trying to deregulate the country, is that correct? </p><p>RAO: Yes, I--I, you know, I was chosen to--to help implement the President's Regulatory Reform Agenda, which is a very ambitious one, and I have sought to do that in my current position responsibly, in a manner that's consistent with law, and in ways that are transparent and promote the norms of due process and fair notice.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you very much. Senator Feinstein.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Mr. Chairman, these are rounds of how long?  </p><p>GRAHAM: Five minutes. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Rao, let me get right to it. As Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, you, I think in your own words, and I quote, \"direct and oversee regulatory policy across the federal government.\" Given this role, if confirmed, will you commit to recusing yourself from all cases involving the Trump Administration's regulatory actions? Yes or no would be fine.  </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, recusal is a--is a very serious issue and it's very important to maintain the impartiality and independence of the judiciary. And if I were to be confirmed, I would look carefully at the statutory standards for recusal under 28 USC 455, I would consult with my colleagues and--and follow the precedents and practices on the DC Circuit.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Okay. In 2007, Senator Snow and--and I authored the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act. That's a--a national program, it sets fuel economy. These standards have already saved $65 billion in fuel costs for American families and 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Despite its success, the Administration has proposed canceling the planned improvements in fuel economy and vehicle emissions for model years, 2021 to 2026. You have highlighted this change as a focus of the Administration. What benefit does eliminating the program provide to the American public? </p><p>RAO: Thank you Ranking Member Feinstein.  </p><p>So it--it might be helpful just to-to explain my role at OIRA, which is that we coordinate regulatory policy. Of course, the primary policies are set by the relevant agencies. They're given the authority from Congress to implement regulatory policy and that's what's been done with the proposed CAFE standards by EPA and the Department of Transportation. So--so those are rules that we have under review. And I think those agencies are seeking to--to implement the Administration's agenda with respect to--to improving--improving environmental outcomes and safety for--for the American people.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, is it true that your intent would have been to have canceled that policy from 2021 to 2026 when the real benefits come into play?  </p><p>RAO: Well--well, Senator, it's, you know, respectfully, it's not my intention and currently the rule is in its proposed stage. We have not yet received the final rule from those agencies so--so those agencies are taking into account all the comments that have been received in the process. We believe that's a very important part of the regulatory process, to--to hear from the public about the consequences of different regulations and--and those will be--will be taken account of in any final rule.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, just so you know, this--is--was a very important bill and worked a long time to get a bill that dealt with CAFE standards which had not been touched in decades. And the first 10 years have gone by and it has worked. And after the first 10 years, in the bill language, the Administration must take the most cost effective technical improvements and make them into their policies for the future. If followed, this would continue to increase fuel efficiency, and it would continue to save people money.  </p><p>Yeah, I gather that in a speech before the American Bar Association, on October 19, in 2017, you intimated that you might be opposed to this and take some action. I'm curious, are you opposed to this law? </p><p>RAO: Senator, you know, as a--as a judicial nominee or even as administrators arm I'm not opposed to or in favor of any law. It's part of our responsibility to make sure the agencies are following the laws as enacted by Congress. And--and there are, of course, a number of laws that are relevant with respect to CAFE standards, and we are working closely with the agencies to make sure that they are--are following the law and regulating in a manner consistent with the statutes.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thank you. </p><p>One last question. Well, I think I'll let it go for now. </p><p>GRAHAM: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FEINSTEIN: In September 2017, you withdrew a form developed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that's CEEOC, that sought to identify wage discrimination on the basis of race or gender, by collecting wage data from some private employers. You have written that you withdraw the form, you withdrew the form, because it was \"an extremely burdensome and not justified collection of information on wages.\" The question is what evidence did you have to conclude that the form was too burdensome for companies to comply? </p><p>RAO: May I respond?  </p><p>So you know, thank you for the opportunity to clarify that. First, that decision is currently in pending litigation so I'm limited as to what I can say about it. But I did issue a stay of an expansion of the EEO 1 form, in part based on the standards under the Paperwork Reduction Act, about information collections and the importance that they be minimally burdensome and have practical utility.  </p><p>Now, again, just so that--so but--but just to be clear, that's an interim decision. We stayed the form and now it's up to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to decide whether to proceed with that form. And in the--in the meantime, the existing wage and--wage, and gender, and race collections are still in place so we're continuing to use the form that's been in place for a number of years. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: And what would change that? </p><p>RAO: So--so at this stage, there's a decision that needs to be made by the EEOC about whether they wish to change the existing form and expand it in some way. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Cornyn.  </p><p>CORNYN: Miss Rao, what is OIRA? I think it's the most powerful government agency nobody's heard of, and few people understand. Would you take a--a few--few seconds here to explain what OIRA's role is?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, thank you, Senator Cornyn.  </p><p>So OIRA is--is an office within OMB and we are charged with reviewing regulatory policy around the executive branch. It's--it's an office that's been in place since President Reagan, who issued an executive order creating the office. And we currently operate under an executive order put in place by President Clinton in the early--early 1990s. So the process at OIRA really is a is--a bipartisan one, that's now been around for a number of decades.  </p><p>CORNYN: Would it be fair to characterize it as a clearinghouse?  </p><p>RAO: It is a kind of clearing house, you know, agencies set the regulatory policy and they send it to us-- </p><p>CORNYN: --Well, to that--to that point, does OIRA make policy or judgments? </p><p>RAO: We do-we do not. We do not. Congress gives that authority to the agencies.  </p><p>CORNYN: So when it comes to sort of legislation that Senator Feinstein was alluding to, would you be authorized to substitute your policy judgment for that of the agency guided by congressional statute?  </p><p>RAO: I would not. </p><p>CORNYN: Miss Rao, I've been reading in some of the Hill rags about your college writings and I want to give you a chance to explain. You know, it's since Judge Kavanaugh's hearing, when we were taking a magnifying glass to his high school yearbook, that seems to be sort of the way things go around here now, that people go back 25, 30 years and look at things like that, and try to criticize people for maybe some of their youthful indiscretions or opinions they expressed back then that are not particularly politically correct. today. </p><p>I know you've written about multiculturalism as an undergraduate student at Yale, and you expressed the hope that racial and gender differences would be appreciated and discussed, but you also wrote about your concerns that they be used to push for divisiveness and not togetherness. When I saw that I was reminded of Arthur Schlesinger, his great book The Disuniting of America and he wrote \"that it's important to learn that much from other races, other cultures, and other continents, that focusing--but that focusing too much on cultural differences can undermine the very idea of unifying American identity.\" Do agree with him? </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, I--I certainly have had similar experiences myself. I--I grew up in a very, you know, diverse environment. I have friends from all different racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. And--and it's been my experience, it's often hard to--to put a label or to categorize someone. And--and one of the things I was responding to at Yale was--was a push towards less tolerance and understanding. And I think perhaps, I was idealistic and hoped that, you know, especially in a small environment at Yale we could have both the celebration of people's racial and ethnic differences, but also more unifying and more unified, you know, more unifying and more unification and understanding.  </p><p>CORNYN: Well, I hope this committee and this Congress isn't in the business of crushing youthful idealism or punishing people who exhibit that. </p><p>So when Judge Kavanaugh, Justice Kavanaugh was going through his confirmation hearing and when Justice Gorsuch was going through his for the Supreme Court there was a lot of discussion about the Chevron Doctrine. And as I understand it, it's a doctrine which where the--where the Supreme Court has said that they will defer to an agency's interpretation of their own authority to act in an area where Congress has been ambiguous, is that correct, roughly? Please, well, let me put it this way, please correct me.  </p><p>RAO: Well, so I think that that's partly the Chevron Doctrine and also the view of the court in the city of Arlington case about agencies ability to--to interpret its own jurisdiction and--and those are precedents of the Supreme Court, which if I were confirmed, I would--I would faithfully follow.  </p><p>CORNYN: Well, you anticipated my--my next question. So is it the role of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to overrule the United States Supreme Court?  </p><p>RAO: It is not.  </p><p>CORNYN: And it is the obligation of every judge on the DC circuit to follow the precedent established by the Supreme Court of the United States, correct?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, Senator, and--and I would do so.  </p><p>CORNYN: Thank you very much. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Leahy.  </p><p>LEAHY: Thank you Chairman.  </p><p>I--I read that you, Miss Rao, that you've never tried a single case to judgment or final decision, is that correct? </p><p>RAO: That is correct. My experience is primarily focused on government service and academia.  </p><p>LEAHY: I understand that. I--I--I wonder, I'm a and some of us are members of the DC Bar (INAUDIBLE) various courts with appeals. Every time I've argued the case before a court of appeals I've looked at judges who have tried cases, who have been involved in litigation because oftentimes, the whole case revolves around what might have happened in the trial before. But zero percent of your practices been a lawyer in federal courts, correct? </p><p>RAO: You know, Senator-- </p><p>LEAHY: --Yes or no, I mean, that's an easy-- </p><p>RAO: Well--well, I have worked in--in--with federal courts in my various government positions and my private practice was in international arbitration.  </p><p>LEAHY: So you tried cases in federal court? </p><p>RAO: I have not tried a case but I have worked on briefs and preparing others.--  </p><p>LEAHY: --Have you tried--have you tried cases in state courts? </p><p>RAO: I have not because my--my primary experience has been as a scholar and--and working for this committee and for the executive branch.  </p><p>LEAHY: Well, the executive branch, have you had any of your practice been before administrative agencies? </p><p>RAO: Not directly before administrative agencies but as the administrator of OIRA I--I oversee administrative policy on a wide swath of issues from all the executive branch agencies.  </p><p>LEAHY: Do you think does it--well, do you understand why some may be concerned about somebody sitting on a federal court hearing appeals from cases that have been tried in federal courts and that person has never tried a case in a federal court or a state court or a court of appeals? Can you understand why some can--can be concerned about that?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, Senator, I certainly understand that concern. You know, there are--there are a number of judges, you know, on the court of appeals who have had a similar background to mine that has combined academia and government service, especially for the Court of Appeals where--where there are more purely legal issues that arise in those cases. And--and, you know, the experience I've had is--is, I think, very germane to--to the specialized docket of the DC Circuit.  </p><p>LEAHY: The cases that I argue before the courts of appeals, they may be legal issues but resulted of my trial. </p><p>RAO: Yes, of course. </p><p>LEAHY: Those came up and you assume that the judges, no matter who appointed them, certainly those of us who are arguing the cases before it assumed that they had some idea of what the courtroom was like.  </p><p>Now, you've made it your mission to deregulate government. I see it is making it harder for government agencies to use their authority to protect our health, our center environment. If we had an administration that sometimes actually cared to address climate change, based on your past record, it's hard to see how you could give them a fair shot in court. For example, you wrote in the 1990s, that \"climate change is nothing more than a major environmental Boogeyman.\" And that \"the Greenhouse effort is a controversial theory pushed by environmental groups.\" Do you still stand by those assertions? </p><p>RAO: You know, Senator--Senator Leahy those are statements from--from college, as you said, a few decades old, when I think some of these issues were--were more--more hotly debated. And--and no. I mean, I think the science has--has become much more conclusive over time.  </p><p>LEAHY: Conclusion in what way?  </p><p>RAO: Well, I think there, you know, my understanding is that there's an overwhelming scientific consensus that there's climate change. </p><p>LEAHY: And do you agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists that say that climate change is not only a reputable reality but has been created by human activity? </p><p>RAO: Well, I believe there--there's also a lot of scientific evidence, my understanding is that human activity does contribute to climate change, yes. </p><p>LEAHY: Contributes?  </p><p>RAO: Well, I'm not a scientist, Senator Leahy.  </p><p>LEAHY: Now, in your college op-ed about date rape you wrote \"If for a woman drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice. Implying that a drunk woman has no control of our actions but a drunk man does strips women of all moral responsibility.\" I prosecuted a lot of rape cases. I would hate to think that was the view of the courts and the jury's. I do know this, that if that view is pushed it results in victims too ashamed to come forward and it can also result in juries excusing culpable defendants. Do you currently believe that if a woman consumed alcohol to the point where she could no longer consent she's in part to blame if somebody rapes her? </p><p>RAO: Senator Leahy, I--I appreciate the opportunity to clarify that. In that column, I make it very clear that rape is a--is a terrible crime for which men should be held responsible and no one should blame a victim of rape or sexual assault. I was trying to make and perhaps, not in the most elegant way, the sort of common sense observation that--that excessive drinking can lead to risky and dangerous behavior for both men and women. It's the advice my mother gave me. It's the advice that--that I give my children and I certainly regret any implication of blaming the victim. </p><p>LEAHY: You can understand that--why that is there, I mean, why the implication of people are concerned that's what you are saying?  </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator Leahy, you know, the context of a column was--was a particular event on campus and I also make a number of statements very clearly about the responsibility of a man for those crimes. </p><p>LEAHY: Okay. Well, I look at it from the eyes of a--as a former prosecutor and it bothered me greatly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>KENNEDY: Professor, good morning.  </p><p>RAO: Good morning.  </p><p>KENNEDY: You know what a motion in limine is, don't you?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, I do. </p><p>KENNEDY: What is it? </p><p>RAO: It's a--it's pretrial motion to exclude evidence.  </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. Do you know what the Daubert, some say Daubert, Doctrine is?  </p><p>RAO: Yes. It's also a demotion regarding the--the inclusion of certain forms of expert testimony.  </p><p>KENNEDY: Good. </p><p>Does a federal judge ever make a law? </p><p>RAO: No, that's not the role of a federal judge. The--the role of the federal judge is to apply the law as it exists and is found in the--in the statutes and the precedents of the Constitution.  </p><p>KENNEDY: How about--you're familiar with the Fourth Amendment? Is there a statute that says what reasonably is under the Fourth Amendment? Don't judges all the time have to determine what reasonable means? Isn't that making law? </p><p>RAO: Well, that is--that is a determination that's made under law in--in applying the facts of a specific case, yes. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah, but don't judges make law when they decide what reasonable is under the Fourth Amendment? </p><p>RAO: Well, they do--they do in some sense make law, that's--that's true. Justice Scalia once said, \"You know I'm not so naive to think judges don't make law but they make law as though they are finding it.' So-- </p><p>KENNEDY: So they do make law. </p><p>RAO: Well, in--in a sense, you know, I mean, they--they decide cases and that--those become precedents.  </p><p>KENNEDY: All right. How about--how about defining a--a restraint of trade? </p><p>RAO: Well-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --I mean, is there a statute to tells us in every circumstance what restraint of trade is? </p><p>RAO: Well, the--the Sherman Antitrust Act is, you know, one of the statutes that's referred to as a kind of common law statute, where--where Congress has put forth a very general standard and that's implemented by the courts -- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Yeah, but don't--don't federal judges all the time have to tell us what--what restraint of trade means? I mean, every case is not identical.  </p><p>RAO: Yes. Well, they have to-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Okay.-- </p><p>RAO: --they have to make that determination.-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --So judges make law there too, don't they?  </p><p>RAO: Well, in a sense, yes.  </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. When--when you're--if you've got an ambiguous statute do--do you--do you think the president's opinion about the meaning of that statute is part of the legislative history? </p><p>RAO: That the president who signed that statute or the president--? </p><p>KENNEDY: --Right, he can sign it or veto it. </p><p>RAO: Uh-huh. Well, I do think that it is--it is, in a sense, part of the legislative history, but I think in general, when interpreting a statute it's best to focus on the text.  </p><p>KENNEDY: But do you think you should ignore what the president thought about it? </p><p>RAO: Well, I think, you know, a court needs to consider the evidence that the parties put forward, and sometimes that includes legislative history or the--the, you know, the opinion of a president --. </p><p>KENNEDY: --Yeah, sorry to cut you off. I just don't have much time. Do you think that what the president thinks about a statute, the meaning of it, is part of the legislative history?  </p><p>RAO: Yes.  </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay.  </p><p>RAO: Yes. </p><p>KENNEDY: Let's suppose Congress passes a statute, it says--I'm going to read it slowly, I just made this up. Okay. No person convicted of rape in any court can work in a battered women's shelter. No person convicted of rape in any court can work in a battered women's shelter. Now, the legislative history makes it very clear that in any court means a United States court and someone is convicted of rape in a court in let's say, Turkmenistan. What controls, the legislative history or the plain meaning of the statute? </p><p>RAO: Well, I--you know, I think that the Supreme Court has made clear that where the statute is clear, you know, that's the end of the inquiry. And in your example, the--the statute says any court. I think-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --So you would rule in any court.  </p><p>RAO: Well, I think that part of the question would be also to look at the structure of the statute and the surrounding text to see whether any also included, for instance, foreign jurisdictions.  </p><p>KENNEDY: But under the plain meaning doctrine, and if you're on originalist you don't look beyond the statute, it says in any court.  </p><p>RAO: But there is sometimes a question of whether that has extra territorial application for (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --No, it says \"In any court.\" That means any court. </p><p>RAO: Well, any usually is--is-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Even though Congress intended it just to mean--I mean, is that a case where you would ignore the legislative history and just go with the plain meaning of a statute, even though Congress obviously, intended otherwise?  </p><p>RAO: Well, I think if looking in the four corners of the statute, and--and considering its structure and the other related provisions, and looking at that, if it seemed clear then there would be no need to have recourse to the legislative history-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Okay.-- </p><p>RAO: --because this text is what Congress enacted after all.  </p><p>KENNEDY: --All right. Okay. What is your--this is my last question, Mr. Chairman, what is your personal definition of life? When does life begin, in your personal opinion? </p><p>RAO: Senator, you know, that is a--it's a difficult question and it's one that's the subject of ongoing political disputes and-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --No, I'm not asking legally, I'm just asking you, personally. </p><p>RAO: I guess I'm--I'm not exactly sure how to answer that question as a judicial nominee. I'm--you know, I hesitate to comment on that issue.-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Why don't you just answer for me honestly? Have you thought about it? </p><p>RAO: I mean, I--I have thought about it, yes, but--but it's the type of issue that is related to cases that could be pending before the court if I'm confirmed, and--and under the code of conduct it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on that.  </p><p>KENNEDY: Well, let me--let me--let me--let me suggest an answer to you, it doesn't matter. As a judge, you're supposed to follow the law.  </p><p>RAO: Well, of--of course, Senator, you know, my personal views, to the extent I have any, are put to one side. </p><p>KENNEDY: And--and--and that's the point. I'm trying to rush through this but others went over. We have nominees come before us all the time and they're beat up for their past written opinions and their past law review articles and the past things they've said. I don't want a nominee that's never thought about the world. I'd prefer to have a nominee that has an intellect above a single cell organism, that doesn't come in here as a blank slate. The issue is not have you thought about the world, the issue is are you willing to put aside your personal beliefs and follow the law? So are you willing to put aside your personal beliefs and follow the law-- </p><p>RAO: --Absolutely.-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --even if you disagree with the law? </p><p>RAO: Absolutely. That's--that's the job of a judge.  </p><p>KENNEDY: Are you willing to rule in an abortion case in a way as dictated by the law even if it--it--it contradicts your personal opinions about when life begins?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, of course.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Mr. Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome to our committee and thank you for your service. This hearing is the first this session on judicial nominations and it may be one of the most important that we do in this entire session. The court that you have to nominated to serve is certainly one of the most important. Those of us who live in the jurisdiction of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals might differ that it is the most important court but there's no question that you will be making law and you will be a decisive and dispositive vote on this court. </p><p>I'm not going to ask you about statements of 20 or 30 years ago that may make you cringe now, I'm going to ask you about more recent statements that make me cringe. And one of them is from November 18, 2014, at a discussion co-hosted by the Federalist Society, where you lamented that the Rehnquist court did not go far enough in reversing the Commerce Clause jurisprudence that had been in place since the court upheld New Deal policies in the 1940s. And you said, \"They're--they're able to invalidate things like the Gun-Free School Zones Act or parts of the Violence Against Women Act, which are really kind of grandstanding statues.\" Do you believe the Gun-Free Zones--the Gun-Free School Zones Act is a grandstanding statute? </p><p>RAO: Senator Blumenthal, no that--that event was--was a-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --Well, why did you say it if you don't believe it?  </p><p>RAO: Well I was--I was responding to the person I was interviewing who had written a book about--about having more robust judicial enforcement of the Constitution and--and that was in the context of asking him questions about things that he had written in his book.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: This statement was made about two years after the massacre at the Sandy Hook School. I don't know whether you've ever talked to a parent who's lost a child in a school shooting but I think if you had you would never have referred to that statute as a grandstanding statute if you were aware of the very effective record of this law. In fact, the CDC found that in the years after the law was passed school associated student homicide rates to increase by more than half. that's just one piece of evidence. I hope that maybe you'll rethink that view.  </p><p>Did you believe then and do believe now that the Violence Against Women Act is a grandstanding statute? </p><p>RAO: You know, Senator, no, that's--it's--an important--violence against women is a--is a very important issue and of course, it is a statute of his body and if I were confirmed I would have no problem following it. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, do you believe those two statutes, you said at the time that they are grandstanding statutes. </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, I believe the context of those comments were--were responding to--to the author who had written about some of those issues.-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --You responded to the author and you said something that you don't believe? </p><p>RAO: Well, I--I don't recall the exact-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --What kind of a judge will you be if you say things that you don't believe. </p><p>CORNYN: Mr. Chairman, would the--would it be too much to ask for the senators to let the witness answer the questions because they're talking over each other and I can't--I can't understand. </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, I was in that context, interviewing someone who had written a book, really I was just the interviewee and--and I was responding to things that he had written and said about the role of the Supreme Court. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Let me ask you about another article that you wrote--wrote in 2009, called the President's Fear of Action, stating your belief in a \"strong unitary executive\". You said that \"the President may also decide not to follow Supreme Court precedent and in the rare instance may decide against enforcement of a particular judgment.\" Do you believe that the President of the United States has the power to defy a United States Supreme Court precedent or judgment? </p><p>RAO: You know, Senator, that that article was it--was in general about the president's authorities in a--in a range of different areas and--and some people have--some other commentators have made that argument that in the very rare instance that that is permissible, some presidents have made that argument.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Do you think you just answered my question? </p><p>RAO: Well, I'm answering your question as to what--what I was writing about in that article.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: No, do you believe it?  </p><p>RAO: Do I believe that? I believe that there are presidents in our history who have declined to enforce judgments of--of the (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --Do you think that is constitutionally permissible?  </p><p>RAO: I think it's a very difficult area. You know, the--the Office of Legal Counsel has opined that a president can, in certain circumstances, decline to enforce an unconstitutional statute, and I think it's related to that concept.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: My time is expired, Mr. Chairman, I'm hoping that we'll have another round. Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Are--are--are you familiar with presidential signing statements?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, I am.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Are you familiar that every president virtually on anything controversial or about executive power issues assigning statement giving their view of Congress's limited ability visa vi the executive?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, that is a common provision in executive signing statements.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Hawley. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and thank you for being here.  </p><p>Let me just ask about, since we're talking about the Violence Against Women Act and the Gun-Free Schools Act, the United States Supreme Court invalidated portions of the Violence Against Women Act, is that correct? Is that your understanding? </p><p>RAO: Yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: And the United States Supreme Court invalidated portions of the gun free Schools Act, is that correct?  </p><p>RAO: That's correct.  </p><p>HAWLEY: That would be the United States versus Morrison case and the Lopez cases, respectively. Is that correct?  </p><p>RAO: Yes.  </p><p>HAWLEY: So you are not arguing for invalidating portions of these acts. You were commenting on, I assume, actions that the United States Supreme Court had already taken, is that correct?  </p><p>RAO: Yes.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Will you faithfully follow precedent of the United States Supreme Court as an inferior court judge? </p><p>RAO: Yes, Senator. </p><p>HAWLEY: Will you do it regardless of your beliefs in whether it's about Violence Against Women Act or the Gun-Free Schools Act or any other act that the United States Supreme Court has a binding precedent regarding? </p><p>RAO: Yes, Senator, I would put any personal views I had to one side.  </p><p>HAWLEY: That would be a refreshing change from many judges on the--our inferior courts, I have to say.  </p><p>Let me ask you about interpreting statutes, picking up what Senator Kennedy was talking about it. He asked you about some particular tools. can you just walk me through how you approach a statute? And when you think about the different tools that judges use to interpret a statue, text, structure, history, legislative history, dictionaries, philosophy, sometimes foreign law, can you give us a sense of what you would prioritize, a precedent of course, what would you prioritize in terms of those tools and how would you go about the business of interpreting an ambiguous statute, which course you'll see every day?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, thank you, Senator.  </p><p>So, of course, as a--as an inferior court judge, I will look to the precedent of the Supreme Court to see how they've interpreted particular statute. But you know, really, the first--the beginning of the inquiry is the text of the statute and that's where the Supreme Court said we should start. And--and, you know, in trying to understand the text of the statute would look at the specific words of the statute, you know, other related provisions within that statute, the structure of the statute and how the provisions fit together. And oftentimes, you know, that will--that will be sufficient to--to yield an answer as to the meaning of the statute. But of course, as a judge, you know, I would consider other arguments raised by the parties before me, and that may include other tools such as legislative history or--or other--other materials.  </p><p>HAWLEY: How--how--tell me about legislative history. I mean, how does that fit into your--your understanding? I mean, you start with text, structure, history, how do you--how do you think about legislative history? And I ask because this is a live debate at the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court's guidance on this issue is somewhat conflicted. And you have judges justices who say that they'll never consult legislative history, of course, the court has made it a practice to consultant legislative history but in different ways. So there's quite a bit of ambiguity there. How do you think about this important issue?  </p><p>RAO: Sure. Well, I think that there's--there's become somewhat more unanimity on this issue. I mean, Justice Kagan said recently, right, \"We're all textualists us now.\" And I think that's in part because they're sort of--of there are constitutional reasons for that,. You know, the text of the statute is what went through the House and the Senate and was signed by the president and so that is the law under the Constitution. The legislative history is, you know, of course, you know, the understanding of some members of Congress and--and, you know, there have been many reasons given by--by the Supreme Court for why--why it's--you should be limited.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Let me ask you about your area of--of expertise, your particular area of expertise, administrative law, which of course, is an area that you'll see quite a lot on--a lot of on the circuit to should you be concerned. This is an area of law that also isn't a state of--of change, and the United States Supreme Court has recently indicated or been sending signals that it may be willing to revisit some of the foundation precedents.  </p><p>I think Senator Cornyn may have asked you about the C4hevron case. Thinking just for a second about the King versus Burwell case, a controversial case for a lot of reasons. But that was a case where one would have thought the court might have applied deference or invoked deference. It did not. And instead, the court majority said that it is courts, not agencies who have the primary role in interpreting statutes. The court expanded what appeared to be the significant questions exception to the Chevron Doctrine.  </p><p>My question is, how do you think about, given the case law, the state of the case law, how do you think about Chevron deference? What is your sense of where we are when it comes to a deference to administrative agencies?  </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, you know, Chevron has not been overruled by the Supreme Court. As you said, there is a--is a debate amongst some justices and including in Congress about the appropriate scope of Chevron, but it hasn't been overruled. So if I were to be confirmed, I would--I would continue to follow that precedent.  </p><p>HAWLEY: What are you--what are your thoughts about political accountability of agencies and what role that courts should--should give to that value when reviewing agency adjudication? </p><p>RAO: Senator, I think political accountability is very important in an agency's decision-making. It's part of the legitimacy of what happens with regulatory policy, which is that regulatory policy is set under statutes enacted by Congress but implemented consistently with a democratically elected president's priorities.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>Thank you very much, Miss Rao, for being here.  </p><p>DURBIN: One cannot escape the national debate over the last four or five days involving the Governor of Virginia and actions, conduct, or statements that he made many years ago and whether he should be held accountable today for those statements or that action and whether that affects his ability to serve in public life. Are you familiar with that debate? </p><p>RAO: Senator, I've seen some of the articles. </p><p>DURBIN: It is interesting is we consider nominees, yourself included, that we look into their backgrounds as to what they've said and done in the past as some indication of their values and their judgment. And you have described your early, and I might add controversial writings, as cringe worthy, inelegant, and at one point, idealistic, which was kind of hard to reconcile in my mind. What do you think should be the level of accountability of a person seeking a position such as you are for things that they have said and done even 20 years ago? </p><p>RAO: Senator Durbin, respectfully, that's a--that's an important question for this committee. But--but as a nominee sitting before you, I think it would be presumptuous to--to comment on--on how this--this committee does its advice and consent function.  </p><p>DURBIN: I'm asking you the human side of this, as Senator Kennedy did, I'm asking you what you think in terms of-- Well, let's go back. I mean, there were times at Yale when you were just downright controversial. Your statements on date rape have been quoted and re-quoted over and over again. You've said in response to the Chairman here, that you were just trying to warn women to use common sense to avoid sexual exploitation. Do you consider that idealism when your part are cringe worthy? </p><p>RAO: You know, Senator, some of those--those comments or the way I express myself, I certainly regret, but I was also very clear about the responsibility that--that men have when they commit those horrible crimes.  </p><p>DURBIN: I could quote from the article. I won't. But there are things that you said which contradict the statement you just made.  </p><p>I want to talk about myths for a moment. You also said at Yale, that a group called the Bisexual Gay and Lesbian Co-Op was \"spreading myths about AIDS\". What were you referring to in that statement?  </p><p>RAO: You know, Senator, I--I--my attention was drawn to that, I honestly do not recall.  </p><p>DURBIN: Well, then let me ask you about another myth statement. In November of 1993 in the Yale Free Press, you wrote an article entitled Submission, Silence, Mediocrity, \"Myths of sexual and racial oppression propagate themselves, create hysteria and finally lead to the formation of some whining new group. One can only hope to scream, 'Perspective, just a little perspective, darling.'\" What are the myths of sexual and racial oppression that you were referring to in that article?  </p><p>RAO: You know, Senator, I don't--I don't recall precisely, but it's, you know--look--I've, you know, I've always been someone who has taken problems of sexism and racism very seriously. And, you know, partly what I'm responding to there is a very narrow set of issues on the Yale campus and a specific type of activism and multiculturalism that existed at Yale at that time. And, you know, I--I guess I you know, I always thought it would be best to have more tolerance and understanding rather than dividing people up into--into groups.  </p><p>DURBIN: Tolerance of sexual and racial oppression. Is that what you're asking for?  </p><p>RAO: No, tolerance of--of--of racial differences, understanding between different racial and ethnic groups. </p><p>DURBIN: I don't think that's consistent with labeling sexual and racial oppression as a myth. Do you have any doubt in your mind that there has been throughout history and even in our country, oppression of people because of their gender and race?  </p><p>RAO: No, I do not. </p><p>DURBIN: Well, your early writings raise questions about your values, and how many of those you bring to the table today and want to take into the future into a courtroom. And I think those are legitimate inquiries on our part and I--I just cannot reconcile something which is cringe worthy and idealistic How do you reconcile those things? </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, I think I had a had a kind of idealism about--about racial relations. I went to a school that was very diverse. I had friends from all different backgrounds. And--and as a, you know, growing up as a--as an ethnic minority, I guess, as it were, I, you know, I was inspired by Martin Luther King's vision, right, that we should be judged by the content of our character and not the color of our skin. And--and maybe that does seem idealistic and naive today, but--but that was inspirational to me when I was--when I was starting college.  </p><p>DURBIN: Miss Rao, I would really struggle to reconcile what you said about racial oppression is a myth with the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King. I can't understand that brand of idealism. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. Senator Lee. </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>I want to start by asking a few questions about a topic that I know is everyone's favorite, which is the intersection of administrative law and constitutional law.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>In my small town of Alpine, Utah we speak a little else.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You know, there are some people would think of this is some sort of distant esoteric topic, but it's not. You want to both know that it's this is part of the functioning of our Republic. In Federalists Number 47, James Madison wrote that \"The accumulation of all powers,\" meaning legislative, executive, and judicial, \"is itself something that doesn't just lead to tyranny. It is the very definition of tyranny itself.\" And--and Tocqueville predicted that if tyranny ever came to the United States it would take the form of an immense and tutelary power, one that would regulate every minute detail of people's lives. And so these topics are not merely esoteric, they're not merely something that could be described as philosophical, they have a real impact on the rights of individuals, on the freedom of people within a free society and they're essential toward safeguarding our own liberties.  </p><p>Because, you know, anyone, any country in its constitutional system of government, if it has a constitution, can claim to have a Bill of Rights. But whether or not that Bill of Rights means anything depends for its security, for its enforce-ability on the protection of the people, by means of prohibiting anything that would lead to the excessive accumulation of power in the hands of the few. </p><p>One of the--and this gets us to--to what you have focused on throughout your academic and professional career in administrative law, as you know there's been a lot of debate in recent years about whether Chevron and our deference are lawful, unless or until the Supreme Court changes the law courts are required to defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes and regulations. But one problem with these rules is that ambiguity may mean different things to different people.  </p><p>So I guess my--my first question for you is, do you think you're more or less likely than others to see a particular provision in a statute or regulation is ambiguous? </p><p>RAO: Thank you, Senator Lee. You know, it's hard to say in--in comparison with others since I've-- But I do think it's important when looking at one of these cases to--to consider the statue for all that it's worth, right. And sometimes a provision that may seem ambiguous at first blush is--is not ambiguous when you really take into account the--the statute as a whole, its structure how and the provisions relate to one another and I think there's usually a lot of meaning that can be found from the text to the statute. </p><p>LEE: What happens when Congress excessively delegates power, is that a problem? </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, the--the Supreme Court has recognized in all of its cases relating to the non-delegation principle that--that non-delegation is a cornerstone of separation of powers. The Constitution does give the legislative power to--to Congress, in part because they are democratically accountable to the people. So--so that has always been recognized as an essential principle in our--in our system. </p><p>LEE: Do you--a lot of commentators defend the--the present doctrine on the grounds that it's impossible to formulate a judicially manageable principle by which to apply the non-delegation doctrine. On the other hand, some would argue that it's a problem anytime a non-delegable duty is delegated. What's the best way to resolve that dispute?  </p><p>RAO: Well, it's a--it's a difficult question. I mean, the Supreme Court has, on the one hand, recognized the importance of non-delegation but used a standard, the Intelligible Principle Standard, to judge whether Congress has, in fact, delegated its authorities, and of course, I would be bound to follow that precedent if I were to be confirmed. And you know, it's--it's--it's--it's--it's something though that--that some justices have raised questions about and as you know, it's something I've written about in my scholarly writings.  </p><p>LEE: Fine. When we speak of the judicial manageability of a standard, what--what are we--what are we referring to when we've got a standard that's--whether or not it's usually manageable? Tell us what that means.  </p><p>RAO: I think that that standard means, you know, is there a--is there some legal standard that the court can apply in that particular case? Is there some provision of a constitution that the court can--can apply?  </p><p>LEE: Okay. I don't have anything to add on the substance of your--on your college writings. You've done a good job of explaining the content and the context and what you were trying to--to accomplish, but I do want to take a step back for a minute. There's a new reality that's set in, which we've--we've had more than a few nominees who have been criticized for their college writings. We've even scrutinized at least one nominee's, high school writings. There are some things you can write in college that could--could disqualify a person from later service, subsequent service in political life, either in the judiciary or otherwise.  </p><p>For judges, I think the standard should involve whether the writing in question shows that the person cannot be impartial and that is quite obviously not what we're dealing with here. Not anything close to that. For the most part, I think someone should be allowed to say, \"Look, when I was young and I saw things differently through the eyes of a young person I--I said X.\" I'm sure you've reread those articles and winced at parts, as you've indicated. There are some passages and I'm sure some articles that you wish you hadn't written or if you were to write today, you would write differently.  </p><p>But I think the same could be said, for everyone in this room. The same could be said, for everyone I know who went to college, and has later gone on to do something else, people grow, they learn, and we should allow that--those changes to--to be taken into account. There's--there's certainly nothing disqualifying here. And I'm certain that there aren't many people in America who want to be judged by what they said in college.  </p><p>And here's the deeper issue-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Let's wrap up.-- </p><p>LEE: --judicial nominations, if I can give it one more sentence, judicial nominations have become a blood sport, and we've convinced ourselves that because judges are important it's all fair game. That's not right and it shouldn't be the case here. Thank you.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Klobuchar.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>Administrator Rao, I wanted to clarify one thing. I believe you said to Senator Feinstein, that \"You will not commit to recuse yourself from cases involving regulations you worked on in the administration.\" Is that right?  </p><p>RAO: No, that--that's incorrect.-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Okay.-- </p><p>RAO: --I think recusal is--is a very important issue. And as I said, I would take it in a--in a case by case manner. I would carefully consult the statutory standards. I would follow the precedence of my colleagues. There have been a number of people who have gone from executive branch service to the DC Circuit and I would certainly discuss with them how to handle recusal.-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --So you're not going to commit to recusing you're just going to look at them case by case? </p><p>RAO: Well, you know, you know, I--I haven't been confirmed yet, I've not been a judge. And so I would need to--to look at those recusal issues carefully and I--I would take that obligation very seriously.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. In August of 2018, the Administration announced a replacement for the Clean Power Plan and that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Many of us were involved in that. According to the EPA, his own data, this could lead to 1,400 additional premature deaths a year. Is that a case you would recuse yourself from if we were to enact a similar bill or a rule like that would come up to you?  </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, that--that role has been reviewed at OIRA. And so I would, you know, I would apply the recusal statute standards to that. There's--there's not been a final rule, however, that has been reviewed by my office.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. And do you believe the cost of that rule outweighed those benefits? </p><p>RAO: Well, there is, you know, partly what's been done is we have continued to use some of the analysis from the previous administration and show the range of--of uncertainty about what some of the impacts of the rule would be. That rule's currently in the propose stage. There was--there were many comments and the two--you know, EPA and the Department of Transportation, are working to--to finalize that or I mean, I guess the EPA (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --So know you don't have a view out on the cost benefits of that?  </p><p>RAO: Well, that's--that's something that we have reviewed and worked with the agencies on and we haven't yet seen the final rule.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: The Trump Administration has a 5 percent success rate, this is according to the nonpartisan Brookings Institution report released last October, the Administration has a 5 percent success rate when defending its agency actions in court. Previous administrations have had an average 69 percent success rate when defending their actions and that includes Republican administrations as well. In your current position, you're responsible for reviewing agency actions to make sure they're supported by facts and evidence. So this suggests to me that the Administration is taking agency actions that are far outside of the mainstream, especially when we know judges are deferential to agency actions. How can you explain the sharp decline? </p><p>RAO: Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>You know, I--I have seen some of those studies. There are other--other ways, of course, different ways of counting the--the litigation record in the courts. But--but it's, I think it's, a part of--been a part of--of every administration that individuals and businesses challenge regulatory action and our courts respond to that. Some of those cases are still going up on appeal. Some of those are about rules that were decided before I was confirmed to my current position.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. You've been extremely critical of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, saying that you \"Hope a lot of what the bureau did will be rolled back.\" You also wrote that \"The structure of the Bureau is unconstitutional because the president can't fire the director.\" As we know, given back the Bureau, $11.7 billion in relief to 27 million consumers in the U.S. If you're confirmed, will--which--by the DC Circuit, in the DC Circuit, you're going to hear challenges to the Bureau's rules. How can we expect you to give fair consideration given these past statements and suggestions and recommendations you've made? </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator Klobuchar, those were writings that I did as an academic, as an academic commentator when I had the freedom to--to speculate on--on abstract questions of law. Of course, if I were confirmed to the DC Circuit. I would have a very different role. I would--I would put aside those academic views, I would follow the precedence of the Supreme Court.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Would you uphold Chevron?  </p><p>RAO: Chevron is a precedence of the Supreme Court and yes, I would follow it.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: In a 2014 Law Review article you wrote that \"The Constitution requires that the president be able to--\" and this isn't a high school writing this a law reviews, \"That the Constitution requires that the president be able to fire at will the heads of independent agencies, such as the FTC, the SEC, and even the Federal Reserve.\" Can you cite any majority opinions of the Supreme Court that support your view that the Constitution would require this? </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, there are--there's the Myers case, the early case. but currently, I mean, my article was about the--the structure and text of the Constitution and looking at that in--in a sense. but I recognize in that article that Humphrey's executor is still good law and if I were to be confirmed, I would follow that precedent with respect to the constitutionality of independent agencies.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Tillis.  </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Miss Rao, thank you for being here. </p><p>I wanted to go back and--and maybe give you an opportunity, I think that Senator Cornyn spoke up when you were having an exchange with Senator Blumenthal, could you better describe the context of the role that you're applying in the interview where the Violence Against Women in School Safety Act came up in the--the word grandstanding was brought up? Can you describe that better for maybe reporters and other people who may take some soundbites out of here versus the full context of that experience?  </p><p>RAO: Sure. That was--that was--I haven't reviewed that interview in some time, but it was a--it was about a specific book. I think the book was called Overruled and the author was arguing for, I guess more judicial involvement in reviewing statutes carefully. And--and so--so we were--we were having a discussion about just how active the court has been with respect to hearing challenges on the Commerce Clause. And of course, those are the statutes that are referenced, the Gun-Fee School Zone Act, the Violence Against Women Act are--are important statutes and--and it was not my intention to--to disparage them.  </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you. I think Senator Hawley did a good job of describing some of the other actions there. But I thought it was very important because I can just see as I walk to the capital later today, how they're only going to remember some--a context or I think it was presented out of context. I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond to that.  </p><p>Can you tell me what your ABA rating is? </p><p>RAO: Yes, I was rated well qualified--qualified.  </p><p>TILLIS: Well qualified. And if I recall, I think it was someone who came before this committee, other members who have expressed s concern about your experience. Senator, or not Senator, Kagan, now Justice Kagan, probably had kind of a similar profile experience to your own, is that right in your recollection? </p><p>RAO: That--that is also my recollection. </p><p>TILLIS: And I understand that she enjoyed a lot of support, actually support from both sides of the aisle. I--the only other question that I have really relates back to some of your writings, earlier. Somebody has said were, I guess, cringe worthy. They've used the various different descriptions. But tell me what--what motivated you to--what--what sort of life experiences or other factors back at that time when your school motivated you to take on some of these issues? And--and if you were to write them today are you saying that you're stepping away from some of the concepts or you'd just do a little bit more eloquent job of describing conceptually what you were beginning to form as a young person in school? </p><p>RAO: Well, thank you, Senator Tillis.  </p><p>I think maybe--maybe a little of both.  </p><p>TILLIS: Which ones would you just say, \"That was dumb. I should have never done it?\" We've--we've had people come before--before the committee and do that. I'd like to know, that when maybe first. </p><p>RAO: Well, I think that there's certainly some--some sentences and phrases I would--I would never use today. And--and, you know, I've just, you know, because they don't reflect my views, they don't reflect the way that I express myself. You know, I think it's also important to consider the context of--of what I was--writing at Yale in the early 90s, right. We were a bunch of kids on a liberal arts campus writing for each other. Right, and there were 35 undergraduate publications, and I think we all fashioned ourselves scribblers on the--the current events on campus. And, you know, I think it was just a specific--a specific time. </p><p>And--and, you know, and frankly, a lot of the quotations that have been mentioned here don't even--aren't even a full representation of all the many columns I wrote while I was at Yale on a whole range of different topics. And--and, you know, the--the committee also has before it, my record since I left college which includes all my scholarly writings, my speeches, my congressional testimony, my public service, my service at OIRA. So hopefully, that can all be taken in context.  </p><p>TILLIS: Yeah, I hope so. Because in a couple of instances, you know, you kind of get the read for how the narrative is going to go around here by the questions various people in the press ask you, some are legitimately asking questions because they're curious, others are trying to build a narrative. And I would really encourage them to go back and understand the context in some cases and--and other cases where you simply changed an opinion because you've--you've witnessed more sunrises and sunsets and you're a wiser person today than you were back when you were in college. </p><p>So again, for those who say that--that your experience is a concern they should go back and look at people that they have enthusiastically support it who had very similar profiles, one who's actually a Supreme Court justice now and we should keep in mind that the ABA has rated you well qualified and that's why I'll be supporting your nomination.  </p><p>RAO: Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Whitehouse. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>Miss Rao, I worry less about what you wrote at Yale years ago, then whose interest you serve right now at OIRA and how that will move over with you into the DC Circuit Court if you are confirmed.  </p><p>We hear a lot in this committee and in the press about how the president is trying to push through lots of conservative judges. I actually don't see much conservatism in those judges. What I see is judges who are predictably likely to rule for specific big, special interests, and you see the hands of those special interests in the process of selection. We'd like to know more about it but the Federalist Society doesn't disclose its donors very clearly. We do know from the White House that the White House said that insourced, that's their word, insourced the Federalist Society to make their selection of the last Supreme Court nominee. We then see a confirmation process that is just rotten with dark money. One donor, nearly $18 million. We don't know who that donor is.  </p><p>And then we see these same groups turning up in front of the courts, circuit court, Supreme Court, as amici. It's not always easy to figure out who's behind the amici because the rules are very vague about disclosure, even in the court. It's probably the worst policed form of influence seeking in our government right now. But what I see over and over again, is an instinct to protect the role of dark money because dark money is the vehicle for all these other powers. I've seen an instinct to protect big polluters at all costs, as if there's no public on the other side of the regulatory balance. The firearms lobby, big instinct to protect them. And a very strong lean in favor of corporate political powers and against the accountability of corporations, either to an honest, knowledgeable regulator or to a court or a jury.  </p><p>Now, the courts and juries were kind of set up to deal with this problem because the Founding Fathers knew about special interest influenced in legislators and in the executive branch. but what I see from the courts is a desire to move as many questions as possible to those areas where the special interests have the most power and I think that's a matter of real concern. What makes me say that this is not a conservative judicial doctrine is that when you look at conservative traditional doctrines they include things like respect for the will of elected branches, like judicial modesty, narrowing the decision to what's least required to decide, stare decisis, respect for precedent and that famous Scalia-ism originalism. </p><p>In various cases, every single one of these so-called conservative judicial doctrines has been completely run over in the path to delivering a win for the big donor interest. So it's hard for me to align conservative judicial doctrine with what's going on here, which is why I say these aren't conservative judges any longer. This is basically an effort to capture the court for big, special interests with judges who will rule predictably for those big interests.  </p><p>Time will tell in your case. There's nothing I can ask you to answer here now that will divulge that you're going to go in and put your finger on the side of the big polluters, you're going to put your thumb on the scales for the firearms industry, you're going to help corporations avoid accountability or any of that, but time will tell. And time is already telling at the Supreme Court and that's what I want to make a record of here today. The Supreme Court is now up to, I want to say 73 partisan decisions, 5-4 with Republicans and Democrats allied on different kinds in the Chief Justice Roberts' tenure. So call them the Roberts' five, the activist Republicans, 73 decisions in which there--they've had a particularly important issue for Republican interests in front of them and in all of those partisan 5-4 decisions the big donor interest, 73 to 0, this from a guy who said he was calling balls and strikes. Give me a break. </p><p>Helping Republicans win at the polls has been a constant theme of the court. Whether it's hurting unions, or helping dark money, or allowing voter suppression, or protecting and enshrining gerrymandering, helping corporations avoid accountability, totally with no mention of the Seventh Amendment with regard to protection from their employers who might be discriminated against, consumers who might be injured, or other parties injured by their actions.  </p><p>And then, of course, there are the big donor interest wins for polluters and for the gun lobby, that just get thrown their way, almost like it's a Christmas present. So what I see is a court that is predictively likely, indeed, infallibly likely in these 5-4 decisions to vote for big Republican donor interest. And I think it's time we clean that mess up and I think that that is going to, in the long run going to do a real disservice to our courts to have a record like that of having so almost slavishly followed those interests in those circumstances. So I hope you'll do a lot better if you get on the court and not just fall into that rut. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>RAO: Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Hawley. No, I'm sorry, Ernst. Ernst. I'm sorry.  </p><p>ERNST: Thank you very much. Mr. Chair and Mrs. Rao, you've been nominal. is to serve on the DC Circuit. And although the DC Circuit can be described as primarily handling federal administrative law, I believe that judges who serve on this very powerful court need to share the same values and morals as any other judge and that includes a number of sensitive topics and concerns that I and the vast majority of the country hold dear.  </p><p>And so I'm not going to mince words. A couple folks here have touched on it. I've had a chance to review a number of your writings while you were in college and they do give me pause and not just from my own personal experiences, but regarding a message that we are sending young women everywhere. And I've said time and time again, that we need to change the culture around sexual violence from our college campuses, to the U.S. Olympic Committee, to our military, and beyond. And a large part of this is ensuring that young women feel comfortable sharing the stories and experiences that they've endured, and that they are given a chance to be heard, and that they know that we hear them and that someone out there actually cares about them.  </p><p>I'm thankful for the opportunity to serve on this committee. I'd like to discuss some of these issues with you today. So right out the gate, do you believe that rape is wrong?  </p><p>RAO: Absolutely. It's--it's a horrific crime.  </p><p>ERNST: And who was at fault in a rape? </p><p>RAO: The rapist. You know, the man who commits the rape is, of course, at fault.  </p><p>ERNST: Man or woman.  </p><p>RAO: Man or woman, but often the man.  </p><p>ERNST: You wrote on these matters in--in college which were about 25 years ago and just describe how your thinking has actually evolved on these matters, as a number of my colleagues have asked.  </p><p>RAO: Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>You know, as you know, I've--I've had a lot of experience since that--that time writing in college and--and I don't think I would express myself in the same way. These are horrible crimes and I wouldn't write anything that might be implied to blame a victim or make it less likely for a victim to come forward. I think it's very important that--that women on campus and elsewhere feel free to bring forward claims of sexual assault or rape. </p><p>ERNST: Thank you. I appreciate that.  </p><p>And in--in your writings you did talk a lot about date rape in the context of--of college campuses, we know it does happen elsewhere, discussing the concepts of blame and responsibility. What has informed your decision as you have moved through the years and--and how have you come to understand that maybe no one is--or the victim is not to blame or the survivors not to blame? Maybe explain that to us how you have informed your decision through the years?  </p><p>RAO: Sure. So--so you know, a victim of a horrible crime is--is not to blame. And--and a person who commits those crimes should be held responsible. I did, you know, I tried to make the common sense observation that--that, you know, women can take certain steps to try to avoid becoming a victim because that ultimately does seem to be the goal in making it less likely. But should someone be a victim then they should not be blamed and you know, there's the responsibility is with the person who commits a crime.  </p><p>ERNST: Okay. I'd also like to ask you also in the feminist dilemma, there was a comment that you made, you--you state the Camille Paglia's view on date rape has often been criticized for its insensitive--insensitivity, because she seems to \"Blame the victim. Paglia, however, accurately describes the dangerous feminist idealism which teaches women that they are equal.\" Is that a dangerous--a dangerous feminist ideal is that women are created equal? </p><p>RAO: Senator, I very much regret that statement. And I've always believed strongly in the equality of women and men and for equal rights and opportunities for women. I'm honestly, not sure why I wrote that in college.  </p><p>ERNST: Okay. I'm glad to hear you admit that today because I would hate to think that women would not be treated equal under the law. </p><p>RAO: Of course, and if I were to be confirmed, I would--I would treat all people who come before me equally and administer justice without respect to persons.  </p><p>ERNST: Okay. I appreciate your explaining some of the views that you had from college. I hope that we can have further conversations about this.  </p><p>RAO: Yes, thank you.  </p><p>ERNST: Thank you. I yield back my time. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. A statement from a prior nominee, \"I would hope that it was Latino with the richness of her experiences with more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male would.\" You didn't say that, Sotomayer said that, Justice Sotomayer. And the argument from my side was that she's biased and when you look at our life, I didn't believe that. When I look at your life, I think you're a very fair squared away person. </p><p>Senator Hirono.  </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>I ask the-- these two questions of every nominee that comes before any of my committees, they are since you became a legal adult have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or a solid of a sexual nature?  </p><p>RAO: No. </p><p>HIRONO: Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement related to this kind of conduct?  </p><p>RAO: No.  </p><p>HIRONO: As a law professor you continue to be critical of affirmative action programs. For example, in a 2009 law review article, you argue this such program \"Confirms and reinforce traditional and historical associations between races and disadvantage and imposes,\" what you term, \"dignitory harm\". Not sure what that means. What does that mean? </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator Hirono, that is a--that is an article about different conceptions of dignity and constitutional law. The term dignity is used by the U.S. Supreme Court and other constitutional courts in other countries. And--and that is, it was a--it was an attempt as an academic to--to explain the different senses in which dignity was used in those cases. So that was the--that was the context of that writing. </p><p>HIRONO: Is that something that you would apply to any cases that come before you whether or not a regulation or any--any issue that came before you imposes dignitory harm?  </p><p>RAO: No, Senator, of course not. You know, these are--these are very academic and abstract discussions of a concept of dignity in--in specific cases. You know, those are all things that I would put to one side. If I were fortunate to be confirmed, I would--I would follow the precedence and the law in cases that come before me.  </p><p>HIRONO: Well, here's an actual situation. I think you responded to something that happened in France where they may dwarf tossing illegal and you--I think that you said something like, you know, \"It's up to them whether they admit that they--this was an individual decision.\" But why wouldn't--it was seem as though you're writing about dignitory harm would apply to something like dwarf tossing, wouldn't it? </p><p>RAO: Senator, for the--for the opportunity to clarify that.  </p><p>Again it was in the--I wrote about a particular case in France that was--was that use different conceptions of dignity. There was a town in France that banned dwarf throwing. There was an individual Mr. Whackinheim (SP) who made his living doing that and he said that this ban affected his dignitary interests But--but in my article I don't take a position one way or another on these issues, I'm just pointing out-- </p><p>HIRONO: I think your article has been interpreted as that you were okay with dwarf tossing. This is one of the reasons that an organization that supports their--their issues is very much against your nomination.  </p><p>After Elena Kagan was nominated to the Supreme Court you criticized the confirmation process and you wrote that nominees are \"Coached to choose from certain stock answers. Nominees are confirmed based on platitudes and public discourse suffers as a result.\" You argue the nominees should not be confirmed, \"Based on incantations of the right formulas, without an examination of their actual beliefs.\" And I must say, sitting here through all of the dozens and dozens of nominees that we have had to--that we've had hearings on, that what we do get our platitudes and I believe that public discourse suffers because we--it's very difficult for us to ascertain what you're actually beliefs are. And since you believe that we should get to the actual beliefs it must be because you believe that judges do make decisions based on their actual beliefs. Is that not so, isn't that why you criticized the confirmation process?  </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator Hirono, in that--in that article I--I suggest that--that a nominee's, you know, views on judicial philosophy and how they would decide cases are--are fair game for--for discussion and I've sought before this committee to give straightforward answers to those questions.  </p><p>HIRONO: So are you saying that because you--you have sat here saying as does every other nominee that you will follow precedent. And we all know, that even as Justice Rehnquist said, you know, just do not come here as blank slates, that you have a wealth of experiences and you bring those experiences to the floor, including various kinds of ideological perspectives that you may have. There is absolutely no question in my mind that a judge's actual beliefs is what's impelling a lot of the decisions and that not just following precedent. Because a lot of times precedent is not on--for on all fours, applicable to any case before you.  </p><p>So I--are you saying that you sit here and tell us that you have been disclosing your actual beliefs, because you didn't respond to the question that Justice, that Justice, he's not a Justice yet, that my colleague asked you about when life begins.  </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, I--I come here to this committee with no agenda and no ideology and--and I--I would strive, if I were confirmed, to--to follow the law in every case. </p><p>HIRONO: Oh, that is what they all say. Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>GRASSLEY: Is it ever appropriate and what would be your view of using foreign law as a--as a decider in a case and when is it proper, is that even proper to make a referral to it? </p><p>RAO: Thank you, Senator Grassley. </p><p>GRASSLEY: The law of some other country. </p><p>RAO: So there--there--there may be some instances where the law of some other countries is at issue under a contract or in some other way, and then--then that would be the applicable law. But--but foreign law's not generally used to interpret our Constitution or U.S.--you know, our federal statutes. </p><p>GRASSLEY: You said generally, when is it appropriate or not appropriate?  </p><p>RAO: Well, I think it's--it's generally not appropriate. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Okay. Would it--would it be wrong to say it's never appropriate?  </p><p>RAO: Well, there--there are some constitutional provisions that rely on the law of nations and--and things like that. So there are some--some context in which--which the--which foreign law and international law would be appropriate to (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>GRASSLEY: --Now, I know you're bound by Supreme Court precedent when and if ever would it be appropriate for when your circuit to overturn a precedent?  </p><p>RAO: It's--it's not appropriate. As a--as a court of appeals, we are--we are absolutely bound by the precedence of the Supreme Court.  </p><p>GRASSLEY: Yeah, I know. I didn't--you didn't hear the clarification.  </p><p>RAO: Sorry.  </p><p>GRASSLEY: I know you're bound by Supreme Court, when would it be appropriate for a precedent of your circuit to be overturned?  </p><p>RAO: Sorry. Sorry, Senator Grassley.  </p><p>Well, there are--there are considerations. You know, normally, you know, you want to follow precedent, but there--there are certain features when a precedent may be overruled. You know, you look at the longevity of the precedent, the reliance interests, you know, there--there are certain standards for when a precedent may be overruled. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Define for me what you think about the terms activist judge or definition of judicial restraint? </p><p>RAO: Sure. So I think, you know, an--an activist judges often seen as a judge who goes beyond the--beyond the law to reach a particular result. And you know, I think it's important for judges to follow the law wherever it leads them, and whatever result it leads them to and I would strive to do that if I were confirmed, </p><p>GRASSLEY: What assurances or evidence can you give us that if confirmed, your decisions will be grounded in that precedent, in the text of law, rather than any political ideology you might bring to the bench? </p><p>RAO: Thank you.  </p><p>I think, you know, I, having had experience in all three branches of the government, I have a good appreciation for the different roles that each of the three branches play and the independence and impartiality of our judiciary is--is essential to our system. And--and if I were to be confirmed, I would--I would work to uphold that in every case.  </p><p>GRASSLEY: Now, my next question isn't going to determine whether I vote for you or not, but I want you to know that I'm very much an advocate for cameras in the courtroom, including your courtroom, if you're on that Circuit, including the Supreme Court, although that gets a little more controversial. But what are your views of cameras in the courtroom?  </p><p>RAO: Senator, I don't--I don't have a view on that subject. I know it's one that's been discussed and debated, you know, even since I was a council on this committee many years ago.  </p><p>GRASSLEY: Yeah. You're going to go to work on the circuit was at least case, I think it's the least case load of--of have any circuits. What do you think about the caseload of your circuit? </p><p>RAO: Well, I--I do understand that there are fewer--fewer cases in the DC Circuit, but my understanding is that many of the--the appeals that come are highly complex and--and so often much more--much more detailed and difficult. So-- </p><p>GRASSLEY: You're lucky that I probably would not oppose you just for the reason that there's too many judges on that court already. There's going to be a time when we are to get this down to at least three less than it is right now to spend the taxpayers' money wisely and to make sure that the caseload from one circuit to another is more fair. At this point, I wouldn't--at one time we reduced the circuit by taking somebody from the DC Circuit and put them on the Ninth Circuit. I'm not sure that was a wise decision, but at least it did reduce the--the judgeships in your circuit by one. So I hope there's another vacancy that we can just not fill. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Senator Harris.  </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you. </p><p>Miss Rao, in 2016 the Obama Administration enacted the Volks Rule, which allowed OSHA to issue citations to employers for failing to keep a record of work related injuries over five year period. In April of 2018 the current president signed a law repealing the Volks Rule, and in a speech that you gave before the United States Department of--or Chamber of Commerce, you applauded the rule's repeal. According to OSHA, are you aware that more than 5,000 workers were killed on the job in 2016 and on average, that is more than 99 deaths a week and more than 14 deaths a day? </p><p>RAO: I'm not familiar with those specific statistics.  </p><p>HARRIS: Do you believe that when government is required to keep data and when employers are required to keep data it allows us to--to be better in terms of public policy and ensuring that we avoid issues like workplace injuries and deaths in this case?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, it certainly can be.  </p><p>HARRIS: So why did you applaud the repeal of the rule? </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, just to--just to be clear about, you know, my role at OIRA you know, we review rules that come up from agencies, those policies are set-- </p><p>HARRIS: --But let's talk specifically about this one. Why did you applaud the repeal of the Volks Rule? </p><p>RAO: Senator, I don't actually recall discussing that in that speech.  </p><p>HARRIS: This was just in 2018 that that happened. You don't recall what happened last year?  </p><p>RAO: I don't know, no. </p><p>HARRIS: Okay. You said, when having a conversation with Senator Ernst, you said, \"Women should take certain steps to avoid becoming a victim.\" What steps do you have in mind that women should take to avoid becoming a victim of sexual assault?  </p><p>RAO: Senator, it's--it's just sort of a common sense idea about, for instance, excessive drinking. You know, that was advice that was given to me by my mother. It's (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>HARRIS: So that's one step you believe women should take to avoid becoming a victim of sexual assault?  </p><p>RAO: Well, it is--it is just a way to make it less likely, it's not to blame the victim. You know, rape and sexual assault are horrible crimes, but we're talking about what can you do to keep yourself safe?  </p><p>HARRIS: Are there other steps that you believe women should take to avoid becoming a victim of sexual assault?  </p><p>RAO: Yeah, that--that is one of the--one of the issues that I discussed. I'm not--I'm not sure if there are--there are others.  </p><p>HARRIS: So do you believe if a woman does not take those steps that she is at fault or partially at fault for what happens to her? </p><p>RAO: No.  </p><p>HARRIS: So what is the significance of taking those steps?  </p><p>RAO: Well, I think it's just the significance of--of trying to avoid becoming a victim of any crime, right? We take--we take different steps to try to protect ourselves from--from horrible crimes such as rape. And you know, and--and I think what we want is for women to not be victims. </p><p>HARRIS: So your previous writings on date rape and sexual assault have been mentioned many times in this hearing. They certainly express strong opinions about the subject and for that reason raise concerns about your current perspective on these issues. You have, for example, in '93 said that \"Date rape exemplifies the attempts of the nurtured feminist to develop an artificial alternative world in which women are free from sexual danger and no always means no.\" In your current view when does no not mean no? </p><p>RAO: Senator, no, no, no means no and I regret writing that when I was in college. </p><p>HARRIS: You said that \"A good way for a potential date rape to be avoided is for a woman to stay reasonably sober.\" You went on to say, \"If a woman drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice.\" Do you stand by those comments?  </p><p>RAO: Senator, I--I was only trying to make the common sense observation about the relationship between drinking and becoming a victim. Rape is--rape is-- </p><p>HARRIS: So I'm concerned about your current views. Do you stand by those comments?  </p><p>RAO: I--I--I do not and I would not express myself that way today. </p><p>HARRIS: Okay. And last week, I joined 35 of my colleagues in the Senate, urging the Department of Education to resend the proposed rule that would narrow the definition of sexual harassment and require colleges to provide live, in-person hearings where an accused representative can cross-examine a survivor. We oppose the rule because it fails to account for the experience of survivors and it hampers schools' ability to respond to complaints. Under your leadership, has the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs evaluated this proposal?  </p><p>RAO: We did evaluate that rule. It's currently a proposed rule and the comment period just closed last week. </p><p>HARRIS: What's your opinion on the rule? </p><p>RAO: Senator, you know, my--my opinion on that rule is--is not what's relevant in my current position as (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>HARRIS: --Well, I would argue it is relevant because if you are not--if you are actually confirmed on the DC Circuit, you of course, will be responsible for reviewing regulatory appeals. So under your leadership, if the office has reviewed this rule, what is your opinion about its efficacy?  </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, this is--this is a policy of the Department of Education, as you stated, and they drafted the rule. You know, my understanding is there were thousands of comments from the public. We take that public process of--of notice and comment rule-making very seriously. And it will now be up to the Department of Education to consider those comments in terms of finalizing the rule, which we haven't--we haven't seen that final yet. But we will take--one of the things we do--do at OIRA, is make sure that the agency has responded to the comments.  </p><p>HARRIS: And my last question, Mr. Chairman, if you--once the--your office under your leadership has commented on the proposed rule will you commit to recusing yourself to any challenges on this rule if it is litigated before the DC Circuit and you are confirmed?  </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, again, you know, I--I will take recusal very seriously. I noted in my questionnaire that--that some of the issues arising at OIRA will require recusal but I can't prejudge what those would be until I have a case before me.  </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Blackburn. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome.  </p><p>RAO: Thank you. </p><p>BLACKBURN: We appreciate that you're here.  </p><p>I have to tell you, I think what an amazing career you've had, the University of Chicago Law, and then clerking spring court working in the White House, running a major regulatory agency, quite a resume and I find it so interesting that much of the day's focus has been on writings that you did during your college years. </p><p>I do want to come to one story that I think is so interesting, your story, your parents story, of emigrating here from India, which really does represent so much of what we cherish as the American Dream. And there's an article that you wrote about bringing a friend to your family's Thanksgiving dinner. So I want you to speak you know, cap that story quickly and then speak a little bit about how that and your family's experience really helped to shape your identity.  </p><p>RAO: Thank you, Senator Blackburn.  </p><p>So the--the column that you reference, I took my friend Dan, who was an Irish Catholic, to Thanksgiving with my friends and family and--and so he got to see sort of a whole range of--of what happens at Thanksgiving with the Rao family. Which included many different meals and lots of people, lots of questions about whether he was my special friend, which he was not, otherwise, obviously, I wouldn't have brought him to-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--to this--to this--to this event. But really, it was about celebrating all the--the closeness and love that my family and friends had. And although my parents were immigrants from India, they--they embraced lots of American traditions, such as celebrating Thanksgiving, and you know, maybe put their own spin on it from their own backgrounds. But, you know, I feel very fortunate to have grown up in such a--such a warm and nurturing environment with so many wonderful people.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: Excellent.  </p><p>Three quick questions so that we can put a cap on your college writings. Number one, do you still hold the same views that you expressed in those college writings as you do today? </p><p>RAO: No, I--and I regret some of the--the language that I used.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: Number two, will you allow your personal opinions to influence your ability to apply the law and the Constitution as written? </p><p>RAO: No.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: Number three, will you fairly apply the law for every party who appears in your court, regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, or religion?  </p><p>RAO: Yes, of course.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: All right. Thank you.  </p><p>I want to move on to congressional power and some of your recent writings. Last year you published an article about congressional power in the administrative state. And there's a fear that representative lawmaking is being displaced by agency regulation. This is something that concerns me. And you wrote, and I'm quoting you, \"Congress currently stands in the shadow of the administrative state\" and you supplied suggestions on how Congress could fix its fading role. And what are your views on how Congress could reassert its lawmaking power and oversight authority? </p><p>RAO: Well, I do think that is a--is a difficult question and it is one I have addressed in my academic writings, as you mentioned. Some of the--the options are less delegation to executive agencies, more lawmaking by Congress. You know, political scientists have--have--have thought about other structural changes. But--but the main point of my article was really to argue about how important it was for Congress to exercise its--its lawmaking responsibilities. You know, it's a--it's a crucial part of our constitutional democracy that lawmaking be done by people who are democratically elected.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: You have presided over a period of deregulation and Tennesseans talk a lot about how please they are to get some of the regulatory burden off their back. So from where you have been sitting, what would you say is your primary contribution to pushing forward with deregulation and seeing the economic growth that we are now seeing in our country? </p><p>RAO: Well, thank you for that question.  </p><p>I--I think one of the things we've been most focusing on is moving forward with regulatory reform in a way that--that gets government out of the way, where it's not working. There are a lot of regulations on the books that don't have the effects that were intended, a lot of paperwork burdens. And, you know, we're looking to--to pull back the things are no longer working. And--and I think we've enjoyed quite a measure of success for that in terms of helping individuals, and small businesses, and families.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you. My time has expired.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Booker. </p><p>BOOKER: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>Hi, Miss Rao. During your time, overseeing the Trump Administration, Department of Housing and Urban Development, you've tried to roll back important protections against housing discrimination on the basis of race. One of these protections was about the agency's disparate impact standard for housing discrimination. Disparate impact, as you know, is not a novel concept. It was established government policy, it's an established Supreme Court precedent, that businesses can be held liable under the Fair Housing Act for housing and lending practices that have a disparate effect. </p><p>But under your watch the department is trying to roll back this basic protection. And I'm wondering, you're overseeing the agency rule changes in this Administration, why would the Administration want to undo such well established policy and Supreme Court precedents when it comes to remedying housing discrimination based on race, going all the way back to a period of the Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King, who you talked about who you admire? </p><p>RAO: Well, if I could just take a step back on this--on this Housing and Urban Development rule. The--the agency put forth in advance notice of proposed rule-making last summer, which was in part design to-- </p><p>BOOKER: --I know the procedures. I'm really wondering and you can answer the question directly.  </p><p>RAO: Well, you know, it was--you know, there's some hard questions there. And as you know, there was a Supreme Court decision in 2015 that addressed this issue. And so the advanced notice of proposed rule-making was designed to--to tee up a series of questions for the public about whether the disparate impact standard should be changed and--and if so, how. And--and I think maybe either we've just received, I think at OIRA, the proposed rule that's--that's based on that advance notice of rule of proposal-- </p><p>BOOKER: Well, I guess the issue for me is this terrible experience of housing discrimination, my family even faced it itself. Getting rid of this protection for disparate, impressed housing claims will actually make it harder to ensure the promise of the Fair Housing Act, harder to stop discrimination. And so do you understand that getting rid of this well established production would actually endanger our ability to hold people accountable for civil rights violations?  </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, I certainly understand that concern, but the--the proposal hasn't even been made public. So, you know, the--Secretary Carson is working on addressing that issue. And--and I think we need to see, you know, see what the--the rule ultimately says. But it's--it's under review, so I can't comment on the substance of it. </p><p>BOOKER: In a 2008 article you criticized the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which invalidated the state laws that--that criminalize same sex relationships. You said, \"That the court's decision eschews older traditions in favor of an emerging awareness of the meaning of the--and the scope of liberty.\" What, in your view, should the Supreme Court have been in the business of holding \"older traditions\", as you said, of laws that criminalize same sex relationships?  </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, those were some comments made in the course of an article about dignity and constitutional law and--and of course, Lawrence is a precedent of the Supreme Court which I would--I would faithfully follow if I were confirmed.  </p><p>BOOKER: Are--are gay relationships, in your opinion, immoral? </p><p>RAO: Senator, I'm not sure, you know, the relevance of that to, you know, I mean, my personal views on that-- </p><p>BOOKER: --I think relevant to your opinion, if you think African American relationships are immoral? Do you think gay relationships are immoral? Do you personally believe that gay relationships--? </p><p>RAO: I do not.  </p><p>BOOKER: You do not believe that.  </p><p>RAO: No.  </p><p>BOOKER: Do you--do believe they're a sin? </p><p>RAO: Senator, you know, my--my personal views on any of these subjects are--are--are things I would put to one side and I would faithfully follow the precedence put forward for it.-- </p><p>BOOKER: --So you're not willing to say here that whether--whether you believe it is sinful for a men--two men to be married, you're not--you're not willing to comment on that?  </p><p>RAO: You know, Senator, yeah. </p><p>BOOKER: Excuse me? I'm sorry, I didn't hear your response.  </p><p>RAO: My response is that--that these are--these personal views are ones that I would--I would put to one side. Whatever my personal views are on this subject, I would faithfully follow the precedence of the Supreme Court with them-- </p><p>BOOKER: Excuse me for interrupting you. I have one minute left.  </p><p>In a 2013 article, you also criticized a Supreme Court landmark decision in the United States versus Windsor which struck down the provision of DOMA, that defined marriage as only between a man and a woman. You said the court had found, \"A novel constitutional right of two people's freedom to marry to--to recognize same sex marriages.\" And you said that, \"The Court's decision amounted to a political choice, not a judicial choice.\" What--what do you believe Supreme Court's decision to respect the status of the same sex marriage, how was that a political choice and not a judicial one? </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator, in that--in that particular article what I was saying is that in the case in Windsor did not recognize same sex marriage as a right, it only recognized the--the right to be--have your marriage recognized if the state provided such a marriage. Of course, that later step was taken in Obergefell, but--but Windsor, part of what I was explaining, was that it was a rather--it was a rather empty right that was in--that case.  </p><p>BOOKER: And you know LGBTQ Americans have faced a--a--a long history of discrimination, long histories of violence, intimidation, bullying,. Young LGBTQ youth in America report not going to school because of fear for their own safety at rates that are unconscionable. And a lot of the hard one provisions that we're talking about became the law of the land very recently. So why is this Administration currently trying to do so much to roll back transgender--transgender right protections and the like? And--and these matters could very much be brought before you under the regulatory conception, that somehow protecting American citizens is burdensome. </p><p>RAO: You know, Senator, I think, you know, civil rights and equal protection of a laws are two essential values in our system and if I were to be confirmed as a judge, I would--I would firmly uphold that.  </p><p>BOOKER: Have you ever had an--an LGBTQ law clerk? </p><p>RAO: I've not been a judge so I don't have any law clerks. </p><p>BOOKER: I'm sorry, working, someone working for you. </p><p>RAO: I'm going to be honest, I don't know the sexual orientation of my--my staff. So I--I, you know, I take people as they come, you know, irrespective of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation. I--I treat people as individuals. Those are the values that I grew up with, you know, and those are the values I would apply if confirmed. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Cruz.  </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee should not be a theater for mischaracterizing or twisting nominees records reviews, nor should it be an avenue for persecution. You know, we've seen a growing pattern among Senate Democrats of hostility to religious faith. I--I have to say I was deeply troubled a few minutes ago to hear questioning of a nominee asking your personal views on what is sinful. In my view, that has no business in this committee. Article Six of the Constitution says \"There shall be no religious test for any public office.\" We have also seen Senate Democrats attack what they've characterized as religious dogma. We've seen Senate Democrats attack nominees for their own personal views on salvation.  </p><p>I don't believe this is a theological court of inquisition. I think the proper avenue for investigation of this committee is a nominee's record. So, Miss Rao, let me talk about your record. And let me ask you about your actual record, which is what this committee should be looking at, not our own personal religious views or your religious views, whatever they may be. </p><p>You shared, at your confirmation hearing, your family story about how your parents left India, arrived in Detroit in the middle of a snowstorm, without winter jackets and--and with just $16 and the optimism of the recently married. That--that is a story that resonates with me, it has similarities to my own father's story. Can you share with this committee a bit of your family story and how that has impacted your life journey? </p><p>RAO: Sure. You know, my parents, as I said, came from India in the early 70s and they had their medical degrees and they, you know, had residencies and fellowships, they worked really hard for not very much pay. You know, I was born in 1973, when my parents still didn't have very much. But you know, I had a really happy childhood. My parents were--were warm and loving and I grew up with many warm and loving family friends and--and I think they conveyed many of the values that--that they brought with them, you know, about hard work and honesty and that has been a big part of shaping who I am today. </p><p>CRUZ: Much of the questioning from this committee has also focused on--on your college writings and--and there has been language and--and characterizations that I think are--are false and--and distorting. So I want anyone listening at home to be unequivocally clear, when it comes to sexual assault and rape both are wrong, are evil, are criminal and should be prosecuted. Do you agree with that?  </p><p>RAO: Yes. </p><p>CRUZ: As I sat here listening to the questioning and--and what was being described by Democratic members, I thought, \"What--what crazy thing must she have written in college?\" And I pulled out and read it sitting here and--and I read, for example, in one of the articles entitled Shades of Grey, that you wrote, \"Clearly if the male student forced the woman to have sex against her will then it should be held responsible.\" You also said, \"A man who rapes a drunk girl should be prosecuted.\" Now, both of those statements unequivocally true, correct and you said them then.  </p><p>What is causing democratic umbrage as you also said that college students should refrain from drinking to access. Now, I would note that is very good advice for a college student, whether male or female, I have two daughters. Now, fortunately, there are 8 and 10, we're not dealing with this yet, but I certainly intend to give them the advice not to drink to excess. And it is unquestionably true that any college student that drinks to the point of--of getting drunk and losing control risks being a victim, risks being vulnerable. </p><p>When--when I was a student in college I recall a student who was--who was there with me, who--who drank to access and then tragically got on top of a train and electrocuted himself, lost three of his limbs. It was horrific and so that is very good advice for a college student \"don't drink to the point of losing self control.\" And I just--just want anyone watching this to be clear that you were unequivocal then and unequivocal now, that anyone who commits a crime of sexual violence should be prosecuted. Is--is that correct?  </p><p>RAO: That is correct. </p><p>CRUZ: The DC Circuit's caseload involves a great deal of administrative law questions, often very complicated administrative law questions. What in your professional background do you believe has prepared you to be a DC Circuit judge? </p><p>RAO: Yes, thank you, Senator Cruz.  </p><p>I believe that--that much of my practical and academic experience relates very closely to the specialized docket of the DC Circuit. I, as has been mentioned, I've worked in all three branches of the federal government. I am currently the Administrator of OIRA, where I oversee regulatory policy from different executive branch agencies and--and look closely at whether those regulations are consistent with law and whether they meet certain analytical standards.  </p><p>I have--and as a scholar for over a decade, I've been writing about these types of issues and constitutional law and administrative law, separation of powers (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>CRUZ: Let me ask one final question, just because I'm at the end of my time. </p><p>Why in your judgment, the separation of powers and federalism matter? Why should the people care about separation of power and federalism, two important structural restraints in our Constitution?  </p><p>RAO: I think those structural restraints are essential to the protection of individual liberty and our--and our founders created that structure to--to protect individuals from--from government overreaching and tyranny.  </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>BOOKER: Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. Just to point out a clarification and Senator Cruz invoked my commentary. And I-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Sure.  </p><p>BOOKER: And--and he knows this because we're friends, I would defend, die for to protect the ideals of religious freedom in our country. And I was in no way trying to attack the nominee's religious freedom. I was simply saying that discrimination under any standpoints, whether it's against one's religion, someone's race, someone sexual orientation, should not be tolerated.  </p><p>And the Senator and I both know that religion was used as a ruse to discriminate against African Americans. My parents told me stories, they felt it was religiously objectionable, the blacks and whites should go to school together and sit down together. And so while he and I agree on the defense of religious freedom, I also know that he and I agree on the fact that no one should face discrimination in this country when it comes to their race, religion or--or--or even their orientation.  </p><p>Thank you for that moment to clarify. Thank you, Senator Cruz.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. I think end of round one we have Coons. I'm sorry. Sorry, Chris. I apologize.  </p><p>COONS: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>Ms. Rao, there's been a great deal of discussion about your college writings, which I would agree are at the very least cringe worthy and have deserved and gotten a great deal of attention. I want to submit for the record if I could, Mr. Chairman, a--a letter from 54 South Asian American women who are civil rights attorneys, who are law professors, who are advocates for survivors, it at length, it challenges some of the assumptions in your college writings. But that's not what I want to focus on today.  </p><p>I want to focus not on things you wrote decades ago, but your view of executive power, and in particular, the unitary executive theory and how, not in college, in the heated exchange of campus politics, not even as a law student or a law clerk, but after completing all of your legal training as a professor, I think at the time, you wrote a law review article in 2014, where you talk really very pointedly about your sense of the scope and reach of presidential power. </p><p>Briefly, I'll quote, \"The president must have the ability to remove all executive branch officers at will\". And then you go on to explain just how broad you think that power is. Let me just put a point on this. Do you believe the president can fire at will a federal prosecutor who's investigating him, his family, his campaign team is senior advisors? Do you think the executive power goes that far? </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator Coons, in that article I was writing primarily about the president's control over--over civil cases, over the administrative state and administrative agencies. You know, the question of--of removal power in that context is not one I have--I have written about or looked at closely.  </p><p>COONS: Well, I appreciate that answer. But it doesn't strike me as really answering my question. </p><p>You may have, there, been speaking to civil, not criminal, but the force and clarity with which you assert the reach of executive power overall, even including independent agencies strikes me.  </p><p>To quote from that same law review article; the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized all agencies including the independent ones are part of the executive branch.  You go on; the president alone possess the power to direct, control and supervise inferior officers or agencies who seek to exercise discretionary executive power. </p><p>Wouldn't the special counsel be part of the executive branch? </p><p>RAO: Well, senator, respectfully that is, you know, an ongoing matter of political controversy and also could potentially lead to lawsuits.  And as the judicial nominee, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on those issues. </p><p>COONS: So is it your view that congress can't place any restrictions, even ones that put in statute what are currently regulations that protect a special counsel from removal by the president? </p><p>RAO: Senator, I did not argue that in my--in my--in my articles. I did not-- </p><p>COONS: Would that not seem an obvious and logical conclusion from a view forcefully and repeatedly asserted that the president should be able to remove even the heads of independent agencies? </p><p>RAO: Well, senator, one of the--one of the things that I try to explain in that article is that there are competing interests, right, congress has a lot of important authorities under Article 1 to--to create agencies and to--to set their powers, to set their different authorities and--and that has to be balanced against the presidents--the presidents responsibility for overseeing the executive branch. </p><p>And so--and so that--you know, I recognize in the article congress has important interests in those areas. </p><p>COONS: Well, and I was going to call on Professor Lee, Senator Lee, my colleague previously questioned you about whether or not tyranny results from an overreach administrative state. I would pause it that an equal and comparably valid concern is the tyranny that might result from an overreach executive something, I think was much more at issue in our founding. </p><p>Let me just briefly turn to Morrison V. Olson, a Supreme Court case from 1988 with which I'm sure you're familiar where Justice Scalia, in a single dissent, expounded this unitary executive theory which has gained a credence and followers. You may be at the head of that pack in the decade since it was handed down. Would you agree with me that your theory of unfettered removal power expounded in that 2014 law review article was expressly rejected by the Supreme Court majority in Morrison? Is that not clearly the holding of the case? </p><p>RAO: Well, I think that--that yes, Morrison V. Olson does recognize, you know, some--some important limitations on the presidents removal power. </p><p>COONS: And is Morrison still good law? </p><p>RAO: It has not been overruled. So it is--it is a binding precedent of the Supreme Court which I would follow if I were confirmed. </p><p>COONS: What's the view of the D.C. circuit of Morrison? </p><p>RAO: The D.C. circuit has upheld the validity and recognized that it is still good precedent. </p><p>COONS: How recently? </p><p>RAO: I think quite recently. </p><p>COONS: Quite recently. I think, in fact, last year. And so I'm--I'm troubled, I have to say, not just by that 2014 law review article but by a 2011 law review article where you're going through free enterprise fund versus PCAOB and suggest, and I quote, that \"That Supreme Court opinion strongly suggests statutory limits on the presidents removal power such as those protecting the officers of independent agencies are unconstitutional.\" Let me make sure I get this right. Do you believe that the constitution allows the president to fire, for example, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve whenever he wants, even to influence monetary policy for his own personal or political benefit? </p><p>RAO: Well, senator, again those questions are--are--are ones that the dependent part on the particular statute at issue and the types of protections it provides. And those were comments I made as an academic commentator scholar where I was able to write about the law in the abstract and I very much understand that it's a--it's a completely different rule when one becomes a judge and needs to decide specific cases and controversies according to the law and precedence. </p><p>COONS: Well, Ms. Rao, I think, you know, alarming writings in college aside, I think very recently in law review articles you've laid out clearly and forcefully, a view of executive power so overreaching and so outside the mainstream as to be truly alarming to me, in terms of its potential consequences for the scope and reach of executive control and executive power. And while I respect your refusal to answer directly given some of these things are current controversies, I also have to say in the context we currently find ourselves in, these are no longer merely academic questions. Thank you Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you Senator Coons. Now we finished the first round. I'm going to have depart at 12:15, Senator Blackburn, I think, is going to chair after that and I appreciate that more than you know. We've had Senator Feinstein, Blumenthal, Hirono, Whitehouse and Kennedy request second rounds. So we'll do five minute second rounds and we'll get started. Let's start with Senator Feinstein. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thank you Chairman. Ms. Rao, as I sit here and listen, a--let me tell you what the heart of my concern is, and it goes back to my question which is on recusal. It's my understanding that you have led the Trump Administrations regulatory agenda. You've worked on repealing the clean power plan regulation, repealing protections that address pay discrimination on the basis of race and weakening the CAFE standards that I spoke about. </p><p>Let me tell you how one of your predecessors before this committee responded and that's Mr. Katsas. He was asked the same question and he said, if I were confirmed I would look carefully at the standards for recusal. That was your answer, but what he said was I can commit to recusing myself from any case that I worked on while in the executive branch. Any challenge to presidential or agency action on which I have provided advice. That's the answer that I look for, that you go in as a fresh human being without the bias of a prior workplace and use the talents that you have acquired in a way that only relates to the case before you and its rightness or wrongness legally. </p><p>And you won't make that direct commitment. I want to give you another opportunity to speak in hopes that you will make that direct commit--and that will be--that is that you will recuse yourself from any case that involves something that you worked on as an executive in this administration. </p><p>RAO: Well, as I--as I have said, I think recusal is a very important issue and it's one I would take seriously. You know, the matter of the question of recusal is--is often very fact specific, it depends on the type of case that's brought. I currently oversee regulatory policy which are generally applicable rules. It's somewhat different then a lawyer working in the White House Counsels office proving legal advice. So--so again, I commit to you that I would follow the statutory standards. I would talk to my colleagues and follow the approach that they have used and I would strive to--to be impartial and independent in all of the cases I decide. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, let me just sum that up. What it says to me, in areas that I care very much about that have to do with environmental protection as well as other things, you would not be a positive vote. That's how this comes through to me because you have worked as an executive and unlike people that have come before us for this court, they have said, yes, I will recuse myself. You're not saying that. So I take the--if you don't say it, I assume you will not recuse yourself. With all the mumbo jumbo that you answer the question with, the answer--the--the question is, will you recuse yourself and you will not say yes. </p><p>RAO: I have not said yes, I will not say no. It's something that I'll consider in--in each case as it comes and I think that--that it's important to--to take that seriously, you know, when cases come before me if I'm fortunate enough to be confirmed. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thank you Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Kennedy? </p><p>KENNEDY: Professor, clear something up for me, something my--my esteem colleague Senator Feinstein talked about how--how you'll vote and not vote. You don't know how you're going to vote yet, do you? </p><p>RAO: I--I--I certainly do not. In every case that comes before me, I'd carefully consider the law and the arguments of the parties and--and--and decide cases according to the law. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. Your parents immigrated here from India, is that right professor? </p><p>RAO: That's correct. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. Have you ever been a--a victim of racial discrimination? </p><p>RAO: Yes senator I think there are times where I believe I have been treated differently on the basis of my race. It's not a great feeling. </p><p>KENNEDY: Did--did it happen when you were younger or has it happened when you were an adult? </p><p>RAO: It's hard to say. Yeah, it certainly happened when I was younger. I think we lived in a different time. You know, but I've--you know, my parents also faced different forms of discrimination in the workplace and, you know, you know, I remember them telling me, you know, they went to go eat at a restaurant, you know, once when they were on a road trip and they were told, you know this was in the early 70's, they were told, you know, you can't eat in the dinning room, but we'll put a table for you here out in the hallway. </p><p>You know, so--so those are things that are--are part of the stories I grew up with. But--but I was also encouraged to focus on the positive, right, all of the great things in this country and--and all the opportunities for advancement and all the good people who--who helped my parents along the way. So that was really what I was taught to focus on. </p><p>KENNEDY: Do you think our society has gotten better in terms of appreciating ethnic diversity? </p><p>RAO: Well, I certainly hope so. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah. Do you think--I'm--I'm just curious, do you think it's possible to be racially insensitive without being a racist? I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just--want to know your thoughts? </p><p>RAO: Perhaps, yes. You know. I think sometimes people lack exposure to--to different groups, you know, so there's sometimes lack of understanding-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. </p><p>RAO: --of differences. </p><p>KENNEDY: I'm going to shift gears a second. Can you tell me the difference between an originalist and a textualist? </p><p>RAO: Well, senator, I think originalists look at the text of the Constitution, of course, and then look to see what the original public meaning of those words were at the time the provision of the Constitution was enacted. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay and by public meaning you mean--what do you mean? Do you mean the drafters or the average citizen at that time in our country? </p><p>RAO: Well, I think you know, I think it's usually meant to be a reasonable observer, you know, who was sort of paying attention and--and--and involved in--in thinking about these issues. So kind of a reasonable objective observer at the time. </p><p>KENNEDY: At--at that time, let's say in the late 1700's? </p><p>RAO: Yes, at that time. </p><p>KENNEDY: As opposed -- and so are--are you an originalist? </p><p>RAO: You know senator, I try not to--to put labels on myself-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Sure. </p><p>RAO: --in terms of judicial philosophy. You know, if I've been nominated to a court of appeals I would certainly follow the precedence of the Supreme Court which-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Right. </p><p>RAO: --which often look at the original public meaning of--of constitutional provisions. </p><p>KENNEDY: Ok. If--if an originalist interprets the constitution based on the public meaning, as you put it, or the meaning to the average person at the time the constitution was adopted. Ho--how--do you think the average person at that time, when the constitution was adopted, believed in, I don't know, desegregated schools? </p><p>RAO: Well, senator, you know it's not necessarily what they intended, you know, the words would have meant it's--it's what those words could fairly be taken to mean. So for in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment the--the drafters of that used the very broad language of equal protection of the laws which you know, regardless of what their intentions were, they--they used this very sweeping language which has been a tremendous promise. </p><p>KENNEDY: But--but this is what troubles me, I'm not saying I disagree with it, I'm just seeing how you reconcile it in your mind. We're supposed to--if you're an originalist you interpret the constitution as understood by the average American at that time, right? Okay. Do you believe that the average American at that time believed in integrated schools? </p><p>RAO: You know, I--I--I don't know. They may not have but--but they may have had an understanding of the meaning of the word equality. </p><p>KENNEDY: Right. </p><p>RAO: Which was to treat people the same even if they did not-- </p><p>KENNEDY: That's a good point. </p><p>RAO: --even if they did not-- </p><p>KENNEDY: It's a good point. </p><p>RAO: --even if they did not believe that segregated schools was a violation of equality, they would have had an understanding that equal means treating people the same. And--and you know, and that--that promise has been carried forward in our history and a series of important cases by the Supreme Court. </p><p>KENNEDY: That was good. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thanks Mr. Chairman and thanks for the second round. I want to come back to this idea of the unitary executive theory and what you've said and written about it because I think it is an issue of paramount importance at this moment in our history and I am deeply disturbed by views that certainly create the impression of your belief in an imperial presidency to use the colloquial term. Not a law review article but in an interview you did with Hugh--Hugh--Hugh Hewitt, December 15, 2017, just a little more than a year ago. He asked you about the authority of the president to direct or fire the attorney general or the deputy attorney general, his special counsel. And he said, everybody who is not an independent agency answer the president and therefore the president can direct them how to act. Can he not? Your response, that is certainly true. </p><p>Do you believe that the president can fire Robert Mueller, special counsel, or direct the attorney general to fire him? </p><p>RAO: Well, Senator Blumenthal, the--the context of those comments, again, were in the administrative context, the civil context of administrative agencies-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, he was referring to this special counsel. </p><p>RAO: Well, you know, I was--I was on that show to talk about regulatory reform and--and that question came up but--but those--the question you've posed is one that-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Let me ask you, as you sit here, do you believe that the president of the United States can fire the special counsel or direct the attorney general to fire him? </p><p>RAO: Well, senator, those are--those are questions that are in--in active political debate and may well come before me if I were to be confirmed as a judge and so it would not be appropriate for me to comment on them. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, I--I know that you've been reminded of your comment about, and I'm quoting senators as important but highly predictable questions and the nominee is coached to choose from certain stock answers, and I know you're giving a stock answer but let me ask you then, in light of your past comments, would you recuse yourself from that question if it came before your court, since you've already expressed your views on it? </p><p>RAO: Senator, I am not sure that I have expressed my views on that subject, respectfully, and--and again, with--I would take recusal seriously and, again, apply the statutory and other standards that are--that are relevant there. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Let me move to another topic. You believe Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided? </p><p>RAO: Senator Brown is a--is a really important precedent of the Supreme Court and--and one that overturned Plessy v. Ferguson which, you know, was a--was a real black mark in our history. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: So you believe it was correctly decided? </p><p>RAO: Yeah senator, as--as a judicial nominee, I think it's not appropriate for me to comment on the correctness of particular precedence. I would faithfully follow them if I'm confirmed. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Do you believe that Griswold v. Con--Connecticut was correctly decided? </p><p>RAO: Again, senator, that's a--that's a precedent of the Supreme Court which I would--which I would follow. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: How about Roe v. Wade? </p><p>RAO: The same thing. It's--it's a longstanding precedent of the Supreme Court which I would--which I would follow if confirmed. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, you know, I am struck by someone who has said that you were a victim of discrimination, very unjustly and unjustifiably and yet you're unwilling to say that Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided. </p><p>RAO: Well, I've--I--it's an incredibly important decision of the Supreme Court but--but again, it's--it's just-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, Plessy v. Ferguson was a very important decision of the Supreme Court but it was wrong. </p><p>RAO: And it was overruled--and it was overruled by Brown. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: So that's why I'm giving you the opportunity to tell us you think Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided. </p><p>RAO: It's--it's an important and longstanding precedent of the Supreme Court which I would follow. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: So it could be overruled too. </p><p>RAO: I--I--senator, it's hard for me to imagine any circumstance in which Brown v. Board would be overruled by the Supreme Court. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: It's hard to imagine but I'm asking you to state that you believe it was correctly decided. </p><p>RAO: Again, senator, you know, it's--it's a very important precedent of the Supreme Court. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Senator Hirono, you're recognized. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. Senator Coons submitted for the record a letter from the South Asian American Women Group who are civil and human rights lawyers, law professors and advocates of survivors of violence some of whom I believe are in the audience today. And that number has grown from 54 that Senator Coons mentioned to 65 signatories and I would like to read from a part of their letter. </p><p>And quoting in their letter, \"We firmly believe in the importance of a diverse federal judiciary and it is not lost upon us that if confirmed, Neomi Rao would be the first South Asian American women to sit on a federal appellate court. However, we are deeply alarmed by Neomi Rao's record, particularly around gender rights and we do not believe that she will bring independence and fairness to the federal bench,\" end quote. </p><p>Ms. Rao, in--in 2017 you claimed that in Fiscal Year 2017 the administration had taken 860 deregulatory actions and withdrew or delayed more than 1500 planned rules. For Fiscal Year 2018 you proudly said the administrations deregulatory actions quoting you, saved American families and businesses $23 billion. As OIRA administrator, you noted that the administration is considering lower the CAFE standards and the vehicle admission standards. Will lowering these standards save businesses money? </p><p>RAO: You know senator, there are--there are a number of--of costs and benefits to that proposed rule which have been--were noted by the agencies and it's a--it's a very complex regulatory scheme. </p><p>HIRONO: Well, you said that of these regulatory decisions, previous regulatory decisions, then the one that you're contemplating, saved a lot of money. I--I would say that lowering the CAFE standards would save businesses money. Next question, the administration is also trying to loosen Greenhouse gas emission limits from power plants. Will loosening these standards save businesses money? </p><p>RAO: Senator, when--when agencies propose regulations they look at a whole range of cost and benefits and--and the idea is to put forward regulations whether they're regulatory or deregulatory that have net benefits for the public. So, you know, in this administration when we're pulling back regulations, that's when pulling back the regulation will have more benefits to the American people than costs. </p><p>HIRONO: Well, you obviously have information on the cost savings to--to businesses, so going back to the $23 billion you mentioned, how much of that $23 billion was money saved by businesses versus families? </p><p>RAO: You know senator, we don't--we don't necessarily calculate it that way but a lot of the beneficiaries of regulatory reform have been--have been small businesses, small fisherman, farmers and individuals. So, you know, there are a range of benefits that extend over--over wide swats of the-- </p><p>HIRONO: So since--since I assume that you had a factual basis for the $23 billion, would you be willing to submit to the--to this committee or, certainly to me, a breakdown of who saved $23 billion that you mentioned? </p><p>RAO: Well, senator, we've tried to be very transparent about how we've calculated this. There is probably more information than you'd like on our--on our Website about how those numbers were calculated, which rules-- </p><p>HIRONO: So your Website will enable me to--to determine how much of the $23 billion was saved by business, whether large or small versus families? </p><p>RAO: Well, I think yes, going to the underlying rules will--will-- </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. </p><p>RAO: --give you some of that information. </p><p>HIRONO: I want to get to LGBTQ rights. As a lawyer, you wrote negatively about two Supreme Court decisions that affirm the rights of the LGBTQ individuals. In 2008 you criticized Lawrence v. Texas where the Supreme Court invalidated a Texas sodomy law for ignoring traditional constitution analysis. In 2013 you argued that the US v. Windsor, which struck down the defense of Marriage Act was effectively a political choice to, you favor recognition of one groups claims over another. And under your watch as OIRA administrator, the Trump Administration has sought to reverse regulatory protections for LGBT key--LGBTQ individuals in schools, the military and in healthcare. </p><p>So, there is ample evidence that you have consistent--you have a consistent pattern of--with regard to the rights of LGBTQ individuals and protections for them. So, what evidence is there that LGBTQ litigants can trust that you will fully follow Supreme Court precedent protecting their rights instead of chipping away at them based on your prior expressed views. And I realize that there's some Supreme Court precedents and you can--you can apply them but you know, just as in Roe v. Wade, which I doubt will be not overturned, those protections are being chipped away. So you know, what--what kind of reassurance can you give to LGBTQ litigants that you can view their--their rights in any lawsuits that involve them in a--in a way that will protect those rights? </p><p>RAO: Well--well senator, I think it's very important to respect the equal dignity of all--of all individuals and if I were to be confirmed I would work to uphold the equal protection of the laws and faithfully follow the precedence of the Supreme Court. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Gentlelady's time has expired. Ms. Rao we thank you for being with us today and for sitting through all the questioning and thank you for your service to our country and for your desire to serve our nation. I can say for me, I look forward to voting for you and we thank you for your time today and you are dismissed from the committee. We will stand in a momentary recess while we reset the table. </p><p>RAO: Thank you very much. </p><p>BLACKBURN: And we will come before us, Professor Aditya Bamzai, am I saying that properly? </p><p>BAMZAI: That's correct senator. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you. And Mr. Travis Leblanc. And, Professor Bamzai, to be a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and Mr. Lablanc also to be a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. And I thank you all for your willingness to serve and for the excellent resumes that you bring to your desire for public service. </p><p>At this time, I want to ask each of you to stand and be sworn in. Okay. Do you affirm that the testimony you are about to give before the committee is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>At this time, Professor Bamzai we'll begin with you for your brief opening and introduction. </p><p>BAMZAI: Thank you Senator Blackburn, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. Thank you for your consideration and your time. It's an honor to be nominated to be a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. Preserving appropriate checks and balances in our effort to protect the nations security is one of the central challenges of our time. </p><p>The board plays a key role in helping to ensure that the antiterrorism efforts of law enforcement and intelligence agencies are consistent with the protection of privacy and civil liberties. In the past, in my own career, I've had the opportunity to work on such issues as an attorney in the Department of Justice and two administrations of different political parties. If confirmed as a member of the board, I hope to bring that background and expertise to bear on the challenging and technical issues that the board confronts. I am committed to approaching the boards work in an independent, nonpartisan and objective fashion. </p><p>I'd like to thank my wife and two children who could not be here and my father and my mother. My mother sits behind me. 28 years ago my parents packed their belongings into suitcases and moved us from another country to a motel not too far from here at the intersection of Routes 236 and 50 in Virginia. Quite literally I would not be here today but for their courage, guidance and sacrifices. Thanks again for considering my nomination. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Ms. LeBlanc, you're recognized. </p><p>LEBLANC: Senator Blackburn, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee, thank you for your consideration. It is an honor and privilege to be nominated to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. I would not be here today without the support of my family, friends, teachers, mentors and colleagues. It is not lost on me this morning that, if confirmed, Aditya and I would be the first people of color presidentially appointed to the board. </p><p>I am therefore grateful to the many giants throughout our shared history who have knocked down the barriers that make it possible for me to here today before all of you. While I cannot acknowledge all of those who have made it possible for me to be here, I would like to specially recognize a few people. </p><p>First is Senator Harris, for whom I had the honor of serving with when she was the Attorney General of the great state of California. Everything I cherish about serving the people I learned from Senator Harris. She ensured that we approached our work as prosecutors with decency, compassion and a sense of purpose and everyday that I wake up yearning to make our world a better place, I am reminded of, and inspired by, the spirit, dedication and courage of Senator Harris. </p><p>While my professional relationships are special, my familial bonds are divine. I would be remiss if I did not express my profound gratitude to my life partner and our four-year old daughter who are here with me today as well as my mother Theral (SP), brother Brandon (SP) and all my family watching from my home in the Southlands fairest city, New Orleans. </p><p>Senator Blackburn, if I may take a point of personal privilege, I also feel compelled today to acknowledge the New Orleans Saints who many believe were wrongfully denied a Super Bowl appearance on Sunday. I don't pretend to suggest that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board has any jurisdiction over the National Football League, but if I learned anything from the NFC championship game this year, it's that those people who are charged with enforcing the rules sometimes need the advice and oversight of independent observers. </p><p>The Privacy and Lib--Civil Liberties Oversight Board is just such an independent advisor and observer. The board is charged with balancing the governments efforts to protect terrorism with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties. As we all know, these are dangerous times. The threats posed to America by its enemies, both foreign and domestic, are very ru--real and they are very serious. At the same time, however, the failure to consider the implications of our security policies on privacy and civil liberties may, itself, threaten our nations security. </p><p>The PCLOB's twin functions; oversight and advice, reflect the wise judgment of congress about how to best balance security and privacy in the modern world. If I am fortunate enough to be confirmed as a member of the PCLOB, I will bring an independent and open mind to the board. I will seek the views of all stakeholders, I will work tirelessly to ensure that my work reflects rigorous and thorough consideration of all information available to me and I pledge that I will embody the bipartisan spirit of the PCLOB. As this committee knows, security, privacy and civil liberties are American issues, not partisan ones. Thank you for your time today. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you Mr. LeBlanc. Professor Bamzai, I want to start with you and discuss China and some of the concerns that we have with China as they have really sought to disadvantage American companies. They've stolen technology, there is a lot of piracy that we deal with. I've got a lot of entertainers and innovators in Nashville that are dealing with them regularly and last month the Justice Department really unleashed some indictments on Chinese telecom maker, Huawei who some of us have followed some of their actions and misdeeds for years and went after them for stealing some of the trade secrets from T-Mobile. Right now we are demanding extradition of a Huawei executive to stand trial. </p><p>President Trump is encouraging other countries to block Huawei from supplying some of the 5G equipment that is coming into the marketplace. And he's doing this because of security risk. So, what do these criminal indictments foreshadow about the threats Chinese tech and telecom companies pose to American security? </p><p>BAMZAI: Senator Blackburn, thank you for the question. So I'm aware of the episodes that you've narrated just over the last few moments from the news and other sources of that nature. Of course, the government itself has more information on these types of issues and if I were lucky enough to be confirmed to the board along with my fellow board members, I would look to see how the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board could bring its expertise to bear on the types of issues where we would be most useful to both the intelligence community and this chamber, the congress generally and the American public. And I'd be happy to take those types of considerations, this issue, into account during my service on the board. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Excellent. Okay. Mr. LeBlanc, the big tech and their privacy violations compound every single day. There is a new story nearly everyday. Last week, Apple temporarily banned Facebook and Google from distributing apps that violated Apples privacy guidelines. Facebook apps targeted children as young as 13, luring them through Instagram and Snapchat ads offering $20.00 to have access to their iPhone data. The app allowed Facebook to track the users app history, private messages, location data and as a mom and a grandmother, I tell you what, some of these privacy violations, to me, are so offensive and I do see them as a threat to our children and their security. </p><p>But let me ask you this, you've got a precious daughter who is here with you today and what other precautions should be in place to protect consumers both young and old from falling victim to some of these privacy violations? </p><p>LEBLANC: Thank you very much for that question senator. I am very well and have followed your own work in the House when you were working on issues around privacy and emerging technologies and social media. In my view, one of the biggest challenges that we face in the United States right now is that we don't have baseline federal privacy legislation. It does appear as if there is a desire, right now, across industry, across consumer groups, across federal and state governments as well as across party lines for some kind of protections to be put in place as a matter of law. </p><p>If, in my view, for my daughters sake, for the sake of the future, I think that having some common baseline federal privacy legislation would be helpful there. I am mindful, however, that the jurisdiction of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board is limited in the role that we have with respect to protecting the privacy of--of the people. I will work with my fellow board members to ensure that we can take every step within our power to main sure--to maintain the balance between protecting security and also ensuring the privacy and civil liberties of the people. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Would you take the same approach to data security, because data breaches, since 2013, have been rampant and have affected millions of Americans. You look at just last year when you had Dunkin Donuts and Under Armour and Marriott Hotels and information that was out there and the need for some data. Do you back the need for data security legislation in breach notification preemption? </p><p>LEBLANC: It's a very good question, I will start by saying it's a bit outside of the jurisdiction of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. I am pleased that 50 states in the United States now have data breach notification laws. The question of whether or not there should also be a federal one is one that's left to the wise judgment of congress at this point to decide on that but there is but there is no doubt that the number of breaches have gone up over the last few years. The breaches themselves are getting bigger and at the end of the day a large number of these seem to be resulting from foreign nation states that are attacking American companies and American individuals. </p><p>I think it's important, and it would be good for us as a society to begin to examine what protections we can also help put in place to protect American businesses and individuals from foreign nation states engaging in cyber attacks on them. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you. Senator Feinstein? </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much Madam Chairman. Welcome gentlemen. I'm going to ask one question. Three provisions of the foreign intelligence surveillance act, the Lone Wolf Provision, roving wiretaps and certain expansions of what's called the Business Records Provisions are scheduled to sunset on December 15 of 2019. I have set, and been chairman and vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee. These are important provisions. </p><p>The board you're going on, which we call the P-club, has often been very helpful in providing advice to the committee. Have you taken a look at these three issues? We are expected, the congress is, to consider an extension of some or all of these three provisions next year. If you have thoughts, would you express them? If you don't, would you look into that? </p><p>BAMZAI: Senator Feinstein-- </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Please go ahead Bamzai. </p><p>BAMZAI: --it's a very important issue. And a--I think I'm very familiar with the set of considerations from the USA Freedom Act that was enacted in-- </p><p>FEINSTEIN: That's right. </p><p>BAMZAI: --2015 which is due now to sunset in 2019. And, as you well know, from your service on the intelligence committee, the propriety or even the legality of programs of this nature depend very much on the facts and circumstances. So if I were lucky enough to be confirmed, what I would want to do immediately is to provide some sort of product to the members of this body so that they could--it would--it would helpfully inform them in the debates that are to come about the reauthorization of that bill along with, of course, a--an understanding that it--it would be my board members and I to gather making those kinds of decisions. </p><p>But I--I completely agree with you, these are very important debates. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thank you. Mr. LaBlanc, you have a-- </p><p>LEBLANC: Thank you for the question Senator Feinstein. Like Aditya, I too am familiar with these provisions. I'm also aware that the USA Freedom Act will sunset in December of this year. I--I don't right now have the benefit of classified information in order to evaluate whether or not these programs have been successful or not. I do pledge that if confirmed to the board, I will keep you fully and currently informed and I do hope that along with my other board members we would examine these issues so that we can be available to congress, as you consider this very important decision later this year. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thank you very much. That does it for me Madam Chairman. Thank you both for your willingness to serve. It's appreciated, thank you. </p><p>BLACKBURN: And there being no additional members who are in the room for questions, we will remind all senators that the record will remain open until 5:00 on February 6 for additional questions. And we ask for your prompt response to those questions. At this time, the hearing stands adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VF0-WF11-F15W-H1KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Our CEO, Brendan Eich, is the inventor of JavaScript, the most popular programming language in the world. He also co-founded Firefox, and built it into one of the world's most popular browsers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Brave is headquartered in San Francisco and we have staff in 17 states. The number of people using our browser grew 600 percent last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"So what I am about to say might surprise you. We view the GDPR as a great leveller. It can establish the conditions to allow young, innovative companies like ours to flourish.1</p><p>\"Today, big tech companies create cascading monopolies by leveraging users' data from one line of business to dominate other lines of business too.2 This hurts nascent competitors, stifles innovation and reduces consumer choice.3</p><p>\"However, two elements in the GDPR can fix this - if they are enforced.</p><p>\"First, Article 5(1)(b), is the \"purpose limitation\" principle,4 which ring fences personal data held by companies so they can't use it outside of consumer expectations. They need a legal basis for each data processing purpose.5</p><p>\"Second, Article 7 (3) requires that an opt-in must be as easy to undo as it was to give in the first place, and that people can do so without detriment.</p><p>\"Once this is enforced, consent messages/6 will become far less annoying in Europe - because if a company insists on harassing you to opt in, and you finally click OK, it will be required to keep reminding you that you can opt back out again.7</p><p>\"These two GDPR tools, the \"purpose limitation principle\", plus the ease of withdrawal of consent, enable freedom. Freedom for the market of users to softly \"break up\" - and \"un-break up\" - big tech companies by deciding what personal data can be used for.</p><p>\"Senators, the GDPR is risk based. That means Big Tech that creates big risks get big scrutiny and potentially big penalties. Regulators are only starting to enforce the GDPR and it will take years to have full effect. But already, things are looking bleak for our colleagues at Google and Facebook.</p><p>\"Their year-over-year growth declined steadily in Europe since the GDPR8 - despite a buoyant advertising market. They face multiple investigations and it is very likely that they will be forced to change how they do business. (Google's consent has already been ruled invalid.9) And things are even bleaker for other tracking companies, that don't have a search business to fall back on, as Google does.</p><p>\"Whereas -- we hear anecdotally that publishers are doing better than before! Lax privacy law hasn't helped publishers.</p><p>\"Let me tell you what happens almost every single time you visit a website: data about you is broadcast to tens or hundreds of companies, which lets advertisers compete for the opportunity to show you an ad.10</p><p>\"Advertising is necessary, and this sounds OK.</p><p>\"But wait until you hear what information about you is in that big broadcast: it can include your - inferred - sexual orientation, political views, whether you are Christian, Jewish, or Muslim, etc., whether you have AIDS, erectile disfunction, or bi-polar disorder.11 It includes what you are reading, watching, and listening to.12 It includes your location, sometimes right up to your exact GPS coordinates.13 And it includes unique ID codes that are as specific to you as is your social security number, so that all of this data can be tied to you over time.14 This allows companies you have never heard of to maintain intimate profiles on you, and on everyone you have ever known.15</p><p>\"This is not necessary for smart advertising. The latest research shows that this profiling nets publishers only zero point zero zero zero zero eight of a dollar extra per ad.16 That's only an extra 4% revenue!</p><p>\"Whereas \"contextual\" ads, which don't broadcast your intimate details, would save publishers 55 to 70 percent in \"adtech tax\",17 and avoid having their audiences bought cheaper elsewhere. Advertisers would also recover billions per year from \"ad bot fraud\" - though few realize this.18 Privacy law will help the digital advertising ecosystem.</p><p>\"Let me conclude by urging you to enact strong privacy rules so that a healthy marketplace can develop. Give consumers freedom to choose the companies and services they want to reward.</p><p>\"The GDPR is based largely on American principles. We urge you to bring them home.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1 See Brave to National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Docket No. 180821780- 8780-01 (Privacy RFC), 5 November 2018 (URL: <url normalizedValue=\"https://brave.com/ntia-federal-privacy-law/);\">https://brave.com/ntia-federal-privacy-law/);</url> see also Brave to Federal Trade Commission, Docket FTC-2018-0100, 7 January 2019 (URL:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://brave.com/brave-ftc-jan-2019/);\">https://brave.com/brave-ftc-jan-2019/);</url> and Brendan Eich to Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 1 October 2018 (URL:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://brave.com/us-gdpr-senate/\">https://brave.com/us-gdpr-senate/</url>).</p><p>2 The cross-use of data between different lines of business is analogous to the tying of two products. Indeed, tying and cross-use of data can occur at the same time, as Google Chrome's latest \"auto sign in to everything\" controversy illustrates. 3 Competition authorities in other jurisdictions have addressed this matter. As early as 2010, France's Autorite de la concurrence highlighted the topic (in Opinion 10-A-13 on the cross-usage of customer databases). In 2015, Belgium's regulator fined the Belgian National Lottery for reusing personal information acquired through its monopoly for a different, and incompatible, line of business.</p><p>4 As with many of the principles of the GDPR, this is based on the FIPPs of the 1974 US Privacy Act.</p><p>5 Consider for example the act of posting a photo on the Facebook Newsfeed for the first time. The distinct processing purposes involved might be something like the following list. The person posting the photo is only interested only the first four or five of these purposes. If purpose limitation is enforced, Facebook will be very vulnerable: - To display your posts on your Newsfeed. - To display posts on tagged friends' Newsfeeds. - To display friends posts that tag you on your Newsfeed. - To identify untagged people in your posts. - To record your reaction to posts to refine future content for you, which may include ethnicity, politics, sexuality, etc..., to make our Newsfeed more relevant to you. - To record your reaction to posts to refine future content for you, which may include ethnicity, politics, sexuality, etc..., to make ads relevant to you. - To record your reaction to posts to refine future content for you, which may include ethnicity, politics, sexuality, etc..., for advertising fraud prevention.</p><p>6 It does not necessarily matter what a person clicks on when shown one of the industry's \"consent notices\", because there is no technical security measure to prevent these companies from sharing the data with their business partners under the table. For this - and other reasons - the consent system that the industry came up with is itself under investigation for infringing the GDPR.

For an indication of the scale of this problem, Google DoubleClick/Authorized Buyers is the largest \"advertising exchange\" involved in the \"real time bidding\" industry that conducts these broadcasts. It is installed on 8.4+ million websites and broadcasts personal data about visitors to these sites to 2,000+ companies.

Professor Acquisti of Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, revealed that the results recently at the Chicago Booth School Stigler Centre 2019 Antitrust and Competition Conference.</p><p>17 The 70% figure is from The Guardian's case against a major adtech company in 2017. To gather evidence, The Guardian masqueraded as an advertiser and bought ads on its own website. For every dollar that The Guardian spent as an advertiser, it received only 30c as a publisher. The publisher got 30%, adtech took 70%. This is known as the ad tech tax. The 55% figure is from \"The Programmatic Supply Chain: Deconstructing the Anatomy of a Programmatic CPM\", IAB, March 2016.</p><p>18 For example, at least $5.8 billion of their spend is stolen by \"ad fraud\" or \"bot fraud\" criminals.

The panel and representatives from Apple and Facebook debated end-to-encryption during a Tuesday hearing, at which law enforcement slammed Apple's decision in 2014 to engineer devices in a way that effectively blocks police access.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told us he understands that industry is trying to protect consumer privacy, and that if a company weakens its devices, users may gravitate toward foreign services. But, he said, \"You've just got to find a way to accommodate a warrant.\"</p><p>Citing the deadly 2015 San Bernardino mass shooting, in which police were denied lawful access to an Apple device that was evidence, ranking member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said during the hearing that police require \"vital access\" to such evidence at the scene of a crime. She noted police are able to contract third parties to access information on an encrypted phone, but the cost, based on classified briefings, is \"obnoxiously high.\"</p><p>Hopefully there will be voluntary cooperation to give police better access, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told us. A product designed to impair lawful access to data necessary for public safety is a real threat that must be countered, he said.</p><p>If providers don't find a way to more consistently cooperate with law enforcement, \"it's probably going to be at their own peril in terms of legislative action,\" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told us. An industry agreement with law enforcement is a better scenario than Congress delivering a response that might not keep pace with technology, he said.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told reporters Congress shouldn't rush to legislation. He wasn't convinced back doors won't make consumer data susceptible to a lot of other bad actors, and foreign entities like China, he said.</p><p>Until fall 2014, Apple and Google \"routinely provided\" police access to mobile phones when a court ordered a warrant for police investigation, testified New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance. But encryption for new operating systems made the companies' phones completely inaccessible, upending centuries of jurisprudence, he said. Google didn't comment.</p><p>Apple doesn't have a method for allowing the good guys to access encrypted data without also exposing that information to bad actors, said Apple User Privacy Manager Erik Neuenschwander. Encryption is the underlying technology for all IT security systems, and it will only grow in need as more devices are added to the internet, he said. Blumenthal told us the company has the expertise to deliver a solution for police, but it's a question of willingness.</p><p>Facebook believes consumers, journalists and others should be able to communicate freely without the threat of bad actors or oppressive regimes accessing the information through back doors, said Messenger Product Management Director-Privacy and Integrity Jay Sullivan. If the U.S. rolls back existing privacy regimes in the U.S., foreign entities will fill the gaps from services formerly offered by U.S. companies like Facebook, he said.</p><p>Neuenschwander said before iOS 7 most data on Apple phones wasn't encrypted, so the company freely turned that data over to law enforcement when investigations deemed it necessary. The company sealed that gap by encrypting all data to prevent access by harmful entities.</p><p>If Apple and Google haven't provided a solution for police to access information that's vital in police investigations \"this time next year,\" Congress will \"impose its will on you,\" Graham said. Feinstein asked if it's accurate that police can't access the Apple data, even with a warrant. It's not a question of a warrant because Apple doesn't have the ability to access the encrypted data on a user's phone, said Neuenschwander. Apple has evaluated techniques for changing that but hasn't found a way to allow police access without weakening encryption for everyone, he said.</p><p>Apple doesn't have access because it engineered its phones that way, said Vance. The company made that decision without any intervention from Congress or police, and it can reverse it, he said. Without the threat of legislation, the two sides won't come to an agreement, he argued. Without external regulation on device encryption, there's no incentive for big tech to engage in a debate, said University of Texas-Austin professor Matt Tait. If regulation threatened court-ordered access, companies would be competing to find the most secure way to deliver, said Tait. Without regulation, there's no incentive to weaken yourself from a competitive standpoint</p><p>It's clear encryption is a positive thing, but the issue is lawful U.S. government access to vital evidence \"protecting our citizens from trafficking and sex abuse,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. A private company shouldn't have the ability to unilaterally decide whether police can access evidence with a warrant, said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas: \"Everybody needs to follow lawful court orders. ... This seems like a race to the bottom.\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., slammed Apple, saying if it continues down the road of unbreachable encryption, it must accept the consequences, such as loss of life resulting from law enforcement's inability to access vital data.</p><p>Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked whether Apple can provide back-door access without the potential for personal data breaches. Apple's experience is that the \"bad guys\" exploit any weaknesses in security systems, said Neuenschwander.</p><p>Big tech now enjoys nearly complete immunity from legal responsibility under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, said Blumenthal. That will end, because Americans are losing patience, he said. That immunity will be short-lived if big tech doesn't better honor its responsibilities, he said.</p><p>The government should abandon efforts to get Facebook to forgo its plans of deploying end-to-end encryption across its messaging services, more than 100 civil society and industry groups wrote law enforcement in the U.S., U.K. and Australia Tuesday.

The panel and representatives from Apple and Facebook debated end-to-encryption during a Tuesday hearing, at which law enforcement slammed Apple's decision in 2014 to engineer devices in a way that effectively blocks police access.</p><p>Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told us he understands that industry is trying to protect consumer privacy, and that if a company weakens its devices, users may gravitate toward foreign services. But, he said, \"You've just got to find a way to accommodate a warrant.\"</p><p>Citing the deadly 2015 San Bernardino mass shooting, in which police were denied lawful access to an Apple device that was evidence, ranking member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said during the hearing that police require \"vital access\" to such evidence at the scene of a crime. She noted police are able to contract third parties to access information on an encrypted phone, but the cost, based on classified briefings, is \"obnoxiously high.\"</p><p>Hopefully there will be voluntary cooperation to give police better access, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told us. A product designed to impair lawful access to data necessary for public safety is a real threat that must be countered, he said.</p><p>If providers don't find a way to more consistently cooperate with law enforcement, \"it's probably going to be at their own peril in terms of legislative action,\" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told us. An industry agreement with law enforcement is a better scenario than Congress delivering a response that might not keep pace with technology, he said.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told reporters Congress shouldn't rush to legislation. He wasn't convinced back doors won't make consumer data susceptible to a lot of other bad actors, and foreign entities like China, he said.</p><p>Until fall 2014, Apple and Google \"routinely provided\" police access to mobile phones when a court ordered a warrant for police investigation, testified New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance. But encryption for new operating systems made the companies' phones completely inaccessible, upending centuries of jurisprudence, he said. Google didn't comment.</p><p>Apple doesn't have a method for allowing the good guys to access encrypted data without also exposing that information to bad actors, said Apple User Privacy Manager Erik Neuenschwander. Encryption is the underlying technology for all IT security systems, and it will only grow in need as more devices are added to the internet, he said. Blumenthal told us the company has the expertise to deliver a solution for police, but it's a question of willingness.</p><p>Facebook believes consumers, journalists and others should be able to communicate freely without the threat of bad actors or oppressive regimes accessing the information through back doors, said Messenger Product Management Director-Privacy and Integrity Jay Sullivan. If the U.S. rolls back existing privacy regimes in the U.S., foreign entities will fill the gaps from services formerly offered by U.S. companies like Facebook, he said.</p><p>Neuenschwander said before iOS 7 most data on Apple phones wasn't encrypted, so the company freely turned that data over to law enforcement when investigations deemed it necessary. The company sealed that gap by encrypting all data to prevent access by harmful entities.</p><p>If Apple and Google haven't provided a solution for police to access information that's vital in police investigations \"this time next year,\" Congress will \"impose its will on you,\" Graham said. Feinstein asked if it's accurate that police can't access the Apple data, even with a warrant. It's not a question of a warrant because Apple doesn't have the ability to access the encrypted data on a user's phone, said Neuenschwander. Apple has evaluated techniques for changing that but hasn't found a way to allow police access without weakening encryption for everyone, he said.</p><p>Apple doesn't have access because it engineered its phones that way, said Vance. The company made that decision without any intervention from Congress or police, and it can reverse it, he said. Without the threat of legislation, the two sides won't come to an agreement, he argued. Without external regulation on device encryption, there's no incentive for big tech to engage in a debate, said University of Texas-Austin professor Matt Tait. If regulation threatened court-ordered access, companies would be competing to find the most secure way to deliver, said Tait. Without regulation, there's no incentive to weaken yourself from a competitive standpoint</p><p>It's clear encryption is a positive thing, but the issue is lawful U.S. government access to vital evidence \"protecting our citizens from trafficking and sex abuse,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. A private company shouldn't have the ability to unilaterally decide whether police can access evidence with a warrant, said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas: \"Everybody needs to follow lawful court orders. ... This seems like a race to the bottom.\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., slammed Apple, saying if it continues down the road of unbreachable encryption, it must accept the consequences, such as loss of life resulting from law enforcement's inability to access vital data.</p><p>Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked whether Apple can provide back-door access without the potential for personal data breaches. Apple's experience is that the \"bad guys\" exploit any weaknesses in security systems, said Neuenschwander.</p><p>Big tech now enjoys nearly complete immunity from legal responsibility under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, said Blumenthal. That will end, because Americans are losing patience, he said. That immunity will be short-lived if big tech doesn't better honor its responsibilities, he said.</p><p>The government should abandon efforts to get Facebook to forgo its plans of deploying end-to-end encryption across its messaging services, more than 100 civil society and industry groups wrote law enforcement in the U.S., U.K. and Australia Tuesday.

AAI is an independent, nonprofit organization devoted to promoting competition that protects consumers, businesses, and society. We serve the public through research, education, and advocacy on the benefits of competition and the use of antitrust enforcement as a vital component of national and international competition policy. As the leading progressive organization dedicated to promoting competition, AAI is pleased that lawmakers in the U.S. Senate have turned their attention to the questions surrounding antitrust enforcement and competition policy in the digital technology sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I. Introduction</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The term \"Big Tech\" is often used to describe the five largest multinational online service or computer hardware and software companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. These companies hold the top slots, by market value, for all publicly traded firms.</p><p>\"The growth of Big Tech over the past three decades is a function of forces ranging from network effects and winner-take-all markets, to organic growth resulting from innovative business models and technologies, and expansion through serial acquisitions of nascent or potential rivals.</p><p>\"AAI recently analyzed several decades of enforcement data for a major category of commerce involving the digital technology industry. Detailed analysis and references are contained in the White Paper THE WEAK RECORD OF MERGER ENFORCEMENT IN BIG TECH. We compared sector-specific enforcement statistics with those across all sectors, as reported in the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Hart Scott Rodino (HSR) Annual Reports to Congress. AAI's analysis reveals that the DOJ and FTC have more intensely scrutinized transactions in the digital technology sectors than the average across all sectors. However, the agencies' rate of merger challenges in federal court is far lower than the all-sector average.</p><p>\"The \"weak\" record of U.S. merger enforcement prompts a number of questions and potential concerns. My testimony today will (1) briefly describe the record of merger enforcement in digital technology markets; (2) explore the likely reasons why enforcement might be weak; and (3) suggest potential ways to invigorate antitrust enforcement, for the benefit of competition, consumers, and innovation.</p><p>II. Big Tech Ecosystems</p><p>\"Digital technology firms have been described as encompassing online ecosystems of exchange and collaboration, through which myriad services are available to intermediate and end users. These include business-to-consumer (B2C) markets such as search, news and content, video, advertising, social networking, locational services, and online retail. Digital technology firms also draw from a common set of inputs, ranging from software, business intelligence, and artificial intelligence. Many of these products and services are exchanged in business-to-business (B2B) markets. Some digital technology companies feature a \"platform,\" or set of technologies with which other technologies, applications, or processes interoperate. Several digital technology firms also feature multi-sided exchanges or markets that bring together providers and/or users of services, in which the platform owners themselves compete against independent rivals.</p><p>III. Acquisitions Have Increased Rapidly Since 2005</p><p>\"As shown in the figure below, the Big Tech firms made over 700 acquisitions of nascent or potential rivals in the last 32 years or, on average, over 20 acquisitions per year. One cycle of acquisitions began in 2005, peaked in 2007, and ended in 2009. A much bigger cycle began in 2010, peaked in 2014-15, and appears to be in decline. The average annual rate of increase in acquisitions over the entire period 1987-2018 is almost 20% per year.</p><p>View table at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/09/24/2019/moss-testimony\">https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/09/24/2019/moss-testimony</url></p><p>\"As shown in the table below, between 1987 and mid-2019, Google accounts for the largest percentage of total acquisitions (32%), averaging about 13 acquisitions per year. This is followed by Microsoft, with 31% of total transactions and seven acquisitions per year; Apple with 15% of the total and about three acquisitions per year; and Amazon and Facebook, each with about 11% of total transactions and about four and seven acquisitions per year, respectively.</p><p>IV. The Rate of Merger Challenges in a Digital Technology is Much Lower Than the Average Across All Sectors</p><p>\"The HSR Annual Reports issued by the DOJ and FTC report statistics on numerous industry areas, including Internet Service Providers, Web Search Portals, and Data Processing Services (NAICS code 518). This code, first reported in 2001, is a primary identifier for the businesses in which many of the digital market players participate. Just under 240 transactions were reportable to the antitrust agencies between 2001 and 2018, over 80% of which were closed after early stage review. The agencies more extensively investigated (i.e., through a second request and beyond) nine of those cases. This is just under 25%, as a percentage of deals cleared to the agencies. Only one deal was challenged in federal district court (the DOJ's case against Google-ITA Software, Inc.), or about 2.5%, as a percentage of deals cleared to the agencies.</p><p>\"Comparing enforcement statistics for the digital technology sector to those across all sectors leads us to the following observations. First, the percentage of digital technology cases that were closed after early stage review is about the average across all sectors. Second, the agencies' combined rate of second requests in digital technology cases is almost 20% higher than across all sectors. While FTC's rate of second requests is over 60% higher than the agency's rate of second requests across all sectors, the DOJ's is 25% lower. Finally, the rate of agency challenges in digital technology is over 80% lower than the average for transactions across all sectors.</p><p>\"The foregoing relationships between early stage reviews, more extensive investigations, and challenges for transactions involving digital technology mergers is important. It indicates that while transactions received average scrutiny in early stage review, they received more than average scrutiny in later stage review, perhaps because of the unique issues they raise. But the enforcement data indicate that the agencies ultimately are not finding that transactions raise competitive concerns, or are finding that they raise the kind of competitive concerns that the agencies are not comfortable challenging.</p><p>V. Making Sense of the Weak Record of Merger Enforcement in Digital Technology Markets</p><p>\"Digital Technology firms have been effective in expanding their positions in B2C and B2B markets. This expansion has occurred at a very rapid pace, which in itself warrants close monitoring by the antitrust agencies. More important, the weak record of merger enforcement in digital technology should prompt further inquiry. The following factors potentially explain this limited record of merger enforcement.</p><p>1. Digital market firms may purposely and strategically pursue deals that are unlikely to trigger antitrust concerns. These include acquisitions that are not reportable under the HSR requirements and smaller, reportable transactions that are likely to fly below the antitrust radar. In pursuing such a strategy, digital technology firms may have succeeded in embarking on mergers that are pro-competitive or benign. But given the significant record of serial acquisitions by Big Tech over the last three decades, it is imperative that enforcers broaden their lens to consider the longer-term implications of such a strategy on market concentration and barriers to entry.</p><p>2. The agencies are reluctant to make competitive concerns surrounding acquisitions of nascent or potential rivals the basis of a complaint in federal court. This is based on the assumption that the agencies apply error cost analysis under conditions of uncertainty, which may lead them to unfavorably compare the costs of mistakenly challenging benign or pro-competitive deals to the cost of mistakenly not challenging anticompetitive deals. This factor is at the center of larger debates over the last many years and, in AAI's view, continues to stymie more vigorous antitrust enforcement.</p><p>3. Enforcers perceive that they have an inadequate set of tools to deal with the complexity raised by digital technology mergers. Digital platforms exhibit, among other features, returns to scale and network effects, both of which contribute to winnertake- all scenarios. These issues could challenge enforcers in assessing whether mergers in some digital technology markets are likely to substantially lessen competition. Enforcers' perceptions that they lack the tools or expertise to fully or effectively litigate a digital technology merger case, in turn, increase the perceived risk of losing in court, with negative implications for future enforcement.</p><p>4. Because of unique characteristics of digital technology markets, acquisitions may raise concerns that are not reachable under current merger presumptions. This reason recognizes that some digital technology acquisitions that eliminate nascent or potential rivals raise concerns are cognizable under antitrust law. However, such concerns may not be reachable in practice because evidentiary standards are currently too high.</p><p>\"For the purposes of this hearing, I would like to focus on the third and fourth potential explanations for weak merger enforcement in digital technology markets. They raise important issues support initiatives to invigorate enforcement.</p><p>VI. Enforcers Have Adequate Tools to Review Acquisitions in Digital Technology Markets</p><p>\"There are a number of features of digital technology markets that enforcers may perceive pose challenges for antitrust review. First, the metric of exchange in many digital technology markets (e.g., social media) is consumer data, not price. Potential adverse effects in these \"zero-price\" markets may include requiring users to provide more consumer data or linking the quality of service to the provision of data. Some digital technology spaces also feature multi-sided markets, which bring together providers and users of a service or product on either side of an exchange. Second, many digital market mergers can have effects on nonprice dimensions of competition such as quality. One aspect of quality is whether a merger will change the firm's incentives around the protection of user privacy.</p><p>\"Third, digital technology mergers raise issues in narrowly defined markets such as advertising or locational services. But they may also strengthen incentives to leverage market power across related markets in which a firm possesses significant market power (e.g., search or online retailing). Finally, many digital technology mergers, particularly involving B2B markets such as cloud infrastructure or software, present vertical issues relating to the competitive effects of combining assets in adjacent markets.</p><p>\"Evidence from previous enforcement investigations, coupled with legal-economic research, support the notion that antitrust has most if not all of the tools it needs to address competitive issues raised in digital markets. For example, zero-price and multi-sided markets are well within the reach of the consumer welfare standard, which accommodates different market definitions and both price and non-price effects. Agency statements indicate that enforcers are comfortable addressing these issues.</p><p>\"For example, in Google-DoubleClick, the FTC issued a press release and closing statement noting that it investigated the effect of the acquisition on the online advertising market, as well as the possibility that the transaction could adversely affect consumer privacy. Likewise, DOJ issued a press release in the Google-Admeld stating it had investigated concerns over adverse effects in the online display advertising market but also the possibility that the transaction would enable Google to extend its market power in Internet search to the display advertising market.</p><p>\"Finally, vertical mergers are standard fare for enforcers. The DOJ challenged Google's acquisition of ITA Software, Inc. because the merger enhanced Google's incentives to foreclose rival online comparative flight search services from access to ITA's airfare pricing and shopping system. European enforcers also explored how Apple's newly acquired access to data about its rivals' customers through its acquisition of music recognition application Shazam could hamper competition.</p><p>\"In sum, what we know about enforcement agencies' approach to digital technology mergers supports the notion that they do not pose insurmountable complexity. Enforcers have the tools, they just need to use them.</p><p>VII. Current Merger Presumptions May be Inadequate for Digital Technology Acquisitions</p><p>\"The record supports the idea that antitrust enforcers have adequate tools to evaluate competitive effects in digital technology markets. We therefore may need to look elsewhere for the reason for weak enforcement. Namely, some competitive concerns that are cognizable under antitrust law may not reachable in practice because evidentiary standards are currently too high. This explanation for weak enforcement is compelling. It is likely to be compounded by the Horizontal Merger Guidelines' focus on narrowly defined markets and \"one acquisition at a time.\" The rapid series of digital technology acquisitions over the past few decades supports the idea that enforcers should attempt to expand the lens through which they evaluate serial transactions, with emphasis on the longer-term effects of such consolidation.</p><p>\"Leading economists have identified the challenges that digital technology acquisitions pose.</p><p>\"For example, economist Carl Shapiro explains that superstar firms possess durable competitive advantages over rivals, the conditions under which mergers are most likely to lessen competition and harm consumers. Economist John Kwoka notes that adding functions to a basic platform makes competition and entry more difficult, reduces choice, and may eliminate incentives to innovate. Both economists have put forward proposals for stronger presumptions for digital technology acquisitions. This includes an affirmative burden on the company proposing the acquisition to justify the acquisition and lowering the evidentiary requirements necessary for the government prevail in a potential competition case by showing that the target firm is reasonably likely to become a rival.</p><p>VIII. Conclusions and Recommendations</p><p>\"The foregoing analysis of merger enforcement in the digital technology sector provides strong support for why lawmakers and enforcers should consider a variety of ways to invigorate merger enforcement. I want to make it clear that antitrust is a leading policy instrument for addressing some, but not all of the myriad concerns raised by the digital technology markets. As a mechanism of law enforcement that relies on an investigatory and evidence-based process and is subject to judicial review, antitrust is ill suited to address broader social policy concerns raised by some of the large digital technology players.</p><p>\"Moreover, antitrust is not designed to be used as a tool to implement industrial policy, including through comprehensive breakups that are not tailored to identifiable competitive harms. Doing so could stymie enforcement at a time when we need to strengthen, clarify, and invigorate antitrust. Antitrust should address competition concerns as a leading policy tool in a portfolio approach that potentially includes social regulation, economic regulation, access and interoperability standards, and other policies.</p><p>\"I respectfully suggest a number of policy proposals to address weak merger enforcement in the digital technology sector.</p><p>1. Stronger merger presumptions are needed for acquisitions in the digital technology sector and should be a leading tool for invigorating effective merger enforcement. These include the presumptions for acquisitions of nascent and potential rivals, as described above. But given that many of digital technology acquisitions are vertical mergers, stronger vertical presumptions should also be considered. This includes rebuttable presumptions surrounding the effect of high market share in upstream or downstream markets on enhancing incentives to foreclose rivals. And the structural presumption in highly concentrative horizontal mergers involving digital technology markets should be rigorously applied.</p><p>2. Retrospective analysis of consummated mergers involving digital technology acquisitions is essential for determining which consummated deals should be challenged. Retrospective analysis of mergers is vital for determining if certain digital technology mergers resulted in higher prices, lower quality, less choice, or slower innovation. If concerns are identified, the agencies should use the full scope of their authority to bring challenges to consummated mergers under Section 7 of the Clayton Act and use fully effective remedies to restore competition lost by the acquisitions.</p><p>3. Improved agency transparency on digital technology merger actions would provide valuable information to the business community, consumers, and entrepreneurs. This includes more expansive press releases and/or closing statements for important acquisitions where the agencies investigated but took no enforcement action. Appropriately framed explanations as to why the agencies reached the decisions they did would provide important information without hampering the agencies' flexibility in future transactions.</p><p>4. A \"blue ribbon\" committee should be formed and tasked with evaluating the need for a new Digital Markets Act. The committee would evaluate the goals and parameters of potential legislation for a sectoral oversight authority. This includes an independent regulatory body with authority to implement and enforcement any new regulation surrounding digital market privacy, access, and interoperability. The committee would also frame out how such a regulator would work with antitrust enforcers to advise on technical matters that affect competition.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6868091 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6868091</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4H-X6V1-DYG2-R3B5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3118\"/><timeReceived>8:32 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 25, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I love America and democracy, and I am also not a conservative. I have been center/center-left my whole adult life. You'll see in moment why this fact is relevant to my testimony.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I am here today for three reasons: to explain why Google presents a serious threat to democracy and human autonomy, to explain how passive monitoring systems can protect us both now and in the future from companies like Google, and to tell you how Congress can immediately end Google's worldwide monopoly on search. My plan for ending that monopoly was published just yesterday (Monday, July 15, 2019) by Bloomberg Businessweek (Epstein, 2019d). I am attaching a copy of my article to my testimony and respectfully request that it be entered into the Congressional Record.</p><p>\"I have been a research psychologist for nearly 40 years and have also served in various editorial positions at Psychology Today magazine and Scientific American MIND. I received my Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1981 and have since published 15 books and more than 300 scientific and mainstream articles on artificial intelligence and other topics.</p><p>\"Since 2012, some of my research and writings have focused on Google LLC, specifically on the company's power to suppress content - the censorship problem, if you will - as well as on the massive surveillance the company conducts, and also on the company's unprecedented ability to manipulate the thoughts and behavior of more than 2.5 billion people worldwide.</p><p>\"Data I've collected since 2016 show that Google displays content to the American public that is biased in favor on one political party (Epstein &amp;#38; Williams, 2019) - a party I happen to like, but that's irrelevant. No private company should have either the right or the power to manipulate large populations without their knowledge.</p><p>\"I've published articles about my research on Google in both scientific publications and a wide array of mainstream news sources: in TIME magazine, U.S. News &amp;#38; World Report, USA Today, Dissent, The Hill, and Huffington Post, for example, but also in The Daily Caller and even in Russia's Sputnik News.</p><p>\"I reach out to diverse different audiences because the threats posed by Google, and, to a lesser extent, Facebook, are so serious that I think everyone in the world needs to know about them. I put my own political leanings aside when I report my data and concerns because the problems these companies present eclipse personal politics. To put this another way, I love humanity, my country, and democracy more than I love any particular party or candidate. And democracy as originally conceived cannot survive Big Tech as currently empowered.</p><p>\"If you were to examine the data I have been collecting over the past 6-and-a-half years, every one of you would put partisanship aside and collaborate to reign in the extraordinary power that Google and Facebook now wield with unabashed arrogance.</p><p>\"Here are five disturbing findings from my research, which adheres, I believe, to the highest possible scientific standards in all respects:</p><p>1. In 2016, biased search results generated by Google's search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that gave at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton (whom I supported). I know this because I preserved more than 13,000 election-related searches conducted by a diverse group of Americans on Google, Bing, and Yahoo in the weeks leading up to the election, and Google search results - which dominate search in the U.S. and worldwide - were significantly biased in favor of Secretary Clinton in all 10 positions on the first page of search results in both blue states and red states.</p><p>\"I know the number of votes that shifted because I have conducted dozens of controlled experiments in the U.S. and other countries that measure precisely how opinions and votes shift when search results favor one candidate, cause, or company. I call this shift \"SEME\" - the Search Engine Manipulation Effect. My first scientific paper on SEME was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in 2015 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://is.gd/p0li8V\">https://is.gd/p0li8V</url>) (Epstein &amp;#38; Robertson, 2015a) and has since been accessed or downloaded from PNAS's website more than 200,000 times. SEME has also been replicated by a research team at one of the Max Planck Institutes in Germany.</p><p>\"SEME is one of the most powerful forms of influence ever discovered in the behavioral sciences, and it is especially dangerous because it is invisible to people - \"subliminal,\" in effect. It leaves people thinking they have made up their own minds, which is very much an illusion. It also leaves no paper trail for authorities to trace. Worse still, the very few people who can detect bias in search results shift even farther in the direction of the bias, so merely being able to see the bias doesn't protect you from it. Bottom line: biased search results can easily produce shifts in the opinions and voting preference of undecided voters by 20 percent or more - up to 80 percent in some demographic groups.</p><p>\"Bear in mind here that all Google search results are, in a sense, biased. There are no equal-time rules built into Google algorithm. It always puts one widget ahead of another - and one candidate ahead of another.</p><p>\"SEME is an example of an \"ephemeral experience,\" and that's a phrase you'll find in internal emails that have leaked from Google recently. A growing body of evidence suggests that Google employees deliberately engineer ephemeral experiences to change people's thinking. (For details about the methodology used in SEME experiments, please see the Appendix at the end of this testimony.) Since 2013, I have discovered about a dozen subliminal effects like SEME, and I am currently studying and quantifying seven of them (<url normalizedValue=\"https://is.gd/DbIhZw\">https://is.gd/DbIhZw</url>) (Epstein, 2018i).</p><p>2. On Election Day in 2018, the \"Go Vote\" reminder Google displayed on its home page gave one political party between 800,000 and 4.6 million more votes than it gave the other party. Those numbers might seem impossible, but I published my analysis in January 2019 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://is.gd/WCdslm\">https://is.gd/WCdslm</url>) (Epstein, 2019a), and it is quite conservative. Google's data analysts presumably performed the same calculations I did before the company decided to post its prompt. In other words, Google's \"Go Vote\" prompt was not a public service; it was a vote manipulation.</p><p>3. In the weeks leading up to the 2018 election, bias in Google's search results may have shifted upwards of 78.2 million votes to the candidates of one political party (spread across hundreds of local and regional races). This number is based on data captured by my 2018 monitoring system, which preserved more than 47,000 election-related searches on Google, Bing, and Yahoo, along with the nearly 400,000 web pages to which the search results linked. Strong political bias toward one party was evident, once again, in Google searches (Epstein &amp;#38; Williams, 2019).</p><p>4. My recent research demonstrates that Google's \"autocomplete\" search suggestions can turn a 50/50 split among undecided voters into a 90/10 split without people's awareness (<url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/2EcYnYI\">http://bit.ly/2EcYnYI</url>) (Epstein, Mohr, &amp;#38; Martinez, 2018). A growing body of evidence suggests that Google is manipulating people's thinking and behavior from the very first character people type into the search box.</p><p>5. Google has likely been determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide since at least 2015. This is because many races are very close and because Google's persuasive technologies are very powerful (Epstein &amp;#38; Robertson, 2015a).</p><p>\"These effects are nothing like Russian-placed ads or fake news stories. Russian interference, although troubling and unacceptable, does not, in my opinion, shift many votes (Epstein, 2017d, 2018a). Ads and news stories are competitive and visible, like billboards. The kinds of ephemeral effects I am studying, however, are invisible and non4 competitive. They are controlled entirely by Big Tech companies, and there is no way to counteract them.</p><p>\"I have also studied and written about Google's massive surveillance operations - most of which people are completely unaware of - and Google's pervasive and unpredictable pattern of censorship, but time does not not permit me to discuss my work in these areas today. On the issue of censorship, I refer the Committee Members to a 2016 report I published in U.S. News &amp;#38; World Report called \"The New Censorship\" (<url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/28PgBmW\">http://bit.ly/28PgBmW</url>) (Epstein, 2016d), which described nine different blacklists Google maintains to suppress information worldwide. We are all aware that Google deletes or blocks access to videos on YouTube, which it owns, but few people are aware that Google blocks access to millions of websites. On January 31, 2009, Google blocked access to virtually the entire internet for 40 minutes.</p><p>\"By the way, it is not just conservative content that gets censored (Epstein, 2018h). At times, Google also censors progressive and socialist content. The problem with Google is not that it censors conservatives; the problem is that it has the power to determine what content billions of people worldwide will or not see. No single entity - especially a private company that is not accountable to the public - should have such power (Epstein, 2016d).</p><p>\"I know how to stop Big Tech companies dead in their tracks, and that brings me, finally, to monitoring systems and the proposal I published yesterday.</p><p>\"Back in 2015, a telephone call from Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, prompted me to start a years-long project in which I learned to monitor what Big Tech companies are showing real users. In early 2016, I launched my first large-scale, Neilsentype monitoring system that allowed my team to look over people's shoulders and, with user permission, to capture the search results they were seeing on their computer screens before those results disappeared (Epstein, 2018d). I successfully deployed such systems in 2016 and 2018, and I'm raising funds now to build a much larger and more comprehensive system in early 2020 - one that will allow us to catch Big Tech companies in the act - to instantly spot when Google is showing people politically biased search results; when Twitter is suppressing tweets sent by the President, Ann Coulter, or Elizabeth Warren; when Facebook is sending out \"Register to Vote\" reminders only to members of one party.</p><p>\"This system must be built to keep an eye on Big Tech in 2020 because if these companies all support the same candidate - and that's likely, needless to say - they will be able to shift upwards of 15 million votes to that candidate with no one knowing and without leaving a paper trail.</p><p>\"To let Big Tech companies get away with invisible manipulation on this scale would be to abandon the free-and-fair election, a cornerstone of democracy. It would make democracy meaningless, even if your chosen candidate prevailed.</p><p>\"A worldwide network of passive monitoring systems must be built to protect humanity and democracy from manipulations by today's Google and the Googles of tomorrow. Only tech can fight tech; laws and regulations will never keep up (Epstein, 2018d). Finally, yesterday I published an article explaining how Congress can quickly end Google's worldwide monopoly on search (Epstein, 2019d). The solution to The Google Problem is to declare Google's massive search index - the database the company uses to generate search results - to be a public commons, accessible by all, just as a 1956 consent decree forced AT&amp;#38;T to share all its patents. There is precedent in both law and in Google's own business practices to justify taking this step.</p><p>\"Declaring Google's index a commons will quickly give rise to thousands of search platforms like Google.com, each competing with Google, each providing excellent search results, each serving niche audiences, large and small, exactly like newspapers and television networks and websites do now. Search will become competitive, as it was during its early years, and democracy will be protected from Google's secretive machinations.</p><p>\"In his famous departing speech in January, 1961, President Eisenhower warned about the possible rise of a \"technological elite\" that could control public policy without people's awareness (Epstein, 2016a, 2018c).

Our nation continues to face a multitude of serious and evolving threats ranging from homegrown violent extremists (\"HVEs\") to cyber criminals to hostile foreign intelligence services and operatives. Keeping pace with these threats is a significant challenge for the FBI.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our adversaries -- terrorists, foreign intelligence services, and criminals -- take advantage of modern technology to hide their communications; recruit followers; and plan and encourage espionage, cyber-attacks, or terrorism to disperse information on different methods to attack the U.S. homeland, and to facilitate other illegal activities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cyber Threats</p><p>Virtually every national security threat and crime problem the FBI faces is cyber-based or facilitated. We face threats from state-sponsored hackers, hackers for hire, organized cyber syndicates, and terrorists. On a daily basis, these actors seek to steal our state secrets, our trade secrets, our technology, and our ideas -- things of incredible value to all of us and of great importance to the conduct of our government business and our national security. They seek to hold our critical infrastructure at risk and to harm our economy.</p><p>The FBI is investigating a wider-than-ever range of threat actors, from transnational organized cybercrime to nation-state adversaries to terrorists using social medial for recruiting and radicalization purposes. The scale, scope, speed and impact of cyber threats is constantly evolving, which may explain why we are also seeing a blending of threats, such as nation state adversaries using criminal actors as proxies to mask their activities.</p><p>The frequency and severity of malicious cyber activity on our nation's networks have increased dramatically in the past decade when measured by the amount of corporate data stolen or deleted, the volume of personally identifiable information compromised, or the remediation costs incurred by U.S. victims. Companies that hold large amounts of Personally Identifiable Information (\"PII\") are susceptible to loss of American's personal data to criminal organizations, terrorists, and nation-state cyber actors. Hotel chains, airlines, healthcare companies, credit bureaus, government agencies, and cleared defense contractors have previously been victims of PII theft.</p><p>Cyber Criminal Trends</p><p>Cyber threats are not only increasing in size and scope, but are also becoming increasingly difficult and resource-intensive to investigate. Cyber criminals often operate through online forums, selling illicit goods and services, including tools that lower the barrier to entry for aspiring criminals and that can be used to facilitate malicious cyber activity. These criminals have also increased the sophistication of their schemes, which are more difficult to detect and more resilient to disruption than ever. In addition, whether located at home or abroad, many cyber actors are obfuscating their identities and obscuring their activity by using combinations of leased and compromised infrastructure in domestic and foreign jurisdictions.</p><p>Such tactics make coordination with all of our partners, including international law enforcement partners, essential.</p><p>Increasingly sophisticated obfuscation techniques are also enabling actors to stealthily obtain data from victims or repurpose victim computers into cryptocurrency-mining botnets.</p><p>Botnets used by cyber criminals have been responsible for billions of dollars in damages over the past several years. The widespread availability of malicious software (\"malware\") that can create botnets allows individuals to leverage the combined bandwidth of thousands, if not millions, of compromised computers, servers, or network-ready devices to disrupt the day-today activities of governments, businesses, and individual Americans.</p><p>Cyber threat actors are conducting ransomware attacks against U.S. systems, encrypting data and rendering systems unusable -- thereby victimizing individuals, businesses, and even emergency service and public health providers. Our threat reporting has demonstrated that ransomware attacks are becoming more targeted, sophisticated, and costly, even as the overall frequency of ransomware attacks is holding steady or declining. Since early 2018, the incidence of broad, indiscriminate ransomware campaigns has sharply declined, while losses from ransomware attacks have increased significantly. Allow me to restate that for emphasis: while the number of reported attacks has gone down, the effects and impacts of the attacks are going up. Meanwhile, state and local governments have been particularly visible targets for ransomware attacks. However, ransomware campaigns have also heavily impacted health care organizations, industrial companies, and the transportation sector.</p><p>Business Email Compromise (\"BEC\") remains a pervasive threat due to its low barrier of entry and maturing social engineering techniques, and cyber criminals almost certainly will continue to use BEC to target industries indiscriminately. BEC threat actors have widened their money laundering networks, including domestic transfers prior to laundering the money overseas, which presents challenges and opportunities for countering this type of fraud. Readily available online personal and business information enhances the reconnaissance capability of actors, providing BEC threat actors with more credible social engineering lures. Spoofed domains are seen in the majority of BEC attempts, and likely will remain a technique used by cyber actors. BEC attacks combining social engineering with network intrusions demonstrate an increase in attack sophistication that can use keyloggers or other malware to identify potential targets, such as business vendors, as well as sell access to or further exploit compromised systems.</p><p>Actors have learned that BEC is effective and are adapting lures to target human resources departments for PII, such as W-2 tax forms to commit stolen identity return fraud, rather than requesting wire transfers. Additionally, industry partners have observed BEC actors increasingly instruct victims to send automated clearing house transfers to prepaid cards in the initial laundering phase.</p><p>Nation State Activities: China</p><p>While several nation-states pose a cyber threat to U.S. interests, no other country presents a broader and more comprehensive threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\") under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (\"CCP\"). The threat takes many different forms. Beijing employs a whole-of-government approach to its intelligence collection strategy. While cyber network operations remain a primary and possibly increasing collection tool, the CCP also relies on techniques such as intellectual property theft, purchases of U.S. corporations, and physical and property theft to acquire U.S.</p><p>data.</p><p>For example, less than a month ago, on February 10, 2020, the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), in coordination with the FBI, publicly unsealed an indictment against four Chinese cyber actors who allegedly acted as agents of the People's Republic of China's People's Liberation Army (\"PLA\"). All four actors are currently located in China. The alleged crimes occurred between May 13, 2017 and July 30, 2017. The actors targeted a software vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to Equifax's network and ultimately obtain PII for 145 million American citizens as well as the intellectual property of the U.S. company.</p><p>The indictment alleges the four individuals named therein reside in Beijing, China and are members of the 54th Research Institute. The 54th Research Institute is a component of the People's Liberation Army. The indicted individuals gained unauthorized access, via a software vulnerability, to Equifax's internal network where they allegedly ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax's systems and obtained the names, birth dates, and social security numbers for approximately half of all adult American citizens. The defendants also took deliberate steps to evade detection in the system, including routing traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, using encrypted channels in order to blend in normal traffic within Equifax's network, and wiping log files on a daily basis to try to eliminate records of their activity.</p><p>DOJ, the FBI, and our partners will continue to work tirelessly to combat this threat posed by the Chinese government against our nation. Although the PRC continues to modify the ways in which it conducts nefarious cyber activity, including through working with criminal hackers, the cases prosecuted by the DOJ in partnership with the FBI reflect an increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute criminal conduct to the individuals and nation states involved.</p><p>We will be relentless in our pursuit of such malicious activity against our citizens and our industry.</p><p>There are other risks. Chinese companies are increasingly acquiring or launching social media applications not housed in mainland China for the global consumer market. These applications generate big data and collect PII such as biometric information, contact lists, location data, log data, communication metadata, content (text and photographic), bank and credit card details, and financial transactions of U.S. persons. The associated user agreements and privacy policies typically obfuscate the companies' data handling responsibilities or directly state any and all data can be transferred to other locations and associated entities to include the Chinese parent company. These data handling policies create a risk for U.S. big data and PII to be targeted and exploited by PRC actors. More broadly, consumers should be aware of the privacy implications of any application they install, especially applications from foreign countries with weak data protection laws.</p><p>In June 2017, the PRC introduced a new national cyber security law that requires foreign firms to store data locally and submit to data surveillance measures. Although implementing regulations are still being drafted, Beijing could likely use these authorities and policies to compel access to U.S. commercial and sensitive personal data, including sensitive information stored or transmitted through Chinese systems. U.S.-based subsidiaries of Chinese corporations and entities, or organizations in the U.S. partnering on cooperative research and development efforts, are among the entities affected by this law. The law has raised fears by those concerned with Beijing's control of sensitive company information and increased opportunity to steal intellectual property.</p><p>Threats Exposing Vulnerabilities on Critical Infrastructure Networks and the Public</p><p>Virtually all companies collect and maintain sensitive data either of their own employees or customer information. The overall trend of digitizing data for ease of use or access makes many different industries vulnerable to data breaches. For instance, over recent years the healthcare industry has moved to centralizing patient data and using Internet-connected devices, which has increased the sector's potential attack surface. Cyber actors benefit from this target rich environment as the passage of patient data between healthcare departments and networks is critical to their care, but often levels of cybersecurity vary. Ransomware, denial of service attacks, and data breaches can all impede the ability to provide basic patient care and privacy for protected health information (\"PHI\"). Electronic medical records typically contain PII, which, combined with medical record information, is known as PHI.</p><p>It is also highly likely cyber actors target the IT Sector to access their customers' data and networks. IT sector entities manage and store valuable customer data and have unique, privileged access to client networks. These vital services create an environment where IT sector networks are compromised as a means for malicious cyber actors to reach a final target for fraud, hacktivism, and counterintelligence purposes.</p><p>Entertainment and media companies use Internet-enabled systems for marketing, merchandising, ticketing, and reservations. As a result, owners and operators manage and protect databases of customer and employee data, including personal, financial, and credit card information. Since at least 2015, nation-state and criminal cyber actors have conducted computer network exploitation against the subsector likely to gain unauthorized access to non-public information, although the extent of the access in each case remains unclear.</p><p>Efforts Used to Combat, Prevent, and Investigate Hacking or the Misuse of this Data In order to combat cyber threats, the FBI has taken a whole-of-society approach. We actively engage with our private sector partners through the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (\"NCFTA\"), which is a non-profit partnership between private industry, government and academia all working together to identify and disrupt cyber-crime. We recently hosted a ransomware-focused summit, with incident response companies, representatives from the legal and insurance industries as well as other government entities, where we discussed collaborative efforts to address the threats.</p><p>The FBI also partners with the National Defense Cyber Alliance (\"NDCA\"), which is a non-profit organization bringing together the U.S. Intelligence Community and Cleared Defense Contractor community to improve the security of their networks. Similar to how the NCFTA supports the financial/retail sector against criminal threats, the NDCA is designed to support the Defense Industrial Base against national security threats.</p><p>Through undercover operations and confidential human sources, we are targeting and shutting down dark-net and Clearnet criminal forums where identities are sold and where cybercriminals gather to plan their next attack. We are actively engaging with our international partners through our Cyber Assistant Legal Attache (\"ALAT\") program, through our annual FBI-sponsored International Task Force and through our participation in the FBI-led International Cyber Crime Operations Summit (\"ICCOS\") as well as the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group (\"FELEG\") Cyber Crime Working Group.</p><p>The FBI understands the importance of stressing cybersecurity with individuals, not just with organizations. To do so, we hold a series of events aimed at educating and speaking with individuals about these issues. The FBI regularly takes part in Public Awareness Campaigns, where we coordinate with other agencies on initiatives for engagement with the private sector to prevent threats to critical infrastructure, educate entities on serious cyber threats, and ultimately close intelligence gaps. Additionally, we disseminate Private Industry Notifications (\"PINs\"), FBI Liaison Alert System (\"FLASH\") reports, and Public Service Announcements (\"PSAs\") to share cyber threat information with the private sector and the general public.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The FBI is engaged in myriad efforts to combat cyber threats, from improving threat identification and information sharing inside and outside of the government, to developing and retaining new talent, to examining the way we operate to disrupt and defeat these threats. FBI agents, analysts, and computer scientists are using technical capabilities and traditional investigative techniques -- such as sources, court-authorized electronic surveillance, physical surveillance, and forensics -- to counter these threats.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7044121 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7044121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC5-4T71-DYG2-R0S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2658\"/><timeReceived>6:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 6, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I am aware that many in my industry have chosen this date to observe a day of inactivity and quiet contemplation. In being present, here, I mean no disrespect to those who have chosen to set aside this day. I wish to state, for the record, that I stand in solidarity with my brothers and sisters in the creative community, and with all my fellow citizens who seek a better, more just world, for everyone.</p><p>As a 55-year veteran of the music industry, I was asked, by the chairman of this Senate subcommittee, to come here and testify, today on behalf of the creative community - songwriters, musicians, music publishers - also known, in today's digital world, as \"content providers.\" I am present, today, not to be contrary, not to advance a personal agenda (at age 73, and indefinitely homebound by the Covid-19 pandemic, I am in the final chapter of my career), but I come here out of a sense of duty and obligation to those artists, those creators who paved the road for me and my contemporaries, and for those who will travel this road after us. It is truly unfortunate - and patently unfair - that the music industry is perceived only in terms of its most successful and wealthy celebrities, when in fact there are millions of people working in the industry, struggling in relative obscurity; people whose voices would never be heard were it not for hearings such as this one being held, today. So, I am compelled to seize this rare opportunity to discuss aspects of the fundamental issues that are foremost in the national conversation, at this anxious moment - fairness, rights, mutual respect and ... in this case, economic justice and equal opportunity.</p><p>But, the smear campaign has already begun. I have been targeted by the digital gatekeepers and their many shills and surrogates. It began last Friday in the newspaper that belongs to Mr.</p><p>Bezos, and it continues, today. Big Tech was probably hoping that this hearing would be canceled, or that I would be intimidated to the extent that I would not testify. But, I will not be silent on this issue. I want to do everything in my power to strengthen the property rights of music creators of all ages, races and creeds; all styles, from hip-hop to honky-tonk, from rock, to rap, to rhythm &amp; blues. From jazz to folk, to heavy metal. To change or improve outdated laws and regulations that have been abused for over 20 years by Big Tech... the enormous digital platforms that facilitate millions of copyright infringements, monthly.</p><p>So, let me directly answer the question at hand: the notice and takedown system of the DMCA does not work for artists and songwriters.</p><p>* When a simple online search for a song returns an endless list of sites that never asked the copyright owner for permission, never received a license and never passed on a penny to the artist for use of their music - the system is not working.</p><p>* Today, when the marketplace has matured, and digital platforms continue to use section 512 as a negotiating leverage to pay license fees which are well below market - the system is not working.</p><p>* When the burden of policing copyright infringements on global platforms lies with the artists instead of the massive technology companies who own and operate the platforms - the system is not working.</p><p>The system is antiquated and badly broken. And the creative community is paying a very steep price. I have worked hard to establish my career and reputation, and I have enjoyed success.</p><p>For me, this is a matter of principle. I am speaking out for those songwriters and recording artists who are struggling to make a living. Particularly now, as our industry has been decimated by the pandemic, we need equitable compensation for the rights guaranteed to authors under the Constitution. Given the current ban on large social gatherings and the indefinite pause in live performances, income from licensed digital music services may be the only real source of revenue music creators can rely on the foreseeable future. So, it is imperative that the devaluation of music - which is a direct result of the DMCA - ceases. And, as a result, creators be paid a market rate for their music across all platforms.</p><p>At the dawn of the Internet age, the DMCA was supposed to provide digital platforms with safe harbor from liability in exchange for cooperation in protecting creators' works. It was meant to provide a proper balance and symbiotic relationship that benefitted all participants and strengthened the legitimate online marketplace.</p><p>Two decades later, the balance is decidedly off.</p><p>In a world where more than 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, more than 1 billion videos are viewed on TikTok per day, and there are over 500 million daily active users on Instagram, it is clear that the massive online services are flourishing while artists have no ability to combat the rampant infringement that occurs on these platforms. As the U.S.</p><p>Copyright Office said in its recent Report, \"the balance Congress intended when it established the section 512 safe harbor system is askew.\"</p><p>Content owners send hundreds of millions of takedown notices annually. And often, for each infringing link or file taken down, a dozen more pop up in its place. But even worse, due to the antiquated procedures dictated by the DMCA, internet services with clear oversight and control of content posted on their websites are continuing to monetize and collect advertising revenue on videos containing music, even after that music has been flagged by the music creator as infringing. How is that a fair bargain?</p><p>The astronomical number of infringement notices sent by creators is not a sign that the system is working - as some defenders of the DMCA suggest. That would be akin to measuring our country's success in fighting wildfires by measuring the number of attempts to extinguish them; instead, we need to seek out the root causes of those fires, implement preventive measures, and ensure that they don't reignite. Many of the enormous tech companies who benefit from the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the DMCA have the tools to do just that: they have the capability to monitor infringements on their platforms and provide enhanced tools for content owners. They just choose not to. They are capable of understanding and tracking the individual likes and dislikes of the fans who visit the platform with frightening accuracy, and yet we are supposed to believe that putting in place a meaningful barrier to infringement is beyond their capabilities?!? More accurately, it's beyond their desire. These tech giants are afraid that blocking infringing content will reduce traffic, and reducing traffic decreases their ad revenue.</p><p>Instead of focusing on platform improvements that drive consumer satisfaction, they rely on copyrighted material - whether licensed or not - to keep consumers engaged. With the DMCA as cover, these companies simply have no incentive to improve technological protection measures.</p><p>The courts have facilitated this worldview, broadening application of the safe harbor provision, watering down obligations of online services, and eliminating consequences. The result is an anemic notice and takedown system that still allows Big Tech to rake in revenue by monetizing access to our unlicensed works, despite being notified of the infringements, even repeat infringements.</p><p>We simply cannot continue like this.</p><p>I applaud and I thank this Subcommittee for shining a light on the damage caused by the unfulfilled promise of a meaningful and effective notice and takedown system. Creators need recourse for the unlicensed, illicit use of their valuable works online. The DMCA is not providing that to them.</p><p>Like a classic song, album, or band, some creations stand the test of time, resonating across generations. Other products of the past are best left there - or updated to reflect the modern era. The DMCA has shown its age - it is a relic of a MySpace era in a TikTok world. Our nation's countless creators, most of them small businesses, deserve a system that recognizes the needs of online participants, a procedure that properly applies the rules, and implements today's technology with an eye toward tomorrow. Only then can we truly achieve the proper balance and the thriving legitimate online marketplace this institution envisioned so many years ago.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7131533 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7131533</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602B-NYC1-JC11-1360-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1457\"/><timeReceived>8:51 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 4, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

CISA works every day to support the private sector and the American people's efforts and responsibilities to secure their corporate and personal data, the focus of today's hearing. Safeguarding and securing cyberspace is a core mission of DHS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At CISA, our mission is to defend against the threats of today, while working with partners across all levels of government and in the private sector to secure against the evolving risks of tomorrow - \"Defend Today, Secure Tomorrow.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Understanding the Threat</p><p>Cyber threats remain one of the most significant strategic risks for the United States, threatening our national security, economic prosperity, and public health and safety. We continue to see malicious threat actors, including hackers, cyber criminals, and nation-states, increase the frequency and sophistication of their attacks. In a 2018 report, Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace, the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center stated, \"We anticipate that China, Russia, and Iran will remain aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace.\" Our adversaries and strategic competitors are developing and using advanced cyber capabilities in attempts to undermine critical infrastructure, target our livelihoods and innovation, steal our national security secrets, and threaten our democratic institutions.</p><p>Increasingly, most discussions around cybersecurity threats include some risk calculation related to supply chain, third party, or vendor assurance risk. In 2018, cybersecurity firm Symantec reported the number of observed supply chain attacks was 78 percent higher in 2018 than it was in 2017, as malicious actors sought to exploit vulnerabilities in third-party software, hardware, and services.</p><p>Supply chain risk can broadly be understood as efforts by our adversaries to exploit information and communications technologies (ICT) and their related supply chains for purposes of espionage, sabotage, foreign interference, and criminal activity. Vulnerabilities in supply chains - either developed intentionally for malicious intent or unintentionally, including through poor security practices - can enable data and intellectual property theft, loss of confidence in the integrity of the system, or exploitation to cause system and network failure. More often, our adversaries are looking at these vulnerabilities as a principal attack vector, and we are greatly concerned with aggressive actions by potential foreign adversaries and strategic competitors to include Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.</p><p>Roles and Responsibilities</p><p>CISA, our government partners, and the private sector are all engaging in a more strategic and unified approach towards improving our Nation's overall defensive posture against malicious cyber activity. In May 2018, the Department published the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy, outlining a strategic framework to execute our cybersecurity responsibilities during the next five years. The National Cyber Strategy, released in September 2018, reiterates the criticality of collaboration and strengthens the government's commitment to work in partnership with industry to combat cyber threats and secure our critical infrastructure. Together, the National Cyber Strategy and DHS Cybersecurity Strategy guide CISA's efforts.</p><p>CISA works across government and industry partnerships to lead the national effort to safeguard and secure cyberspace. We share timely and actionable classified and unclassified information as well as provide training and technical assistance, and we do this with attention to protecting privacy, civil liberties and confidentiality. Our work enhances cyber threat information sharing between and among governments and businesses across the globe to stop cyber incidents before they occur and quickly recover when they do. By bringing together the intelligence community, law enforcement, the Department of Defense, Sector-Specific Agencies, all levels of government, the private sector, international partners, and the public, we are enabling collective defense against cybersecurity risks, improving incident response capabilities, enhancing information sharing of best practices and cyber threats, strengthening our resilience, and facilitating safety.</p><p>CISA provides entities with technical assistance and guidance they can use to secure their networks, systems, assets, information, and data by reducing vulnerabilities, ensuring resilience to cyber incidents, and supporting their holistic risk management priorities. CISA operates at the intersection of the Federal Government, state and local governments, the private sector, international partners, law enforcement, intelligence, and defense communities. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-113) established DHS as the Federal Government's central hub for sharing cyber threat indicators and defensive measures. CISA's automated indicator sharing capability allows the Federal Government and private sector network defenders to share technical information at machine speed, without eroding privacy protections or civil liberties.</p><p>CISA provides a broad range of capabilities to assist private sector entities across all 16 sectors of critical infrastructure. In addition to information sharing and incident response, these capabilities include assessments and technical services as well as recommended remediation and mitigation techniques that improve the cybersecurity posture of the Nation. Among other services, these include vulnerability scanning and testing, penetration testing, phishing assessments, and red teaming on operational technology that includes the industrial control systems which operate our nation's critical infrastructure.</p><p>Supply Chain Risks</p><p>There are also steps we can take to secure the hardware agencies and entities use to build their networks and the software that runs those networks. ICT is critical to every business's ability to carry out its mission efficiently and effectively. Vulnerabilities can be exploited intentionally or unintentionally through a variety of means, including deliberate mislabeling and counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, and insertion of malicious software or hardware. If these risks are not detected and mitigated, the impact to the ICT supply chain could be a fundamental degradation of its confidentiality, integrity, or availability and potentially create adverse impacts to essential government or critical infrastructure systems.</p><p>In 2018, CISA established the Information and Communication Technology Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force as a public-private partnership jointly chaired by CISA and the chairs of the Information Technology (IT) and Communications Sector Coordinating Councils. The Task Force is working to identify and manage risks to the global ICT supply chain and is comprised of 40 industry partners from the IT and Communications Sectors and 20 interagency partners from the United States Government.</p><p>In its first year, the Task Force focused on four priority areas of policy concern for supply chain risk management, including: Information Sharing, Threat Evaluation, Qualified Bidder Lists and Qualified Manufacture Lists, and Policy Recommendations to Incentive Purchase of ICT from Original Equipment Manufacturers and Authorized Resellers.</p><p>In September of 2019, the Task Force released an Interim Report providing a status update on activities and objectives of the Task Force. The report outlines the overall structure of the Task Force, including the four Working Groups, areas of discussion, and relevant key findings. The Interim Report serves as an important building block for the second year of the Task Force, including strategic priorities and recommendations.</p><p>Among these priorities is enhancing information sharing about supply chain risks with a particular focus on potential adversaries. The Task Force identified current gaps in the ability of government to collect relevant information on bad actors, the ability to use that information as part of an overall evaluation of trusted vendors, and the ability for that information to be shared with the private sector. Crucially, the Task Force also identified limitations on private-to-private information sharing regarding supply chain risks because of lingering legal concerns. Going forward, the Task Force is establishing a Working Group of lawyers from industry and government to address these hurdles and make recommendations for legal and regulatory changes; in addition, the Task Force is likely to identify the necessary components of an enhanced information sharing environment that can take advantage of factors that contribute to understanding as to whether vendors can be trusted.</p><p>Another effort of the Task Force will be related to taking the output from the Threat Evaluation Working Group - which identified nine types of supply chain threats and related scenarios - and making recommendations as to how the identified threats and threat scenarios can inform risk management programs for government agencies, and large and small businesses alike. These threats - whether from counterfeit parts, insider threats, poor cybersecurity practices, or market forces - need to be accounted for in effective supply chain risk management programs.</p><p>On May 15, 2019, the President signed Executive Order (EO) 13873: Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain. This EO declares a national emergency with respect to the threat posed by foreign adversaries to the Nation's information and communications technology supply chain. Specifically, the EO addresses concerns that \"foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services, which store and communicate vast amounts of sensitive information, facilitate the digital economy, and support critical infrastructure and vital emergency services, in order to commit malicious cyber-enabled actions, including economic and industrial espionage against the United States and its people. \"DHS, specifically CISA, plays a key role in the EO, which requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \"assess and identify entities, hardware, software, and services that present vulnerabilities that pose the greatest potential consequences to the national security of the United States.\" CISA coordinated with federal and private partners to assess what ICT hardware, software, and services (referred to individually in this report as elements) present the greatest vulnerabilities in U.S. infrastructure and pose the greatest consequences, this assessment was completed in August 2019.</p><p>Mitigating the Risks</p><p>CISA works with our private sector partners every day to help them protect their networks and their data from bad actors, using some of the previously-mentioned tools and coordination activities. However, as we work with the private sector to help them secure their information, CISA has published the Cyber Essentials guide for leaders of small business and small and local government to show basic steps that can be taken on their own to improve their cybersecurity posture:</p><p>* Employ a backup solution that automatically and continuously backs up critical data and system configurations;</p><p>* Enable automatic updates whenever possible;</p><p>* Replace unsupported operating systems, applications, and hardware; and</p><p>* Test and deploy patches quickly.</p><p>Along with these steps, companies must develop a culture, at all levels, that reinforces cybersecurity essentials. Corporate leaders should drive cybersecurity strategy, investment, and culture by learning how much of their organization's operations are dependent on IT and by leading the development of cybersecurity policies. Promoting security awareness and vigilance through training and maintaining awareness of cyber risks among all employees is vital. Critical assets and applications must be protected through implementing secure hardware and software configurations and leveraging email and web browser security settings to protect against spoofed or modified emails and unsecured webpages. Companies must manage their operational footprint, access, and identities to ensure that only those that require access to the corporate network receive permissions. Knowing who is on your network, using multi-factor authentication for administrative privileges and remote access, and issuing unique passwords for all user accounts is important in this area. Finally, information should always be backed up and protected by instituting rules such as establishing regular automated backups and redundancies of key systems and deploying malware protection capabilities, with an organization's most critical data encrypted, including Personally Identifiable Information, or PII, particularly when it is \"at rest,\" in storage.</p><p>Even if an organization implements these steps, it must be ready and prepared to respond and recover from a potential cyber incident and breach of personal data. Companies should develop incident response and disaster recovery plans, as well as a personal data breach response plan. Business impact assessments should be leveraged to prioritize resources and identify which systems must be recovered first. Internal reporting structures must be built to detect, communicate and contain an attack. IT security officials should have already determined who to call for help when an incident takes place, whether it is outside partners, vendors, government/industry responders such as CISA, technical advisors or law enforcement. Planning should occur before a potential cyber incident to determine which in-house containment measures can be applied to limit the impact of the cyber incident when it occurs.</p><p>Administrative Subpoena Authorities</p><p>Finally, CISA supports Congress's efforts to address a significant gap in the protection of critical infrastructure through the introduction of legislation, such as the Cybersecurity and Vulnerability Disclosure Act (S. 3045). Today, our Nation's adversaries can use publicly available, easily accessible tools to detect vulnerable systems operating our Nation's critical infrastructure that are connected to the public internet. While CISA is aware of these vulnerable online systems operating critical infrastructure, the Agency is unable to identify the vulnerable system's owners or operators.</p><p>The Internet service providers (ISPs), who can identify and provide contact information for these operators, are generally prohibited by law from disclosing this information to the federal government. If Congress provides CISA with a legal mechanism to obtain very limited information regarding the contact details for the affected entity, the Internet service providers could legally provide it.</p><p>The authority CISA seeks is limited in scope and would provide the Agency with a necessary tool to help secure our Nation's critical infrastructure from cyber-attacks. CISA does not seek to change the voluntary nature of our cybersecurity support to industry. Ultimately, our goal is to enable that broader collective defense against cybersecurity threats, where government and industry understand the risks we face and are prepared to defend against them. We look forward to working with Congress on this legislation.</p><p>In the face of increasingly sophisticated threats, CISA employees stand on the front lines of the Federal Government's efforts to defend our Nation's networks and critical infrastructure. The threat environment is complex and dynamic with interdependencies that add to the challenge. As new risks emerge, we must better integrate cyber and physical risk responses in order to effectively secure the Nation. CISA contributes unique expertise and capabilities to mitigate cyber-physical risk.</p><p>I recognize and appreciate the Subcommittee's strong support and diligence as it works to understand this evolving risk and identify additional authorities and resources needed to address it head on. We at CISA are committed to working with Congress to ensure our efforts cultivate a safer, more secure, and resilient Homeland through our efforts 6 to defend today and secure tomorrow.</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Subcommittee today, and I look forward to your questions.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7044161 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7044161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC5-4T71-DYG2-R0S8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2828\"/><timeReceived>6:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 6, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Attorney General Barr has emphasized the importance of cybersecurity, having spoken publicly about the risks our telecommunications sector faces, especially from China, and personally announced charges against Chinese military hackers. Prior to that, in February 2018, then-Attorney General Sessions established a Cyber-Digital Task Force to canvass how the Department combats the global cyber threat and to identify how law enforcement can more effectively accomplish its mission in this area. The Task Force's July 2018 report/1 did just that, and I will draw from it in my testimony today.</p><p>Below I will outline some of the threats we have identified, particularly from foreign nation-states, and how we have responded through our investigations and other operational work, before going on to describe some of the legislative changes that, we believe, would help us better confront them.</p><p>I. Cyber Threats from Foreign Nation States</p><p>A. State-Sponsored Intrusions</p><p>Beginning in 2012, the Department's National Security Division shifted our approach to malicious cyber activity sponsored by foreign nation states. Applying the rationale that all tools of government power should be brought to bear on national security threats, we began opening criminal investigations of state-sponsored computer intrusions and attacks, with the intention of identifying, charging, arresting, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting those responsible according to the same Principles of Federal Prosecution that apply in other, purely criminal contexts. We took this approach based on lessons learned from the counter-terrorism and counter-espionage contexts, where our objectives include a mix of intelligence collection and detection, disruption of illegal activity, and deterrence, and law enforcement has proven effective at those ends, especially when combined with other Executive Branch efforts. Since then, our investigations have exposed a number of disturbing trends.</p><p>First, China, in particular, has for years sponsored computer intrusions to steal trade secrets and other confidential business information from American companies (among others) for the apparent benefit of its own industries, to give them a competitive advantage or to advance its military:</p><p>* In 2014, for example, a grand jury in Pittsburgh, Pa., indicted five Chinese military hackers for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses directed at six American victims in the U.S. nuclear power, metals and solar products industries. According to the indictment, the defendants conspired to steal information from those entities that would be useful to their competitors in China, including state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including trade secrets, communications about business strategy, cost and pricing information, and litigation strategy./2</p><p>* Later that year, Su Bin, a Chinese engineer, was arrested in Canada at the Department's request, on charges that he conspired with Chinese military officers to target U.S. defense contractors in order to steal military technical data related to aircraft. Su used his expertise to advise the military officers which companies to target, what files to steal, and why it was significant. (He was ultimately sent to federal court in Los Angeles, Cal., where he pled guilty and was sentenced to prison.)/3</p><p>* In October 2018, a San Diego, Cal., grand jury indicted Chinese intelligence officers, among others, on charges of conspiring to steal turbofan technology used in U.S. and European commercial airliners. According to the charges in that case, the defendants relied on computer hackers to infiltrate company networks, but they were assisted by employees of a victim company who were working in China and who are accused of facilitating the computer intrusions./4</p><p>* And in December 2018, the Department unsealed charges in Manhattan, N.Y., against two Chinese nationals accused of working in association with a Chinese intelligence service (the Ministry of State Security) in a global campaign of computer intrusions targeting managed service providers (MSPs), which are companies that remotely manage the information technology infrastructure of businesses and governments around the world. According to the charges, the conspiracy targeted a diverse array of commercial activity, industries and technologies, including aviation, satellite and maritime technology, industrial factory automation, automotive supplies, laboratory instruments, banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, computer processor technology, information technology services, packaging, consulting, medical equipment, healthcare, biotechnology, pharmaceutical manufacturing, mining, and oil and gas exploration and production./5</p><p>That activity violated China's 2015 commitment to stop stealing trade secrets and other confidential business information through computer hacking \"with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.\"/6</p><p>As we have spoken about in other forums, breaches like these (as well as trade secret thefts committed by company insiders) leach hard-earned intellectual property from American firms, unjustly enrich Chinese firms, and, at scale, threaten our economic security./7</p><p>Second, China has also targeted large stores of personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), and the like. In February, an Atlanta, Ga., grand jury indicted four Chinese military hackers on charges of hacking into the computer systems of the credit reporting agency Equifax in 2017, where, according to the indictment, they stole names, addresses, birthdates, and social security numbers belonging to nearly half of all American citizens (and driver's license numbers belonging to millions).</p><p>As the Attorney General said in announcing the charges, this data breach was \"of a piece with other Chinese illegal acquisitions of sensitive personal data,\" including the theft of personnel records from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management./9 Bulk thefts of sensitive personal data like these can support China's development of artificial intelligence tools as well as aid their intelligence services in targeting U.S. government employees and those they work with.</p><p>The Department has been increasingly concerned about the national security consequences of sensitive personal data falling into our adversaries' hands. For a few reasons, the theft of PII, PHI, locational data, electronic communications, and the like is more than an inconvenience and can present more than a risk of criminal identity theft or embarrassment to an individual victim. First, there is vastly more information about us and our habits stored online than there ever was before, and with the proliferation of connected devices, the volume of that information will continue to increase exponentially./10</p><p>Second, while any individual piece of consumer data is probably not a national security secret, a mosaic of personal information can enable computer hackers and intelligence officers alike to better target us, by guessing our passwords, tricking us into responding to a phishing request, or, more darkly, exploiting our weaknesses, fears, or ambitions. Third, the extent to which we are connected to each other (online and otherwise) means that information about people who do not themselves know national security or corporate secrets (perhaps our friends and relatives) can be exploited to target those of us who do. And, fourth, as recent studies have shown,/11 even masked or purely transactional information, when collected in bulk, can be very revealing when mined and analyzed./12</p><p>All too often, privacy is spoken about as if it is a value opposed to law enforcement. But, in fact, our prosecutions vindicate the right to privacy, whether it is the right of a company to control who has access to its trade secrets; or the expectation of privacy we have in our e-mail communications and medical records. When a company faces retaliation through exposure of its internal communications, a political campaign's e-mails are hacked and dumped, or an Olympic athlete's medical records are exposed online, we will respond to these violations of privacy, both by investigating and charging those responsible (as we have in all of those situations) and by working to mitigate the harm (such as by working with providers and foreign law enforcement in countries where the stolen information is hosted to facilitate takedown requests).</p><p>It is troubling, however, that our efforts to hold nation states and ordinary criminals alike accountable for their violations of privacy (among other crimes) are increasingly stymied by providers that seem determined to frustrate law enforcement access, not just to prevent unauthorized intrusions by bad actors. To be sure, the increasing prevalence of encryption has raised the baseline of protection and privacy we all enjoy, and it has been a net social benefit. As the Attorney General has observed, encryption \"provides enormous benefits to society by enabling secure communications, data storage, and on-line transactions,\" and \"[b]ecause of advances in encryption, we can now better protect our personal information; more securely engage in e-commerce and internet communications; obtain secure software updates; and limit access to sensitive computers, devices, and networks.\"/13</p><p>But encryption, like other decisions requiring tradeoffs between functionality and security, is not an all-or-nothing proposition. In the Department of Justice's opinion, in some circumstances, companies have gone well past the point of ensuring, to a high degree of confidence, that unauthorized outsiders cannot compromise the security of your communications, choosing instead to blind both themselves and law enforcement officials attempting to execute court-authorized warrants to the malicious activity occurring on their platforms. In the United States, that decision might qualify as a marketing opportunity. Yet, some of these same companies willingly accommodate the demands of authoritarian regimes by relocating data centers to enable warrantless, bulk surveillance; disabling features and applications used by pro-democracy advocates; and otherwise catering to the whims of the politically powerful, where doing so is a pre-requisite for market access./14</p><p>Their systems design, in other words, reflects a business decision, not an immutable principle. As the Attorney General has said about engaging with the private sector on this issue, it is well past time for the tech community to \"abandon the indefensible posture that a technical solution is not worth exploring, and instead turn their considerable talent and ingenuity to developing products that will reconcile good cybersecurity to the imperative of public safety and national security.\"/15</p><p>B. The Rule of Law</p><p>China is not limited to using intelligence and military officers and their proxies to hack U.S. systems. The legal environment in China--the authorities the Communist Party can bring to bear on Chinese companies and individuals to cooperate, combined with the government's failure to honor its commitments or to respect the rule of law and legal process more generally--has grave implications for trusting Chinese companies beholden to that political party for success.</p><p>Starting in 2014, the Chinese Communist Party began enacting an interrelated package of national security, cyberspace, and law enforcement legislation. They include the 2014 Counterespionage Law, the 2015 National/State Security Law, the 2015 Counterterrorism Law, the 2016 Foreign Non-Governmental Organization Law, the 2017 Cybersecurity Law, and the 2017 National Intelligence Law, and most recently, the 2019 Cryptography Law. Together, these laws reflect President Xi Jinping's effort to transform Chinese national and state security in accordance with his vision of the \"China Model.\"/16</p><p>While some of the provisions of these laws could support legitimate, defensive national security activities, the 2017 Cybersecurity Law and the 2017 National Intelligence Law, in particular, impose affirmative legal responsibilities on Chinese and foreign citizens, companies, and organizations operating in China to provide access, cooperation, and support for Beijing's intelligence gathering activities. Other provisions, such as those contained in the 2019 Cryptography Law, impose requirements that will expose commercial encryption used within China to testing and certification by the Chinese government, potentially facilitating those same intelligence activities.</p><p>.</p><p>Article 28 of the 2017 Cybersecurity Law states, \"[n]etwork operators shall provide technical support and assistance to public security organs and national security organs that are safe guarding national security and investigating criminal activities in accordance with the law.\"/17</p><p>Article 7 of the 2017 National Intelligence Law states explicitly, \"[a]ny organization and citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law, and maintain the secrecy of all knowledge of state intelligence work.\"18 Article 26 of the 2019 Cryptography Law requires any \"[c]ommercial cryptography products that involve national security, the national welfare and the people's livelihood, or the societal public interest\" to be tested and certified by Chinese government authorities, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the 2017 Cybersecurity Law.19 None of these laws provide much, if any, detail about legal procedures or judicial oversight available to challenge Chinese government demands. These laws are not merely defensive in nature: they enable the Chinese government to make affirmative demands on its people and entities to advance the Communist Party's interest.</p><p>While it demands obedience to the law from its firms - as well as foreign firms that choose to operate within its borders - on the one hand, the Chinese government has demonstrated a willingness to break its commitments and disregard our laws, on the other. In 2015, China and the United States agreed to cooperate with requests to investigate computer crime, collect electronic evidence, and mitigate malicious cyber activity emanating from their respective territories. Yet in 2017, when the Department invoked that commitment to request assistance in connection with an investigation of a purported Internet security firm for trade secret theft, we received no meaningful response.</p><p>Since 2001, the United States and China have had a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAA). The Agreement creates an obligation, after one country makes a request to the other, to share evidence and provide other assistance \"in investigations, in prosecutions, and in proceedings related to criminal matters.\" Over the past 10 years, however, China has rarely produced bank records or similar business transactional records pursuant to the United States' MLAA requests. In the few cases where China produced records, they were incomplete, untimely, or inadmissible./20</p><p>On the other hand, when we exercise our authorities as federal prosecutors to compel businesses located here to produce records, the Chinese government threatens them not to comply, on pain of sanctions under their laws./21</p><p>And when a foreign government cooperates with the United States, in our effort to vindicate our laws and protect our people, that government may face threats and reprisals from China, such as economic pressure or even the detention of its nationals on trumped-up charges.</p><p>For these reasons, among others, the Department has been sounding the alarm about Chinese providers that are ultimately subject to direction or control by the Communist Party. All too often we talk about the security of a product or service in a simplistic way: whether there is proof that a company has already conducted illicit surveillance, for example. But if we wait for a smoking gun in this context, we might get shot.</p><p>Whether a company has a culture that promotes theft, dishonesty, or obstruction of justice is just as relevant, because it tells you how the company will behave when it suits its interests. And that is all the more true if the company operates in a legal environment, like China's, where success depends on cooperation with the authorities, no matter how sweeping or illegal their requests. As the Attorney General wrote to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai late last year, urging the FCC to designate Huawei and ZTE as threats to the telecommunications supply chain that are ineligible for FCC programs, \"Surely a willingness to break U.S. law combined with a determination to avoid the consequences by obstructing justice argues against the reliability of a provider.\"/22</p><p>Our cases show that the Chinese government will use the employees of Chinese companies doing business here, and Chinese employees of foreign companies in China, to engage in illegal activity. Last year, for example, a former airline ticket counter agent pleaded guilty to acting as an agent of the Chinese government, without notification to the Attorney General, by working at the direction and control of military officers assigned to China's Mission to the United Nations. During her employment at JFK airport in New York for a Chinese Air Carrier, she accepted packages from PRC military officers, and placed those packages aboard flights to China as unaccompanied luggage or checked in the packages under the names of other passengers flying on those flights. She encouraged her coworkers to assist the military officers, telling them that, because the Air Carrier was a Chinese company, their primary loyalty should be to China. But covertly doing the Chinese military's bidding on U.S. soil is a crime, and the defendant and the Chinese military took advantage of a commercial enterprise to evade legitimate U.S. government oversight, violating TSA regulations./23</p><p>This record--of intent, capability, and practice of exploiting access to U.S. systems; and of violating our laws and refusing to honor commitments--has led this Administration to take unprecedented steps to protect our critical infrastructure. In July 2018, for example, the Executive Branch recommended that the FCC deny an application for a license to offer international telecommunications services in the United States. The applicant was a subsidiary of China Mobile Communications Corporation (a Chinese state-owned enterprise and the world's largest mobile carrier). The Justice Department led the national security and law enforcement review of the application, and the Executive Branch's recommendation highlights the risks of granting a Chinese SOE common carrier status and, with it, access to trusted, peering relationships with American carriers./24</p><p>We considered a number of factors, including whether the applicant's planned operations would provide opportunities</p><p>* to disrupt our communications infrastructure;</p><p>* to enable economic espionage; or</p><p>* to undermine authorized law enforcement or national security missions.</p><p>Because China Mobile is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government, we advised the FCC that granting China Mobile's application would pose unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks. And we were gratified when the FCC accepted that recommendation and denied the application, in May 2019.</p><p>Cases like China Mobile have brought home to the Department how important our foreign investment review work is to protecting our equities in law enforcement, counterintelligence, and telecom security.</p><p>* That is why, during the first two years of this Administration, we co-led more CFIUS reviews than in the five years before that, combined.</p><p>* That is why we have renamed the staff that conducts these reviews to be a \"Section,\" and reorganized its management structure, to match other operational components of NSD.</p><p>* And that is why the President's FY2020 budget for the Department significantly increased the staff and other resources devoted to this work; an increase, fortunately, that Congress approved.</p><p>To be clear, China is not the only country whose political and legal environment presents a challenge. As we found during an investigation of a software company that performed contract work for the Defense Department, even an American firm can present risks, depending on where it performs critical functions. In that case, the vendor used a Russian back office to code software intended for a classified network. But under a legal regime known as the Russian System of Operative-Investigative Measures (\"SORM\"), that software was subject to collection by Russia's Federal Security Service (the \"FSB\"), raising a risk that the FSB could gather information about our defense networks./25</p><p>Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security barred federal agencies from using Kaspersky anti-virus software, because it was concerned about the ties between Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence, and because Russian law allows Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky, and to intercept communications on Russian networks. The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicated U.S. national security./26</p><p>II. New Ideas to Combat Cyber Threats</p><p>In the face of these disturbing and ever-increasing threats, I know the Subcommittee has on its mind a key question: How can Congress help, today? The good news is that, as the Attorney General's Cyber-Digital Task Force concluded, there are several key changes to Federal law that would greatly aid our work to combat threats online.</p><p>A. Data Breach Notification</p><p>In 2018, the White House's Council of Economic Advisors observed that most data breaches are not reported to the U.S. government./27</p><p>This reluctance may be driven by a fear of regulatory action, of reputational harm, or of an interruption to business operations. The reluctance of organizations and businesses to disclose that they have been attacked constitutes a major challenge for the U.S. government in its battle against cybercrime. Law enforcement cannot be effective without the cooperation of crime victims. A lack of cooperation may not only prevent discovery of evidence that could lead to identifying and holding the threat actors accountable, but also creates barriers to fully understanding the threat environment.</p><p>The Department has been actively evaluating statutory data breach notification requirements. Currently, there is no federal reporting requirement or standard. All 50 States have enacted separate notification laws setting standards governing notification by private entities when a data breach occurs, and companies must navigate and comply with the varying requirements in multiple jurisdictions. In the wake of recent high-profile data breaches exposing Americans' personal information, there is revived interest in national notification requirements.</p><p>As you and your colleagues consider a national data breach standard, we would urge you to follow the model of many State statutes and include a requirement to promptly notify law enforcement in addition to, and in advance of, notification of impacted consumers. Government notification would increase Federal law enforcement's ability to pursue hackers and prevent data breaches. The Administration is actively working on proposed legislation, and we look forward to working with Congress on this important issue.</p><p>B. Deterring Insider Threats</p><p>I would like to spend the balance of my time today focusing on areas of concern in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\") and related statutes that currently hamper our work to combat threats online. The CFAA is the primary Federal law against hacking. It protects the public against criminals who intrude into computers to steal information, install malicious software, and delete files. It was also intended to criminalize malicious conduct by insiders who abuse their right of access to computer systems and networks to commit online crime. The CFAA, in short, reflects our baseline expectation that people are entitled to have control over their own computers and are entitled to trust that the information they store in their computers remains safe.</p><p>The CFAA was enacted in 1986, at a time when the problem of online crime was still in its infancy. Over the years, Congress has enacted a series of measured, modest changes to the CFAA to encompass new technologies and to equip law enforcement to respond to changing threats. The CFAA has not been amended since 2008, however, and the intervening years have again witnessed the need for the enactment of modest, incremental changes. The CFAA needs to be updated to make sure that it continues to appropriately deter violations of Americans' privacy and security.</p><p>At its core, the CFAA is a privacy statute, because it deters criminals from stealing peoples' information. Yet, the CFAA's privacy protections now contain a significant gap. The statute was meant to apply both to hackers who gain access to victim computers without authorization from halfway around the world, and to so-called \"insiders\" who have some authorization to access a computer -- like company employees entitled to access a sensitive database for specified work purposes -- but who intentionally abuse that access. The part of the CFAA that covers the conduct of those who have some authorization to access a computer is the tool that Department prosecutors have used to charge, for example, police officers who misuse their access to confidential criminal records databases in order to look up sensitive information about a boyfriend or girlfriend, who sell access to private records to others, or who provide confidential law enforcement information to a charged drug trafficker. As a recent survey of 472 cybersecurity professionals indicated, 90% percent of organizations feel vulnerable to insider attacks, and 53% have confirmed insider attacks against their organization in the previous 12 months. The survey also found that the type of data most vulnerable to insider attacks is confidential business information, and that a plurality of those surveyed estimated that the potential cost/loss of an insider attack was between $100,000 and $500,000./28</p><p>Unfortunately, recent judicial decisions have limited the Government's ability to prosecute such cases. As a result, in circuits covered by these decisions, insiders cannot be charged under the CFAA -- even where the insider has intentionally exceeded the bounds of his legitimate access to confidential information and has caused significant harm to his employer and to the people, often everyday Americans, whose data he has improperly accessed.</p><p>The insider threat is relevant to voting security. Currently, for example, if a foreign hacker accessed a State's voter registration database over the Internet, that could be charged under the CFAA as an access \"without authorization.\" But if an insider, such as a State government employee, used his privileges to access the same information, that insider could not be prosecuted under the CFAA, at least as several courts have interpreted the statute.</p><p>The narrow judicial interpretation of the term \"exceeds authorized access\" in the CFAA stems from concerns that the statute potentially makes relatively trivial conduct a Federal crime. We understand the concerns of the courts, and I would like to reiterate that the Department of Justice has no interest in prosecuting harmless violations, to the extent that the statute could be construed to cover them.</p><p>However, by essentially barring CFAA prosecutions of insiders in certain circuits, these court decisions have constrained our ability to bring certain cybercriminals to justice. Over the last several years, numerous Department of Justice officials have called on Congress to address this issue in a manner that would maintain the law's key privacy-protecting function, while providing further reassurance that trivial violations of things like a website's terms of service will not be prosecuted as Federal crimes.</p><p>The Department supports efforts that would accomplish this task. This can be done by reaffirming that the definition of \"exceeds authorized access\" includes the situation where the person accesses the computer for a purpose that he knows is not authorized by the computer owner. Such an amendment is necessary to ensure the nationwide ability to prosecute, for example, a law enforcement officer who is permitted access to criminal records databases, but only for official business purposes. At the same time, a legislative fix could add further limitations that reflect the statute's focus. For example, a limitation could be put into the CFAA making clear that in order to constitute a crime under the new insider provision, not only must an offender access a protected computer in excess of authorization and obtain information, but the information must be worth $5,000 or more, the access must be in furtherance of a separate felony offense, or the information must be stored on a government computer.</p><p>We strongly believe that the insider threat problem in the CFAA can be fixed in a way that empowers the Department to prosecute and deter significant threats to privacy and security and further assures that prosecutions will remain focused on such crimes. Of all of the reforms to the CFAA under consideration by this Subcommittee, addressing this problem would have the most immediate, significant impact in improving our ability to punish and deter cybercriminals. We would like to work closely with Congress and, specifically, this Subcommittee, to find a way forward on this pressing issue.</p><p>C. Certain Malicious Activities as RICO Predicates</p><p>We support the efforts to update the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") to make CFAA offenses and certain Wiretap Act offenses subject to RICO as was proposed in the International Cybercrime Prevention Act (\"ICPA\"), which was sponsored by Senator Graham and the Ranking Member in the last Congress. As computer technology has evolved, it has become a key tool of organized crime. Criminal organizations operating around the world hack into public and private computer systems, including systems key to America's national security and defense. They hijack computers to steal Americans' identity and financial information; they extort American businesses with threats to disrupt computers; and they commit a range of other online crimes.</p><p>Accordingly, much of the fight against transnational organized crime has moved online. Federal prosecutors have used RICO for over forty years to prosecute organized criminals ranging from mob bosses to Hells Angels to members of MS-13. Just as RICO has proven to be an effective tool to prosecute the leaders of these organizations who may not have been directly involved in committing the underlying crimes, it should be a tool to fight criminal organizations that use computer intrusions and other CFAA violations to further their schemes. These changes, as proposed in ICPA, would simply make clear that all types of CFAA violations should be considered criminal activities under the RICO statute, with the associated heavy penalties.</p><p>D. Protecting Election Computers from Attack</p><p>Protecting election infrastructure from attack is another important goal. Yet, as the Department's recent Cyber-Digital Task Force report noted, \"should hacking of a voting machine occur, the government would not, in many conceivable circumstances, be able to use the CFAA to prosecute the hackers.\"/29</p><p>The CFAA's current definition of \"protected computer\" includes computers \"affecting interstate or foreign commerce,\" a definition that attempts to encompass the breadth of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. We are concerned that courts might conclude that the Commerce Clause power, alone, does not reach voting machine computers that are not used in a commercial setting, are not used in interstate communication, and are typically never connected to the Internet or to any other network.</p><p>The Department and each of its components has consistently recognized the primacy of State and local jurisdictions in the administration and policing of electoral processes under Article I, Section 4, of the Constitution. Accordingly, the Department remains committed to its longstanding policy in criminal law enforcement against operations, actions, or public statements that would interfere with State and local election administration, or appear to do so. Nevertheless, the Constitution in that same Section also provides for a federal role in regulating elections that include federal candidates on the ballot, and we believe that this provision provides additional support for an amendment that would cover election-related hacking.</p><p>Expanding the definition of a protected computer to include electronic voting machines will strengthen confidence in the integrity of our electoral system and ensure that any attempts to manipulate the results of an election can be prosecuted to the fullest extent under Federal law. We therefore applaud the Senate's passage of the Defending the Integrity of Voting Systems Act last year, which would accomplish this important goal.</p><p>E. Botnets</p><p>Another striking example of online crime that victimizes Americans is the threat from botnets -- networks of victim computers surreptitiously infected with malicious software, or \"malware.\" Once a computer is infected with malware, it can be controlled remotely from another computer with a so-called \"command and control\" server. Using that control, criminals (including nation-state actors) can steal usernames, passwords, and other personal and financial information from the computer user, or hold computers and computer systems for ransom. Criminals can also use armies of infected computers to commit other crimes, such as DDoS attacks, or to conceal their identities and locations while perpetrating crimes ranging from drug dealing to online child sexual exploitation.</p><p>The scale and sophistication of the threat posed by botnets is increasing every day. Individual hackers and organized criminal groups are using state-of-the-art techniques to infect hundreds of thousands -- sometimes millions -- of computers and cause massive financial losses, all while becoming increasingly difficult to detect. If we want security to keep pace with criminals' technological innovations, we need to ensure that we have a variety of effective tools to combat rapidly evolving cyber threats like these.</p><p>One powerful tool that the Department has used to disrupt botnets and free victim computers from criminal malware is the civil injunction process. Current law gives Federal courts the authority to issue injunctions to stop the ongoing commission of certain crimes by authorizing actions that prevent a continuing and substantial injury. This authority played a critical role in the Department's successful disruption of the Coreflood botnet in 2011 and of the Gameover Zeus botnet in 2014. (The Gameover Zeus botnet, which infected computers worldwide, inflicted over $100 million in losses on American victims alone, many of them small- and medium-sized businesses.) Because the criminals behind these particular botnets used them to commit fraud against banks and bank customers, existing law allowed the Department to obtain court authority to disrupt the botnets by taking actions such as disabling communications between infected computers and the command and control servers.</p><p>The problem is that current law permits courts to consider injunctions only for limited categories of crimes, including certain frauds and illegal wiretapping. Botnets, however, can be used for many different types of illegal activity. They can be used to steal sensitive corporate information, to harvest email account addresses, to hack other computers, or to execute denial of service attacks against websites or other computers. Yet -- depending on the facts of any given case -- these crimes may not constitute fraud or illegal wiretapping. In those cases, courts may lack the statutory authority to consider an application by prosecutors for an injunction to disrupt the botnets in the same way that injunctions were successfully used to incapacitate the Coreflood and Gameover Zeus botnets.</p><p>Thus, we support the provision in ICPA that would add activities like the operation of a malicious botnet to the list of offenses eligible for injunctive relief. ICPA would allow the Department to seek an injunction to prevent ongoing hacking violations in cases where 100 or more victim computers have been hacked. This numerical threshold focuses the injunctive authority on enjoining the creation, maintenance, operation, or use of a malicious botnet, as well as other widespread attacks on computers using malicious software (such as ransomware).</p><p>The same legal safeguards that currently apply to obtaining civil injunctions, and that applied to the injunctions obtained by the Department in the Coreflood and Gameover Zeus cases, would also apply under the ICPA proposal. Before an injunction is issued, the Government must civilly sue the defendant and demonstrate to a court that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its lawsuit and that the public interest favors an injunction; the defendants and enjoined parties have the right to notice and to have a hearing before a permanent injunction is issued; and the defendants and enjoined parties may move to quash or modify any injunctions that the court issues.</p><p>I would now like to turn to the criminal statutes that prohibit the creation and use of botnets. Unfortunately, these statutes also contain shortcomings. We find that criminals continue to find new ways to make money illegally through botnets. Law enforcement officers now frequently observe that creators and operators of botnets not only use botnets for their own illicit purposes, but also sell or even rent access to the infected computers to other criminals.</p><p>Current criminal law prohibits the creation of a malicious botnet because it prohibits hacking into computers without authorization. It also prohibits the use of botnets to commit other crimes. But it is not similarly clear that the law prohibits the sale or renting of a botnet. In one case, for example, undercover officers discovered that a criminal was offering to sell a botnet consisting of thousands of victim computers. The officers accordingly \"bought\" the botnet from the criminal and notified the victims that their computers were infected. The operation, however, did not result in a prosecutable U.S. offense because there was no evidence that the seller himself had created the botnet in question. While trafficking in botnets is sometimes chargeable under other subsections of the CFAA, this problem has resulted in, and will increasingly result in, the inability to prosecute individuals selling or renting access to thousands of hacked computers.</p><p>We believe that it should be illegal to sell or rent surreptitious control over infected computers to another person, just like it is already clearly illegal to sell or transfer computer passwords. That is why we support the provision in ICPA to prohibit the sale or transfer not only of \"password[s] and similar information\" (the wording of the existing statute) but also of \"means of access,\" which would include the ability to access computers that were previously hacked and are now part of a botnet. In addition, we recommend replacing the current requirement that the Government prove that the offender had an \"intent to defraud\" with a requirement to prove that the offender not only knew his conduct is \"wrongful,\" but also that he knew or should have known that the means of access would be used to hack or damage a computer. This last change is necessary because, as noted above, criminals do not use botnets only to commit fraud -- they also use them to commit a variety of other crimes.</p><p>Some commentators have raised the concern that this proposal would chill the activities of legitimate security researchers, academics, and system administrators. The Department takes this concern seriously. We have no interest in prosecuting such individuals, and our proposal would not prohibit legitimate activity. That is because the Government should have the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the individual intentionally undertook an act (trafficking in a means of access) that he or she knew to be wrongful. The Government should similarly have to prove that the individual knew or had reason to know that the means of access would be used to commit a crime by hacking someone else's computer without authorization.</p><p>ICPA's approach makes clear that ordinary conduct by legitimate security researchers and others is not a crime. We believe that ICPA's botnet injunction provision strikes the proper balance in prohibiting the pernicious conduct I have described without chilling the activities of those who are trying to improve cybersecurity for us all.</p><p>F. Enhanced Penalties for Malicious Activity Directed at Critical Infrastructure</p><p>The Department also supports the efforts in ICPA to strengthen the criminal code to better deter malicious activities directed at computers and networks that control our critical infrastructures. As I have discussed, America's open and technologically complex society includes, as a part of its critical infrastructure, numerous vulnerable targets. While the CFAA's maximum penalties apply to malicious efforts to harm the computers and networks that run our critical infrastructure, the statute does not currently require any enhanced penalties for such conduct. While it is reasonable to believe that judges would impose appropriate prison terms if malicious activity severely debilitates a critical infrastructure system, it is possible that courts may not impose adequate penalties for activities that cause less disruption -- and they could conceivably impose no penalty at all in the case of an attempt that is thwarted before it is completed.</p><p>In light of the grave risk posed by those who might compromise our critical infrastructure, the Department believes that the enhanced penalties for such malicious activity called for in ICPA not only will appropriately punish offenders, but also will more effectively deter others who would engage in misconduct that puts public safety and national security at risk. Criminals and other malicious actors should know that any attempt to damage a vital national resource will result in serious consequences.</p><p>G. Updated Tools for Investigators and Prosecutors</p><p>We have long had concerns about the text of the \"Pen Register and Trap and Trace\" (\"PRTT\") statute that is used, among other things, to support criminal investigations and the security of government networks. The PRTT statute's exceptions -- which, for example, permit a provider, but not a user, of wire or electronic communications services to monitor their own network -- are subtly and inexplicably different than the Wiretap Act's exceptions. The existing language in the PRTT statute has been difficult to apply, resulting in complex legal analyses for services as simple as Caller ID. The Wiretap Act's rules appropriately protect the content of communications; they are more than adequate to protect non-content information, which is much less sensitive. Importing the Wiretap Act's exceptions into the PRTT statute would remedy these problems and result in a more logical framework for applying these two related statutes that regulate the real-time collection of communications. There is no reason why a user of a PRTT device, whether a private or governmental entity, should be precluded from logging his or her own communications. We have proposed language under which the PRTT statute would continue to protect user privacy, but it would no longer inappropriately limit private entities' or the Government's ability to use PRTT devices on their own computer networks.</p><p>Finally, we support several amendments to the CFAA, which are reflected in the ICPA. Key amongst these changes would be amendments to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2513, which would bring the forfeiture provisions of the CFAA in line with other Federal criminal statutes, providing concrete procedures for the forfeiture of property used to commit or facilitate a violation of this statute as well as the proceeds of such violation. These amendments support consistent application of the law, while maintaining the Government's ability to dismantle and disrupt criminal operations and deter future violations, both when prosecutors are able to reach violators and when those violators are located overseas beyond the judicial reach of our courts. The amendments in ICPA are a measured and sensible addition that will help assure that criminal hackers do not profit from their crimes.</p><p>We also support the change in ICPA that would make the sale or advertising of a surreptitious interception device under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2512 a predicate offense under the Federal money laundering statutes. Section 2512, which is part of the Wiretap Act, has proven to be a valuable tool for protecting the privacy of innocent Americans by criminalizing the manufacture, distribution, possession, and advertising of devices, such as spyware, that unlawfully collect private communications. Section 2512 is not a predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. Sec.Sec. 1956 and 1957, however, which impedes the Government's ability to punish and deter certain offenders who conceal and spend their ill-gotten gains by selling and advertising spyware and other illegal interception devices.</p><p>H. Assuring Jurisdiction of Thefts of U.S. Companies' Trade Secrets</p><p>The Economic Espionage Act recognizes that trade secret theft frequently involves an international component (and section 1831 of Title 18 specifically criminalizes trade secret theft committed for the benefit of foreign instrumentalities). However, since the statute came into force in 1996, manufacturing, research, and development have become increasingly dispersed geographically. Just as manufacturing supply chains often cross borders, U.S. firms conduct research and development across international borders, with collaboration between facilities in multiple countries. With this trend, U.S. companies face increasing risk that their trade secrets may be stolen from facilities they own or operate outside U.S. borders.</p><p>Under the current EEA, the Department can prosecute trade secret thefts occurring abroad, but only where either (1) the defendant(s) are U.S. persons or organizations, or (2) an act in furtherance of the offense is committed in the United States. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1837. One illustration of the EEA's extraterritorial reach is the Department's ongoing prosecution of United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., and three Taiwan nationals for theft of trade secrets belonging to Micron Technologies. In that case, the defendants are charged with stealing trade secrets from a Micron facility in Taiwan, but acts in furtherance of the theft were committed within the U.S. However, it is easy to imagine future cases in which trade secrets owned by a U.S. company may be stolen by foreign nationals from facilities outside the U.S., which would fall outside the extraterritorial reach of the current statute. To address this scenario, Congress could amend Section 1837 to permit jurisdiction over extraterritorial conduct, at least in criminal cases, where \"the trade secret owner injured as a result of the offense conduct is a natural person who is a citizen or permanent resident alien of the United States, or an organization organized under the laws of the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof.\"</p><p>III. Conclusion</p><p>I want to thank the Subcommittee again for providing me this opportunity to discuss these important issues on behalf of the Department of Justice. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to improve the Government's ability to counter threats posed by our foreign adversaries in cyberspace. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1.

Accordingly, the Department was pleased to support Congress's recent expansion of authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), by the Foreign Investment Risk Review and Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), to consider investments in U.S. businesses that maintain or collect sensitive personal data of United States citizens that may be exploited in a manner that threatens national security. In regulations implementing this authority, CFIUS defined \"sensitive personal data\" for purposes of its jurisdiction by describing categories of identifiable data that could potentially implicate national security, including financial data that could be used to analyze or determine an individual's distress or hardship, consumer report information, insurance applications, health information, non-public electronic communications, geolocation data, biometric data, government identification information, security clearance status, government employment applications, and genetic tests. 85 Fed. Reg. 3112, 3132 (Jan. 17, 2020) (to be codified at 31 C.F.R. pt. 800.241(a)(1)(ii)). These categories reflect some of the most sensitive types of data that could be used to target individuals in ways that threaten national security. We look forward to working with other members of CFIUS to review qualifying foreign investments with an eye towards protecting national security by safeguarding Americans' sensitive personal data.</p><p>13.

As a result of our investigation, which we resolved without criminal charges, the vendor (Netcracker Technology Corp. (NTC)) agreed to implement an Enhanced Security Plan to increase information security by regulating remote access by Netcracker to its clients' U.S. networks and transfers of sensitive data therefrom. We believe the Enhanced Security Plan (which can be accessed through the above link) is a model of good security practices: it requires Netcracker to use U.S.-based infrastructure to provide certain services to U.S.-based clients; obtain prior, written consent from U.S.-based clients before remotely accessing their networks; and avoid transferring certain categories of sensitive client data outside the U.S. without taking certain precautions. In addition, Netcracker was required to engage an auditor to ensure compliance with the Enhanced Security Plan. Based on our direct engagement with the company as well as external information and analysis to-date, we believe Netcracker has so far complied with its obligations under the agreement.</p><p>26.

Our films include franchises like The Expendables, Hellboy, Rambo, the \"Has Fallen\" Series, and The Hitman's Bodyguard. We develop, produce, and self-finance our own content. Our box office has generated a total of over $1 billion. Our industry, with the other core copyright industries, together contribute $1.3 trillion annually to the U.S. GDP and employ over 5.7 million Americans. So, this is not just about entertainment, it is about a very important economic driver for this country and its citizens.</p><p>Piracy is an existential threat to our business and the livelihoods of all the individual creatives who work so hard to bring entertainment to audiences. Piracy competes unfairly with the legitimate marketplace and destroys the economic basis of creativity. For the past two decades, the plague of digital piracy has been stealing jobs from hardworking Americans.</p><p>The truth is that the battle against piracy has only intensified since the DMCA became law, with too little progress to show for it. At first, the tornado of piracy blew through the music industry - ultimately cutting that industry's revenues by half - but then it continued its destructive path through photography, film, television, journalism, and book publishing. Anything that could be distributed digitally online was stolen and monetized by criminals, facilitated by some of the world's wealthiest internet companies including Google, its now-sibling YouTube, and Facebook.</p><p>A recent study commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that global video piracy costs the U.S. economy at least $29.2 billion in lost revenue each year, and, as much as $71 billion annually. This is a staggering loss, made more so because of the many barriers to stopping it. Piracy is not only facilitated by global criminal operations who are immune to American law enforcement, but also by immense and reputable platforms based in the U.S. who enjoy broad statutory immunity for their actions, or inactions, under current law.</p><p>When the DMCA was written in 1998, Google was in beta. Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube did not exist.</p><p>As you know, at that time, there was a real concern that the threat of legal liability and any form of restriction or regulation would constrain the then-fledgling internet industry. So, through Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act of 1996, internet intermediaries were given legal protection against being treated as publishers or speakers of third-party content. Courts doubled down on Congress' desire to protect the growth of a nascent internet at all costs, effectively granting these intermediaries wholesale immunity from liability for virtually any illegal actions of their users, excepting federal crimes and intellectual property violations.</p><p>Two years later, the DMCA stepped in where the CDA left off, providing internet intermediaries with \"safe harbor\" from copyright infringement liability stemming from their users' actions. On their face, the DMCA \"safe harbors\" are more constrained. They condition liability protection on the intermediaries taking affirmative steps aimed at combatting known infringement. But courts have again doubled down on the then-prevailing \"hands-off\" approach to the internet, in the process effectively eliminating the very safeguards that Congress intended to ensure effective protection for copyright online.</p><p>These laws were designed to promote growth, while also encouraging intermediaries to act responsibly in dealing with clearly abusive conduct. These laws have, without question, succeeded in fueling the unfettered growth of the internet. Unfortunately, they have done little to check the growth of piracy. They have also allowed companies like YouTube to leverage this immunity to build massive and profitable global businesses on the backs of copyright owners and have failed to encourage responsible behavior on the part of many intermediaries.</p><p>These safe harbors created a harmful assumption, and a reality, that copyright infringement was allowed on the internet unless and until a copyright owner found it and objected. As a result, the scale of criminal activity online is so immense, so pervasive and destructive, that current safe harbors, at least as applied to the biggest global digital platforms and intermediaries, cannot be seen as anything but a failure. And, this global criminal piracy ecosystem is directly competing with our films in markets around the world - to the detriment of Americans here at home.</p><p>Under current U.S. law, Google has become one of the largest companies in the world in part by leveraging free infringing content into eyeballs and advertising revenue through its search results and its streaming service YouTube. Just for some context: The last time we did a comprehensive accounting of our films on YouTube, in June 2018, we found over 200 pirated versions of our titles on the platform. These films had been viewed over 110 million times. In just that one month! And, by Google's own admission, it receives almost 900 million takedown notices from copyright holders each year.</p><p>With my partner, I run an independent production company. Our business is film. We finance our projects by entering into deals with international companies prior to production (called territorial pre-sales), giving them exclusive distribution rights in their home countries in exchange for providing a percentage of our production budgets.</p><p>Our partners invest in our films in the hope of monetizing their investments by showing our films in their home countries. In some countries, piracy has eliminated our partners' ability to invest. Even if our films are released on the same day in every country around the world, we still find that every one of these films becomes available online, for free, globally, within days... despite our best efforts at security. Why would any financial partner pay for movies that are being widely offered for free online, knowing full well that they would never be able to recoup their investments?</p><p>I would like to be able to tell you that America is on the front lines of this global fight against piracy, but, unfortunately, that is not true. Other countries around the world have taken the lead.</p><p>The first and most important tool being used abroad is no-fault injunctive relief aimed at blocking access to the market by known, adjudicated pirate sites, referred to by some as \"site blocking.\" I realize that this idea may send some people on the Hill running from the room, particularly those who recall the painful and bitter fight when related legislation was last considered in the United States in 2011. At that time, opponents of copyright managed to convince everyone that such enforcement mechanisms would \"break the internet\" and \"stifle free speech and innovation.\" The problem was that these arguments were based in fearmongering and hyperbole, and there was no real basis for them. But most did not understand that at the time, including many people in our community. Break the internet? I did not want that. Back then, we all thought Silicon Valley was simply trying to make the world a better place. The tech industry and its allies tried to portray the creative community as a rich and greedy behemoth that was trying to take away people's free content and destroy their access to a safe and well-functioning internet.</p><p>Well, I think we all know who the rich and greedy industry behemoth is today, and there are plenty of questions about who can properly wave the guardian banner on behalf of internet users. In this David and Goliath scenario, the creative industry is obviously the David to the Big Tech Goliath. I just hope that this time, the story works out the way it did for David.</p><p>Let's focus on the truth about site-blocking. There are currently at least 34 countries with active site-blocking laws in place around the world, including our Western allies Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In the European Union alone, there are at least 17 member states that offer website blocking as a means of ensuring meaningful online enforcement. As of April 2018, it is estimated that over 1,800 websites and over 5,300 domains used by such sites have been blocked in the European Union (mainly in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Italy, and Portugal).</p><p>The effect of site-blocking has been studied extensively in these countries. It is entirely clear that it is a highly successful tool to fight piracy. In the United Kingdom, according to a Carnegie Mellon study, there was an almost 25% increase in traffic to legitimate sites by the heaviest users of the blocked sites./1</p><p>And, in Australia, a recent report found that piracy traffic has decreased by 25% in the wake of their site-blocking efforts. These trends further prove that consumers happily frequent legitimate online marketplaces when the option of pirate sources becomes less attractive or available. In another Carnegie Mellon study, users purchased legitimately 94% of the time when given search results that did not include pirate websites./2</p><p>Since the first website blocking order went into place in May 2010, notorious piracy site ThePirateBay has been blocked in 19 countries. Isohunt is now blocked in 10 countries and KickAssTorrents is blocked in 11 countries. But, sadly, all of those sites are still available to Americans.</p><p>And the implementation of site-blocking by courts and agencies in these countries has not led to the breaking of the internet.</p><p>And, in those countries, I have seen first-hand that the legitimate marketplace is now healthier. My partners are more willing to pay better license fees because they know that the risk of digital piracy has been reduced. In the United Kingdom, revenues have definitively gone up since site-blocking went into effect. I would like to see America equally committed to creating a healthier legitimate film and television marketplace.</p><p>It is very rare for a film to be released online illegally before the theatrical release. And, at Millennium Media, we have some of the best film security in the world, security that costs us a lot of money. But in 2014, our film, Expendables 3, was stolen by an employee of one of our vendors and released online a month before it could open in theaters. By opening day, the movie had been downloaded 60 million times. It was calculated that we lost about $250 million in box office revenue.</p><p>As I noted earlier, our company depends on territorial pre-sales like that one to Russia to make our movies. We spent about $90 million to make Expendables 3, much of it raised from these territorial pre-sales around the world. At that time, one of our Russian distributors had paid $6 million for the right to release the film in Russian theaters. Because the piracy pre-release destroyed the value of the film in Russia, they went out of business.</p><p>The pirate was eventually caught because of a law enforcement organization in the United Kingdom called PIPCU, the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit, funded by the UK government. Increased resources and directions for the Department of Justice and Homeland Security are a part of any solution to piracy.</p><p>Why wouldn't the U.S. be a leader in preventing access to our market by sites that are clearly illegal, taking money out of the hands of American workers and industry alike? Given that we now have years of experience around the world and have seen different approaches, it is time to evaluate what works and what does not - to protect the interests of American creatives, the American economy, and the American public. Please do not shy away from this important task. We must again be the gold standard of copyright protections for all other countries around the world.</p><p>Silicon Valley's campaign against copyright is never-ending. Google spent more money lobbying the federal government last year than any other American company - fighting, among other things, to erode copyright protections in the U.S. and around the world. Today, Google makes more money than all of the major movie studios and television networks combined. They do not need weaker laws to allow the profitable piracy of our creative work on their platforms. They just need the status quo. I do not understand why Google and other Big Tech companies would continue to justify their own role, and that of pirates, in destroying the value of American creativity. They need to stop.</p><p>We need Congress' help to lift the members of the creative community out of their indentured service to these internet giants and the global criminals they help, and once again give them control over their work and how it is distributed online. The DMCA created a framework that was meant to encourage meaningful cooperation and effective protection against online piracy. But, as we sit here today, it is not producing either one. Internet platforms have failed to live up their side of the bargain, enabled by court decisions eroding the DMCA's core protections in favor of a hands-off approach to the internet. Meanwhile, everyday working creatives and consumers bear the brunt of those decisions. Congress needs to do what it can to ensure that the meaningful protection it intended to achieve through the DMCA does not remain illusory.</p><p>Silicon Valley likes to tell you that they already have solutions to piracy, using filtering technology or content protection tools to catch copyright infringement. As some of you may know, I traveled to DC in December for a Senate roundtable with Google and YouTube executives to discuss why so many of us in the creative community are denied access to this filtering technology. My question is: Why do I have to come to DC to beg for the ability to protect myself with tools that already exist? After two months of back and forth, my company has now been given access to a simpler version of YouTube's filtering technology. But my question remains: Why did I have to make that trip? And what about the thousands of other copyright holders, my peers, who cannot make this trip?</p><p>Full-length piracy of our films has nothing to do with free speech. Criminal operations running piracy sites are not engaged in legitimate \"free speech\" when they steal our movies. I could argue that the only thing \"broken\" about the internet is the lack of law and order that has created the cesspool with which we are all contending today. I ask that you look internationally for examples of what has been successful in the efforts to curb copyright infringement and work here at home to improve our own efforts to ensure a robust and equitable 21st century American copyright framework.</p><p>I have a movie premiering soon about the Battle of Kamdesh in Afghanistan called The Outpost - it's the story of 53 soldiers who stood up to over 400 Taliban, and defeated them. They were the most decorated unit in the Afghanistan War. It took me seven years to get it made.</p><p>Some of the proceeds from this film were intended to help our veterans. But, I know now, seven years later, that as soon as the film is released online, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people will probably stream it illegally in the United States. I do not anticipate that there will be enough profits to share because of piracy. Please tell me how I explain to SFC Jonathan Hill, who fought in the battle and who I have promised to help fund 22 Kill (an organization dedicated to helping stop veteran suicide), that there are not enough profits on this film to deliver on my promise.</p><p>How am I supposed to tell America's sons and daughters that we cannot help them? We need to win this fight.</p><p>Thank you for inviting me to participate in this Hearing, and I look forward to your questions.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1.

At the time, most believed that Yahoo was so dominant in search that no one could challenge it. Fortune Magazine summed it up this way in an article titled How Yahoo! Won the Search Wars: \"Once upon a time, Yahoo! was an Internet search site with mediocre technology. Now it has a market cap of $2.8 billion.</p><p>Some people say it's the next America Online.\"4 These days we look back at former giants Yahoo and AOL and know that their dominance was anything but.</p><p>We also know that Google's gamble paid off. Today, the company works out of offices located across the United States and on every continent. It processes around 40,000 search requests per second, 3.5 billion per day, and 1.2 trillion per year.5 And just a few months ago, it became the fourth-ever company to reach a $1 trillion market valuation, joining the ranks of competitors Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Not bad for a startup that Yahoo! once passed over and venture capitalists laughed at.</p><p>But this success was never guaranteed, and as the history of the tech industry amply demonstrates, never will be. Only with an obsessive focus on product quality and sound business decisions has Google been able to achieve its current position. And only through constant innovation that delivers ever-better benefits to American consumers will Google avoid becoming the next Ask Jeeves, Ask.com, Yahoo!, AltaVista, Lycos, or MSN Search.</p><p>Among the many Google products and services that consumers love are Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Google Drive--all amazingly useful, and all free. To many critics of \"Big Tech,\" however, when consumers enthusiastically choose these free-of-charge products, it amounts to proof that something must be wrong. Every successful new service or product that proves a winner with consumers is deemed by these critics to be just another antitrust violation.6</p><p>But Google's greatest successes are being won in markets with the greatest competition. In the digital ads market, for example, Google faces fierce competitive pressure. You would never know that listening to the critics.</p><p>For starters, Google is no monopoly. It's wildly popular with consumers, yes. And true, it's also very popular with investors. But the company faces competition from all corners, including from other tech platforms such as Facebook and Amazon (which are simultaneously and thus illogically also dubbed monopolies).</p><p>Far from being evidence of any unlawful conduct, Google's success under these conditions offers abundant proof that it is meeting and exceeding the fundamental test that has been the bedrock of antitrust law for the last 40 decades: are consumers benefitting? There can be little doubt on this point, for Google's users vote daily with their choices. In order to dismiss this as irrelevant, the critics are now arguing that antitrust enforcement should simply abandon the consumer welfare standard, enabling them to attack \"bigness\" per se. This would undermine the very purpose of antitrust law since its inception more than a century ago.</p><p>When Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890, it enshrined in law the country's \"national values of free enterprise and economic competition.\"7 Back then, Congress sought to stem the \"seemingly endless combinations and consolidations of industries\" that led to the \"great trusts of the day--the Standard Oils.\"8 And even then, President Teddy Roosevelt--an aggressive \"trust buster\"-- worried that attempts to break up of Standard Oil through slowmoving antitrust cases in the courts might, in the end, succeed only in robbing consumers of efficiencies in the form of high quality and lower costs that they presently enjoyed.</p><p>Roosevelt lamented, \"I do not see what good can come from dissolving the Standard Oil Company into 40 separate companies.\"9</p><p>In his biography of T.R., Ron Chernow captured the 26th president's conflicting instincts about the most effective way to limit monopoly abuses while preserving consumer benefits.</p><p>\"Roosevelt,\" he said, \"was genuinely reluctant to wield the big stick against Standard Oil... He wanted to supervise the trusts, not break them up and sacrifice their efficiency.\"10 But in 1906 the Roosevelt administration did sue Standard Oil under the Sherman Act. It would take five years before the company was ordered to divest itself of its major holdings-- 33 companies in all. For decades afterward, as both the executive branch and the Supreme Court struggled to arrive at a principled basis for sorting procompetitive business actions from anticompetitive ones, the default condition was the one today's critics would resurrect--that big must be bad.11</p><p>As former Federal Trade Commissioner Joshua Wright put it, \"[t]he result of this approach was that consumers were made worse off by preventing the very competition from which they would benefit and which the competition laws were supposed to promote.\"12 Instead of producing consumer benefits, antitrust enforcement based on size frequently led to higher prices and fewer goods, damaging consumers.13 And, Commissioner Wright added, \"preserving inefficient firms with higher prices and lower output,\" which was the result of such antitrust enforcement, had the perverse effect of favoring \"corporate welfare over consumer welfare.\"14</p><p>By the 1970s, a decade marked by increasing global competition and sluggish U.S. economic growth, leading antitrust scholars and economists sensed the urgency of rationalizing the purposes and methods of enforcement policy. Under the leadership of economist Alfred Kahn, the Carter administration launched a major regulatory reform initiative focusing administration policies on consumer welfare. The result was to bring competition to industries across the U.S. economy including railroads, airlines, and trucking. This turn toward consumer welfare was supported by antitrust experts across the ideological spectrum,15 who recognized that by attacking large companies regardless of the impact on consumer welfare, antitrust enforcement had produced legal uncertainty that deterred firms from innovating, boosting productivity, and offering consumers better products and services at a lower cost.</p><p>The replacement of antitrust-by-gut-instinct with the consumer welfare standard that took place nearly a half century ago enjoys broad, bipartisan support still today.16 It is buttressed now by the empirical evidence of two generations of enforcement policy and case law. But as the critics' attacks on Google demonstrate, that support isn't universal. While these critics are not in the main antitrust experts, it is easy to find political pundits on both the left and right who unite in their agreement that American tech companies are just too big.</p><p>Antitrust enforcement is an extraordinary remedy for an extraordinary problem. The Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights thus deserves praise for providing this \"forum to assess the most important antitrust investigation of the 21st century.\"17 Today's hearing provides a good opportunity for Congress to dig deep into the consumer welfare standard's continued relevance and success.</p><p>Using Google's advertising business as an example, I expect lawmakers will see firsthand both the benefits of the current antitrust approach and the pitfalls of upending it, which would turn back the clock to days when \"big\" meant \"guilty until proven innocent.\" To help in that effort, NetChoice prepared this testimony. The first part imagines a hypothetical question-and-answer session about Google and the digital advertising market.</p><p>This is meant to give a broad, bird's-eye view of market realities. The second part is a deep dive into Google's business model, the search engine market, the digital ads market, and business practices that touch on all three.</p><p>At bottom, this testimony makes clear that Google is no monopoly, that its business decisions are not only lawful but benefit consumers immensely, and that the consumer welfare standard works and should be retained.</p><p>Part I. Q&amp;A</p><p>1. Some say that Google controls 90% of the market. Doesn't that prove it's a monopoly?</p><p>Before determining a company's market share, the relevant market must be defined.</p><p>Google's critics try to inflate its market share by narrowing the relevant market. According to them, digital advertising breaks down into (1) search ads, (2) video ads, and (3) display ads. Under this definition, they contend that Google has a market share in the search ads market. That number is of little use to antitrust analysis as the standard tells us we must look at how consumers use a product. By defining the market so narrowly, critics not only miss the forest for the trees but also fail to follow the rules laid out for antitrust analysis.</p><p>That is so because at its core Google competes in the \"attention market.\" Put simply, Google attracts users--and their eyeballs--by developing great products that it then provides to consumers for free. When consumers use those products, they may see search ads on Google Search, video ads on YouTube, or personalized ads on third-party websites such as NYTimes.com. So every minute a user spends elsewhere--on Netflix, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, etc.--is a minute Google loses to a competitor who also sells digital ads and thus competes for a user's attention.</p><p>Because digital ads boil down to getting ads before a user, the relevant market must at least include all online platforms that operate to do just that. Viewed this way, Google's market share is a modest 29%. In other words, it's nowhere close to being a monopoly, which the Supreme Court informally defines as having at least 75% market share and the DOJ defines as above 66%.</p><p>Defining the relevant market, especially when it comes to tech companies, involves looking backward in time to make decisions about the future. This job is hard to begin with, but it's even harder in digital markets where innovation routinely disrupts markets and creates new \"hybrid\" ones. Consider Walmart, for example: Is it merely the largest retailer in the US18 with an online retailer that sells directly to consumers? Or is it a marketplace that connects buyers and third-party sellers?19 Or is it a marketplace that also serves as a search engine for the \"100 million unique Walmart.com visitors each month\" looking for products and read reviews?20 As it turns out, it's both. Indeed, thousands of Americans begin their product searches on the platform. Walmart also sells digital ads on its platform, which makes it a direct competitor to Google.21</p><p>2. But if market definition is easily manipulated, isn't that a strike against the consumer welfare standard and claims that it's superior because it's objective?</p><p>No, it's a strike against those who seek to reverse engineer the consumer welfare model to yield their preferred results. While market definition is difficult and there is scholarly debate about its application, it remains essential to determining market share and the opportunity a company has to exploit market power.</p><p>Digital ads are a good example of how the consumer welfare standard helps get us to the best possible answer about market definition and market share. Because the standard tells us to look at how consumers use a product, we know right off the bat that the market can't just be digital search ads. That is because advertisers--the main purchasers of digital ads-- use search ads interchangeably with other forms of advertising, including digital display ads.</p><p>In addition, advertisers are increasingly using digital ads as a replacement for traditional ads, including those that run on television. If these competitors are considered part of the relevant market, Google's market share is even lower than 28%, because it directly competes with cable television, newspapers, and other media for these advertising revenues.</p><p>Without the objective consumer welfare standard, the government could simply define the relevant market in any way it likes. That would make it impossible for companies to comply with the law, because they could not know in advance the standard to which they must conform their conduct. Instead, businesses would be left to wonder whether doing \"x\" will irritate the government enough to bring about enforcement even though, objectively, consumers and competition are benefitting from \"x.\"</p><p>3. Google is one of the few digital ads providers that operate across the entire advertising spectrum. Isn't that cause for concern?</p><p>Google has developed a complete suite of ad products, each of which competes against different companies and different competitive products. It offers services for buyers (placing ads), sellers (selling space), an auction system (matching the two), and it offers its tools to help advertisers place ads on Google's platforms. These distinct and varied product offerings compete with hundreds of companies, including such heavyweights as Adobe, AT&amp;T, Comcast, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Snap, Verizon, and Oracle.</p><p>The result of this vibrant competition shows that rather than cause for concern, it is a boon to consumers. Digital ad prices are down 40% since 2010, output is up significantly, and quality has never been better.</p><p>Moreover, advertisers and publishers engage in multihoming - simultaneously using multiple Demand Side Platform (DSP) and more than Sale Side Platform (SSP). On average, advertisers use 4.2 DSP22 and publishers average 5.7.23 For example, the LATimes.com uses twelve DSPs for display ads alone.24</p><p>Finally, just because a business is vertically integrated is no reason to bring an antitrust action. If that were so, Starbucks would be inherently anticompetitive, because it sources and prepares its own beans.25</p><p>4. You say Google benefits consumers--can you elaborate?</p><p>Google Search and YouTube are multisided platforms. That means that Google plays matchmaker among many participants operating in different facets of the same market.</p><p>For example, it links users with advertisers, and it links advertisers with publishers. To meet the needs of each of these different customers, Google must keep its platforms attractive to consumers. Attracting consumers is necessary both to attract advertisers and keep its services free for consumers requires keeping advertisers interested.</p><p>Google has benefitted all these groups. With digital ads prices down 40% since 2010, advertisers are getting more bang for their buck. Publishers are earning money from digital ads without having to invest in developing and maintaining the intricate technology that makes it all happen. Thanks to its advertising revenue, Google can keep its services free.</p><p>And that, in turn, has put competitive pressure on the likes of Microsoft, which responded by cutting prices on its Office products after Google released its suite of office products for free.</p><p>In sum, Google's ad business, in conjunction with its innovative ecosystem of free consumer products, has produced enormous benefits for consumers.</p><p>5. But isn't Google the reason newspapers went out of business and publishers are hurting?</p><p>On the contrary, Google is helping newspapers transition to the new Information Economy.</p><p>Consider the New York Times. It currently uses Google's ad tech to sell display ads, and with web traffic higher than ever before, its website is valuable real estate for advertisers.</p><p>Thanks to Google, the Times can capitalize on that asset. And because it has seen just how profitable digital ads are, the Times has announced that it'll be creating its own ad tech-- thus competing with Google.</p><p>Although many critics would like to blame \"Big Tech,\" the truth is that for decades the internet itself has presented a challenge for print newspapers and publishers, who have struggled to adapt their pre-internet business models to the prevailing consumer reality.</p><p>For centuries, print newspapers relied on advertising and classified ads for the major portion of their revenue. Because newspapers were the main source of local information and in wide circulation, advertisers of all shapes and sizes bought ads.26 But when consumers in the United States began to go online, newspapers suddenly faced a changed landscape.</p><p>Indeed, even before digital advertising developed in the mid-2000s and grew in the latter half of the decade, newspapers struggled, in part because the advent of 24/7 television and radio news rendered their product stale. Americans simply weren't buying as many print newspapers anymore. With the advent of instantaneous worldwide communication via the internet and online classified ads, the newspapers' model of delivering the news the following day and monopolizing classified advertising took an even harder hit. And because consumers could no longer be counted on to wait for the printed word to arrive at their doorstep the next weekday or the next Sunday, traditional display ad revenue fell.</p><p>6. But doesn't Google's acquisition of YouTube show anticompetitive behavior?</p><p>Google's acquisition of YouTube has benefited users and advertisers alike. It is emblematic of Google's business strategy. Consider how it unfolded.</p><p>Animated by a desire to \"prevent staleness,\" and not to become \"our father's Oldsmobile,\" Google has long sought to stay ahead of the curve. So much so that as far back as 2006 it predicted that \"social networking sites will ultimately represent a threat to our search business as people will spend more time on those sites and ultimately may do most searches from the search boxes available there.\"27</p><p>Time would later prove Google right. But instead of falling victim to changing market dynamics, Google made three wise decisions that enabled it to compete. First, it entered the social media market by acquiring one of the several participants in that space, YouTube.</p><p>Second, it committed to a policy of continuously developing consumer-friendly innovations to enhance Google Search. And third, it built out its ad tech services, connecting its social media, search, and advertising products.</p><p>Google's acquisition of YouTube in 2006 came after much internal strategizing. Their market analysis convinced them of social media's potential to transform how people spent their time online, in turn making entertainment sites likely places from which consumers would want to conduct online searches. This highlighted the value of \"own[ing] the search box on the entertainment sites\"28--an opportunity for all of their social media competitors, and something Google itself needed to pursue. Among possible acquisition candidates, YouTube was particularly attractive because of its \"smart team\" and its \"platform [that Google] could build from.\"29</p><p>Without Google's participation in the social media marketplace through its acquisition and subsequent development of YouTube over the last 14 years, there would be less competition, fewer offerings to consumers, diminished consumer choice, and higher prices for lower quality services.</p><p>7. But surely Google's other business practices--such as displaying publisher information directly on its search results page--are anticompetitive, right?</p><p>Search engines used to display results by displaying each publisher's URL below the branded result. By displaying the URL on top of the branded result, consumers could more easily see where the information is coming from. Giving the URL top billing means that users will naturally look there first, making it easier for them to determine whether the particular search result is a reputable site. These enhancements that add to consumer value are the result of the company's ongoing commitment to research and development. Its annual R&amp;D spending is nearly $30 billion--reflective of a commitment to constant product improvement rather than the cheaper shortcut of anticompetitive practices.</p><p>Google has enhanced the consumer experience and the value to consumers from its various search services in other, similar ways as well. For example, it has introduced what it calls \"Universal Search,\" which integrates search results from a variety of different media sources (links, video, photos) and services including Google Maps and Google Flights.</p><p>Integrating YouTube videos with Google Search has enabled consumers to see relevant videos in their search results as links on the search engine's main page and under its \"Videos\" tab as well. No longer do consumers have to visit multiple websites to find what they're looking for.</p><p>Many of Google's rivals have pursued similar pro-consumer strategies to improve their offerings. Microsoft's Bing, as Google itself has noted, \"has explicitly made improving verticals a key part of [its] strategy to beat Google.\"30 To do that, Microsoft began to offer consumers \"cashback (shopping), purchased Farecast (flights), partnered with Wikipedia (reference), Wolfram (calculations and facts), and built vertices for events and recipes.\"31 This constant product improvement is necessary to compete in search because even many niche search engines that compete with Google are provided by large companies with significant resources. These include Walmart, which offers extensive search capabilities for shopping; Yelp, which provides search results for local goods and services; Kayak, which delivers comprehensive search information on flights; and a host of other specialty search providers such as Hotels.com, AllRecipes, and Edmunds that provide specially tailored search services for items ranging from lodging and cooking to car buying, and virtually every other consumer need.</p><p>8. There's one group, though, that hasn't benefitted: conservatives. How do you explain Google's censoring of them?</p><p>The oft-heard complaint from the critics is that Google has \"censored\" news and political commentary from a conservative perspective. This inaccurate criticism is based on a kernel of truth: Google does moderate content, including removing or limiting it when warranted by its community standards. But these standards are applied across the board, and empirically, have resulted in far more politically progressive content being limited and removed.</p><p>At the same time, conservatives have benefitted immensely from Google's products and free services. By offering conservative voices an enormous audience free of charge, YouTube has enabled them to bypass traditional TV, radio, and publishing to get their message out. Even better, YouTube lets conservatives monetize those messages. Prager University, for example, boasts over four billion YouTube views and earns considerable revenue from that.32 ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, and other traditional media, including print, offer nothing like these opportunities to PragerU and other politically conservative voices.</p><p>Conservative content routinely makes up the majority of the most popular channels on YouTube. And unlike the traditional media, YouTube streamed the Republican National Convention in full, without commercial interruption.</p><p>Critics maintain that Google shouldn't do any moderating--all content should be allowed.</p><p>That's neither realistic nor desirable. To use but one obvious example, in demanding that Google follow the First Amendment, critics are saying that Google should allow pornography on its site. Beyond that, Google's advertisers are very conscious of the context in which their brands appear. They won't pay to be featured alongside offensive, crude, or violent content, even if it is protected by the First Amendment. And without advertising revenue, Google could no longer offer its services including YouTube to conservatives and all others for free.</p><p>9. But what about Google Search--doesn't it suppress conservative news and amplify news critical of the president and Republican Party?</p><p>Google Search's algorithms aren't perfect--that's why the company makes an average of 1,000 tweaks every few years. But neither are they biased against conservatives.</p><p>The technology is complex, but the concept is simple: Google Search continuously crawls the internet's two billion pages to create an ever-changing, constantly updated index of the world's online content. When a user enters a search query, Google retrieves relevant results based on that index.</p><p>Once retrieved, the information is ranked based on about 200 factors. One factor is authoritativeness, determined by a site's popularity (as measured by clicks) and the number of other pages that link to that site. That may seem circular--after all, if Google helps connect users to websites, it plays a role in determining which websites get clicks. But that's true only to a small extent. What matters most is the search phrase. So, if many Americans are searching for and reading negative stories about a topic, general searches about that topic will increasingly rank those stories higher because they are the most widely read.</p><p>It's also true that many news websites with the highest viewership, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC, produce a disproportionate share of digital articles critical of conservatives and their policies. Here's an example of how this affects Google's search results: When Republicans cut tax rates for middle and low-income Americans in 2017, progressives nonetheless criticized the legislation because it also cut tax rates for higher earners. This produced a rash of stories that were critical of the tax cut. So, as Google users searched using a neutral term such as \"tax cut,\" they increasingly saw the negative stories higher up.33</p><p>This understandably irks Republicans, but the alternative would have Google explicitly giving positive stories about conservative policies a boost. This \"affirmative action\" of sorts would force Google to make explicit political decisions--something no one wants--by singling out conservative sources for especially favorable treatment.</p><p>And to be clear, the algorithms turn up unflattering links about everything--including Google itself. One would assume that, if Google really were biasing its algorithms, it would do a better job suppressing stories critical of it. And yet here are the top results, based on several variations of the same search request. Each shows links to negative stories about Google.</p><p>Part II. Deep Dive into Tech Market Realities</p><p>What's Past is Prologue: The Gut Instinct of Big-is-Bad</p><p>Antitrust laws in the United States are meant to promote consumer benefits through competitive markets.34 Businesses that have to compete will usually cut prices and/or improve the quality of their products or services.35 As the Supreme Court stated in 2019, \"'protecting consumers from monopoly prices' has been 'the central concern of antitrust.'\"36 Antitrust laws, the court added, also \"stimulate businesses to find new, innovative, and more efficient methods of production,\" which also benefits consumers.37 But for much of our history, antitrust relied on \"confused doctrines that pursued populist notions\"--most particularly, the idea that the size of business was all that mattered, regardless of whether consumers benefitted or were injured.38 As a result, the government's enforcement decisions often \"led to contradictory results,\" by seeking to \"advance a variety of social and political goals, but doing so at the expense of American consumers.\"39 In the Sherman Act's first decade, for example, the Supreme Court held that the law was meant to protect \"small dealers and worthy men.\"40 Decades later, the Court reaffirmed that interpretation, holding that antitrust law is meant to protect \"viable, small, locally owned business\" even when that protection means \"higher costs and prices.\"41 By the 1970s, this confusion had dissipated, as antitrust experts including economists, academics, and practicing lawyers reached a general consensus that ever since has anchored antitrust analysis in consumer welfare.42 This achievement made the United States the first country to root antitrust analysis in economics.43 Under the consumer welfare standard, economic evidence is analyzed to assess whether a business's actions benefit or harm consumers.44 Economists, antitrust scholars,45 and U.S. courts46 agree that the consumer welfare standard has succeeded in protecting consumers. That success came only once the government replaced the old model of antitrust analysis based merely on the size of an enterprise with the more logically rigorous approach of determining anticompetitive harm to consumers through objective economic analysis.47 Ironically, given the success of this approach, today's critics of \"Big Tech\" have mounted an attack on the consumer welfare standard that is the basis of modern antitrust law. Just as in the early 20th century, generalized concerns about such social ills as corporate power, income inequality, and wage stagnation have sparked calls to \"solve\" these problems by reviving the discredited antitrust theory of \"big is bad,\"48 in place of the consumer welfare standard.</p><p>The critics can point to Europe, where antitrust enforcement focuses far less on economic analysis than the United States does.49 But such a move would be a major departure and a dangerous change for our nation. There is a reason Europe has no companies on the list of the top 10 tech companies in the world. Indeed, Europe has only one--Spotify--in the top 30. The United States, by contrast, leads the world in technology. Should we follow Europe's lead, only Chinese competitors like Alibaba will benefit. American consumers, by contrast, will suffer.</p><p>The European Union's experience with antitrust enforcement should serve as a cautionary tale for America. The E.U.'s main antitrust law, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), is designed \"to prevent competition from being distorted to the detriment of the public interest, individual undertakings and consumers.\"50 By leaving it to the discretion of the courts to determine what is in \"the public interest,\" Europeans have made their standard of antitrust enforcement entirely subjective. Free to choose their own notions of what is fair, and unbounded by any rigorous economic analysis that is the sine qua non of U.S. antitrust analysis, E.U. courts have produced a smorgasbord of results, the net effect of which has been the diminution of competition, higher prices, and reduced benefits for consumers.</p><p>As explained in detail below, that's not necessary. The consumer welfare standard works well and Google's advertising business shows that.</p><p>Starting Point: Understanding Google's Business Model</p><p>Like any for-profit business, Google must make a profit. But unlike traditional for-profit businesses, Google's most famous and popular product--Google Search--is given free of charge to its users. To understand Google, therefore, it helps first to understand its unique business model and the incentive structure within which it operates in the marketplace.</p><p>Google Search is currently the most popular search engine, but because it is free, that popularity does not provide the company with any revenue, let alone profit. As with free over-the-air television, revenue comes not from viewers or users but advertising. In 2018, advertising amounted to 84% of revenues for Alphabet, Google's parent company.51 The willingness of advertisers to pay for digital ads on Google's site is directly connected to its popularity. No one would pay to advertise on billboards dotting a rarely used road. But people would--and do--pay millions for a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl. Google's popularity thus drives its advertising revenue, and it is strongly incentivized to provide consumers with the highest-quality products and services, even though they are free.</p><p>But Google Search is only as useful to consumers as the websites that it displays to them in the form of search results. Google may build the world's best search algorithm, but if the content responsive to consumer search requests isn't itself relevant or useful, then those consumers will find using Google Search to be less useful. That means Google also has a strong incentive to see to it that publishers--those who create the wide variety of news, entertainment, research, educational material, and commentary that is published on the internet--flourish.</p><p>The relationship between Google and web publishers is largely symbiotic. Many of these publishers rely on advertising as a principal source of revenue. When their advertising revenue rises, the publishers flourish. Flourishing publishers that are in financial good health produce higher quality content. And when publishers produce higher quality content that benefits consumers, more people have reason to use Google Search.</p><p>While Google understands and lives by this market reality, many of its critics seem to believe that Google is motivated to run publishers into the ground by extracting as much money from them as possible. Common sense suggests this cannot be so: when publishers fail, Google Search suffers. And what common sense suggests, evidence confirms. As explained below, although many publishers use Google's advertising tools, they typically also use from four to six other companies' advertising tools.</p><p>In sum: Google invests heavily in its search engine so that consumers find it even more useful. Google does this not only because Google Search is the company's lifeblood, but because failing to do so would yield ground to competitors ranging from Microsoft's Bing to DuckDuckGo to Amazon and Yelp. (Google also faces competition in voice search-- Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana all compete with Google's Voice Search.) Google also invests heavily in its advertising tools and products because it relies on advertising for revenue, as do many of its rivals in the marketplace including Amazon, Facebook, and Bing.</p><p>In the world of online business, the position of any market leader is precarious, as history has shown. That is why Google continues to innovate, invest, and improve. It does not rest on its laurels or cut corners as a monopolist would. If Google did that, rather than continuously improving, it would quickly become the next MySpace.</p><p>Instead, Google is successful--for now--because it makes smart business decisions that benefit consumers.</p><p>About Display Advertising and Ad Tech</p><p>Digital advertising is a large and diverse industry that encompasses everything from search ads (ads shown on search engines), to video ads (those that you might see before, say, watching a video on YouTube), to display ads (those you might see while reading an article on NYTimes.com or while scrolling through Instagram).</p><p>Below is a screenshot of a typical display ad that I noticed while reading a Times article about the power of technology to help vulnerable Americans during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>\"Ad tech\" is the colloquial term for the software that facilitates buying, selling, and displaying these ads. As discussed later in this paper, the ad tech industry is competitive.</p><p>For example, Google faces competition not only from well-known companies such as Oracle, Comcast, Adobe, Facebook, and Amazon, but also from competitors that may be unfamiliar such as The Trade Desk and Rubicon Project. Some of these companies focus solely on the demand side (buyers); others focus on the supply side (sellers); and others, like Google, do a little of both.</p><p>The fact that there is so much competition in this market has benefitted both consumers (those buying and running ads) and the public generally. The robust competition has resulted in lower prices for advertisers. And it has enabled many websites to continue to offer their content for free--especially content providers with small audiences who may struggle to attract paid subscribers, as well as news and opinion websites such as Vox.com, MotherJones.com, and NationalReview.com.</p><p>Google Search is No Monopoly</p><p>Although Google Search is highly popular, it is not a monopoly--actually, virtually, or otherwise. To be sure, Google leads the pack in its sheer number of searches and users. In the United States, Google boasts 62.5% market share of all core searches.52 But Microsoft's search engine, Bing, launched in 2009, already has 24.7% market share today.53 And Verizon Media, which bought Yahoo's and AOL's search engines in 2017 and 2019, respectively, has 11.5%.54 Given this, Google Search cannot, by definition, be a monopoly as that term is understood in antitrust law.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently defined monopoly power as \"the power to control prices or exclude competition.\"55 The price that Google charges for its search service is zero--no high-price umbrella sustained by monopoly practices here--while at the same time, it faces considerable competition. Even setting aside formal definitions, Google Search has none of the trappings of a monopoly. One of the tell-tale signs indicating that a company is relying on its market control--and not its product quality--to gain or maintain market share is that it decides to cut its investment even in good times. Economists tell us that monopolists often spend little to no money on innovation because there is no need to improve products and services once the market is consolidated. (Think of the electric power industry, a classic monopoly. When was the last time we heard of an innovation from PG&amp;E?)</p><p>An independent evaluation by PwC found that Google spends more on research and development than every other company in America save one--Amazon, its main competitor.56 Last year, Google spent $26 billion on research and development. Two years ago, it undertook over 650,000 experiments to improve its Search Engine.57 Every year, as a result of this R&amp;D, Google makes an average of 1,000 improvements to its Search Engine.58 If Google Search were a monopoly, Google could worry a lot less about maintaining its market leadership, and it could spend a lot less on improving its flagship product.</p><p>Google Search faces considerable competitive pressure on multiple fronts. When people want to know specific information about specific things, they frequently turn to competitors that specialize in that particular field. Google faces competition from Expedia, Kayak, Orbitz, and Travelocity on travel-related searches. And it faces competition from Yelp, Angie's List, UrbanSpoon, and TripAdvisor on searches related to local restaurants and vendors. The competition in this space is so great, in fact, that even Yelp, one of Google's most vocal critics, said just last year that \"[w]e compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and we expect competition to intensify further in the future with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants.\"59</p><p>DuckDuckGo, a rival search engine launched in 2008, promises every user that it will let them \"take back your privacy!\"60 Contrasting its data-privacy protections with Google's protections,61 DuckDuckGo has seen its market share grow every year since its founding. In 2010, DuckDuckGo hosted 16.4 million searches during the entire year. In April 2020, it hosted 1.8 billion searches.62 Its most explosive growth has occurred in the last two years.</p><p>Since 2018, DuckDuckGo's daily search queries have more than doubled.63 With nearly 97% of people reporting that they are somewhat or very concerned about protecting their personal data,64 competition on this basis can be expected to be intense.</p><p>Facebook, with its over 2.4 billion users, has announced plans to invest in building out and expanding its own search platform. According to the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, \"Facebook is uniquely positioned to answer questions that people have, like, 'What sushi restaurants have my friends gone to in New York lately and really liked?' \" These are queries that Facebook is uniquely positioned to answer. As Zuckerberg sees it, \"you couldn't do [such searches] with anything else; we just have to do it.\"65 Facebook's entry into the search market is yet another formidable competitive challenge for Google and a further illustration of the truism that no market leader in the field of technology is ever secure.</p><p>The Google Ad Stack Isn't a Monopoly</p><p>Google is not a monopoly in the ad tech market. On the contrary, it competes against hundreds, if not thousands, of other ad tech companies, including many profitable ones.66 These competitors include Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter, as well as other household names such as Adobe, Oracle, Verizon, Comcast, and AT&amp;T, and less</p><p>well-known companies such as The Trade Desk and Rubicon Project.</p><p>According to the principles of antitrust law, a monopolist has the power either to exclude competitors from the market or to raise prices above what the market would otherwise dictate.67 Manifestly, Google has not excluded competitors from the market. As for prices, since Google's entrance into the ad tech market, prices have dropped by 40%./68</p><p>In fact, prices have dropped so much that advertising expenditures--as a percentage of GDP--have never been lower in U.S. history, even though digital advertising has never been more popular.69</p><p>That the lucrative ad tech market is competitive comes as little surprise.</p><p>In 2019, the U.S. spent $124.6 billion on digital advertising--a 15.9% increase in just one year.70 With so much money on the line, and with consistent revenue growth, the market has enticed new entrants</p><p>including one of Google's major competitors, Amazon. Although Amazon entered the market a mere three years ago, it is already the number one demand-side ad tech provider.71</p><p>And even Amazon's success is being tested: The Trade Desk, which analysts called the \"fastest-growing\" demand-side platform, saw a 1,000% increase in its stock value since it went public in 2015./72</p><p>Meanwhile, Rubicon--which merged with Telaria in 2019--is now the largest independent supply-side platform in the world.73</p><p>Even established companies that operate their own ad tech have seen their revenues increase. Last year, for example, Pinterest reported a 62% year-over-year increase in its advertising revenue; Snapchat reported a 48% increase; and, Twitter reported 21%./74</p><p>A simple hypothetical helps explain why the critics' narrow focus on digital search ads as the relevant market is wrong at best, and deceptive at worst.</p><p>Imagine you wanted to study the market for national coffee chains in the United States.</p><p>You'd learn that Starbucks' market share is about 40% and that Dunkin' Donuts' is about 26%.75 Now imagine you focus only on coffee chains in the United States that follow Fair Trade practices. Well, those numbers wouldn't change much because both companies have signed on to Fair Trade. But now imagine you narrow your focus even more and look only at coffee chains in the United States that follow Fair Trade practices for Americano coffee.</p><p>Under this scenario, Starbucks' market share would approach 100% because Dunkin' does not sell Americano coffee, let alone Americano coffee that complies with Fair Trade practices.</p><p>Starbucks and Dunkin' compete against each other, which is reflected in the first and broadest scenario, and even in the second scenario. Yet the third scenario does not capture that. On the contrary, it leaves the impression that Starbucks is a monopolist. And maybe Starbucks does have a monopoly on Americano coffee that complies with Fair Trade. But that raises the question: So, what?</p><p>Put simply, antitrust analysis is like zooming in on a digital image: the more you zoom, the more distorted the picture becomes.</p><p>Even if the critics' distorted picture were correct--and it isn't--and even if Google were the dominant or only player in this artificially defined market--the fact remains that there is no consumer harm, but rather substantial benefits to consumers as a result of Google's participation in the digital ad market. As mentioned above, the overall market is growing, while Google's share is shrinking. The output of digital advertising has never been higher.</p><p>Ad prices are down by 40%. Robust investment in innovation has continued uninterruptedly for over a decade. This includes new technology that allows ads to be placed on mobile apps and websites, as well as ads specific to social media.</p><p>Turning to publishers who buy ads, we see the same results: benefits, not harm, in the form of more effective advertisements that are better targeted to their audiences, delivered at lower prices than ever before.</p><p>Although display ads run on third-party websites, they often are not made by those websites. In that sense, these ads are just like those in a printed copy of a newspaper.</p><p>When websites run such ads, they are often called \"publishers,\" just as a newspaper is called a publisher. These websites are the advertisers we refer to when we use the term \"publisher\" in the digital advertising context.</p><p>Publishers--both digital and print--use the ad revenue they receive for placing display ads to support their businesses. But digital display ads are different from printed ads in an important respect. They are far better at targeting their intended audiences.</p><p>In the past, advertisers had to rely on limited data in deciding where to place ads. They might know, for example, that the average reader of the New York Times is college educated and has a disposable income above average. Based on this information, advertisers for Walmart may decide that their money is best spent elsewhere; advertisers for Whole Foods, however, may reach the opposite conclusion.</p><p>But with display ads, advertisers do not have to rely on such overbroad generalizations.</p><p>Using tools like those provided by Google and many other companies, they can craft ads that appeal to specific consumers and then run those ads on websites those consumers are most likely to visit. To be sure, the ads (output) are only as good as their data (input). So, as some critics point out, tools that use a lot of data are often more valuable than tools that do not.76 But what this really proves is that Google's tools are popular among publishers and other consumers precisely because their inputs and outputs are strong.</p><p>Even under the critics' framework, Google's services help publishers. In fact, publishers earn 68% of the revenue that Google itself earns from AdSense whenever those ads are placed on the publishers' websites.77 Publishers also profit from Google's ad services that allow them to monetize their own websites and apps. The revenue this generates for publishers, in turn, supports their provision of free and diverse online content that everyone can then enjoy. All these benefits flow from the billions of dollars' worth of investment that Google makes year in and year out, resulting in products and services that are made available to publishers at little to no cost.</p><p>Advertisers benefit too. For a fraction of what they paid a decade ago, advertisers can now reach millions of more potential customers, and receive highly accurate, real-time information about which ads work and which do not, saving them even more ad dollars.</p><p>Google's Ad Tech Even Helps Competitors</p><p>Publishers who use Google's supply-side ad tools can sell to advertisers that use Google's competitors' tools. And advertisers can use Google's tools to buy ad space on ad exchanges that aren't run by Google, as well as on sites that do not use Google's services. In numerical terms, that means Google's tools give publishers access to demand from over 700 advertising platforms and give advertisers access to supply on more than 80 publisher platforms.78</p><p>If Google were a monopolist, or if it were trying to stifle competition, providing all of this access to publishers would be counterproductive. However, Google's business model requires that it support a healthy publisher ecosystem, from which publishers and Google itself all benefit.</p><p>Looking for Help and Expertise: Google's Ad Acquisitions</p><p>Google's founders--the computer science whiz kids at Stanford--were experts in programming, not digital advertising. When it became clear that advertising revenue would be the company's main source of income, Google's entry into this new market included targeted acquisitions that allowed it to import outside help to develop and improve its ad services. In all, beginning in 2007, Google acquired nine digital advertising companies.79 Bringing digital advertising in house had three benefits. First, Google maximized efficiencies. Second, it ensured quality control. And third, it ensured that all the facets of its business worked together.</p><p>Some former Justice Department officials have sought to portray these common-sense investments as something nefarious. They claim that \"these acquisitions reveal a sustained effort to occupy the entire tech stack as well as the related analytics market through mergers.\"80 That is obviously not true. Far from \"occupying\" the \"entire tech stack,\" Google competes against Amazon, Facebook, Oracle, Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Telaria, Rubicon Project, The Trade Desk, Index Exchange, MediaMath, OpenX--and more.</p><p>Even if one looks only at the narrow market of publishers, the competition is robust.</p><p>Although some critics claim that Google \"coerces\" publishers to use Google's advertising products,81 publishers say otherwise. In a study published last year, publishers reported that they routinely use, on average, no fewer than six supply-side ad platforms, and about four demand-side ad platforms.82</p><p>It is also worth noting that far from being a market abuse, mergers and acquisitions, which occur routinely not only in the technology field but across the board in U.S. business, are a necessary and healthy part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Starting any business is risky; starting a tech company is usually even riskier. Without the prospect of a future acquisition as an \"off-ramp\" for investors, many entrepreneurs would never be able to raise the capital to start a business in the first place.</p><p>It is, of course, always up to the individual company whether it wishes to accept an offer to be acquired. Sometimes a tech company will choose to cut its risks and accept the guaranteed return on investment it receives in a merger or acquisition. Sometimes, though, companies turn down these offers. Consider Instagram and Snapchat: the former accepted Facebook's offer; the latter rejected it. Both continue to exist and thrive. It should go without saying that Google did not coerce the companies it acquired. These nine companies each decided--on their own--to sell.</p><p>Data Privacy: Google's Response to Consumer Demand</p><p>A particularly unwarranted criticism from Google's detractors is that the company has created a \"superior\" ad tech service for publishers to use. Their argument goes like this: Because Google has a lot of data, it has been better than competitors at placing ads so that the relevant consumers see them, and that competitive advantage is unfair and anticompetitive.83</p><p>There is perhaps no better illustration of why these critics want to abandon the consumer welfare standard in antitrust. Winning market share by building a better mousetrap is how competition is supposed to work. The fact that Google's superior service--the critics' characterization--is favored by the advertisers who are the consumers of that service can hardly come as a surprise. For this criticism to succeed, the critics have to relieve themselves of the responsibility to point to anticompetitive behavior and consumer harm. In reality, there are only consumer benefits.</p><p>Moreover, observing that Google's ad tech services are \"superior\" is far different than claiming that Google faces no competition in this market. That claim is not made, nor could it be. Not only does Google face competition from numerous other ad tech companies, and not only does the typical publisher use a half-dozen different supply-side ad platforms on average, but the very same data that Google uses in its ad tech services is available to other companies. Data is neither finite nor limited to one company. Google does not own consumer data, nor does it in any way prevent consumers from providing the same data to its competitors, including Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>So although Google's data inputs make its ad tech superior to many other competitor services, they do not and cannot render it immune from competition. Indeed, Microsoft has comparable data about consumers' product searches, and likely leverages that data to improve its own advertising tools. As Facebook's CEO has stated publicly, it too possesses substantial amounts of such data that the company is eager to use.</p><p>At the same time, there is growing competition spurred by consumer privacy concerns that will restrict the amounts and kinds of data that Google and any competitor will employ in ad tech in the very near future. Apple's Safari web browser and Mozilla's Firefox web browser have already restricted third-party cookies. Like Apple and Mozilla, Google, too, is responding to public demand and has announced its intention to phase out the use of thirdparty cookies in its Chrome web browser. To that end, it is investing in new technologies that are less invasive than tracking cookies, making it possible for advertisers to target various demographics without identifying specific people. Since consumers drive Google's popularity--across all its platforms and products--that decision is not only necessary but strategic, impelled by the demands of a highly competitive marketplace.</p><p>In all of these ways, competition in digital advertising is strong and growing ever more intense. But Google's critics maintain the opposite. An oft-repeated claim is that Google controls about 93% of the market.84 This would indeed define Google as a monopoly, but the claim is not true. In reality, Google's share of the ad tech market is a far more modest 29%.85</p><p>'Self-Preferencing': A Clever Slogan in Search of Consumer Harm</p><p>\"Self-preferencing\" is the latest buzzword of the critics, meant to pejoratively re-brand the perfectly benign practice of businesses in every industry commonly known as vertical integration.86 Vertical integration enables a business to take responsibility for producing more of the products it sells to its customers while giving it greater quality control and often yielding efficiencies reflected in lower consumer prices. It is widely accepted as good for consumers. Re-branding it as \"self-preferencing,\" however, suggests something unseemly is at work. As former Federal Trade Commissioner Joshua Wright has observed, the term reflects a \"general hostility to firm size regardless of its actual impact on competition or consumer welfare.\"87</p><p>Today's calls to ban or restrict \"self-preferencing\" are targeted almost exclusively at digital platforms such as Google and digital marketplaces such as Amazon.88 Indeed, brick-andmortar marketplaces have been vertically integrating for decades, with no complaint from those now aiming their barbs at \"Big Tech.\" The \"problem\" of \"self-preferencing\" arose only once certain politicians and competitors began turning against the technology industry.</p><p>Yet from the consumer's perspective, it is relatively much easier to switch digital providers in order to find more product choices, than it is to switch to a different brick-and-mortar retailer in order to find choices beyond that retailer's own branded products.</p><p>How common is vertical integration throughout the U.S. economy? The commercial world around us is replete with examples. Thinking of these well-known consumer product companies and retailers as guilty of \"self-preferencing\" illustrates the absurdity of the concept. Is Gillette harming consumers by \"preferring\" to include its own replacement blades with its razors? Is Coca-Cola harming consumers by \"preferring\" its own beverages in its vending machines?</p><p>Consider the following further examples:</p><p>* CVS Health brand</p><p>* Gold Emblem brand</p><p>* Beauty 360 brand</p><p>* Kirkland Brand products</p><p>* Sam's Club products</p><p>* Great Value products</p><p>* Equate brand</p><p>* Townhouse brand</p><p>* Edwards Coffee brand</p><p>* Bel Air Frozen Food brand</p><p>* Busy Baker Cookies &amp; Crackers</p><p>Vertical integration operates no differently in an online marketplace than in a brick-andmortar marketplace. But critics of American tech want to define it as a supposed antitrust violation, and they want to enforce their new rule against \"self-preferencing\" only against tech. Indeed, the creation of a new term to describe vertical integration allows the critics to discriminate against the tech industry more discreetly: brick-and-mortar marketplaces can continue to engage in \"vertical integration\"; online marketplaces must be prosecuted for engaging in \"self-preferencing.\"</p><p>New and Innovative Business Practices</p><p>Technology companies based in the United States lead the world, setting the standard for increased productivity, consumer satisfaction, and innovation. There is no comparable flagship industry that is winning the global competition to this degree. A large part of the reason for this is that the U.S. tech industry spends more on research and development than any other U.S. industry.</p><p>The U.S. tech industry also leads in capital investment:</p><p>What's more, the technology industry innovations that flow from these investments are not restricted to semiconductors and electromagnetic waves. The digital economy has produced remarkable benefits for consumers worldwide, and innovation in business models is a big reason. It continues to provide a competitive edge for U.S. industry.</p><p>Because tech's business strategies, models, and practices benefit both consumers and the entire economy, much is at stake in ensuring that innovation can continue. As new business methods are perfected, other industries, too, will likely adopt them in order to enhance their own competitiveness in markets that are becoming ever-more integrated with the digital economy each day. To use but one example, the financial services industry, typified by banks with large marble columns and physical retail branches everywhere, is not only moving online but becoming an entirely digital market for some consumers.</p><p>Caution and circumspection are required in evaluating new and innovative business practices in the tech arena, in large measure because the pace of change is so rapid. When a new technology proves successful with consumers, the migration to that product or service can be instantaneous. This produces lopsided \"market share\" for the successful technology, particularly if the \"market\" is defined as the one dominated by that very tech innovation.</p><p>The ill-wisdom of viewing the marketplace in this way should be obvious.</p><p>Failing to recognize the difference between a \"better mousetrap\" and anticompetitive business practices would likely inflict significant harm on consumers and the economy.</p><p>Product innovation would suffer; lacking the opportunity for constant improvement in business models, efficiencies would be lost and prices to consumers would rise; and the consequent losses in productivity and employment would ripple across the entire U.S. economy. It is therefore of vital importance that antitrust enforcement distinguishes between business conduct that is procompetitive and yields consumer benefits, on the one hand, and conduct that is actually anticompetitive and exclusionary, on the other hand.</p><p>The two are often brewed in the same barrel. Conduct that benefits consumers also tends to increase market share, which can be viewed as circumstantial evidence of excluding competitors. So even with an eye toward consumer welfare, spotting the difference can be difficult. This is especially true in multi-sided markets--such as those in which Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google compete--where a platform's conduct that benefits consumers inevitably takes business away from a competitor.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1 NetChoice is a trade association of e-Commerce and online businesses, at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.netchoice.org\">www.netchoice.org</url>.

I have worked as an analyst of Chinese cyber and technology policies for the last decade, in the U.S. national security community and in the private sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My previous testimonies before other House and Senate committees over the past two years addressed broader challenges in the U.S.-China technology relationship, providing recommendations on issues such as export controls, market access in China, and the ethical challenges of joint research in emerging technologies./1</p><p>In each of these areas, I argued that it is absolutely vital that we maintain the openness of the U.S. system, but with greater resilience and new guardrails to ensure that openness is not exploited.</p><p>Today I will provide remarks on managing the data security risks of U.S.-China technology entanglement. I will focus on three areas:</p><p>(1) The reality of China's cyber governance system and how Chinese government access to data works in practice</p><p>(2) How to build a stronger U.S. cybersecurity and data privacy system</p><p>(3) How to address risks posed by China in a way that strengthens U.S. global technological leadership and competitiveness</p><p>Part I. China's cyber governance system and Chinese government access to data We need to start with an accurate understanding of the nature of the risks posed by China's cyber governance system.</p><p>Here I would like to make two points:</p><p>1. U.S. policymakers should not conflate the problems of (a) U.S. companies operating inside China with (b) Chinese companies operating in the United States.</p><p>Different policy approaches are required to address two separate sets of risks. The first is U.S.</p><p>companies like Apple operating in China (mainly handling Chinese citizen data) and the second is Chinese companies like TikTok operating in the United States (mainly handling U.S. citizen data). Because U.S. firms in China manage mostly Chinese citizen data, this poses serious ethical and market access questions. This is distinct from the national security question of Chinese companies having access to massive amounts of U.S. citizen data overseas.</p><p>The data handled by U.S. firms operating in China is primarily Chinese citizen data, and in some cases, they segment their global networks to prevent Chinese citizen data from flowing outside of China, in accordance with Chinese law. The challenges for U.S. firms in this context are ethical: how will they respond to pressure from the Chinese government to turn over the content of user emails or search histories to crack down on dissent? Do they have control over and visibility into supply chains to prevent the company's technology from enabling the Chinese government to commit mass human rights violations today or in the future? The mass incarceration of minorities in areas like Xinjiang or Tibet is just one example. A new report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute describes Uighurs in prison-like forced labor conditions at Chinese factories reported to supply U.S. companies such as Nike./2</p><p>In my previous testimonies, I argued for the development of new legislation and standards to systematically consider the ethics of specific partnerships in China. This is too big and complex a challenge for individual companies to take on themselves. Existing voluntary guidelines like the Global Network Initiative (GNI) are not up to the task of addressing the problem./3</p><p>But neither of the two extreme positions I often hear--pretending these issues do not exist at all or pushing to sever all research and commercial ties with China--serve U.S. interests and values, either.</p><p>U.S. firms also face market access barriers and costs due to Chinese government restrictions around cross border transfer of data. Article 37 of China's Cybersecurity Law requires that certain kinds of data (\"important data\" and \"personal data\") must be stored on local servers or undergo a security assessment before being sent outside of China. There still appears to be a regulatory gray zone in which multinationals in China can send certain kinds of data outside the country, but it is not clear the extent to which this will be the case in the future, given the significant weight given to national security in Beijing's approach to data regulation.</p><p>This is a separate question from the other key issue: the way Chinese companies handle U.S. citizen data does impact U.S. national security. This could mean a Chinese app collecting data from overseas users (like TikTok) or a Chinese company seeking to acquire a U.S. company that has data collected on Americas (like the Ant Financial/Moneygram deal blocked by CFIUS).</p><p>This brings me to my second point:</p><p>2. The Chinese government does not necessarily have unfettered real-time access to all companies' data.</p><p>The government of Xi Jinping has built the most comprehensive cyber governance framework in the world. With the 2017 Cybersecurity Law as the centerpiece, a sprawling framework governs data security and transfer, critical infrastructure, and digital content. This framework underpins the most sophisticated system for online control in the world, which the Chinese government is now using to monitor and restrict population movement in the wake of the Coronavirus./4</p><p>And on March 1, a new sweeping regulation for censoring content took effect./5</p><p>U.S. and Chinese firms must comply with these requirements to operate in China. But what exactly does compliance mean in practice? Nothing is black and white, particularly when it comes to government access to data. Ultimately the Chinese government can compel companies to turn over their data, but this does not always happen.</p><p>U.S. policymakers must start with a fact-based understanding of the reality on the ground, taking into account the internal push and pull of different actors in the system, and the gray zones in the rules. Chinese corporate actors are not synonymous with the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and have their own commercial interests to protect. Failure to take into account the friction within the system can lead to dangerous policy outcomes; decoupling and conflict with China are not in the interest of U.S. security or economic prosperity.</p><p>Many Chinese companies will say privately that they routinely push back against data requests from the government, but they do not want to talk publicly about the fact that they do often resist because doing so draws attention to themselves. In fact, drawing attention to themselves would be counterproductive to the ultimate goal of fighting against government intrusion. In China, media attention will only lead government officials to double down on their request.</p><p>A few examples have come out publicly. The Chinese ride-sharing company Didi initially refused to turn over data to law enforcement authorities investigating the murder of passengers./6</p><p>Tencent and Alibaba refused to feed their transaction data to a government credit reporting program under the People's Bank of China (PBoC)./7</p><p>The Chinese app WeChat states that it does not store the content of user chats for data mining, which may be driven in part to avoid entanglement with the government, according to an article in the Harvard Business Review./8</p><p>It is also important to keep in mind that data requests are made in a manual fashion (request, review, respond). Moreover, there is no single government repository of all data. The PboC and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the state agency responsible for state economic planning, have a history of not sharing data with each other. This is not surprising given the tremendous political power that certain kinds of data can yield in the Chinese system.</p><p>I'd like to walk through how the regulatory regime related to government access to data in China works since the system is very difficult for outsiders to understand in English, let alone by reading the original directives in Chinese. Moreover, many commentators in the U.S. have no experience with the process involved for companies undergoing cybersecurity-related audits in China.</p><p>Among the concerning parts of this cyber governance framework, the Cybersecurity Law (Article 28) states that \"Network operators shall provide technical support and assistance to public security organs and national security organs that are safeguarding national security and investigating criminal activities in accordance with the law.\"/9</p><p>This vague language (which also is echoed in the 2015 Counterterrorism Law/10 and National Security Law)/11 does provide an opening for the government to compel companies to collaborate with intelligence services and law enforcement. Does \"technical support\" mean turning over encryption keys? Does it mean data monitoring by the security services? Maybe, maybe not.</p><p>Compliance often involves lengthy and complicated negotiations between companies and local officials. Local officials must balance competing demands of security with immense pressure to deliver economic development in their jurisdiction. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) derives its ruling authority in large part by providing economic prosperity. Furthermore, different local government agencies often have different objectives. Sometimes companies will leverage connections with officials from other agencies to stop security bureau officials from seeking certain kinds of data./12</p><p>These factors creates a kind of backstop on how far the government tends to go in implementing some of the most worrisome provisions of China's cyber governance regime.</p><p>I'd like to look at recent developments in China's cyber governance system where risk of data access is at issue: a regulatory scheme called the Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS) and the Cryptography Law. Both apply to Chinese and U.S. firms in China.</p><p>(a) Multi-Level Protection Scheme 2.0 (MLPS 2.0)</p><p>MLPS is a security certification regime that the Chinese government established in 2007. In 2018, China's Ministry of Public Security (MPS) released a draft of a new version (referred to as MLPS 2.0). The draft regulation updates the original MLPS regime based on the new principles set out in the 2017 Cybersecurity Law. MLPS ranks from 1 to 5 all information and communications technology (ICT) systems based on their importance to national security, with Level 5 deemed the most sensitive. Anything ranked level 3 or above triggers a suite of regulatory requirements. Companies initiate the process by conducting a self-assessment and working with a third party auditor (typically linked with the local public security bureaus); the auditor conducts interviews on site and observes testing and verification performed by the company. The auditor then writes a report for the provincial or city-level public security bureau.</p><p>To be sure, MLPS 2.0 creates more regulatory scrutiny on foreign technology, along with a host of new market access barriers as the Xi government doubles down on reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and boosting indigenous equipment. While the 2007 version of MLPS only targets information systems controlled by the government, the updated regime covers all information systems (all \"network operators\"), meaning that all private and foreign companies now fall in scope of the review. In the current environment MLPS 2.0 also appears to have a focus on cloud computing, big data platforms, and the Internet of Things.</p><p>While this creates a ton of regulatory headache, there is nothing written down under MLPS that requires firms to provide access to all of their data (or provide encryption keys to the Chinese government). There is a provision that requires information systems graded level 3 and above to undergo \"cybersecurity monitoring\" connected to the public security agency. But there is no definition of what exactly this entails--does this mean a sleepy security guard sits in a facility or a device is installed in the network? The audit is a negotiation--a give and take in which companies hash out with regulators a way to be compliant but not go as far as the most conservative interpretation of the requirements. Again, local bureaus responsible for economic growth in their jurisdiction do not have incentives to demand that companies turn over all of their data. Chinese government regulators understand that certain MLPS requirements like the use of Chinese domestic encryption (as discussed in the next section) create tremendous costs and challenges for foreign companies, which means the use of domestic encryption by foreign firms is rarely enforced.</p><p>(It is important to note that the final regulation for MLPS 2.0 has not yet been released. The latest development in late 2019 is that the core standard of MLPS took effect (spelling out the requirements for each of the five levels of the graded system).)</p><p>(b) New Cryptography Law</p><p>The two most important things to understand about China's encryption regime are (1) the Chinese government wants all companies to use Chinese encryption algorithms; and (2) the vast majority of foreign companies do not do this and regulators rarely enforce it.</p><p>The problem, however, is it is not clear whether this will be the case in the future.</p><p>A major change is underway with the release of the Cryptography Law (which entered force January 1 2020). This law overhauled China's encryption regime after two decades of intense internal debate. The law is concerning on several fronts, but it is too early to determine the impact it will have as we are awaiting follow-on regulations that will offer more details about its scope and how it will be implemented for companies. (New regulations plus standards tied to those will eventually update a 1999 regulation called the Regulation on the Administration of Commercial Cipher Codes.)</p><p>This new law introduces two important changes, among other developments:</p><p>First, it eliminates a significant carve out that has benefitted foreign companies for years. Under the previous regime (centered on the 1999 Regulation on the Administration of Commercial Cipher Codes), the government granted what is known as the \"core function exception.\" This meant that the government permitted the use of products designed with encryption as a general feature (e.g., commercial software). In contrast, products designed to be encryption or security products as their \"core\" function would face restriction. So companies like Symantec and encryption hardware manufacturers, for example, were excluded from the Chinese market, leaving domestic firms to dominate these business segments. However, for the past two decades, many companies have benefited from carve out, including server, database, and software companies considered not to have encryption as their core function.</p><p>The new law is a potential game changer by removing this exception. It is still too early to know whether this means products allowed under the previous regime could be restricted or if they will still be allowed albeit with a new approval process. Nobody knows yet. In place of the exception, the government has indicated that it will focus on requiring certifications for the fifteen products listed in the \"Catalogue of Critical Network Equipment and Network Security-Specific Products\" (\"The Catalogue\" includes items like routers, switches, PLC equipment). This Catalogue came out with the Cybersecurity Law in 2017 and lists network products that must receive a certification before they can enter the market./13</p><p>It is also possible that the new regime could create some new openings for foreign companies, especially smaller companies.</p><p>The second change is that the new law creates a separate category of what is called \"commercial encryption\" (distinct from \"core\" and \"common encryption,\" which both apply to state secrets; \"core\" being the most sensitive). Any item that is identified as a commercial encryption \"mass consumption product\" will not be subject to an import license. The government has not yet released regulations to clarify the scope of \"mass consumption,\" again creating much uncertainty. Depending on how it is implemented, this could mean lifting the burden of having to navigate a lengthy administrative review process (which is often subject to rent-seeking).</p><p>Is operating in a regulatory gray zone--one in which the government has all the power and can change course at any moment--a wise decision for a U.S. company? That is not my area of expertise. I highlight these ambiguities so that U.S. policymakers have an accurate picture of how the process works.</p><p>Part 2. Recommendations</p><p>This first part of my testimony makes clear that China poses real cyber risks to the United States (ethical, commercial, and national security). If the Chinese government wants something, then they can get it, so why is it even important to understand the nuance of how the process works in China, and the fact that there is an internal push and pull, driven by stakeholders with often conflicting agendas? It's easy to make claims that drive headlines on this issue, but my observations are different and can be more difficult to make into short sound bites. I believe U.S. policymakers must have an accurate understanding of the complexities in China's system so that we can respond to the risks it poses in the most responsible and effective manner.</p><p>Here I have two main recommendation for how to do this.</p><p>(2.1) Build a better U.S. cybersecurity and data privacy system</p><p>In order to address the risks presented by Beijing, we should not be reactive, but actively seek to set out a different vision for U.S. internet governance based on a rule of law system.</p><p>The reason why in China there is no guarantee that the Chinese government cannot access data is because China's system lacks clarity of law, oversight mechanisms, and clear pathways for contestation. As U.S. policymakers look to strengthen our own data privacy and cybersecurity system, there are important lessons we can learn. Establishing clear authorities and oversight capacity enables the U.S. government to conduct legitimate national security and law enforcement investigations in such a way that upholds civil liberties and is subject to review and appeal. Here the United States has an opportunity to set out a different vision for U.S. internet governance, one that strikes the appropriate balances among national security, economic, and privacy concerns in a way that promotes strong democratic norms and protects data flow openness.</p><p>The United States would be wise to spend more time working on legislation and the development of standards to better protect privacy and secure data--not just in dealing with China--but for all companies./14</p><p>Lawmakers should accelerate progress on a number of bills addressing algorithmic transparency, strengthening cybersecurity, and mandating higher standards for personal data.</p><p>Developing a comprehensive federal privacy bill is vital to this effort, along with the creation of strong enforcement mechanisms. Inaction by the United States means ceding leadership and influence to both Europe and China in setting international standards.</p><p>Moreover, without higher standards for data security and privacy, U.S. citizen data held by unregulated private companies will be more vulnerable to breaches by hackers from China.</p><p>Equifax's many security issues are well-documented, such as the company's failure to patch known vulnerabilities that ultimately left exposed the data of 145 million Americans. But the hack was also conducted by a foreign government entity with sophisticated hacking capabilities and access to considerable state resources. Setting minimum standards on what data can be collected and retained by all companies will help protect U.S. personal data, regardless of whether the risk is exacerbated by a state-sponsored hacker, a data broker, or a private company transferring the data to Beijing. Companies should not even have access to so much personal data in the first place that can be hacked or transmitted back to Beijing.</p><p>(2.2) How to address cyber risk from China in a way that strengthens global U.S. technological leadership and competitiveness</p><p>We must keep in mind that U.S. actions to respond to data security risks posed by the Chinese government are not occurring in a vacuum. Our policy approach should be tailored to take into account the fact that technology competition with China will not only play out in the United States and China, but also in other places from India to Europe. How we respond to Chinese companies operating in the United States will have ramifications for whether other countries are willing to accept our vision of data governance.</p><p>The ability of U.S. firms to maintain a high rate of innovation depends upon access to global markets, talent, and, perhaps most important, datasets. But an increasingly obstacle to the ability of U.S. companies to operate internationally--beyond China--is rising data sovereignty in places from Europe to India and Vietnam. Data sovereignty refers to efforts by nation-states to ensure control over data by prohibiting transfers of data out of the country or seeking to limit foreign access to certain kinds of data./15</p><p>In this context, our actions will serve as a reference and a roadmap for other governments that are concerned about U.S. companies and the U.S. government getting access their data.</p><p>For example, Indian lawmakers are in the middle of debating a draft data protection bill that would require local storage and processing of Indian citizen data in an effort to boost local technology firms as well as push back against data collection by large U.S. companies./16</p><p>The U.S. government and U.S. industry have lobbied against this law. In this context, the U.S. establishing (or, arguably, contributing to) a precedent of strict data localization rules risks other countries following suit.</p><p>If U.S. firms cannot send data out of countries in which they operate overseas, they lose access to the value of being able to create international data sets. This directly impacts economic growth and AI innovation because of the ways large, diverse, international datasets are core to building artificial intelligence applications that work across a variety of different geographies, languages, cultures, and demographics. A language translation system only trained in China, for instance, will likely not accurately and precisely capture all of the world's spoken languages as much as a language translation system with data from many different countries. Skin cancer predictors trained only on lighter skin tones, to give another example, are likely to have poor accuracy and precision when trying to predict skin cancer with darker skin tones. Policies that leave companies without any access to global datasets under any circumstances will lead to a \"fracturing\" of how AI applications are developed.</p><p>We have an opportunity to set the standards for protecting the flow of data that has underpinned economic growth and the free flow of information around the world, but with the right safeguards in place.</p><p>The challenge, therefore, is how to maintain this openness but with the right guardrails in place.</p><p>The first step is to limit companies' access and retention of data across the board, as discussed earlier.</p><p>We also need to take a targeted approach to restrictions on Chinese companies. In my previous testimonies I argued for an approach based on the idea of a \"small yard, high fence,\" borrowing a phrase used by former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to mean be selective about what we protect, yet aggressive in protecting it. The same idea should apply to restrictions on access to U.S. citizen data.</p><p>The expanded powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)/17 provides one tool to do this. The U.S. government should evaluate the risks when a foreign firm acquires or takes a non-controlling investment stake in an American firm that holds U.S. citizen data. As my Yale colleague Rob Williams writes, CFIUS uses a case-by-case approach to evaluate risk, best understood as a scalpel and not a sledge hammer./18</p><p>Whether through CFIUS or other policy tools, any new restrictions must take a risk-based approach. Not all data has the same level of sensitivity. The mere fact that a Chinese company handles U.S. citizen data in and of itself may not necessarily warrant banning a transaction or blacklisting a specific company. The U.S. national security risks should be evaluated based on an investigation (with regular audits) to determine (a) what kind of U.S. citizen data is being accessed (e.g., metadata, images, geographic data, critical infrastructure data, etc.), (b) how that data is being used and what data protection measures are in place to protect the rights and interests of U.S. consumers, and (c) with whom that data is being shared and through what mechanisms. If based on the outcomes of such an evaluation, we cannot verify that the interests and rights of U.S. consumers will be protected, then that company should be prohibited from storing and sharing U.S. personal data.</p><p>In short, we need a more effective strategy to protect U.S. personal data than one-off bans on companies or where they send their data. We need to address legitimate national security risks where they exist but as one part of a broader U.S. initiative on comprehensive data privacy and higher standards for cybersecurity for all companies (whether U.S. or foreign). These efforts should not name China as a bad actor, but instead create a high bar for how all companies manage their data. Failure to establish a compelling vision for U.S. internet governance will only allow more space around the world for companies controlled by the CCP to flourish worldwide, and Beijing's vision for the internet with it.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1.

I am Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley. I served as Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration, Director of Policy Planning for the Federal Trade Commission in the Carter Administration, and Assistant to the Solicitor General in the Ford Administration.</p><p>\"I am pleased to discuss with you the question whether America has a monopoly problem. My answer is it does. Let me explain.</p><p>\"Not long ago I visited some farmers in Missouri whose profits are disappearing. Why? Monsanto alone owns the key genetic traits to more than 90 percent of the soybeans planted by farmers in the United States, and 80 percent of the corn. Which means Monsanto can charge farmers much higher prices.</p><p>\"Farmers are getting squeezed from the other side, too, because the food processors they sell their produce to are also consolidating into mega companies that have so much market power they can cut the prices they pay to farmers.</p><p>\"This doesn't mean lower food prices to consumers. It means more profits to the monopolists.</p><p>Monopolies All Around</p><p>\"America used to have antitrust laws that stopped corporations from monopolizing markets, and often broke up the biggest culprits.</p><p>\"But antitrust has faded. The result has been hidden upward redistributions of money and power from the majority of Americans to corporate executives of and major investors in huge concentrations of economic power.</p><p>\"Consumers may believe they have lots of choices, but take a closer look and choices are far more constrained:</p><p>1. The four largest food companies control 82 percent of beef packing, 85 percent of soybean processing, 63 percent of pork packing, and 53 percent of chicken processing.</p><p>2. There are many brands of toothpaste, but 70 percent of all of it comes from just two companies.</p><p>3. Consumers may think they have their choice of sunglasses, but almost all sunglasses are from one company: Luxottica - which also owns nearly all the eyeglass retail outlets.</p><p>4. Practically every plastic hanger in America is now made by one company, Mainetti.</p><p>5. Cat food appears to come in many brands, but behind them are basically just two companies.</p><p>6. Consumers can get low-cost generic versions of pharmaceuticals. But drug companies in effect pay the makers of generic drugs to delay cheaper versions. Such \"pay for delay\" agreements are illegal in other advanced economies, but they are commonplace in America. They cost consumers an estimated $3.5 billion a year.</p><p>7. Health insurers are consolidating, too. Which is one reason health insurance premiums, copayments, and deductibles are soaring.</p><p>8. Anyone who thinks they have a lot of options for booking discount airline tickets and hotels online should think again. They have only two. Expedia merged with Orbitz, so that's one company. And then there's Priceline.</p><p>9. How about cable and Internet service? At most, consumers have a choice of just four companies; many consumers are served by just one or two.</p><p>10. Today, four airlines control 80 percent of domestic airline seat capacity. In 93 of the top 100 airports, either one or two airlines manage a majority of all seats sold.</p><p>11. What about choice of bank? The five biggest commercial banks now control nearly half of all banking assets, as well as ATM networks.</p><p>12. Three rating agencies control 95 percent of the market for rating bonds and other financial instruments: Moody's, Standard &amp;#38; Poor's, and Fitch.</p><p>\"The problem with all this consolidation is that giant firms don't have to compete very much, if at all. Which means they can - and do - raise prices higher than they'd be if they faced more competition.</p><p>\"But it's not just prices we should worry about.</p><p>\"Such consolidation can also depress wages. Workers with less choice of whom to work for have a harder time getting a raise.</p><p>\"When local labor markets are dominated by one major big box retailer, grocery chain, and a handful of fast-food restaurants, those firms essentially set wage rates for the area.1 Researchers have found that wages drop when fewer employers in a geographic area list most jobs in an occupation.2 Non-compete clauses can also hold down wages. 3</p><p>\"These massive corporations also possess substantial political clout. That's one reason they're consolidating: They don't just seek economic power; they also seek political power.</p><p>\"Antitrust laws were supposed to stop what's been going on.</p><p>We've Forgotten History</p><p>\"In America's first Gilded Age, at the end of the nineteenth century, the public viewed with growing alarm the economic and political power of the huge railroad, steel, telegraph, and oil cartels - then called \"trusts\" - that were essentially running America. A handful of corporate chieftains who came to be known as \"robber barons\" presided over these trusts - collecting great wealth at the expense of workers who toiled long hours often in dangerous conditions for little pay. Corporations gouged consumers and corrupted politics.</p><p>\"America responded to these abuses of power with antitrust laws that allowed the government to break up the largest concentrations. Antitrust was viewed not only in narrow economic terms but also as a means of preventing giant corporations from undermining democracy. \"If we will not endure a king as a political power,\" thundered Ohio's Senator John Sherman, the sponsor of the nation's first antitrust law in 1890, \"we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale\" of what the nation produced. (It is worth noting that when Congress enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act, no separate discipline called \"economics\" existed; the field was known as \"political economy.\")</p><p>\"Then in 1901 the progressive Republican reformer Teddy Roosevelt became President. By this time, the American public was demanding action. In his first message to Congress in December 1901, only two months after assuming the presidency, Roosevelt warned, \"There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people that the great corporations known as the trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare.\" Roosevelt used the Sherman Antitrust Act to sue the Northern Securities Company, a giant railroad trust run by J. P. Morgan, the nation's most powerful businessman. The U.S. Supreme Court backed Roosevelt and ordered the company dismantled.</p><p>\"In 1911, John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust was broken up, too. But in its decision, the Supreme Court effectively altered the Sherman Act, saying that monopolistic restraints of trade were objectionable if they were \"unreasonable\" - and that determination was to be made by the courts. What was an unreasonable restraint of trade? In the presidential election of 1912, Roosevelt, running again for president but this time as a third party candidate, opined that some concentration of industries should be allowed where there were economic efficiencies due to large scale; but these firms should be regulated the public benefit. Woodrow Wilson, who ended up winning the election, and his adviser Louis Brandeis, took a different view. They didn't think regulation would work, and thought all monopolies should be broken up.</p><p>\"For the next sixty-five years, both views dominated. America had strong antitrust enforcement along with regulations that held big corporations in check. Most big mergers were prohibited. Even large size alone was thought to be a problem. In 1945, in the case of United States v. Alcoa (1945), the Supreme Court ruled that even though Alcoa hadn't pursued a monopoly, it had become one by becoming so large that it was guilty of violating the Sherman Act.</p><p>\"All this changed in the 1980s, after Robert Bork - with whom, incidentally, I studied antitrust law with at Yale Law School, and then worked for when he became Solicitor General under President Ford - wrote an influential book called The Antitrust Paradox, which argued that the sole purpose of the Sherman Act is consumer welfare. Bork believed that mergers and large size almost always create efficiencies that lower prices, and therefore should be legal. Bork's ideas were consistent with the conservative Chicago School of Economics, and found a ready audience in the Reagan White House.</p><p>\"Since then, even under Democratic administrations, antitrust has all but disappeared.</p><p>The Particular Problem of Big Tech</p><p>\"America's first Gilded Age began with a raft of innovations - railroads, steel production, oil extraction - but culminated in mammoth trusts. We're now in a second Gilded Age - ushered in by semiconductors, software and the internet - which has spawned a handful of giant hi-tech companies.</p><p>\"Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches now go through Google.4 Facebook and Google dominate advertising, carrying 58 percent of all digital ads; Amazon accounts for 4.2 percent of the digital ad market.5</p><p>\"Facebook and Google are also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 percent of Americans receive news online).6 Apple dominates smartphones, with over 40 percent of the U.S. market.7 Google's Android accounts for 55 percent of all smartphone operating systems in the U.S.; Apple's iOS, for 44 percent.8 Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything - and responsible for an estimated 45 percent of all retail e-commerce in the United States.9</p><p>\"This consolidation at the heart of the American economy is contributing to five problems that go far beyond narrow concepts of consumer welfare.</p><p>\"First, it stifles innovation. Contrary to the conventional view of a US economy bubbling with inventive small companies, the rate at which new job-creating businesses have formed in the United States has been halved since 2004, according to the Census Bureau.10 A major culprit: Big Tech.</p><p>\"Big Tech's sweeping patents and copyrights, huge and growing data collections, dominant networks and platforms, and capacities for predatory behavior -- combined with legions of lawyers ready to sue for infringement of intellectual property, or the poaching of employees -- have become formidable barriers to new entrants. The most that many startups can hope for is to be purchased by Big Tech; but in any such negotiations, Big Tech has the advantage of a monopsony. The second problem is that such large size and gigantic capitalization translate into political power. They allow vast sums to be spent on lobbying, political campaigns, and public persuasion. To take one example, although the European Union filed fined Google a record $2.7 billion for forcing search engine users into its own shopping platforms, American antitrust authorities have not moved against the company.</p><p>\"Why not? In 2012, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition recommended that the Commission sue Google for conduct that \"has resulted--and will result--in real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets,\" but the commissioners chose not to pursue the case, and gave no explanation for their decision. As a former official of the commission, I can tell you it's unusual for the commissioners to decide against a staff recommendation without comment. We can't be sure why the FTC chose not to pursue Google. After all, section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 gives the Commission broad authority to prevent unfair acts or practices. One distinct possibility concerns Google's political power. It has one of the biggest lobbying powerhouses in Washington, and the firm gives generously to Democrats as well as Republicans.</p><p>\"A clearer example of an abuse of power was revealed last November when the New York Times reported that Facebook executives withheld evidence of Russian activity on their platform far longer than previously disclosed.</p><p>\"Even more disturbing, Facebook employed a political opposition research firm to discredit critics.11 How long will it be before Facebook uses its own data and platform against critics? Or before potential critics are silenced even by the possibility? As the Times's investigation made clear, economic power cannot be separated from political power.</p><p>\"A third problem is the ease by which misinformation can be \"weaponized\" through these giant networks. Facebook attracts most of the criticism, but Google's YouTube is generating similar problems. A number of research and news reports have shown how easily YouTube users get sucked into conspiracy theories.12 One recent study showed that after watching YouTube conspiracy videos, a significant number of people became skeptical that the earth is round.13</p><p>\"As long as Facebook and YouTube possess a virtual duopoly over information flows, the only choice for dealing with systematic misinformation flowing through these networks appears to be either requiring that Facebook and YouTube regulate - and therefore censor -- what they consider to be misinformation, or having government do the regulating and censoring. Obviously, neither of these choices is desirable in a democracy. If government does the censoring, democracy would be directly threatened. But democracy would also be threatened if Facebook or Google did the censoring. What's to prevent them from using their power to suppress political views they disagree with?</p><p>\"The best alternative would be to end the information duopoly itself. Absent these networks, information (and misinformation) would have to be distributed through a large number of independent channels, without a centralized platform giving them apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach.</p><p>\"Maintaining competition gets government out of the role of censorship. An analogy would be the Federal Communications Commission, which prohibits common ownership of a full-power broadcast station and daily newspaper if the station's reach encompasses the newspaper's city of publication, in order to maintain competition in communication markets.</p><p>\"The fourth problem is privacy. Big Tech is amassing huge amounts of data about the personal behavior of virtually everyone. The sheer quantity of data will soon become an entry barrier of its own, further entrenching the giants. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg predicts that \"Facebook will know every book, film, and song you ever consumed, and its predictive models will tell you what bar to go to when you arrive at a strange city, where the bartender will have your favorite drink waiting.\" Google's Eric Schmidt says, \"you give us more information about you, about your friends, and ... we don't need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you've been. We more or less know what you're thinking about.\"14</p><p>\"Privacy is a cornerstone of personal freedom. As Senator Lee recognized in 2011,\"the combination of behavioral and personal information enables Google to generate consumer data that is unprecedented in scale and scope. These activities raise serious privacy concerns and may be indicative of an important market that is largely unconstrained by competition. Antitrust enforcement may unlock beneficial competition for the protection of user privacy and avert the need for additional privacy regulation.\"15</p><p>\"Which brings us to the fifth problem: The concentration of data, information, and power in a few giant corporations threaten to undermine civil society. As Senator Lee has said, \"free enterprise and civil society operate in the natural human space -- between the isolated individual and the impersonal state -- where we live, and love, and flourish . . . where everyone can earn a good living and build a good life . . . where the strong and the vulnerable alike can pursue their happiness, and find it . . . together.\"16</p><p>\"But the Big Tech is undermining civil society. Consider, for example, the nonprofit sector, an essential part of civil society. Google is exercising its power to stifle criticisms coming from independent researchers in that sector. As reported by The New York Times, the New America Foundation, an influential think tank, fired researcher Barry Lynn, a sharp critic of platform monopolies like Google's. Why? Lynn had posted a congratulatory note to European officials on their Google decision, and called for American antitrust officials to follow suit. Since its founding in 1999, the New America Foundation received more than $21 million from Google (and its parent company, Alphabet) and from the family foundation of Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet who previously served as chairman of New America's board. According to the Times, Schmidt didn't like Lynn's comments and communicated his displeasure to the president of the New America Foundation. She then accused Lynn of \"imperiling the institution as a whole,\" and fired him, along with his staff.17</p><p>\"Colleges and universities are another important cornerstone of civil society. Big Tech is threatening their independence and integrity as well. The Wall Street Journal reports that Google has quietly financed hundreds of professors at universities such as Harvard and Berkeley to write research papers that help Google defend itself against regulatory challenges to its market dominance -- paying them from $5,000 to $400,000 on a wish-list of topics developed by Google. Google uses the resulting research in courtrooms, regulatory hearings, and congressional hearings. Some professors have allowed Google to see the papers before they are published, enabling Google to offer \"suggestions,\" according to emails obtained by the Journal. The professors' research papers have not disclosed that Google sought them out, and do not necessarily reveal Google's backing.18</p><p>\"Big Tech is also undermining civil society by draining communities of their vibrancy and functions. Amazon draws customers away from local and retailers. Google and Facebook take advertising dollars away from local and regional media. Big Tech's social media platforms drain attention and interactions away social capital within our communities, on which voluntary civil society is built.</p><p>\"There is no easy answer to these five problems. They have become endemic to life in the twenty-first century. But I believe antitrust enforcement can help mitigate them. The biggest of Big Tech should be broken up, or at least be required to make their proprietary technology and data publicly available and to share their platforms with smaller competitors, and should be barred from further acquisitions. There would be little cost to the economy, since these giant firms rely on innovation rather than economies of scale - and, as noted, they're likely to be impeding innovation overall.</p><p>\"It's Time to Revive Antitrust Antitrust is - or should be -- about more than welfare economics. The problems it should be addressing go far beyond helping individual consumers get the best possible deal for themselves.</p><p>\"Most fundamentally, antitrust is about maintaining a free market. As the late Robert Pitofsky, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, noted: \"Antitrust is a deregulatory philosophy. If you're going to let the free market work, you'd better protect the free market.\"19</p><p>\"Antitrust is also about protecting and fostering civil society - robust communities in which individuals have multiple sources of information, deep connections to one another, roots in local and regional economies, abiding commitments to the institutions they share, and freedom from intimidation, whether from a giant government or giant corporations that know everything there is to know about them.</p><p>\"Freedom depends on a free enterprise economy and a voluntary civil society. Antitrust enforcement is the key to both.</p><p>\"It is time to revive antitrust.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1 Arindrajit Dube, Alan Manning, Suresh Naidu, \"Monopsony and Employer Mis-optimization Explain Why Wages Bunch at Round Numbers,\" NBER Working Paper No. 24991, September, 2018.</p><p>2 Jose Azar, Ioana Marinescu, Marshall Steinbaum, \"Labor Market Concentration,\" NBER Working Paper No. 24147, Revised February 2019.</p><p>3 Alan Krueger and Eric :Posner, \"A Proposal for Protecting Low-Income Workers from Monopsony and Collusion,\" Brookings Institution, February 27, 2018.</p><p>4 See Statcounter, <url normalizedValue=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/united-states-of-america\">http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/united-states-of-america</url>.

I am a professor of law at New York University School of Law. I hold the chair of Walter J. Derenberg Professor of Trade Regulation. I have been a member of the faculty of NYU School of Law since 1976. Immediately before then I was a partner in the law firm Simpson Thacher and Bartlett. I graduated from New York University School of Law in 1961 and hold an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Paris-Dauphine (2009). My books include a casebook EU COMPETITION LAW (Elgar 2017) co-authored with Damien Gerard; a casebook US ANTITRUST IN GLOBAL CONTEXT (3rd ed. West 2012); a casebook EUROPEAN UNION LAW (4TH ed. West 2015) co-authored with Goebel, Bermann, Atik, Emmert and Gerard; and a study THE DESIGN OF COMPETITION LAW INSTITUTIONS with Michael Trebilcock (Oxford 2013). My book with Mor Bakhoum, MAKING MARKETS WORK IN AFRICA, will be published in January 2019 by Oxford University Press. My bio may be found on my NYU Law faculty page at <url normalizedValue=\"https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overviewandpersonid=19924\">https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overviewandpersonid=19924</url></p><p>I am pleased to discuss the comparative approaches of the United States and the European Union to the monopoly/abuse of dominance problem, and to suggest how the comparison might facilitate thinking about the new problems we confront in the high tech, big data space. I will first explain the similarities and differences between the two bodies of law, and second suggest lessons from cross-fertilization.</p><p>I attach a short interview of me on the subject of US/EU competition law and big tech, and my article, \"Why Europe Is Different.\"</p><p>I. A COMPARISON</p><p>The United States</p><p>The US Sherman Act was enacted in 1890 to control the power of the big trusts. Senator John Sherman famously said: \"If we will not endure a king..., we should not endure a king of trade.\" n1 Through major legislation in 1914 (the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act) and 1950 (the Cellar Kefauver merger act), Congress extended the reach of the law to control power, to protect the little guy, and to stem a rising tide of economic concentration for social, political and economic ends. Congress tried to ensure against fascism, at one end, and communism, at the other, by protecting the market. Antitrust was the economic democracy of the market. n2 But through the years the Supreme Court excessively expanded the law's reach, condemning some perfectly normal aggressive business behavior, and, beginning especially in 1981 with the Reagan Administration, the Supreme Court set about to cut back the reach of the law. Case by case, the law changed to an efficiency prescription. For mergers the paradigm became: There should be no antitrust intervention unless the transaction would decrease consumer surplus. In monopoly cases, the Court assumed and assumes that what firms do is good for consumers; that freedom of even dominant firms will produce the most efficiency and innovation and thus will be best for consumers, competitiveness and markets. Today in US monopoly law (Section 2 of the Sherman Act), there is relatively small scope for condemnation of conduct as anticompetitive. To be condemned, the acts must not only constitute a use of monopoly power; they must create more monopoly power or at least entrench existing power. And by default presumption, the Court assumes that this will not happen; that the market will work. n3 Many lower courts, and often our two excellent federal antitrust agencies, are more watchful watchdogs against abuses of power than Supreme Court jurisprudence would predict.</p><p>Europe</p><p>Meanwhile in Europe, at the end of World War II, a critical core of European nations resolved to create a new structure of governance so as never to have a war again. Six nations, led by Germany, France and Italy, formed first the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951/52 and then the European Economic Community in 1957/58. The project depended upon community - upon a single European market. As Adam Smith said, people who trade (intensely) together don't fight wars with one another. They come to respect one another and leave hatreds behind. n4 Free trade in the internal market was at the heart of the conception. That meant border barriers must fall. But as the founders correctly anticipated, once tariffs and quotas were abolished, private firms would conspire to re-erect them, and they did. Moreover, most of the nations had their own national champions, often state-owned, and almost always beneficiaries of state-conferred privilege. Thus it was necessary to include antitrust within the Treaty itself, to prevent private power and privileged enterprises from undermining community. As a result, the EU Treaty contains Article 101, against anticompetitive agreements, and Article 102, against abuse of dominance. n5</p><p>Like the US, the EU went through two important phases with regard to the question: When is single-firm conduct anticompetitive? In the first stage, EU law was formalistic. It was very hard on dominant firm conduct that had exclusionary effects on smaller firms. It contained broad presumptions against, for example, exclusive contracts by dominant firms. The second phase came in the 1990s and even more dramatically in the first decade of the new millennium, epitomized by the 2009 guidance on dominant firm conduct. n6 In this second phase, the European Commission adopted, and the Courts followed, a more economic approach. n7 While incorporating economic analysis into the law, Europe retained certain guiding principles and approaches reflecting the place of antitrust in the Treaty. These approaches include: EU law is about community and integration. EU competition law is sympathetic with EU's internal market free-movement law, which stresses the importance of free movement across Member State lines. Likewise, EU law is antagonistic to Member State restraints and the privileges they grant to favored firms. It views such restraints and privileges as distortions of competition. Both aspects - respect for free movement and antagonism to state restraints - are imported into EU competition law and specifically into abuse of dominance law. EU competition law stresses market access and the right to contest markets on the merits. It is sympathetic to access to networks. It is hostile to dominant firms' using leverage to take advantages for themselves at the expense of competitors, thereby \"unleveling the playing field.\" It does not aim to protect inefficient competitors. Rather, EU precedents safeguard a clearer path of the outsider to access markets on the merits, free from obstructions by dominant firms. Nonetheless, from the point of view of detractors who worry about excessive enforcement against dominant firms, the EU approach does protect competitors.</p><p>Presumption and Divergence</p><p>EU competition law adopted its more economic approach nearly two decades ago. However, it never adopted the Chicago School premises. It does not assume markets work well. It does not admonish: Trust the market - especially not when the market is concentrated and dominated by a single firm. It does not presume that antitrust intervention is likely to mess up the market and chill competition and innovation. Its teaching implies a belief that lowering barriers to entry and keeping a clear path for challengers is likely to make the market more dynamic and thus serve consumers better. When dealing with innovation incentives, US cases are likely to assume that antitrust action against a dominant firm will chill the firm's incentives to invent. n8 EU law is more likely to find that the dominant firm's challenged conduct will chill the outsiders' incentives to invent, and has documented this effect in specific cases. n9 While US competition law abhors duties of dominant firms to deal with competitors, calling such duties \"forced sharing,\" undermining incentives to invent, n10 EU law applies a contrary principle: Dominant firms, especially firms with power in one market who compete in an adjacent market, have the special responsibility not to impair rivals' competition on the merits.</p><p>Both jurisdictions want to preserve and facilitate sustainable low pricing even if it displaces small firms that can't keep up with the competition, but US law makes it harder than does EU law to attack below cost pricing. US law requires the plaintiff to prove a probable recoupment scenario (defendant must be likely to recover its losses by charging monopoly prices high enough and long enough after the predatory siege). n11 EU law does not require proof of probable recoupment where the dominant firm had exclusionary intent. n12 It is enough that the predator thought the scheme was worth it.</p><p>Despite these different presumptions and principles, much of the unilateral conduct law is virtually identical on both sides of the ocean. But the different presumptions and principles have resulted in diametrically different results on nearly identical facts in some key cases, especially regarding refusal to deal, as described in my attached article, Why Europe is Different. n13</p><p>II. Implications for Big Tech, Big Data</p><p>The big tech, big data firms are posing challenges to this country and to the world. A handful of high tech giants are dominating markets. The firms generally were started from scratch by entrepreneurs with great ideas that have attracted millions of users. They are networks and make use of network effects, which please consumers (who get more friends or suppliers or buyers), but create high barriers to entry and, with it, power. They offer their products on one side of the market for zero; on the other side they make huge revenues from advertising, often by selling the data of their users. They operate with low-price models, not the high prices that have traditionally attracted antitrust attention. Some have been exposed for serious misuses of data. Some have waged media campaigns of false information against critics. The platforms that offer services in competition with their customers tend to prefer their own products and demote their rivals, to stamp out creative rivals by appropriating their ideas, to mine the data of the firms they host to provide the next big thing, and to breach privacy. Are the firms violating the competition laws? Does it depend on whether the laws are those of the US or those of the EU? It might.</p><p>The new forms of business, even to the extent that they may be abusive, pose challenging questions under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The market definitions are difficult and contestable. Monopoly power may be hard to prove, especially if, as usual, power is measured by the extent to which the firm can raise price above a competitive price for a significant time. Anticompetitive conduct may be difficult to prove, especially if the plaintiff must establish, as frequently demanded, that the conduct lowers output and raises prices.</p><p>Under EU competition law, the case is easier to make. EU law is less demanding of proof of the market. Moreover, a firm might hold a dominant position even when it does not have monopoly power or be dangerously likely to get it as demanded in the United States. It might be a gatekeeper rather than a traditional monopolist. A firm might abuse its dominance when it uses its power in one market to get significant competitive advantages in an adjacent market by blocking competitors' access by conduct that has no competitive merit. An important platform might abuse its dominance under EU law by refusing to deal fairly with a competing rival on the platform when the refusal squeezes out an otherwise efficient rival.</p><p>These qualities of EU law make it a more flexible tool than the Sherman Act to deal with the new problems of high tech/big data. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair methods of competition, also has this flexibility. The flexibility does not prejudge the answers. The European Commission and Courts n14 and the US FTC would want to consider all of the facts; they would consider the reasons for and benefits of the challenged conduct. They would consider the effects on innovation on both sides - the insider seeking to justify its strategy and the outsider or user seeking fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and non-exploitative treatment. The European Commission and the US FTC can consider the consumer protection as well as the antitrust the problems; and the European Commission may consider any violations of the European privacy directive. A holistic treatment of the issues might be what we need.</p><p>The standard for analysis: US/EU</p><p>I will comment on the standard for analysis: What is anticompetitive? Here, perhaps surprisingly, US and EU competition law converge in broad concept, even while displaying big differences in presumptions and applications. Both the US and the EU, by their antitrust laws, are trying to protect the market. Neither law protects inefficient competitors from competition itself. Both laws welcome the winds of competition and sustained low pricing. The Court of Justice expresses the goal of EU competition law variously as protecting consumers' interests and as protecting the interests of all market players - meaning all but those who want protection or privilege. n15 The US Supreme Court sometimes says the goal of US antitrust is consumer welfare and sometimes says (as did Justice Breyer in Leegin) \"to maintain a marketplace free of anticompetitive practices.\" n16 This is the market goal, the robust market goal, or the market process goal. What it does not admit into the antitrust paradigm is protection of non-competition interests.</p><p>There is a false dichotomy afoot that says: Either we protect the tried and true standard of consumer welfare n17 or we sink into a mire of special interests. The real dichotomy is antitrust as market law versus antitrust without market boundaries. US antitrust and EU competition law are market law. This, of course, is the tip of another inquiry - What interventions are good and important to help make the market work better for the good of the people, or to prevent its degradation by the use of economic power? This essay has described two points of view or perspective in answer to the question. Still, the basic market facts that the analyst needs to know are virtually the same.</p><p>Does Europe Discriminate?</p><p>I am of course aware that various colleagues and even Presidents have accused the European Commission of suing successful American high tech firms because they are successful. I have read the European decisions and judgments carefully and I do not believe that the European Commission has discriminated against American firms. The principles applied by the EU courts and Commission to the US firms are principles deeply embedded in the European competition law jurisprudence. Breaking company with US law, EU competition law imposes on dominant firms responsibilities to deal fairly with rivals that are their customers. The whole EU Treaty exudes sympathy with non-discriminatory market access. It is not surprising that President of the European Commission Junker listed second in his 10 Commission priorities for 2015-19: a digital single market. n18 And it is worthy of note that cases very similar to the EU cases have been brought or advocated to be brought in the United States. n19</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>The US antitrust law on monopolization and the EU competition law on abuse of dominance share much in common. They proscribe the anticompetitive conduct of dominant or monopoly firms. However they often part ways in their application, because the United States maintains a default posture that even dominant firms tend to act in the interests of consumers, and a perspective that duties to deal are perverse because they undercut incentives (of the dominant firm) to invent; and in Europe the dominant firm has the responsibility not to obstruct outsiders' efficient competition on the merits, and Europe (more clearly) aspires to unleash outsiders' as well as incumbents' innovation. This century has revealed new forms of competition and innovation and also new forms of power and its abuse. For solutions, we may need law flexible enough and enforcers wise and knowledgeable enough to deal with these new sources and uses of power.</p><p>n1 See 21 Cong. Rec. 2455 et seq.

Introduction</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An increasing number of scholars and advocates have argued recently that US antitrust law should be \"reformed\" in order to invigorate antitrust enforcement and sidestep the judicially-imposed con-straints that have developed over antitrust's 100 year history. Explicitly or not, these efforts seek to bring about a shift in US antitrust that would make it more closely resemble competition law in Europe. While these scholars and advocates assert that their proposals would improve economic conditions in the US, economic logic and the apparent reality from Europe suggest otherwise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indeed, there is much we can learn about the implications of these efforts by understanding the differences between US and EU antitrust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although the differences between US and EU antitrust law can appear minor or superficial at a glance, even small differences can have important consequences, and the cumulative effect of the differences is significant. Although the Commission is often quite careful to couch its decision-making in economic language, in practice, analytical economic administration of antitrust is far from the norm.</p><p>The proposals that would make US antitrust law resemble that of the EU are varied -- from calling for tougher structural presumptions n1 and making predatory pricing claims easier to bring, n2 to weak-ening the consumer welfare standard, n3 punishing dominant firms simply for being dominant, n4 and severely curtailing vertical restraints. n5</p><p>The movement to undermine the hard-won foundations of modern US antitrust law is not re-stricted to a small group of academics. Writing in Vox recently, for example, Matthew Iglesias ven-tured that \"[o]ne idea [for remedying perceived problems with US antitrust] would be for the US to actually move to something more like the European system and abandon the consumer welfare standard.\" n6 In a similar vein, Bloomberg featured a recent article by economics writer Noah Smith heaping praise on the growing populist antitrust wave and its potential to roll back the consumer welfare standard. n7 And, at least according to Commissioner Vestager, the US executive branch agencies have expressed a \"renewed deeper interest and curiosity as to what we are doing in Eu-rope[.]\" n8</p><p>While compared with some other foreign jurisdictions the EU's approach to competition policy appears close to that of the US, it is fundamentally at odds with the sound economics that under-pins much of US antitrust law in several crucial ways. In particular, these divergences between EU and US law point to four key areas where the EU approach threatens to undermine consumers and constrain the region's economic growth: n9</p><p>1. Precautionary principle vs. error cost framework</p><p>The US Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the limitations the courts face in distinguishing between pro- and anticompetitive conduct in antitrust cases, particularly the risk of false positives in monopolization cases. n10</p><p>The Court has also expressed concerns, originally laid out in Judge Frank Easterbrook's seminal article, The Limits of Antitrust, that the cost to consumers arising from type I errors might be greater than those attributable to type II errors because \"the economic system corrects monopoly more readily than it corrects judicial errors.\" n11</p><p>The EU's \"precautionary principle\" approach is the antithesis of this. It is rooted in a belief that markets do not -- or, more charitably, are unlikely -- to function well in general, and certainly not sufficiently to self-correct in the face of monopolization.</p><p>Of course, no one believes that markets are perfect, or that antitrust enforcement can never be ap-propriate. The question is the marginal, comparative one: Given the realities of politics, economics, the limits of knowledge, and the errors they can lead to, which imperfect response is preferable at the margin? That is: Should we give antitrust enforcers and private plaintiffs more room to operate, or should we continue to cabin their operation in careful, economically grounded ways, aimed squarely at opti-mizing -- not minimizing -- the amount of antitrust enforcement?</p><p>This may be a question about changes at the margin, but it is far from marginal. It goes to the heart of the role of the market in the modern economy. While there are plenty of views on this, the arguments that the market has failed us in ways that more antitrust would correct are unsupported. We should certainly continue to look for conditions where market failures of one kind or another justify intervention, but we should not make policy on the basis of mere speculation, and we should certainly not do so without taking into account the likelihood and costs of regulatory failure, as well. In order to reliably adopt sound antitrust policy that might improve upon the status quo (which has evolved over 100 years of judicial decisions, generally along with the field's copious ad-vances in economic understanding), we need far, far better information about the functioning of markets and the consequences of regulatory changes than is currently available. Unfortunately, there is little indication that this concern resonates at the European Commission.</p><p>2. Presumptions vs effects-based analysis</p><p>While US antitrust law generally requires a full-blown, effects-based analysis of challenged behavior -- particularly in the context of unilateral conduct (monopolization or abuse of dominance) and vertical restraints -- the EU continues to rely heavily upon presumptions of harm or woefully trun-cated analysis. Even the EU's highest court has, finally, recognized the paucity of the Commis-sion's analysis in this area in its recent Intel decision, which offers some small encouragement that we will see some movement toward better analysis by the Commission, as well. n12</p><p>This difference between the US and the EU with respect to the reliance on presumptions in anti-trust cases is, at root, a manifestation of the relative adherence of the US regime to economic prin-ciples, and their relative disregard in the EU. The US approach is consistent with the learnings from modern economics, which near-universally counsel against presuming competitive harm on the basis of industry structure (e.g., the extent of concentration in a market), particularly in the case of unilateral, vertical restraints.</p><p>As discussed below, there is no reliable empirical support for claims that concentration is increas-ing, or that it necessarily leads to, or has led to, increased market power and the economic harm associated with it. n13 There is even less support for claims that concentration leads to the range of social ills ascribed to it by advocates of \"populist\" antitrust. By the same token, there is little evi-dence that the application of antitrust or related regulation to more vigorously prohibit, shrink, or break up large companies will correct these asserted problems.</p><p>Meanwhile, economic theory, empirical evidence, and experience teach that vertical restraints rarely harm competition and often benefit consumers by reducing costs, better distributing risk, better informing and optimizing RandD activities and innovation, aligning manufacturer and dis-tributor incentives, lowering price, increasing demand by inducing greater supply of promotional services, and/or creating more efficient distribution channels.</p><p>As the FTC's former Director of the Bureau of Economics explained in summarizing the body of economic evidence analyzing vertical restraints: \"it appears that when manufacturers choose to im-pose [vertical] restraints, not only do they make themselves better off but they also typically allow consumers to benefit from higher quality products and better service provision.\" n14 A host of other studies corroborate this assessment. n15 As one of these notes, \"some studies find evidence consistent with both pro- and anticompetitive effects... virtually no studies can claim to have identified in-stances where vertical practices were likely to have harmed competition.\" n16 Similarly, \"in most of the empirical studies reviewed, vertical practices are found to have significant pro-competitive ef-fects.\" n17</p><p>At the very outside, we must consider ourselves to be profoundly uncertain of the effects of vertical conduct (particularly in the context of modern, high-tech and platform industries), with the proviso that, so far, most of what we do know suggests that this conduct is good for consumers. But even that worst-case version of the state of our knowledge is inconsistent with the presump-tions-based approach taken by the EU. And by adopting presumptions against conduct for which there is no economic basis to do so, the EU's stance is far more hostile to novel business conduct, especially in these innovative contexts. As a result, the EU necessarily errs on the side of their con-demnation, deterring beneficial business activities where authorities should, rather, try to better understand them first.</p><p>3. Extraction of rents vs. extension of monopoly</p><p>While US monopolization law prohibits only predatory or exclusionary conduct that results in both the unlawful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power and in the creation of net harm to consumers, the EU also punishes the mere exercise of monopoly power -- that is, the charging of allegedly \"excessive\" prices by dominant firms (or the use of \"exploitative\" business terms). Thus, the EU is willing to punish the mere extraction of rents by a lawfully obtained domi-nant firm, while the US punishes only the unlawful extension of market power.</p><p>There may be multiple reasons for this difference, including the EU's particular history with state-sponsored monopolies and its unique efforts to bring about the integration of its internal market. But, whatever the reason, the US approach, unlike the EU's, is grounded in a concern for mini-mizing error costs -- not in order to protect monopolists or large companies, but to protect the consumers who benefit from more dynamic markets, more investment, and more innovation. At the same time, the US approach mitigates the serious risk of simply getting it wrong - which is in-credibly likely where, for example, \"excessive\" prices are in the eye of the beholder and are ex-tremely difficult to ascertain econometrically.</p><p>4. Non-economic factors and the politicization of antitrust vs. an economically grounded con-sumer welfare standard</p><p>American and European antitrust regimes also differ substantially with regard to the objectives they pursue, and the extent for which these are - or are not - grounded in mainstream economics. Whereas, the US is guided by the consumer welfare standard, the goals of European competition enforcers are both diverse, and often untethered from economic thinking. A quick glance at Eu-rope's main competition provisions is highly revealing. Take article 102 TFEU - Europe's equiva-lent to Section 2 of the Sherman act:</p><p>Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the internal mar-ket or in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market in so far as it may affect trade between Member States.</p><p>Such abuse may, in particular, consist in:</p><p>a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions;</p><p>b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of con-sumers;</p><p>c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading par-ties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;</p><p>d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial us-age, have no connection with the subject of such contracts. n18</p><p>It is striking that firms can infringe Article 102 with practices that are either \"unfair,\" prejudice consumers, place trading partners at a disadvantage, or impose obligations that depend on the be-havior of other, non-contracting parties. Not only are these broad categories sometimes mutually exclusive (a firm could very well prejudice consumers by not disadvantaging some of its trading partners) but, more importantly, many of these concepts are almost impossible to translate into economic thinking.</p><p>Although the tersely worded Sherman Act, with its prohibitions on any contract \"in restraint of trade\" n19 or attempts to \"monopolize\", n20 is notoriously ambiguous, over the course of more than a century the Supreme Court has developed jurisprudence to limit these provisions to certain prac-tices that restrict consumer welfare. It thereby grounded American antitrust enforcement in a re-quirement of rigorous economic analysis.</p><p>This is not all merely an academic question: there are real and damaging consequences that can follow from the antitrust prescriptions based on the EU model. As I discuss below, by endorsing open-ended enforcement, the EU courts have ultimately exposed EU competition law to increased politicization. Because EU regulators can call upon a large list of justifications for their enforce-ment decisions, they are free to pursue cases that best fit within a political agenda, rather than fo-cusing on the limited practices that are most injurious to consumers. In other words, there is largely no definable set of metrics to distinguish strong cases from weak ones under the EU model; what stands in its place is political discretion.</p><p>In the US we have been there before. US antitrust struggled to incorporate a wide variety of often conflicting values throughout the early and mid-twentieth century -- what Robert Pitofsky dubbed \"the political content of antitrust\" n21 -- and it was anything but a resounding success. As Robert Bork wrote at the time:</p><p>The thesis of this book has been that modern antitrust has so decayed that the policy is no longer intellectually respectable. Some of it is not respectable as law, more of it is not respectable as economics; and now I wish to suggest that because it pretends to one ob-jective while frequently accomplishing its opposite, and because it too often forwards trends dangerous to our form of government and society, a great deal of antitrust is not even respectable as politics. n22</p><p>We have thus learned over time, through hard-won experience, that antitrust works best when it focuses on economically sound, empirically rooted analysis that frames its inquiry with a clear and singular goal: the welfare of consumers.</p><p>American and European antitrust regimes also differ significantly when it comes to establishing anticompetitive effects. European competition law's overarching goal is to protect a system of \"un-distorted competition.\" n23 Accordingly, European authorities generally operate under the assump-tion that \"competitive\" market structures ultimately lead to better outcomes for consumers. This contrasts with American antitrust enforcement which, by pursuing a strict consumer welfare goal, systematically looks at the actual impact of a practice on economic parameters, such as prices and output. In other words, European competition enforcement assumes that concentrated market structures likely lead to poor outcomes and thus sanctions them, whereas US antitrust law almost systematically looks into the actual effects of a practice. The main consequence of this distinction is that, compared to the US, European competition law has established a wider set of per se prohibi-tions and sets a lower bar for plaintiffs to establish the existence of anticompetitive effects. Because of this lower evidentiary threshold, EU competition decisions are also subjected to a less stringent judicial review.</p><p>Despite asserting that EU competition law is \"better\" than that of the US, and that emulating the EU will improve economic conditions in the US, references to the likely outcome -- positive or neg-ative -- of the expanded antitrust experiment in the EU are not provided. Moreover, as noted be-low, to the extent the European experience is assessed at all, these assessments are manifestly unreliable.</p><p>Unfortunately for proponents of this expanded approach to antitrust, the European experience is anything but an unmitigated success. The European Union has not outperformed the United States since the turn of the century. Quite the opposite. Between the years 2000 and 2017, GDP per capita grew from $34,916 to $40,088 in the Euro area (14.81%), and from $45,055 to $53,128 in the United States (17.92%). n24 Although economic growth is a multivariate phenomenon in which antitrust policy plays only a part, these numbers should at the very least dispel the myth that reforming antitrust law would somehow alleviate all of the ills that allegedly dog the American economy. n25</p><p>II. The specious lure of excessively discretionary antitrust</p><p>Antitrust is an attractive regulatory tool for a number of reasons. As noted above, the vague, terse language of the Sherman Act readily lends itself to \"interpretation\" imbuing it with virtually limit-less scope. Indeed, the urge to treat antitrust as a legal Swiss Army knife capable of correcting all manner of social and economic ills is apparently difficult to resist. Conflating size with market power, and market power with political power, many recent calls for regulation of the tech indus-try are framed in antitrust terms, even though they are mostly rooted in nothing recognizable as modern, economically informed antitrust legal claims or analysis.</p><p>But that attraction is precisely why we should care about the scope, process, and economics of anti-trust and the extent of its politicization. Antitrust in the US has largely resisted the relentless effort to politicize it. Despite being rooted in vague and potentially expansive statutory language, US anti-trust is economically grounded, evolutionary, and limited to a set of achievable social welfare goals. In the EU, by contrast, these sorts of constraints are far weaker. Whether or not that is suitable for the particular political and historical circumstances of the EU is a separate question. But, undoubt-edly, applying a controversial legal regime to the United States -- a markedly different jurisdiction with a unique governance structure -- and upsetting more than a century of legal, technological, and social development, is deeply problematic.</p><p>This conclusion is in no way altered by the fact that US antitrust law has become the outlier of global antitrust enforcement, compared to the EU's more \"consensual\" approach. n26 What matters is a policy's actual results, not whether it is widely adopted; the world is full of debunked beliefs that were once widely shared. And it is far from certain that the widespread adoption of the EU model is in any way indicative of superior results. It is equally (or even more) plausible that this model has proliferated because it naturally accommodates politically useful populist narratives -- such as \"big is bad,\" robin hood fallacies and robber baron myths -- that are constrained by the US's more evidence-based and rational antitrust decision-making. n27 America's isolation might thus be a testament to its success rather than an emblem of its failure. But even if by some chance the European approach proved to be optimal for many other countries in the world, it is still dubious that its adoption would lead to improved economic performance in the United States. As has already been alluded to, the unique features of the US legal regime make it unlikely that the best policy for the EU would also happen to be the best one for America.</p><p>The EU's more aggressive pursuit of technology platforms under its antitrust laws demonstrates many of the problems with its approach in general. I urge this subcommittee to consider not just whether the EU approach seems to permit the government to reach a preconceived outcome -- i.e., placing large tech platforms under increased antitrust scrutiny -- but whether it is truly desirable at all to emulate the EU's approach and to try to reach the goals of EU competition policy under US antitrust law. Endorsing the European approach to antitrust, in a naive attempt to bring high-pro-file cases against large Internet platforms, would prioritize political expediency over the rule of law. It would open the floodgates of antitrust litigation and facilitate deleterious tendencies, such as non-economic decision-making, rent-seeking, regulatory capture, and politically motivated enforce-ment.</p><p>Bringing US antitrust enforcement in line with that of the EU would thus unlock a veritable Pan-dora's box of concerns that are currently kept in check. Chief among them is the use of antitrust laws to evade democratically and judicially established rules and legal precedent. When consider-ing this question, it is important to see beyond any particular set of firms that enforcement offi-cials and politicians may currently be targeting. An antitrust law expanded to consider the full scope of soft concerns that the EU aims at will not be employed against only politically disfavored companies, companies in other jurisdictions, or in order to expediently \"solve\" otherwise political problems. Once antitrust is expanded beyond its economic constraints and imbued with political content, it ceases to be a uniquely valuable tool for addressing real economic harms to consumers, and becomes a tool for routing around legislative and judicial constraints.</p><p>A. The European approach to Facebook and Google as cautionary tale</p><p>The question of whether technology platforms should be regulated (and why) is a contentious one. But whatever the political, economic, or social rationale impelling regulation, it remains a crucial question whether antitrust -- or competition policy implemented through other laws -- is the proper regulatory lever. Despite many claims that European authorities, through their competition laws, have adopted a \"better\" approach toward regulating technology platforms, these claims are generally based on an a priori preference for the outcome -- not on a careful assessment of the under-lying legal interpretation and its broader implications.</p><p>Indeed, Europe's recent (and ongoing) experience with applying antitrust to both Facebook and Google presents a cautionary tale, not a model. As these examples show, moving towards a more open-ended enforcement of antitrust law (potentially converging with EU competition law) entails significant risks.</p><p>1. Facebook</p><p>The German Bundeskartellamt's (Federal Cartel Office, or \"FCO\") ongoing Facebook investiga-tion, for which an infringement decision is said to be in the pipeline, n28 is a stark case of the un-principled extension of antitrust to attempt to reach a politically favored result. Indeed, in contrast to the European Commission -- which at least often mentions economic analysis in its decisions -- the FCO did not include any economic analysis or an attempt to gauge the actual effects of the complained-of conduct on users in its preliminary assessment. The FCO's investigation thus bears all the traits of consumer protection enforcement (which, in Europe at least, tends to rely upon bright-line rules and little analysis of effects) rather than competition scrutiny (which nominally entails at least some inquiry into to the economic effect of firms' conduct).</p><p>The crux of the case concerns Facebook's collection of users' personal data outside its site -- data that is then merged with Facebook's user profiles. n29 The German competition agency asserts in its preliminary assessment that Facebook (which it \"assumes... is dominant\") is \"abusing this domi-nant position by making the use of its social network conditional on its being allowed to limitlessly amass every kind of data generated by using third-party websites and merge it with the user's Face-book account.\" n30</p><p>Note that the allegation on its face is not that Facebook forecloses other sites from amassing this external data, nor that its data collection amounts to anticompetitive harm (e.g., supracompetitive prices) to consumers. Rather, its allegation is that Facebook's terms of service authorizing this data collection are simply not good for consumers, regardless of their acceptance of the terms, and thus constitute an abuse of dominance. \"In the authority's assessment, consumers must be given more control... and Facebook needs to provide [consumers] with suitable options to effectively limit this collection of data.\" n31</p><p>The German competition authority is thus attempting to use its antitrust authority to impose on consumers (and Facebook) its idiosyncratic political preferences, in this case with regard to privacy. But turning voluntary contract terms that are not, in and of themselves, anticompetitive into an antitrust violation requires a remarkable and unprecedented sleight of hand.</p><p>To begin with, the FCO asserts that this data -- data collected from outside of Facebook -- is \"essen-tial\" for other social networks to compete with Facebook. But, despite asserting that its assessment is not based on how Facebook uses internal data collected from users' interactions with Facebook directly, the FCO appears to convert this external data into an essentiality by condemning Face-book's superior ability to combine it with its own internal data:</p><p>Facebook has superior access to the personal data of its users and other competition-relevant data. Because social networks are data-driven products, access to such data is an essential factor for competition in the market. The data are relevant for both[] the prod-uct design and the possibility to monetise the service. If other companies lack access to comparable data resources, this can be an additional barrier to market entry. n32</p><p>The effect of this is to condemn Facebook's success -- and even, perhaps, to end up demanding that Facebook share its internal data -- without saying so outright. The reference to \"comparable data resources\" is an unmistakable nod to the essential facilities doctrine, which can require access to a firm's competition-relevant inputs where comparable inputs cannot be obtained elsewhere. Here the FCO appears to be asserting that competitors' effective use of external data is thwarted if they do not have comparable internal data with which to combine it. But, of course, Facebook has this data only as a result of its success in bringing users to its platform. And it would be the height of unmoored antitrust enforcement to demand that other social networks, which do not operate through Facebook (in contrast, say, to advertisers, who do reach consumers via Facebook), must have access to Facebook's internal data simply to give them a leg up in competing with a more suc-cessful rival. And yet, that is precisely what the authority seems to be suggesting -- just indirectly by purporting to rest its claim on access to external data (which, like Facebook, competing social net-works certainly do try to use).</p><p>Of course, lack of access to a successful company's resources is a form of barrier to entry in every case where a challenger wishes to enter a market where existing firms are long established. The same argument that the FCO makes with respect to Facebook and data could be applied to any firm that has a strong reputation, significant brand value, substantial customer loyalty, or even large real estate holdings or an established line of credit with a bank. For antitrust to require com-petitor access to these resources would be to undermine completely the competitive market forces that antitrust is supposed to support. And yet the FCO does not -- and cannot -- distinguish these valuable types of capital from that of access to a large pool of self-generated consumer data.</p><p>The FCO also alleges that Facebook's \"exploitative business terms\" n33 constitute an antitrust viola-tion because \"[t]he damage for the users lies in a loss of control: they are no longer able to control how their personal data are used.\" n34 But the allegedly exploitative nature of this loss of control is a function of European data protection laws, not antitrust law. The FCO appears to convert the al-leged data protection law violation into an antitrust offence because, [a]ccording to the authority's preliminary assessment, when operating this business model Facebook, as a dominant company, must consider that its users cannot switch to other social networks. Participation in Facebook's network is conditional on registration and unrestricted approval of its terms of service. Users are given the choice of either accepting the \"whole package\" or doing without the service. n35</p><p>But because of the essentiality of Facebook's internal data, this choice is alleged to be a false one. And thus consumers \"have no option to avoid the merging of their data\" n36 -- a violation, the FCO asserts, of data protection law. In this way the FCO uses data protection law as a foothold to build a convoluted antitrust case that really amounts to nothing more than the condemnation of Face-book's size and success.</p><p>This is exactly the sort of uneasy merging of general social policy and the tools of competition pol-icy that is so corrosive to the rule of law. Using the language of antitrust, the FCO is basically mak-ing a case that Facebook should be subject to competition law penalties for possessing more data than the FCO thinks is appropriate. Perhaps there are violations under other laws -- data security or privacy laws, e.g. -- but nothing in the FCO's discussion of its preliminary assessment suggests anything recognizable in the economic literature as an abuse of dominance.</p><p>The FCO's approach would dramatically expand the scope of German (and possibly European) competition law. As some commentators have observed, any dominant company that infringes any legal obligation aimed at protecting consumers -- regardless of whether the violation actually re-sults from the absence of competition, results in cognizable anticompetitive effects, or extends the company's dominance -- could be found to infringe competition law. n37</p><p>Although particularly egregious here, the FCO's efforts to reach beyond the limited constraints of competition law are not new. Starting in 2017, the FCO has been progressively urging for expan-sion of its powers into a broader consumer protection set of tools. n38 Thus, even if it is unsuccessful in building its case under the current state of the law, the FCO is laying the foundations for con-vincing the German legislature why it needs vast new powers to combine consumer protection and competition into a single regulatory authority. Notably, even the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) -- which has both consumer protection and competition mandates -- treats these missions separately, and regards competition cases to arise only under competition law, and not from the violation of specific consumer protection rules.</p><p>The implications of this approach are obvious. If competition law is unconstrained on its own terms -- that is, it unmoored from a set of subject-specific constraints imposed by courts and legisla-tures -- it threatens to become a large, sprawling, economy-wide set of regulations that resembles more closely a national industrial policy. The merits or demerits of actually having an economy-wide industrial policy aside, it is unquestionably a bastardization of antitrust law to facilitate the im-position of policies from law and regulation outside of competition policy, in ways that of necessity will promote other polices at the very expense of competition.</p><p>And, although this is a German case, its antecedents in the prevailing orthodoxy of EU law are not hard to recognize. Though the Commission frequently makes noises about conducting an eco-nomic analysis, as I discuss below, the EU's competition process is, at root, a political one. As such, a tremendous amount of leeway is afforded to EU competition regulators. This makes sense, on its own terms: the Commission is, after all, a policy-making body directly responsive to the pol-icy preferences of the President of the European Commission. n39 While the Commission may some-times cite to economics in its decisions, it fundamentally structures its activities in a way that affords it a large degree of policy-making discretion.</p><p>The Bundeskartellamt's action, although specific to Germany, makes (unfortunate) sense against this backdrop. Where, unlike in the US, antitrust enforcement is viewed as a political function of the state, regulators administering competition policy can surely be relied upon to turn it into a general regulatory apparatus, as much as possible. While this is precisely what some advocates seem to want for US antitrust, doing so entails enormous risk and the potential agglomeration of mas-sive political power outside of our democratically elected branch of government.</p><p>2. Google</p><p>The European Commission's Google Shopping case likewise illustrates the fundamental problems and deep-seated inappropriateness of the EU's approach to antitrust for the US. n40 In its decision, the Commission, in the name of protecting small competitors, substituted its own judgment for the judgment of Google in administering its search algorithms.</p><p>The basic claim is that Google unfairly manipulated its search engine algorithms to benefit itself and to harm competition. In the Google Shopping decision, the European Commission concluded that \"Google does not position and display in the same way results from Google's comparison shopping service and from competing comparison shopping services.\" n41 Over the course of more than a hundred pages, the decision adduces copious evidence to prove that this preferential treat-ment of Google's services over those its competitors coincided with a drop off in traffic to these sites, and a relative increase in traffic to Google's comparison shopping results. It also asserts -- with far less robust evidence -- that this traffic pattern impaired or even destroyed these sites. n42 On this basis, the Commission concluded that Google \"excluded\" these rivals, that this interfered with the \"competitive process,\" and thus that Google prevented its rivals from \"competing on the mer-its.\" n43</p><p>The glaring defect in the decision is that, while it devotes nearly all of its 216 pages to describing the fact of Google's non-neutrality and its relative effect on traffic to other comparison shopping sites, it offers only conclusory statements asserting that this diversion of traffic had, or will have, anticompetitive effect. Rather, the decision asserts that Google's conduct makes competition more difficult for its rivals and generates more revenue for Google than would \"impartial\" conduct, and asserts that this is sufficient to demonstrate anticompetitive harm. What the decision never as-sesses, however, is whether this self-preferencing treatment actually results in harm to consumers. \"The commission said Google abused its dominance of online search to promote its own compari-son-shopping service and relegate those of rivals. Yet it did not show, for instance, that consumers were denied a superior service as a consequence.\" n44</p><p>Even if it is true that competing comparison shopping sites received more visitors when they were ranked higher in Google's search results, and that their traffic plummeted when Google updated its algorithm to promote its own comparison shopping results at the top of its search results pages, the fact of that drop in traffic, simply because it resulted from \"non-neutral\" treatment, does not amount to evidence of anticompetitive effect.</p><p>Google's allegedly anticompetitive conduct, in other words, was to favor its own results over those of its competitors. But without evidence (or even analysis) of the effect on consumers, the conclu-sion simply does not follow from the premise. A scheme of \"impartial results that do[es] not bene-fit [Google] financially\" n45 -- as the founders of Foundem.com, among Google's most vocal comparison shopping critics, prefer -- is, in fact, inherently no better (or worse) for consumers than one that benefits Google at Foundem's expense.</p><p>Without evidence of actual consumer harm, the Commission simply presumed its existence from the structure of the market, discounting the possibility that that structure was derived from con-sumer-welfare-enhancing innovations and product improvements. EU competition law is thus in-terpreted to grant Foundem -- and every other site that can claim it competes with Google and happened to make it to the top of Google's search results at some arbitrarily determined point in history -- a virtual entitlement to a previous, idiosyncratic state of affairs, and to penalize develop-ments impelled by new technology and changing consumer preferences. n46 Such an entitlement will not only deter the continued improvement of Google's search engine and decimate innovation by competitors hoping to unseat the incumbent, it is an unprecedented legal anomaly. n47</p><p>Competitors like Foundem (one of the chief instigators of the EU complaint against Google) found themselves in an asset specificity trap: they engineered their services to be entirely depend-ent upon Google's algorithms as they were written at a particular time. Google, as it has since its inception, continued to develop its services. Part of that development obviously benefits users, and part of that benefit undoubtedly has some negative effect on competitors that benefit from the sta-tus quo ante. But the Commission simply discounted all of the many ways that Google's algorith-mic changes benefit users and instead opted to focus on the harm that small competitors faced when Google changed its services. The competitors in question were still free, of course, to com-pete on the merits, and many still do. What the Google Shopping decision truly is, however, is the Commission using antitrust law to preference companies that may have made overly risky business decisions, locking in the Commission's unsubstantiated preference for a particular market struc-ture.</p><p>In short, absent injury to consumers, there is no coherent antitrust principle that would properly endorse a company's decisions when they happen to benefit a particular competitor, but condemn the same decisions when they happen to harm it. Conduct that leads to a decrease in traffic for, say, Foundem but improves Google for consumers is not necessarily anticompetitive or otherwise problematic -- any more than was Google's conduct that benefitted Foundem in the first place. n48 And yet nowhere in the Commission's 200-plus page Google Shopping decision does it establish that Google's conduct actually harmed consumers -- only that it harmed competitors like Foundem.</p><p>It must be said that the trappings of economic analysis and the preservation of competition to the benefit of consumers are present -- rhetorically -- in the decision. But they are just that: trappings. The reality is that the Commission's Google Search decision offers a defense only of a structuralist approach aimed at protecting competitors, not consumers. To be sure, the theory under which the decision purports to operate is theoretically consistent with modern economic theories of possible consumer harm (as unlikely as they are to arise). But the elements that the Commission thinks sufficient to prove its case, and the proof offered by the decision, are manifestly at odds with an actual consumer-focused case.</p><p>B. Competition law as a tool for censorship</p><p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (ACCC) has recently made recommendations in a new report that demonstrate exactly the potential harms that come with a competition authority vested with broad discretion and a political mandate disconnected from rig-orous economics.</p><p>The ACCC report starts with a discussion of basic competition principles, including when a firm may be considered to be dangerously exercising its market power:</p><p>Australian law does not prohibit a business from possessing significant market power or using its efficiencies or skills to \"out compete\" its rivals. But when their dominant posi-tion is at risk of creating competitive or consumer harm, governments should stay ahead of the game and act to protect consumers and businesses through regulation. n49</p><p>Thus, the ACCC claims both that it is not illegal to obtain market power, and that it will punish the possession of market power -- without an actual harm -- as long as the dominant firm is \"at risk of creating competitive or consumer harm.\" This is, in other words, a purely discretionary model.</p><p>Starting with the assertion that both Facebook and Google have substantial market power, n50 the Commission then opines that \"the ubiquity of digital platforms mean many consumers feel they have to join or use these platforms, and agree to their non-negotiable terms of use, in order to re-ceive communications and remain involved in community life.\" n51 Noting a lack of \"transparency\" in how the feed, advertising, and search algorithms work on Facebook and Google (which is a strange assertion given that these are ostensibly valuable trade secrets), the ACCC outlines a pa-rade of horribles that therefore obtain: a risk that the firms will favor their own content, n52 a risk that advertisers ads aren't being served, n53 risks of constraints on consumer choice, n54 and a risk of filter bubbles developing. n55</p><p>The ACCC proposes a number of \"remedies\" for these problems, but one proposed solution well highlights the problems that arise when using the facade of competition policy to effect political ends. In particular, it recommends the creation of a new regulatory authority tasked with oversee-ing the algorithmically driven feeds of Google and Facebook. More specifically, the authority would be \"tasked with monitoring, investigating and reporting on the criteria, commercial arrange-ments or other factors used by relevant digital platform... to impact ...the ranking and display of news and journalistic content with the aim of identifying the effects of algorithms or other policies on the production of news and journalistic content or competition in media markets.\" n56</p><p>Further, The ACCC considers that such a regulatory approach would provide assurances to both businesses and consumers that algorithms are not... operating in such a way as to cause significant detriment to the production of news and journalistic content or media mar-kets. n57</p><p>The implications are both clear and troubling: The ACCC wants to use competition law as a hook to set up what amounts to a national censorship board to ensure that the \"right\" kind of news is being promoted through Google and Facebook. Most concerning of all, given the existing ability of users to select the news they see in their Facebook feeds, in particular, it is not clear how (or whether) such an authority would preserve user-driven content within the context of Facebook's algorithm. And whether or not censorship is the stated goal of such an authority, the risks with this approach to competition law should be immediately apparent to anyone passingly familiar with the history of national censorship boards. Moreover, this freewheeling approach to competi-tion law is precisely the danger we want to avoid in the US, and a danger that becomes all the more possible were we to import the sort of vast discretion we see in Germany, Australia, and the EU.</p><p>III. Should we be concerned about concentration, and should we look to EU competition policy to combat it?</p><p>We have, of course, been debating these matters throughout the course of antitrust and consumer protection history. As judicial doctrine and regulatory policy have evolved over the past century to incorporate our better (but still far from perfect) understanding of industrial organization and the consequences of antitrust enforcement, they have moved generally toward, rather than away from economically grounded policies aimed at the protection and promotion of consumer welfare. And yet, throughout that time, presumptions at odds with economic learning and empirical evidence, and preferences to defend politically favored stakeholders (or to \"defend\" antitrust from the as-serted political power of large corporations) have repeatedly crept back into the discussion.</p><p>Nowhere is this more consistently the case than with respect to the efforts to condemn market con-centration and firm size independently of any evidence of actual anticompetitive effects. Today this effort proceeds apace, despite the copious economic learning to the contrary.</p><p>In 1973, Michigan Senator Philip Hart introduced Senate Bill 1167, the Industrial Reorganization Act (IRA), n58 in order to address perceived problems arising from industrial concentration. Among other things -- and most remarkably, given Hart's assertion that the bill was offered as \"an alterna-tive to government regulation and control\" n59 -- the bill would have required the creation of an \"In-dustrial Reorganization Commission\" to \"study the structure, performance, and control\" of seven \"priority\" industries, n60 and, for each, to \"develop a plan of reorganization... whether or not any cor-poration [was determined to possess monopoly power].\" n61</p><p>The bill was grounded in the belief that industry concentration led inexorably to monopoly power; that monopoly power, however obtained, posed an inexorable threat to freedom and prosperity; and that the antitrust laws were insufficient to address the purported problems. Thus the preamble to the Industrial Reorganization Act asserts that:</p><p>[C]ompetition... preserves a democratic society, and provides an opportunity for a more equitable distribution of wealth while avoiding the undue concentration of economic, social, and political power; [and] the decline of competition in industries with oligopoly or monopoly power has contributed to unemployment, inflation, inefficiency, an un-derutilization of economic capacity, and the decline of exports.... n62</p><p>That sentiment -- rooted in the reflexive application of the (largely-discredited n63) structure-conduct-performance (SCP) paradigm n64 -- has resurfaced today as the asserted justification for similar (although less onerous) antitrust reform legislation n65 and the general approach to antitrust analysis often referred to as \"hipster antitrust.\" n66 Sen. Klobuchar's Consolidation Prevention and Competi-tion Promotion Act of 2017, for example, asserts that:</p><p>[C]oncentration that leads to market power and anticompetitive conduct makes it more difficult for people in the United States to start their own businesses, depresses wages, and increases economic inequality;</p><p>Undue market concentration also contributes to the consolidation of political power, undermining the health of democracy in the United States; [and]</p><p>The anticompetitive effects of market power created by concentration include higher prices, lower quality, significantly less choice, reduced innovation, foreclosure of com-petitors, increased entry barriers, and monopsony power. n67</p><p>Despite repeated attempts the IRA was never enacted into law. But the conversation around the proposal is instructive, as efforts to invigorate antitrust enforcement today have adopted many of the same underpinnings as those of the IRA.</p><p>A. What's at stake: The politicization of antitrust</p><p>Much of the pressure behind the IRA was the allegation that economic power leads to political power. We see this same charge today, and, in fact, it is perhaps the most consistently leveled: that economic concentration and the presence of large firms lead inexorably to the subversion of de-mocracy. But this purported causal relationship has no basis in reality. As my father, Henry G. Manne, noted in testimony on the IRA before this very subcommittee in 1974:</p><p>There is, however, a \"political\" argument that should also be considered. It is that some corporations are so large that they are able to \"control\" the Government, presumably as it were, to \"buy\" the protection, the subsidy, the transportation system, the war, or what-ever they want from the Government.</p><p>The argument that companies like Standard Oil, du Pont, and General Motors run our Federal, State and local governments like dictators is no longer simply a Marxist myth about the American system. It has become common fare for television commentators, journalists, self-styled consumer spokesmen, and certain academics, all of whom speak with one voice and a forked tongue. Unfortunately, the energy utilized in making these assertions is about the only force behind them, and again it does not require complicated empirical studies to show the error, or perhaps the mendacity, for example, behind these assertions.</p><p>Has the automobile industry, for example, been more successful in Washington than the environmentalists? Have the petroleum companies spent as much money lobbying for protective legislation as has the National Education Association? Has the steel industry received as much bounty from our seemingly universal Federal welfare system as have the elderly, the uneducated, or those stricken with a strange desire to engage in farming? One could go on like this almost endlessly. But to ask these rhetorical questions is suffi-cient to make the point.</p><p>There is simply no correlation between the concentration ratio in an industry, or the size of its firms, and the effectiveness of the industry in the halls of Government. This scare argument about the political power of large corporations is a sham. We all know that the institutions that influence policies in Washington are those that can deliver the votes or utilize their finances to secure votes. And these are the very practices that large corporations are relatively weakest in performing, especially as compared to un-ions, farmers, consumer organizations, environmentalists, and other large voting blocks. There is even less substance to this political argument about corporate concen-tration than there is to the economic ones. n68</p><p>Many things other than dollars influence political decision-making, and it can hardly be said that any large company succeeds in all its efforts to influence politics -- just as it must be acknowledged that relatively small companies, labor unions, activist organizations, and even well-connected indi-viduals often succeed in theirs. n69</p><p>Indeed, not only is the risk of political influence arising from concentrated industry overstated, the risk and cost of politicized enforcement arising from the efforts to expand the scope of, and relax the constraints on, antitrust enforcement is significantly understated.</p><p>When antitrust policy is unmoored from economic analysis, it exhibits fundamental and highly problematic contradictions, as Herbert Hovenkamp highlighted in a recent paper:</p><p>As a movement, antitrust often succeeds at capturing political attention and engaging at least some voters, but it fails at making effective or even coherent policy. The result is goals that are unmeasurable and fundamentally inconsistent, although with their contra-dictions rarely exposed. Among the most problematic contradictions is the one between small business protection and consumer welfare. In a nutshell, consumers benefit from low prices, high output and high quality and variety of products and services. But when a firm or a technology is able to offer these things they invariably injure rivals, typically those who are smaller or heavily invested in older technologies. Although movement antitrust rhetoric is often opaque about specifics, its general effect is invariably to en-courage higher prices or reduced output or innovation, mainly for the protection of small business or those whose technology or other investments have become obsolete. n70</p><p>Even Robert Pitofsky, in his 1979 paper advocating in favor of incorporating political concerns into antitrust, noted that not all non-economic concerns were appropriate for consideration by an-titrust enforcers:</p><p>There are a number of non-economic concerns that can play no useful role in antitrust enforcement. These include (1) protection for small businessmen against the rigors of competition, (2) special rights for franchisees and other distributors to continuing access to a supplier's products or services regardless of the efficiency of their distribution oper-ation and the will of the supplier (a kind of civil rights statute for distributors), and (3) income redistribution to achieve social goals. n71</p><p>Remarkably, at least two of these (protection for small businesses and income redistribution) are now offered as core, constituent parts of the \"Neo-Brandeisian,\" populist antitrust resurgence. n72</p><p>The Neo-Brandeisian movement shares much in common with those who pushed for the Indus-trial Reorganization Act (and with Brandeis himself). And it suffers from many of the same fail-ings. Most fundamentally: The failure to grapple with the reality that constraining firm size in an effort to promote the political and economic power of consumers or favored businesses may actu-ally have the opposite of its intended effect.</p><p>One of the key concerns with a more overtly politicized competition policy is precisely that: its po-liticization. By imbuing antitrust with an ill-defined set of vague political objectives, antitrust be-comes a sort of \"meta-legislation.\" n73 As a result, the return on influencing a handful of government appointments with authority over antitrust becomes huge increasing the ability and the incentive to do so. As Baumol and Ordover observe, antitrust law is inherently prone to rent-seeking, espe-cially protectionism. n74 This leads to numerous harms, including the misallocation of resources, less efficient firms, and a diversion of firms' energies towards less productive ends (rent-seeking). n75</p><p>Adding a political dimension to antitrust law exacerbates these inherent flaws. A political antitrust regime is inherently prone to be captured by rivals who seek to ride populist waves of protection-ism.</p><p>And finally, if the underlying basis for antitrust enforcement is extended beyond economic welfare effects, how long can we expect to resist calls to restrain enforcement precisely to further those goals? All of a sudden the effort and ability to get exemptions will be massively increased as the per-suasiveness of the claimed justifications for those exemptions, which already encompass non-eco-nomic goals, n76 will be greatly enhanced. We might even find that we end up with even more concentration because the exceptions could subsume the rules.</p><p>All of which of course highlights the fundamental, underlying problem: If antitrust becomes more po-litical, the outcome will be less democratic, more politically determined results -- precisely the opposite of what proponents claim to want.</p><p>B. The Lack of Convincing Empirical Support for Claims that Concentration Is Harmful</p><p>Despite numerous assertions to the contrary, there is, in fact, no rigorous economic support for claims that high concentration levels are a strong indicator of harm to competition or that they should trigger a presumption of such harm in antitrust analysis. n77</p><p>As it stands, there is no empirical foundation on which to conclude that monopoly power is rising. To the extent that markups are increasing, other studies show that output has increased and that quality-adjusted prices have remained stable. Claims that concen-tration has increased at least find somewhat consistent empirical support, although the extent of those changes are up for debate. There is no reliable empirical basis, however, to support the inference that the United States economy has experienced a systematic increase in market power. n78</p><p>By the same token, there is little evidence that the application of law or regulation to more vigor-ously prohibit, shrink, or break up large companies will correct these asserted problems. n79 This is not surprising. As Henry Manne noted in his testimony on the IRA:</p><p>[T]he studies done to date strongly indicate that there is little or no significant correlation between industrial concentration and corporate profits. To be sure, if one selects a par-ticular year with peculiar characteristics, the figures can be made to appear otherwise, but in general, over a significant period of time, this lack of correlation seems well sub-stantiated....</p><p>The studies referred to [] indicate that there is no causal relationship between concentra-tion on the one hand and monopoly profit on the other. We are, it appears, as apt to find companies earning a higher than market rate of return in nonconcentrated indus-tries as in concentrated ones.</p><p>Indeed, one thing on which there is unequivocal agreement among economists... is that monopoly rates of return are realized regularly in some of the least-concentrated indus-tries imaginable: those for personal services.... In the industrial sector on the other hand, where remedies for unproved problems abound, monopoly rates of return, when they do occur, seem unlikely to persist for a significant period of time. n80</p><p>The evidence proffered today is no more convincing. Further, there is also no reason to think that the EU's more aggressive stance toward dominant firms leads to better economic outcomes.</p><p>Instead, such assertions are based on a simple inference of competitive effects from market struc-tures, and the unsupported assumption that an increase in concentration can mean only a reduc-tion in competition. The problem is that no such inference can be made: \"[I]t is presumptuous to conclude... that markets populated by fewer firms perform less well or offer competition that is less intense.\" n81 As Yale Brozen so aptly put it back in 1978:</p><p>Industries have become concentrated where that was the road to lower costs. It is these lower costs that have created temporary, above-average profitability in concentrated in-dustries when it has occurred. Where concentration was not the road to lower costs, industries have remained unconcentrated. The market has worked surprisingly well, where it has been permitted, to conserve our resources and maximize our output. The antitrust agencies' concentration on concentration in recent years is misdirected and should cease. n82</p><p>For example, a quick empirical analysis of the US wireless sector shows that concentration is not a reliable predictor of either the health of competition or of consumer welfare. As shown in the graph below, as concentration in the industry increased, wireless communications prices to con-sumers decreased -- precisely the opposite of what a concentration-based approach would predict.</p><p>The same trend is seen in the price of smartphone mobile data, which has fallen dramatically from $49.00 per gigabit in 2010 to just over $6.00 per gigabit in 2017, despite increasing concentration in the industry. n83</p><p>Properly considered, a superficial increase in concentration is just as consistent with an increase in competition as with a decrease; the contrary claim -- that there is a clear causal link between in-creased concentration and reduced competition -- simply disregards the weight of economic evidence. n84 Put simply: market share and industry concentration are poor predictors of competitive effects. n85</p><p>The fact is that economists know very little about the relationships among market structure, firm size, competition, profits, prices, entrepreneurship, and innovation. n86 Market shares and structural presumptions are not capable of predicting competitive effects and, thus, of specifying optimal pol-icy choices.</p><p>In particular, in markets in which competition occurs significantly through innovation, the effect of increased concentration on competitiveness is ambivalent, at best. n87 And where effective compe-tition requires significant up-front investment and where economies of scale predominate (because of these high fixed costs), n88 the assumption that concentration leads to reduced competition is es-pecially misguided.</p><p>Excessive reliance on obsolete, market-share-based analysis to evaluate antitrust practices is tanta-mount to a rejection of modern antitrust principles and the economic learning that undergirds them. Moreover, such an analysis is likely to lead to decisions that reduce rather than promote con-sumer welfare and the public interest.</p><p>1. Problems with the alleged empirical evidence proffered</p><p>It is also important to address recent empirical research which claims to show that increased con-centration does lead to higher prices or other competitive harm. On such example is the recent merger retrospective study by Professor John Kwoka. n89</p><p>Unfortunately, Professor Kwoka's study -- and the econometric literature of which it is a part -- cannot bear the weight placed upon it.</p><p>To begin with, it must be noted that economists have been studying the relationship between con-centration and various potential indicia of anticompetitive effects -- price, markup, profits, rate of return, etc. -- for decades. There are, in fact, hundreds of empirical studies addressing this topic. Contrary to the claims of some, however, even taken as a whole this literature is singularly unhelp-ful in resolving our fundamental ignorance about the functional relationship between structure and performance: \"Inter-industry research has taught us much about how markets look... even if it has not shown us exactly how markets work.\" n90</p><p>Individually, these empirical studies point in multiple directions simultaneously, and variously as-sign a wide range of causes to the same observed correlations between concentration and price or firm profits.</p><p>On methodological grounds alone, it is clear that essentially no confidence can be placed in any of the... studies done in this area.... [L]awyers, judges, and economists should accord the studies no more importance than they deserve. On a scale of one to ten, the studies merit only 'two-and-a-half cheers.'\" n91</p><p>Although that assessment was made in 1986, it remains the dominant view among industrial or-ganization economists n92 -- and Professor Kwoka's study is no more reliable as a guide to policy in any particular case than are previous studies. Kwoka's study is, in fact, a meta-analysis of some 60 merger retrospectives, and not itself an empirical assessment of the relationship between concen-tration and price in any particular case or industry. While this may save it from some of the more damning critiques of the typical concentration-price study, it creates additional problems for its rel-evance to any particular case. n93</p><p>One problem with a meta-analysis (or a rather casual study derived from it, as is Kwoka's Antitrust Law Journal article) is that it does not readily allow for consideration of industry-or firm-specific characteristics that might undercut the applicability in certain cases of broad claims based on the larger study (unless, of course, that were part of the meta-analysis, which is not the case here). Kwoka's study does not distinguish between (or even identify at all) the industries at issue in each case. Thus, there is no way to tell from the article, for example, whether the cases in which the un-derlying study found price increases following a merger involved an industry with economies of scale, high rates of advertising, high fixed costs, significant transportation costs, etc.</p><p>As it happens, we do know that the prior meta-study from which Kwoka's sample was derived (with the exclusion of nine transactions from that study) was heavily concentrated in a few industries:</p><p>The concentration of Kwoka's sample in a small number of industries renders it remark-ably unrepresentative of recent merger activity. The three industry groups discussed above (transportation, energy, and journal publishing) represent 32 of his 49 transac-tions, i.e., two-thirds of his sample. n94</p><p>This is a problem because, [a]n alternative explanation for price increases or decreases instead may be that the mer-ger led to changes in the quality of the merged .rms' products. Thus, rather than market power, price increases may re.ect quality improvements; and rather than cost reductions, price decreases may reflect quality degradation. n95</p><p>Obviously, this is particularly true in rapidly innovating, high-fixed-cost industries in which the very purpose of a merger is to facilitate the production of higher quality products. Indeed, several studies that have looked beyond the simplistic concentration-price relationship have found that apparent price increases following mergers in several industries were offset by efficiency gains that ultimately led to lower prices. n96</p><p>Deposits, 93 AM. ECON. REV. 1152 (2003) (finding \"strong evidence that, although [banking industry] consolidation does generate adverse price changes, these are temporary. In the long run, efficiency gains dominate over the market power effect, leading to more favorable prices for consumers\").</p><p>For example, a recent econometric study of consolidation in the mobile industry across OECD countries suggests that that may indeed be what tends to happen following mobile operator mer-gers. n97 The study's authors -- including the current chief economist of the European Commission's competition authority, Tommaso Valletti -- find that:</p><p>[A]n increase in market concentration in the mobile industry can potentially generate an important trade-off. While a merger will increase prices, investment per operator will also go up. Based on our estimates, a hypothetical 4-to-3 symmetric merger would in-crease the bill of end users by 16.3% on average. At the same time investment per oper-ator significantly increases by 19.3%, while total industry investment does not change significantly. n98</p><p>As the authors point out, this finding suggests several possible interpretations that add an im-portant gloss to the purported implications of previous studies:</p><p>[O]ur finding that concentration has no effect on industry investment suggests that effi-ciencies from coordinating investment among fewer firms are present. An obvious pos-sibility is that there are fixed cost savings, because fewer firms avoid duplicating the same fixed costs. Such savings can be welfare improving, but do not benefit consumers. A second possibility is that there are economies of scope or spill-overs that generate mar-ginal cost savings or quality improvements to the benefit of consumers. n99</p><p>No study can actually convey fully the competitive implications of a particular merger. The study cited above, for example, deals with a particular group of telecom companies; operating under more than 30 widely varying regulatory regimes; merging over a span of 12 years; and facing dispar-ate market conditions, demand, and usage patterns -- among other things. These unique character-istics wouldn't matter if concentration were indeed the sole, or even the most significant, determinant of an industry's competitiveness. But it is not. As the authors of the study conclude:</p><p>[T]he main pay-off from an understanding of the expected efficiencies arising from a horizontal merger is likely to be the insights this gives about the nature of competitive rivalry in an industry, which in turn will assist in gathering evidence on market dynamics and likely supply-side responses. Such evidence should not be an after-thought. It de-serves a central role in a unilateral effects assessment that justifies a departure from the constraints imposed by simple theoretical static models. n100</p><p>Even to the extent that some studies have plausibly shown that an increase in concentration in a particular case led to higher prices, assuming the same result from an increase in concentration in other industries or other contexts is simply not justified by the state of the literature: \"The most plausible competitive or efficiency theory of any particular industry's structure and business prac-tices is as likely to be idiosyncratic to that industry as the most plausible strategic theory with mar-ket power.\" n101 Similarly, even where post-Chicago economists have identified theoretical conditions under which certain business conduct (including some mergers) \"could be understood as competitive under some conditions but as reflecting the exercise or creation of market power under others,\" n102 these are merely \"possibility theorems,\" the application of which to any particular circumstance requires far more empirical evidence than casually constructed concentration ratios.</p><p>As it happens, at least one recent theory paper formalizes the sensible intuition that, in any given market, there is likely some optimal number of firms that maximizes social welfare--and that opti-mum is never \"the maximum\" and sometimes it is equal to one. n103 As that paper discusses, the op-timal number of firms varies with the strength of scale economies, such that consumers may benefit from an increase in concentration, even up to monopoly (i.e., where there is a \"natural mo-nopoly\"), if economies of scale are strong enough. Thus, as the paper notes, \"[t]his conclusion clearly suggests that the HHI should be augmented by some measure of economies of scale in the industry that would allow appropriate balancing between the legitimate fears of market power and the desire for production efficiency.\" n104</p><p>One can appreciate the desire to reduce incomprehensibly complex systems like the market to the predictable effects of a very few, readily quantified variables -- or a single variable, as proponents of concentration as the contemporary economy's bete noir seem to prefer. But just because such over-simplification is easier to comprehend doesn't mean it is correct. As one recent, comprehensive canvas of the literature concludes: \"In summary, the literature documenting price effects of mer-gers has shown that mergers can lead to either price increases or decreases, in keeping with the cen-tral market power versus ef.ciency trade-off.\" n105 This is a far cry from the resolute conclusions some scholars and advocates would like to draw. Perhaps more apt is the conclusion of one critic of the concentration-price literature: \"All of these studies illustrate once again that the identifica-tion of concentration with monopoly power is indeed a fragile 'mental construct.'\" n106</p><p>2. The purported evidence that less concentration has led to better economic conditions in Europe is weak</p><p>A recent NBER working paper by Gutierrez and Philippon attempts to link differences in US and EU antitrust enforcement and product market regulation to differences in market concentration and corporate profits. n107 The paper's abstract begins with a bold assertion: \"Until the 1990s, US markets were more competitive than European markets. Today, European markets have lower con-centration, lower excess profits, and lower regulatory barriers to entry.\" n108</p><p>The authors are not clear what they mean by lower, however its seems they mean lower today rela-tive to the 1990s. At the risk of being pedantic, Gutierrez and Philippon's measures of market con-centration for which both US and EU data are reported cover the period from 1999 to 2012. Thus, \"the 1990s\" refers to 1999, and \"today\" refers to 2012, or six years ago.</p><p>Based on Gutierrez and Philippon's data, there actually appears to be no meaningful difference in overall market concentration between the US and EU in 2012, using either the 8-firm concentra-tion ratio or HHI: The numbers are 26% (CR8) and 640 (HHI) for the US, and 27% (CR8) and 600 (HHI) for the EU. n109 Based on this information, it cannot be concluded broadly that EU sec-tors have lower concentration than the US.</p><p>Gutierrez and Philippon focus on the change in market concentration to draw their conclusions. However, the levels of market concentration measures are strikingly low. In all but one of the in-dustries (telecommunications) in Figure 27 of their paper (Figure 3 below), the 8-firm concentra-tion ratios for the and the EU are below 40 percent. Similarly, the HHI measures reported in the paper are at levels that most observers would presume to be competitive. In addition, in 7 of the 12 sectors surveyed, the 8-firm concentration ratio is lower than in the EU.</p><p>The numbers in parentheses in the table above show the change in the measures of concentration since 1999. The changes suggest that markets have become more concentrated and EU markets have become less concentrated. But, how significant are the changes in concentration?</p><p>A simple regression of the relationship between CR8 and a time trend finds that in the EU, CR8 has decreased an average of 0.5 percentage point a year, while the CR8 increased by less than 0.4 percentage point a year from 1999 to 2012. Tucked in an appendix to Gutierrez and Philippon, Fig-ure 30 (Figure 4 below) shows that CR8 in the had decreased by about 2.5 percentage points from 2012 to 2014.</p><p>A closer examination of Gutierrez and Philippon's 8-firm concentration ratio for the EU shows that much of the decline in EU market concentration occurred over the 1999-2002 period. After that, the change in CR8 for the EU is not statistically significantly different from zero.</p><p>A regression of the relationship between HHI and a time trend finds that in the EU, HHI has de-creased an average of 12.5 points a year, while the HHI increased by less than 16.4 points a year from 1999 to 2012.</p><p>As with CR8, a closer examination of Gutierrez and Philippon's HHI for the EU shows that much of the decline in EU market concentration occurred over the 1999-2002 period. After that, the change in HHI for the EU is not statistically significantly different from zero.</p><p>It is necessary to be cautious when relying on Gutierrez and Philippon's data to conclude that the is \"drifting\" toward greater market concentration while the EU is \"drifting\" toward lower market concentration. Indeed, the limited data presented in the paper point toward a convergence in mar-ket concentration between the two regions.</p><p>Gutierrez and Philippon also claim that EU markets have lower \"excess profits.\" However, aside from a passing mention of someone else's work in a footnote, the only mention of \"excess profits\" is in the paper's headline-grabbing abstract. Indeed, the authors do not define or describe what they mean by excess profits.</p><p>Gutierrez and Philippon define \"profit\" to be gross operating surplus and mixed income as reported in the OECD's STAN Industrial Analysis dataset as \"GOPS.\" GOPS is not the same thing as gross margin or gross profit as used in business and finance (for example GOPS subtracts wages, but gross margin does not). The EU defines GOPS as:</p><p>Operating surplus is the surplus (or deficit) on production activities before account has been taken of the interest, rents or charges paid or received for the use of assets. Mixed income is the remuneration for the work carried out by the owner (or by members of his family) of an unincorporated enterprise. This is referred to as 'mixed income' since it cannot be distinguished from the entrepreneurial profit of the owner. n110</p><p>Figure 5 is from Gutierrez and Philippon plotting GOPS as a share of gross output. Over 23 years, from 1992 to 2015, the gross operating surplus rate for firms grew by 2.5 percentage points. In the EU, the rate increased by about one percentage point.</p><p>Figure 6 is an alternative presentation of the data from the STAN dataset. It plots the gross operat-ing surplus rate for each EU country (blue dots) and the US (red dots), along with a time trend. There are three takeaways from this plot:</p><p>1. There is not much of a difference between the and the EU average--they both hover around a gross operating surplus rate of about 19.5 percent;</p><p>2. There is a substantial variation in gross operating surplus rate across EU countries; and</p><p>3. The slopes of the trendlines are not statistically significantly different from zero and are not statistically significantly different from each other. Thus, there is no statistically significant growth in US profit rates, nor is there a statistically significant decline in EU profit rates, nor is there a statistically significant difference between the US and the EU.</p><p>The Economist also reports a forthcoming study by Matej Bajgar and colleagues at the OECD pur-porting to show that the average market share of the top four firms in each industry has risen ap-proximately twice as fast in the US and Canada as in Europe. n111 Figure 7 recreates a key figure reported by the study.</p><p>Figure 7 n112</p><p>A t-test indicates that there is no significant difference in the two series. On average, over the time period surveyed, the average CR4 for the North America was approximately 24.1 percent and the average for Europe was 23.4 percent. And in four of the fourteen years of the survey, CR4 in Eu-rope was higher than in North America.</p><p>In addition, a t-test of year-over-year changes in CR4 indicates no statistically significant difference between North America and Europe in the change in CR4 over the relatively short time period surveyed.</p><p>As with the work of Gutierrez and Philippon, it is necessary to exercise caution and avoid reading too much into Bajgar, et al.'s reporting of market concentration in North America and Europe. The time series is too short and the apparent differences are not statistically significant.</p><p>Another measure of the relative lack of economic success in Europe is the valuation and rate of venture financing of EU tech firms:</p><p>Figure 8 n113</p><p>As the brief analysis accompanying the above table notes, \"[the disparity is notable given that the EU's $17 trillion economy is comparable in size with the US's and bigger than China's.\" n114 Mean-while, \"the cumulative value of all European unicorns created since 2000 is around $120bn. By comparison, Facebook currently has a market capitalization of $275bn.\" n115</p><p>Similarly, the rate of venture fund investment in EU firms, while increasing, lags far behind the US:</p><p>According to figures from Dow Jones VentureSource, an investment database, funding for the continent's digital groups almost doubled from $4bn a year to $7.75bn between 2010 and 2014. In the first three months of 2015, companies in the sector raised just over $2.5bn, the highest for any quarter since the start of the decade.</p><p>While growing, European tech investment is well behind that in the US. Over the past five years, US venture capital funds have raised $96bn, according to the National Ven-ture Capital Association, and have drawn on existing cash to invest a total of $160bn -- $70bn of it in Silicon Valley alone. n116</p><p>Of course, there are certainly multiple and complex reasons for the disparity. Among (many) other things, surely, it must be relevant that: labor regulations in Europe make it extremely difficult to fire (and thus to hire) workers; European member states' tax regimes tend toward the Byzantine; corporate rules, particularly bankruptcy rules, are more straightforward in the US, allowing for a more fluid transfer of capital; and, on the other hand, US tech firms have generally been around longer, and are at more mature investment stages.</p><p>These factors make the comparison unreliable, but the general trends are still telling. In short, the state of the EU's tech industry does not, on its face, lead to an inference that EU competition law caused or even contributed to the relative lack of success of EU tech firms and the relative size and rate of tech firm investment in Europe.</p><p>Yet it is notable that EU regulatory policy is, much more explicitly than the US's, often aimed at propping up European companies:</p><p>Some European regulators believe they should offer the region's tech groups a leg up and protect them from being swallowed up by US rivals. Among them is Florence Raynal, an executive at France's privacy watchdog CNIL, who argues that Europe's tough data protection rules should be seen as a positive -- offering a competitive advantage to local groups....</p><p>\"If anybody believes Europeans will create a better business environment than Ameri-cans, they're completely dreaming,\" says [Mark Tluszcz, chief executive of Mangrove, the Luxembourg-based venture capital firm that was an early investor in Skype]. \"We don't have this in our culture.\" n117</p><p>Moreover, while still new, the EU's privacy rules (the GDPR) are certainly not turning out to be an advantage to smaller companies, whether native to the EU or not. n118</p><p>EU competition policy is similarly charged with such policy aims. As the Current European Com-mission President noted in his charge to Margrethe Vestager, the EU Competition Commissioner: \"Competition policy is one of the areas where the Commission has exclusive competence and ac-tion in this field will be key to the success of our jobs and growth agenda. It should contribute to steering innovation....\" n119 Of course, we don't know what the European economy or tech sector would look like in the absence of the implementation of these objectives. But the available evi-dence offers little to suggest the approach has been a successful one, and still less to suggest it has any likelihood of being successful in the US.</p><p>IV. Summary of American Antitrust Law</p><p>Antitrust law in the United States has been marked by an evolutionary course that progressively adapts to new business and technological developments. Originating with the Sherman Act in 1890 (and with some common law antecedents), courts and Congress have continually shaped various antitrust doctrines to comport with the norms and expectations unique to the US. In par-ticular, from its earliest days courts worked to introduce economic analysis into antitrust law in recognition that the tersely worded Sherman Act \"directly implicated economic concepts\" n120 and yet, owing to its terseness, left the details of appropriate analysis for a common-law-like process. Notably, the courts in the early era of US antitrust struggled to develop coherent principles for an-titrust. n121</p><p>Following its formative phases, the early twentieth century was marked as a period in which the an-titrust laws were interpreted as existing to prevent \"bigness.\" n122 By failing to adapt a more rigorous framework that was capable of evaluating harmful conduct (as opposed to relying on a harmful ap-pearance, i.e. size), the courts allowed antitrust to serve a variety of often-conflicting social and po-litical goals, often \"regardless of their economic results.\" n123 But an approach that framed \"big\" corporations as bad necessarily worked to benefit \"small\" firms -- even when such benefits were not earned by providing superior goods and services to consumers, or even where maintenance of inefficient firms would lead to higher prices. n124</p><p>The end result of this rudderless analysis meant that sometimes the antitrust laws were used to condemn anticompetitive practices, but sometimes they were used to condemn procompetitive practices. By pegging the distinction based on an arbitrary size of firm, there was no meaningful way to distinguish procompetitive conduct from anticompetitive conduct.</p><p>The unprincipled approach to US antitrust adjudication that dominated through the 1960s even-tually gave rise to serious criticism of the entire body of law. n125 A rigorous debate grew as scholars and lawyers sought to develop a proper foundation for antitrust laws that would lead to an analyti-cally useful framework. n126 These scholars observed that, under conventional antitrust wisdom of</p><p>Director's seminal role in the development of the economics of competition and monopoly presented in this book.\"); Bruce H. Kobayashi and Timothy J. Muris, Chicago, Post-Chicago, and Beyond: Time To Let Go of the 20th Century, 78 ANTITRUST L.J. 147, 150 (2012) (\"The historical accounts of the Chicago School of Antitrust uniformly agree on the central influence of Aaron Director and the Antitrust Law course he taught with Edward Levi at the University of Chicago.\"); William H. Page, The Chicago School and the Evolution of Antitrust: Characterization, Antitrust Injury, and Evidentiary Sufficiency, 75 VA. L. REV. 1221, 1229-30 (1989); Aaron Director and Edward H. Levi, Law and the Future: Trade Regulation, 51 NW. U. L. REV. 281, 282-84 (1956). the middle-Twentieth Century, as a firm developed into a monopoly, it was automatically assumed that the firm obtained and maintained its power through impermissible means. n127</p><p>The reformers revealed that antitrust was marred by a history of internal contradictions where, with little appreciable rationale, courts would vacillate between preserving competition itself on the one hand, and protecting firms from more efficient rivals on the other. n128 Moreover, the re-formers recognized that economic efficiency as a measure of antitrust efficacy was not a good in it-self, but as a signifier of the revealed preferences of society. Therefore, an economic efficiency standard was also pro-social (as opposed to a politically-managed antitrust standard which was merely allegedly pro-social). n129</p><p>While significant debate over appropriate rules and standards remained among antitrust reform-ers, some unifying themes emerged. First, antitrust should be focused on fostering consumer wel-fare. n130 Legal scholars were forced to consider the basic principles that guided antitrust and answer why, in the first instance, competition is valuable. The consensus that emerged was that competi-tion leads to lower prices, expanded output, better quality, and more innovation -- that is to say it produces outcomes that benefit consumers. n131 The precise number of competitors was only indi-rectly relevant in discovering whether the desirable result obtained from the competitive process.</p><p>The second major contribution of the antitrust reformers was introducing the concept that eco-nomic theory, empirical evidence, and the error-cost framework should guide antitrust enforce-ment decisions. n132 By aligning legal theories of harm with economic theories, rigor and predictability were introduced into the antitrust enforcement process. n133 Importantly, it is both the-ory and evidence that governs the US enforcement process. If economic theory indicates that anti-competitive outcomes are possible, but empirical evidence shows that they are rarely observed in practice, the analysis is correspondingly adjusted. n134</p><p>These insights provided a coherent framework for analyzing allegedly anticompetitive conduct -- and specifically for distinguishing between procompetitive and anticompetitive conduct. Today, there is widespread, bipartisan support for the modern consumer welfare standard. That standard has been repeatedly embraced by majorities in Supreme Court decisions that recognize and em-brace the economic foundation that the standard provides. In Reiter v. Sonotone, for example, the Court recognized that the Sherman Act is a \"consumer welfare prescription.\" Later, in U.S. v. Baker Hughes, then Judge Clarence Thomas--joined by then-Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg--wrote that \"[e]vidence of market concentration simply provides a convenient starting point for a broader inquiry into future competitiveness.\" And, more recently, in her confirmation hearings, Justice Ka-gan stated \"it's clear that antitrust law needs to take account of economic theory and economic un-derstandings.\" n135</p><p>The end result of the evolutionary growth of US antitrust law is the development of an economi-cally rigorous antitrust analysis that puts the welfare of consumers at the forefront. Modern US ju-risprudence has long recognized that structural analyses of markets are necessarily insufficient for finding competitive harms, because it is the benefits of competition that matter most, and not merely the form of some idealized market structure.</p><p>V. High-level differences between EU / US</p><p>EU and US antitrust policies differ in a number of important respects, and these differences, even where they seem minor, entail significantly different antitrust environments. Some of those differ-ences originate from the divergent historical, legal, political, and institutional characteristics of the two jurisdictions. But some of the differences are decidedly more philosophical and/or economic. Unlike the more ingrained, institutional differences, these are malleable characteristics that reflect the two jurisdictions' decidedly different approaches to business and its relationship to the state. Most fundamentally, perhaps -- and although it is doubtful that the Commission would itself frame it thusly -- the overall structure of and approach to antitrust law in the EU vests the Com-mission with much greater discretion to deviate from established economic principles and proce-dural best practices in its antitrust enforcement and decision-making. Antitrust enforcement at the EU level is driven almost entirely by the European Commission -- a political body -- and largely unreviewed and unchecked by EU courts. As a result, EU antitrust is, put simply, decidedly less economically grounded, and inevitably more politicized, than in the US.</p><p>C. A difference of goals</p><p>A first key difference between European and American antitrust law lies in the goals each jurisdic-tion seeks to pursue with its antitrust laws. While the US focuses on protecting competition for the benefit of consumers, n136 the EU has built and maintains its competition laws to effect a wider range of political/economic/social objectives. Indeed, the Commission has routinely stated that European competition law pursues multiple goals. n137</p><p>The non-economic ambitions of European competition law are largely down to institutional and historic differences. The EU's main competition provisions are enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"TFEU\"), which has a quasi-constitutional value in the Euro-pean legal order. One of the key concerns of the framers of the EU treaties was that the EU's poli-cies should not contradict themselves, with one potentially undermining the other. With these various objectives in mind, the European Commission has sometimes incorporated non-economic considerations into its competition decisions. This is, for example, the case for employment and environmental issues. n138</p><p>More fundamentally, these attempts to ensure that the EU's various activities remain coherent, along with the supra-national nature of the Union, have highly politized the position of the EU Commissioner for competition. This is best evidenced by the Mission Letter that the current presi-dent of the European Commission sent to Margrethe Vestager, the current Commissioner for competition. n139 The letter highlights that European competition enforcement is constantly ac-countable to political forces that notably seek to preserve the overall legitimacy of the European Union:</p><p>The Commission's relationship with the European Parliament is the source of our dem-ocratic legitimacy. This must, therefore, be a political and not a technocratic partner-ship. n140</p><p>Competition policy is one of the areas where the Commission has exclusive competence and action in this field will be key to the success of our jobs and growth agenda. It should contribute to steering innovation and making markets deliver clear benefits to consum-ers, businesses and society as a whole. Every effort should be made to maximise the pos-itive contribution of our competition policy in support of our overall priorities and to explain and demonstrate its benefits to citizens and stakeholders at all levels. n141</p><p>I want the new Commission to be a strong and political team. And I want you, with your political skills and experience, to fully play your part in this team. n142</p><p>Thus, the guiding ethos for EU competition enforcement is markedly distinct from that of US en-forcement. The US structure, although shaped by the political process through the election of Congress and the President, is nonetheless largely insulated from direct political concerns. The roles of the Department of Justice and the FTC are to fairly administer the laws written by Con-gress, as interpreted over time and a great number of cases by the courts. Undoubtedly there is pol-icy decision-making occurring by US enforcement officials, but it is constrained in the first instance by the structure of the US system, including, most notably, the judiciary's strong check on flights of political fancy. The EU enforcement agencies are significantly less constrained, not least because of its explicitly political function, as President Juncker noted in his letter.</p><p>With respect even to competition itself, the EU pursues objectives that are far more ambiguous than that pursued under US antitrust law. While it is relatively uncontroversial that antitrust law in the US currently pursues a single goal -- the maximization of consumer welfare n143 -- the question is less settled in the EU. n144 Throughout recent decisions and policy statements, the European Un-ion has been reluctant to commit to a well-defined competition objective for its antitrust law.</p><p>Among other things, Protocol No. 27, which is annexed to the EU treaties, states that \"the inter-nal market as set out in Article 3 of the Treaty on the European Union includes a system ensuring that competition is not distorted.\" n145 This goal is sometimes also referred to as \"the protection of the competitive process.\" n146</p><p>Unlike the consumer welfare standard -- which, for all the internecine and arcane debates it has engendered, refers to a series of generally cognizable principles n147 -- the notion of \"undistorted\" competition has no clear normative implications.</p><p>Competition authorities and courts in the EU have seized upon the open-ended nature of the EU treaties to include a variety of different, and often contradictory, objectives within the purview of European competition law. These include, as mentioned above, European integrationist objectives and social policies, but also various conceptions of competition including the promotion of con-sumer welfare, the preservation of competitive market structures, the protection of consumer choice, fairness -- the list goes on. n148</p><p>The open-ended nature of European competition law has two important consequences. First, the European Commission faces much lighter requirements to show the existence of anticompetitive harm than if its cases were assessed under a true consumer welfare standard similar to that found in US law; and second, the Commission benefits from a highly deferential review of its decisions by the European Court of justice. n149</p><p>D. Different approaches to the analysis of anticompetitive effects</p><p>A second important difference concerns the quantification of anticompetitive harm, where Euro-pean competition law imposes a much less strenuous burden on authorities than does the US. This makes European competition law much more prone to false positives that condemn effi-ciency-generating or innovative firm behavior. The main cause of these false positives is the failure of the EU's \"competitive process\" standard to separate competitive from anticompetitive exclusion-ary conduct in accordance with established economic principles and learning.</p><p>The EU's competitive process standard is similar to the structuralist analysis that was popular in the US through the middle of the twentieth century. As discussed above, this view of antitrust led US enforcers to frequently condemn firms for merely growing larger than some arbitrary threshold -- even when those firms engaged in conduct that, on net, benefited consumers. While EU enforc-ers often claims to be pursuing a consumer welfare standard, and to adhere to rigorous economic analysis in its antitrust cases, n150 their actual practice tends to engage in little more than a window-dressed version of the outmoded structuralist analysis that US scholars, courts, and enforcers roundly rejected in the latter half of the twentieth century.</p><p>To take one important example, a fairly uncontroversial requirement for antitrust intervention is that a condemned practice should actually, or be substantially likely to, foster anticompetitive harm. Even in Europe, whatever other goals competition law is to further, it is nominally aimed at protecting competition rather than competitors. n151 Accordingly, the mere exit of competitors from the market is meant to be insufficient to draw competition liability under European competition law in the absence of certain accompanying factors. n152</p><p>And yet, by pursuing a competitive process goal, European competition authorities regularly con-flate desirable and undesirable forms of exclusion precisely on the basis of their effect on competi-tors. For instance, the Commission routinely sanctions exclusion that stems from an incumbent's superior efficiency rather than welfare-reducing strategic behavior. n153 European law thus routinely protects inefficient competitors that would otherwise rightly be excluded from a market. As Pablo Ibanez Colomo puts is:</p><p>It is arguably more convincing to question whether the principle whereby dominant firms are under a general duty not to discriminate is in line with the logic and purpose of competition rules. The corollary to the idea that it is prima facie abusive to place rivals at a disadvantage is that competition must take place, as a rule, on a level playing field. It cannot be disputed that remedial action under EU competition law will in some in-stances lead to such an outcome. n154</p><p>This tendency to sanction super efficiency is nowhere clearer than the Commission's recent Google Shopping case. n155 The unfortunate consequence of the conception of competition policy embodied in the EU Google Shopping decision is that, by failing to sort harmful from beneficial exclusion, the outcome threatens to harm innovation, consumer welfare, and the economy writ large. Where US antitrust law has developed a position of relative restraint in the face of uncertainty, the EU tends to read uncertainty as the outward expression of what must be a lurking threat; it is a position that, at root, hearkens back to the \"inhospitality\" tradition of earlier eras of US antitrust law. n156 The risk, of course, is that this approach will end up thwarting technological evolution and enshrining mediocrity out of a sort of over-active \"precautionary principle\" -- in the process giving up far more than it gains. And this risk of false positives, stemming from a naive analysis of exclusion, is partic-ularly acute in the digital economy, where practices such as leveraging, n157 lock-in, n158 and network effects n159 have highly ambiguous welfare effects, despite often leading to the exclusion of inefficient firms.</p><p>E. Judicial deference towards enforcement authorities</p><p>A third important difference concerns the deficient and limited judicial review of the European Commission's decisions by the General Court and the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This ac-quiescence has numerous causes, two of which are particularly noteworthy. The first is that the Eu-ropean Court of Justice has proved highly reluctant to require the lower court (or itself) to undertake complex economic assessments, instead preferring to defer to the Commission on these points (although the ECJ's recent Intel ruling may mark a turning point in this respect). n160 The sec-ond is that, as discussed above, the European Commission can call upon an open-ended series of objectives to support its decisions. As a result of this discretion, there are few bases on which the Court may challenge the Commission's decisions.</p><p>1. Deficient judicial review</p><p>The European Court of Justice has self-imposed limits on the courts' review of \"complex economic appraisals\" made by the Commission. n161 As stated in its Holcim ruling:</p><p>[W]here it reviews complex economic appraisals made by the Commission . . . the [EU] judicature confines itself to verifying whether the rules on procedure and on statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts have been accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of appraisal or a misuse of powers. n162</p><p>In practice this \"manifest error\" standard means that defendants must meet an exceedingly high burden of proof before a court will evaluate and overturn economic assessments made by the Com-mission. Notably, this deferential judicial review loomed large in the lower court's Microsoft ruling, which pointedly remarked at the outset that \"review of complex economic appraisals made by the Commission is necessarily limited....\" n163 Indeed, the ECJ itself has acknowledged the deferential consequence of this standard, albeit with characteristic understatement: \"In this respect, however, the basic provisions of the Regulation... confer on the Commission a certain discretion, especially with respect to assessments of an economic nature.\" n164</p><p>The consequence of this deference is that, particularly in abuse of dominance cases, the Commis-sion enjoys remarkable -- even implausible -- success in defending its decisions, and especially its economic approach, in court. Indeed, prior to the ECJ's 2017 Intel decision, \"the Commission's track record [in abuse of dominance cases] is unblemished, with only a few investigations having been abandoned and no decision having been overturned by the European Courts on the basis of either substantive or procedural grounds.\" n165 This perfect track record is unlikely (to say the least) to reflect perfect knowledge and judgment on the Commission's part (or the complete absence of these on the courts' part). As such, it has troubling implications for the welfare effects of the Com-mission's decisions:</p><p>Overall, the trivial rate of annulment judgments under Article 102 TFEU is disturbing. It casts doubt on the effectiveness of the GC's judicial review in eliminating type I errors. Of course, the Commission may well have been right in all cases appealed to the GC.</p><p>Yet, in our opinion, this \"success story\" hypothesis does not withstand scrutiny. It is indeed contradicted by the existence of several harsh annulment judgments in all other areas of competition law (and, in particular in areas where (i) negative decisions are less frequent; and (ii) the Court grants to the Commission a large margin of discretion/error tolerance). n166</p><p>A further troubling consequence of this deference in the antitrust context (especially combined with the inherently political nature of the Commission given its place within the European govern-ment, and the Commission's \"star chamber\"-like processes n167) is not simply that the Commission gets to choose which economic standards it applies; rather, because antitrust law is inherently given content by the economic assessment it entails, the Commission is given effective legislative discre-tion over the law itself. Indeed, this troubling consequence has not gone unremarked upon by the European legal community:</p><p>[I]t is arbitrary, dangerous and unfair to apply the same \"judicial deference\" to the Com-mission's discretion in the context of the current EU competition law enforcement re-gime, characterized by increasingly large fines having inevitable economic and financial impact on companies, shareholders and employees, and leading to de facto \"criminaliza-tion\" of competition law. EU competition rules are directly applicable provisions which leave no room for policy-based discretion in their interpretation and application, so that there is scope for only a very limited degree of deference by the Courts when reviewing their application by the Commission in a specific case. n168</p><p>And in that same case the ECJ itself addressed the problem and, although it ultimately upheld its review standard, pointedly admonished that \"the Courts cannot use the Commission's margin of discretion... as a basis for dispensing with the conduct of an in-depth review of the law and the facts.\" n169</p><p>Most importantly, and more recently, the ECJ has -- as if finally exasperated by the extent to which its excessively deferential review has permitted the Commission to engage in woefully insufficient economic analysis -- expressed in clear terms the need for more thoroughgoing judicial review of the Commission's decisions. Although it is far from certain how or whether the General Court and the Commission will respond to its holding, n170 the ECJ's recent Intel decision offers a clear statement of concern by the ECJ. n171 In a case centered on rebates offered by Intel to OEMs, the Court overruled the General Court's initial judgment in favor of the Commission. Crucially, the ECJ rejected the court's deference to the Commission's insufficient economic analysis, which simply ignored arguments put forward by Intel that could serve to undermine the rationale for a finding of abuse:</p><p>Article 102 TFEU [case-law that] prohibits a dominant undertaking from, among other things, adopting pricing practices that have an exclusionary effect on competitors con-sidered to be as efficient as it is itself... must be further clarified in the case where the undertaking concerned submits, during the administrative procedure, on the basis of supporting evidence, that its conduct was not capable of restricting competition and, in particular, of producing the alleged foreclosure effects.</p><p>In that case, the Commission is not only required to analyse, first, the extent of the undertaking's dominant position on the relevant market and, secondly, the share of the market covered by the challenged practice...; it is also required to assess the possible existence of a strategy aiming to exclude competitors that are at least as efficient as the dominant undertaking from the market.</p><p>The analysis of the capacity to foreclose is also relevant in assessing whether a system of rebates... may be objectively justified. In addition, the exclusionary effect arising from such a system, which is disadvantageous for competition, may be counterbalanced, or outweighed, by advantages in terms of efficiency which also benefit the consumer. That balancing of the favourable and unfavourable effects of the practice in question on com-petition can be carried out in the Commission's decision only after an analysis of the intrinsic capacity of that practice to foreclose competitors which are at least as efficient as the dominant undertaking.</p><p>If, in a decision finding a rebate scheme abusive, the Commission carries out such an analysis, the General Court must examine all of the applicant's arguments seeking to call into question the validity of the Commission's findings concerning the foreclosure capa-bility of the rebate concerned. n172</p><p>Consequently..., the judgment of the General Court must be set aside, since, in its anal-ysis of whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition, the General Court wrongly failed to take into consideration Intel's line of argument seeking to expose alleged errors committed by the Commission.... n173</p><p>As laudable as the decision is, it is not a full-throated rejection of the Commission's approach to abuse of dominance cases, and it is not clear that the judgment will actually have much effect on the General Court or the Commission. Notably, the ECJ based its decision on the General Court's procedural failings, rather than the substantive divergence of the Commission's approach from rigorous, economically informed antitrust analysis. Thus, while the Court did cast doubt upon the integrity of the Commission's conclusion, it continued to refrain from undertaking its own evaluation of complex economic evidence, and instead directed the General Court (and, indi-rectly, for future cases at least, the Commission) to do so. In the absence of that analysis at the Commission level, however, it is unclear how well the General Court will be able to undertake its own such analysis on appeal. The real power of the case, if it is to have any, is far more likely to be found in the Commission's own response.</p><p>Yet therein lies the problem in future cases, as it is the Commission, exercising the still-broad dis-cretion noted above, that will conduct the examination on its own terms -- presumably favorable to its own complaints. At stake, however, is the legitimacy of the Commission's antitrust decision-making. As Intel itself puts it (not incorrectly, despite its obvious bias in the case, of course):</p><p>Intel has reluctantly concluded that the Commission initiated the investigation with a predisposed view to alter the results of competition, and consequently tended to assess the evidence with a prosecutorial bent to confirm its point of view. In doing so, it ignored or minimized -- and indeed at times even refused to obtain -- important evidence that contradicted its view of the world. The result was a consistently one-sided and result-oriented selection and interpretation of the evidence. n174</p><p>Moreover, it must be noted that, to the extent that EU courts have sometimes undertaken a more thorough review of the Commission's economic decision-making, the opinions demonstrate a re-markable deviation from fundamental, standard economic concepts that would be found routinely -- and necessarily -- in US antitrust caselaw. As Damien Geradin and Nicolas Petit have shown:</p><p>The [General Court] is reluctant to accommodate mainstream economic concepts within the realm of the Article 102 TFEU [abuse of dominance] case-law. For instance, the con-cept of \"consumer welfare\", which has been elevated as the alpha and omega of compe-tition policy in Europe and in the US, is not even cited once in the Article 102 TFEU case-law of the [General Court]. The same holds true of the SSNIP test, or to a lesser extent of the HHI Index, which however constitute conventional instruments for the assessment of a dominant position.</p><p>Those two indicators tend to corroborate empirically the hypothesis that the [General Court] is reluctant to embrace an economic approach in the area of abuse of dominance (and that it intends to stick to old, legalistic solutions). In so doing, the [General Court] arguably maintains a misplaced approach of abuse of dominance law, which insulates Commission decisions from judicial scrutiny. n175</p><p>This history does not bode well for the quality of the courts' judicial review -- even subject to the Intel admonition.</p><p>Finally, under long-standing judicial precedent (again, perhaps, until Intel), in order to make a find-ing of exclusion by a dominant firm the Commission need not actually demonstrate concrete anti-competitive effects -- despite its adoption of a Guidance Paper and frequent lip service to the contrary. n176 \"Arguably, the [Commission's] adoption of a more effects-based approach may be more about semantics or presentation than substance.\" n177 And even the Commission's findings of domi-nance are always upheld by the courts, despite being based on economically deficient reasoning from which \"it is difficult to distinguish genuinely dominant companies that have substantial mar-ket power from successful companies that are subject to effective competition.\" n178 Whether these crucial analytical problems will be rectified following Intel is, at best, uncertain.</p><p>2. European competition law's dangerous discretion</p><p>EU competition law demonstrates well (by its absence) the advisability of a coherent analytical framework like that found in the US's consumer welfare standard. As noted above, the EU process is driven by a number of laterally equivalent, and sometimes mutually exclusive, goals. n179 Aside from the general problem of such a wide array of conflicting aims leading to a lack of clarity for firms conducting their business, a large problem exists in the discretion that this fluid arrangement of goals yields.</p><p>The Microsoft case illustrates this problem well. In Microsoft, the Commission could have chosen to base its decision on a number of potential objectives. It notably chose to base its findings on the fact that Microsoft's behavior reduced \"consumer choice.\" n180 The Commission, in fact, discounted arguments that economic efficiency may lead to consumer welfare gains because \"consumer choice\" among a variety of media players was more important:</p><p>Another argument relating to reduced transaction costs consists in saying that the econ-omies made by a tied sale of two products saves resources otherwise spent for maintain-ing a separate distribution system for the second product. These economies would then be passed on to customers who could save costs related to a second purchasing act, in-cluding selection and installation of the product. Irrespective of the accuracy of the as-sumption that distributive efficiency gains are necessarily passed on to consumers, such savings cannot possibly outweigh the distortion of competition in this case. This is be-cause distribution costs in software licensing are insignificant; a copy of a software pro-gramme can be duplicated and distributed at no substantial effort. In contrast, the importance of consumer choice and innovation regarding applications such as media players is high. n181</p><p>It may be true that tying the products in question was unnecessary, but merely dismissing this deci-sion because distribution costs are near-zero is hardly an analytically satisfactory answer. There are many more costs involved in creating and distributing complementary software than merely the costs associated with hosting and downloading. And by the same token, the Commission simply asserts that consumer choice among some arbitrary number of competing products is necessarily a benefit. This, too, is not necessarily true, and the decision's implication that any marginal increase in choice is more valuable than any gains from product design or innovation is similarly analyti-cally incoherent.</p><p>The Court of First Instance was only too happy to give the Commission a pass in its breezy analy-sis; it saw no objection to these findings. With little substantive reasoning to support its findings, the Court fully endorsed the Commission's assessment:</p><p>As the Commission correctly observes (see paragraph 1130 above), by such an argument Microsoft is in fact claiming that the integration of Windows Media Player in Windows and the marketing of Windows in that form alone lead to the de facto standardisation of the Windows Media Player platform, which has beneficial effects on the market. Alt-hough, generally, standardisation may effectively present certain advantages, it cannot be allowed to be imposed unilaterally by an undertaking in a dominant position by means of tying.</p><p>The Court further notes that it cannot be ruled out that third parties will not want the de facto standardisation advocated by Microsoft but will prefer it if different platforms continue to compete, on the ground that that will stimulate innovation between the various platforms. n182</p><p>Simply pointing to these conflicting effects of Microsoft's bundling decision without actually weighing them is a weak basis for upholding the Commission's decision that consumer choice out-weighs the benefits of standardization -- not least because actions undertaken by other firms to en-hance consumer choice at the expense of standardization are, on these terms, potentially just as problematic. The dividing line becomes solely which theory the Commission prefers to pursue.</p><p>What such a practice at the Commission, aided by friendly courts, does is vest the Commission with a great degree of discretionary power. Any given Commission case sets up a \"heads I win, tails you lose\" situation in which defendants are easily outflanked by a Commission that can change the rules of its analysis as it sees fit. Defendants, on the other hand, can play only the cards that they are dealt. Accordingly, Microsoft could not successfully challenge a conclusion that its behavior harmed consumers' choice by arguing that, for example, that on net it improved consumer welfare.</p><p>By being able to, in this instance, select \"consumer choice\" as the standard by which the case was judged, the Commission was able to evade the constraints that might have been imposed by a more robust welfare standard. Thus, the Commission can essentially pick and choose the objec-tives that best serve its interests in each case. This vastly enlarges the scope of potential antitrust liability (while also substantially decreasing the ability of firms to predict when their behavior may be viewed as problematic), leading to what, in US courts, would be regarded as untenable false pos-itives that chill innovative behavior and create nearly unwinnable battles for targeted firms.</p><p>VI. Concrete divergences</p><p>In addition to the high-level differences discussed above, European and US antitrust authorities also diverge on numerous specific issues. These dissimilarities often result from the different policy goals that animate these two bodies of law. Where US case law is guided by an overarching goal of maximizing consumer welfare (notably a practice's effect on output), European competition law tends to favor structural presumptions and places a much heavier emphasis on distributional con-siderations. In addition, where the US approach to many of these specific issues is deeply influ-enced by its overweening concern with the potentially chilling effects of intervention, this apprehension is very much foreign to European competition law. The result is often widely diver-gent approaches to complex economic matters in which the US hews far more closely than does the EU to the humility and restraint suggested by economic learning.</p><p>A. Exploitative abuses</p><p>With the potential exception of SEPs and FRAND pledges, US antitrust is by and large uncon-cerned with companies that charge what some might consider exorbitant prices. Justice Scalia, writ-ing for the majority in Trinko, observed that:</p><p>The mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system. The opportunity to charge monopoly prices--at least for a short period--is what attracts \"business acumen\" in the first place; it induces risk taking that produces innovation and economic growth. n183</p><p>This stands in stark contrast to European competition law cases, where firms have been found to infringe competition law because they charged \"excessive\" prices:</p><p>In this case charging a price which is excessive because it has no reasonable relation to the economic value of the product supplied would be such an abuse. n184</p><p>Although United Brands was decided in 1978, the European Commission reiterated that these al-legedly exploitative abuses were a possibility when it published its guidance paper on abuse of dom-inance cases in 2009. n185 Despite the absence of economic merit to support nearly all excessive pricing cases -- and, indeed, the Commission's apparent disinterest in bringing such cases in some time -- recently both the European Commission as well as some national authorities have shown a renewed interest in them, most notably in the pharmaceutical sector. n186</p><p>Moreover, European competition law also sanctions so-called \"margin squeeze\" abuses, where a dominant upstream supplier charges a price to distributors that is too high for them to effectively compete with the dominant firm downstream:</p><p>[I]t is for the referring court to examine, in essence, whether the pricing practice intro-duced by TeliaSonera is unfair in so far as it squeezes the margins of its competitors on the retail market for broadband connection services to end users. n187</p><p>The EU's case law has potentially severe welfare ramifications. Just as Justice Scalia observed in Trinko, forcing firms to charge prices that are below a market's natural equilibrium has a knock-on effect on firms' incentives to enter markets, notably with innovative products and more efficient means of production. But the problem is not just one of market entry and innovation, but also of the competence of competition authorities to effectively determine the \"right\" prices or margins for competitors. As Friedrich Hayek, winner of the 1974 Nobel Prize in economics, demonstrated in his influential essay, The Use of Knowledge in Society, n188 economic agents use prices as information upon which to base their business decisions. In doing so, the collected activity of these agents is greater than the sum of its parts. The distributed activity of thousands or millions of economic ac-tors enables markets to put resources to their most valuable use, thereby leading to more efficient societies. By comparison, the necessarily constrained attempts of central regulators to set prices and margins is also necessarily inferior: There is simply no reasonable way for competition regula-tors to properly make these judgments in any consistent and reliable manner.</p><p>Although investigations into purportedly excessive prices should thus properly be significantly cir-cumscribed given the substantial risk of deterrence of ex ante entry because of a myopic focus on ex post prices, the Court's precedents here do not necessarily impose such a constraint on the Commission. It thus remains a serious risk that the lure of \"correcting\" high prices -- especially in the politically contentious pharmaceutical industry -- may well induce economically unjustified and ultimately deleterious intervention.</p><p>F. Predatory pricing cases</p><p>A second important area of divergence concerns predatory pricing cases. US antitrust law subjects allegations of predatory pricing to two strict conditions: (i) Monopolists must charge prices that are below some measure of their incremental costs; and (ii) there must be a realistic prospect that they will able to recoup these first-period losses. n189 In laying out its approach to predatory pricing, the Supreme Court identified the risk of false positives and the clear cost of such errors to consumers. It thus particularly stressed the importance of the recoupment requirement because, without re-coupment, \"predatory pricing produces lower aggregate prices in the market, and consumer welfare is enhanced.\" n190</p><p>Accordingly, in the US, authorities must prove that there are constraints that prevent rival firms from entering the market after the predation scheme, or that the scheme itself would effectively foreclose rivals form entering in the first place. n191 Otherwise, the predator would be undercut by competitors as soon as it attempts to charge supracompetitive prices in order to recoup its losses. In such a situation -- without, that is, the strong likelihood of recouping the lost revenue from un-derpricing -- the overwhelming weight of economic learning (to say nothing of simple logic) makes clear that predatory pricing is not a rational business strategy. n192 Thus, apparent cases of predatory pricing in the absence of the likelihood of recoupment are most likely not, in fact, predatory, and deterring or punishing them would likely actually harm consumers.</p><p>In contrast, the legal standard applied to predatory pricing in the EU is much laxer, and almost certain, as a result, to risk injuring consumers. Authorities must prove only that a company has charged a price below its average variable costs, in which case its behavior is presumed to be predatory. n193 Even when a firm imposes prices that are between average variable and average total costs, it can be found guilty of predatory pricing if authorities show that its behavior was part of \"a plan to eliminate competition.\" n194 Most significantly, in neither case is it necessary for authorities to show that the scheme would allow the monopolist to recoup its losses. n195</p><p>[I]t does not follow from the case-law of the Court that proof of the possibility of recoup-ment of losses suffered by the application, by an undertaking in a dominant position, of prices lower than a certain level of costs constitutes a necessary precondition to establish-ing that such a pricing policy is abusive. n196</p><p>This aspect of the legal standard has no basis in economic theory or evidence -- not even in the \"strategic\" economic theory that arguably challenges the dominant, \"Chicago School\" understand-ing of predatory pricing. Indeed, strategic predatory pricing still requires proof of below cost pric-ing, recoupment, and the refutation of any convincing business justification offered in response. n197</p><p>The case of predatory pricing illustrates a crucial distinction between European and American competition law. The recoupment requirement embodied in American antitrust law essentially serves to differentiate aggressive pricing behavior that improves consumer welfare because it leads to overall prices decreases from predatory pricing that reduces welfare due to ultimately higher overall price increases. It is, in other words, entirely focused on the welfare of consumers. The Eu-ropean approach, by contrast, reflects structuralist considerations that are far removed from a con-cern for consumer welfare. Its underlying fear is that dominant companies could, through aggressive pricing -- even to the benefit of consumers -- by their very success engender more con-centrated market structures. It is simply presumed that these less atomistic markets are invariably detrimental to consumers. Both the Tetra Pak and France Telecom cases offer clear illustrations of the ECJ's reasoning on this point:</p><p>[I[t would not be appropriate, in the circumstances of the present case, to require in addition proof that Tetra Pak had a realistic chance of recouping its losses. It must be possible to penalize predatory pricing whenever there is a risk that competitors will be eliminated... The aim pursued, which is to maintain undistorted competition, rules out waiting until such a strategy leads to the actual elimination of competitors. n198</p><p>Similarly:</p><p>[The lack of any possibility of recoupment of losses is not sufficient to prevent the un-dertaking concerned reinforcing its dominant position, in particular, following the with-drawal from the market of one or a number of its competitors, so that the degree of competition existing on the market, already weakened precisely because of the presence of the undertaking concerned, is further reduced and customers suffer loss as a result of the limitation of the choices available to them.. n199</p><p>In short, the European approach leaves much less room for the analysis of a pricing scheme's con-crete effects, making it much more prone to false positives than the Brooke Group standard in the US. To make matters worse, the European approach ignores not only the benefits that consumers may derive from lower prices, but also the chilling effect that broad predatory pricing standards may exert on firms that are attempting to attract consumers with aggressive pricing schemes.</p><p>G. Refusals to deal</p><p>US and EU antitrust laws are also very different when it comes to refusals to deal. While the US has imposed strenuous limits on authorities or rivals that seek to bring such cases, EU competition law sets a far lower threshold for liability.</p><p>As Justice Scalia wrote in the Trinko majority opinion:</p><p>Aspen Skiing is at or near the outer boundary of [Sec.]2 liability. The Court there found sig-nificance in the defendant's decision to cease participation in a cooperative venture. The unilateral termination of a voluntary (and thus presumably profitable) course of dealing sug-gested a willingness to forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end. n200</p><p>This highlights two key features of American antitrust law with regard to refusals to deal. For a start, US antitrust law generally does not apply the \"essential facilities\" doctrine. n201 Accordingly, in the absence of exceptional facts, upstream monopolists are rarely required to supply their product to downstream rivals, even if that supply is \"essential\" for there to be effective competition in the downstream market. Moreover, as Justice Scalia observed in Trinko, the Aspen Skiing case appears to concern only those limited instances where a firm's refusal to deal stems from the termination of a preexisting and profitable business relationship. n202 While even this is not likely the economically appropriate limitation on liability, n203 its impetus -- ensuring that liability is found only in situations where procompetitive explanations for the challenged conduct are unlikely -- is exactly appropriate for a regime concerned with minimizing the cost to consumers of erroneous enforcement deci-sions.</p><p>As in most areas of antitrust policy, EU competition law is much more interventionist. Refusals to deal are a central theme of EU enforcement efforts, and there is a relatively low threshold for lia-bility. n204 In theory, there are four conditions for a refusal to deal to infringe EU competition law: the input must be indispensable, the refusal must eliminate all competition in the downstream market, and there must not be objective reasons that justify the refusal. n205 Moreover, if the refusal to deal involves intellectual property, it must also prevent the appearance of a new good. n206 In prac-tice, however, all of these conditions have been severely relaxed by EU courts and the Commis-sion's decisional practice. This is best evidenced by the lower court's Microsoft ruling where, as John Vickers notes:</p><p>[T]he Court found easily in favor of the Commission on the IMS Health criteria, which it interpreted surprisingly elastically, and without relying on the special factors empha-sized by the Commission. For example, to meet the \"new product\" condition it was un-necessary to identify a particular new product... thwarted by the refusal to supply but sufficient merely to show limitation of technical development in terms of less incentive for competitors to innovate. n207</p><p>EU competition law shows far less concern for its potential chilling effect on firms' investments than does US antitrust law.</p><p>H. Other areas</p><p>While at a glance US and EU competition law are often superficially similar, the preceding discus-sion should make clear that, in practice, small differences have a significant cumulative effect on outcomes. Three more such differences deserve to be touched upon briefly. The first concerns ver-tical restrictions and resale price maintenance (RPM), the second involves rebates, and the third re-lates to damages claims.</p><p>1. Vertical restraints</p><p>There are vast differences between US and EU competition law relating to vertical restraints. On the one hand, since the Supreme Court's Leegin ruling, even price-related vertical restraints (such as RPM) are assessed under the rule of reason in the US. n208 Some commentators have gone so far as to say that, in practice, the US case law almost amounts to per se legality. n209 Conversely, EU competition law treats RPM as severely as it treats cartels. Both RPM and cartels are considered to be restrictions of competition \"by object\" -- the EU's equivalent of a per se prohibition. n210 This par-ticularly strict treatment of vertical restrictions flies in the face of the longstanding, mainstream economics that deal with the subject. As Patrick Rey and Jean Tirole (hardly the most pro-free-mar-ket economists) saw it as long ago as 1986:</p><p>Another major contribution of the earlier literature on vertical restraints is to have shown that per se illegality of such restraints has no economic foundations. n211</p><p>Unlike in the EU, the US Supreme Court in Leegin took account of the weight of the economic literature, and changed its approach to RPM to ensure that the law no longer simply precluded its arguable consumer benefits: \"Though each side of the debate can find sources to support its posi-tion, it suffices to say here that economics literature is replete with procompetitive justifications for a manufacturer's use of resale price maintenance.\" Further, \"[the prior approach to resale price maintenance restraints] hinders competition and consumer welfare because manufacturers are forced to engage in second-best alternatives and because consumers are required to shoulder the increased expense of the inferior practices.\" n212</p><p>By contrast, the EU's continued per se treatment of RPM strongly reflects its \"precautionary princi-ple\" approach to antitrust, under which European regulators and courts readily condemn conduct that could conceivably injure consumers, even where such injury is, according to the best economic understanding, unlikely (at best). The US approach to per se illegality, which rests on likelihood ra-ther than mere possibility, n213 is far less likely to erroneously condemn beneficial conduct.</p><p>2. Rebates</p><p>US and EU antitrust laws are also divided when it comes to the assessment of rebates (although, as noted above, EU law on rebates is very much up in the air after the ECJ's recent Intel ruling n214). The assessment of rebates is one of the more complicated areas of modern competition law. n215</p><p>Nevertheless, there are significant divergences between the US and the EU's stance on these issues that reflect not the complexity of the issue, but rather the EU's relative willingness to disregard complex economics in favor of non-economic, formalist presumptions. Whereas US antitrust has predominantly moved to an effects-based assessment of rebates, n216 this is only (at best) starting to happen in the EU. Prior to the ECJ's Intel ruling, the EU implemented an overly simplistic ap-proach to the assessment of rebates by dominant firms, where so-called \"fidelity\" rebates were al-most per se illegal. n217 It is unclear how the Intel ruling will affect this approach. At the very least, it seems to have moved European competition towards a slightly more evidence-based approach. n218</p><p>3. Damages Claims</p><p>Damages claims are also treated differently on both sides of the Atlantic. Whereas the US has a long tradition of private enforcement relating to antitrust matters, this is much less the case in the European Union and its member states. For this reason, the EU recently adopted a competition law damages directive, aimed at facilitating private antitrust suits by injured parties. n219</p><p>Two parts of this piece of legislation are particularly striking and are in stark contrast to US anti-trust law. First, the EU damages directive explicitly mandates that indirect purchases should have standing to claim damages. n220 This differs from the US approach, where the Supreme Court con-cluded in Illinois Brick that indirect purchasers could not bring antitrust damages claims. n221 Second, the US bars both defensive and offensive passing-on claims, n222 whereas the EU mandates that courts should consider both of these claims if they are raised by parties. n223</p><p>The US bar on passing-on claims is rooted largely in administrative concerns:</p><p>Permitting the use of pass-on theories under [Sec.] 4 essentially would transform treble-dam-ages actions into massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge -- from direct purchasers to middlemen to ultimate consumers. However appealing this attempt to allocate the overcharge might seem in theory, it would add whole new dimensions of complexity to treble-damages suits and seriously undermine their effectiveness. n224</p><p>There is something to be said for this reticence to open up the floodgates to private antitrust litiga-tion. Of course, in theory, we want every wronged party to be able to seek redress, but if the system is untenable, it is entirely possible that less justice will be served because of the cost and expense entailed in apportioning damages (and locating relevant parties) in matters involving thousands or millions of individuals. The EU's bold experiment is worth watching, but it is likely better to take the measured approach adopted by the US, and seek marginal improvements as new cases arise.</p><p>Recently, the Supreme Court took up just such a potential modification in Apple v. Pepper. n225 Apple v. Pepper emerged from a claim that Apple's pricing model for its App Store violates US antitrust laws. The central dispute of the case is whether the Illinois Brick indirect purchaser doctrine n226 -- which limits standing in price fixing cases only to those parties directly injured, and prevents pri-vate actions by subsequent purchasers -- can be used to prevent App Store users from suing Apple for its alleged anticompetitive pricing structure imposed on app developers. Those in favor of ap-plying Illinois Brick to prevent the standing of users assert that -- following Campos v. Ticketmaster in the 8th Circuit n227 -- it is the app developers themselves who are injured by the restrictive pricing (while users receive only a pass-through injury). Therefore, so the argument goes, end users do not have sufficient standing to bring an antitrust suit.</p><p>The real opportunity presented to the Court in this case, however, is to consider how antitrust standing doctrine should apply to certain kinds of digital platforms. In truth, Apple's position in the center of the transaction between developers and end users is unique in the context of the in-direct purchaser doctrine. The relationship is better framed as a two-sided market, rather than a traditional vertical chain of purchases, and so it may be the case that end users are appropriate par-ties to bring antirust complaints against a platform operator -- not because Illinois Brick should be overturned, but because Illinois Brick should be amended to reflect the particular circumstances of this and similar cases.</p><p>Importantly, this doctrinal evolution also occurs in a larger context in which courts are grappling with the law and economics of two-sided platforms. The Court's recent American Express decision actually sets the stage for considering the standing doctrine in Apple v. Pepper and how the law ought to develop. In American Express, the Court held that plaintiffs need to incorporate facts about both sides of a two-sided \"transaction\" platform when alleging anticompetitive harm. n228 The full ramifications of this decision are not yet known, but the general consensus is that this means that litigants need to conduct a full cost-benefit analysis that examines the net harms and benefits of the platform as a whole, and cannot merely restrict alleged harms to one side.</p><p>If Apple v. Pepper does increase the number of potential litigants by relaxing the indirect purchaser doctrine for two-sided platforms like the App Store, it is likely that American Express will temper the feared excesses this could bring by imposing a higher burden on plaintiffs. The end result may be a system that is capable of addressing more claims, while also being calibrated to limit the risk of wrong-headed or abusive litigation and other administrative problems.</p><p>In contrast to this (possible) evolution of doctrine, the EU's approach looks much more like set-ting off a litigation time bomb. It appears calibrated not to achieve optimal results, but to achieve maximal litigation and redress. Given the incentives of plaintiffs and the likelihood of error, this is almost certain to exacerbate type I errors. The US's approach of developing doctrine that both fits better to the sorts of claims that arise, and also is tempered by incrementalism, is far more likely to yield outcomes that avoid excess while also facilitating just results.</p><p>n1 See K.

In this testimony I focus on the economic aspects of EU competition policy, and so discuss these procedural problems only in passing. But they are indeed significant and problematic:</p><p>[T[he European Commission's procedures for enforcing competition law are inadequate and do not match the importance and prestige of the institution as a world leader in antitrust enforcement. The topic is especially urgent due to the heavy consequences of being found to have infringed competition rules, the punitive and adjudicatory nature of the process, and the increasingly important case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. Th[is] article identi.es three weaknesses in the current system: the adoption of a decision .nding guilt by 27 political appointees who have not heard or studied the evidence; the lack of any hearing before a decision-maker; and the fact that the same case team in the Commission handles both the investigation of the case and the reaching of a decision.</p><p>Ian S.

Whether any firm is able to exercise market power is emphatically a function of competitive constraints from other firms.

But the \"EU - Country\" data in their table presents the weighted average of data from eight of Europe's most advanced economies, while the \"EU - Aggregate\" data treats the entire EU as a single market. The problem, of course, is that this data includes Eastern Bloc countries, with much younger, much-more-recently state-controlled economies. These countries also have significantly less antitrust enforcement. It should be treated as quite revealing that, by including them in the analysis, the extent of industry concentration appears to go down, rather than up. It is certainly true that the EU has become more integrated as a single market over the relevant timeframe, and thus it is possible that the country-specific numbers are misleading. But the integration is by no means perfect, and the simple, undifferentiated combining of countries into a single whole is also extremely unlikely to reflect reality.</p><p>n110 Gross operating surplus and mixed income (2018).

In many respects, EU merger law is fairly similar to US merger law, being guided by something that approaches a consumer welfare model. Of course, like US law, there is still a great deal of discretion in enforcement, and even within sensible constraints the EU tends to be relatively more suspicious of large mergers. As noted above, the political aims of competition enforcement tend to include concerns for unifying the single market, including the effects that markets have on labor broadly speaking. This is an important distinction from US competition law which, even within the bounds of discretion, still hews more closely to a dependence on rigorous economic analysis.</p><p>n150 See, e.g., Joaquin Almunia, \"Competition and consumers: the future of EU competition policy,\" Speech at European Competition Day, Madrid (May 12, 2010), available at <url normalizedValue=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-10-233_en.pdf\">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-10-233_en.pdf</url> (\"All of us here today know very well what our ultimate objective is: Competition policy is a tool at the service of consumers.

ECON. 137 (1958). Some economists have more recently posed a \"strategic\" theory of predatory pricing that purports to expand substantially (and redirect) the scope of circumstances in which predatory pricing could be rational. See, e.g., Patrick Bolton, Joseph F. Brodley and Michael H. Riordan, Predatory Pricing: Strategic Theory and Legal Policy, 88 GEO. L. J. 2239 (2000). While this and related theories have likely, indeed, expanded the theoretical scope of the circumstances conducive to possible predatory pricing, they have not established that these conditions are remotely likely to occur. See, e.g., Frank H. Easterbrook, Predatory Strategies and Counterstrategies, 48 U. CHI. L. REV. 263, 268 (1981) (\"[It] is conceivable that predation could be profitable. Short-run sacrifice for later reward often is a rational way to maximize profits.... The question, though, is whether profitable predation is probable.\"). From a legal perspective, particularly given the risk of error in discerning the difference between predatory pricing and legitimate price cutting, it is far more important to limit cases to situations likely to cause consumer harm, rather than those in which harm is but a remote possibility. The cost of error, of course, is the legal imposition of artificially inflated prices for consumers.</p><p>n193 Case C-62/86, AKZO v Commission, EU:C:1991:286, [Paras.] 71-72.</p><p>n194 Id. para 72.

I am Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley. I served as Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration, Director of Policy Planning for the Federal Trade Commission in the Carter Administration, and Assistant to the Solicitor General in the Ford Administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am pleased to discuss with you the question whether America has a monopoly problem. My answer is it does. Let me explain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not long ago I visited some farmers in Missouri whose profits are disappearing. Why? Monsanto alone owns the key genetic traits to more than 90 percent of the soybeans planted by farmers in the United States, and 80 percent of the corn. Which means Monsanto can charge farmers much higher prices.</p><p>Farmers are getting squeezed from the other side, too, because the food processors they sell their produce to are also consolidating into mega companies that have so much market power they can cut the prices they pay to farmers.</p><p>This doesn't mean lower food prices to consumers. It means more profits to the monopolists.</p><p>Monopolies All Around</p><p>America used to have antitrust laws that stopped corporations from monopolizing markets, and often broke up the biggest culprits.</p><p>But antitrust has faded. The result has been hidden upward redistributions of money and power from the majority of Americans to corporate executives of and major investors in huge concentrations of economic power.</p><p>Consumers may believe they have lots of choices, but take a closer look and choices are far more constrained:</p><p>1. The four largest food companies control 82 percent of beef packing, 85 percent of soybean processing, 63 percent of pork packing, and 53 percent of chicken processing.</p><p>2. There are many brands of toothpaste, but 70 percent of all of it comes from just two companies.</p><p>3. Consumers may think they have their choice of sunglasses, but almost all sunglasses are from one company: Luxottica - which also owns nearly all the eyeglass retail outlets.</p><p>4. Practically every plastic hanger in America is now made by one company, Mainetti.</p><p>5. Cat food appears to come in many brands, but behind them are basically just two companies.</p><p>6. Consumers can get low-cost generic versions of pharmaceuticals. But drug companies in effect pay the makers of generic drugs to delay cheaper versions. Such \"pay for delay\" agreements are illegal in other advanced economies, but they are commonplace in America. They cost consumers an estimated $3.5 billion a year.</p><p>7. Health insurers are consolidating, too. Which is one reason health insurance premiums, copayments, and deductibles are soaring.</p><p>8. Anyone who thinks they have a lot of options for booking discount airline tickets and hotels online should think again. They have only two. Expedia merged with Orbitz, so that's one company. And then there's Priceline.</p><p>9. How about cable and Internet service? At most, consumers have a choice of just four companies; many consumers are served by just one or two.</p><p>10. Today, four airlines control 80 percent of domestic airline seat capacity. In 93 of the top 100 airports, either one or two airlines manage a majority of all seats sold.</p><p>11. What about choice of bank? The five biggest commercial banks now control nearly half of all banking assets, as well as ATM networks.</p><p>12. Three rating agencies control 95 percent of the market for rating bonds and other financial instruments: Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch.</p><p>The problem with all this consolidation is that giant firms don't have to compete very much, if at all. Which means they can - and do - raise prices higher than they'd be if they faced more competition.</p><p>But it's not just prices we should worry about.</p><p>Such consolidation can also depress wages. Workers with less choice of whom to work for have a harder time getting a raise.</p><p>When local labor markets are dominated by one major big box retailer, grocery chain, and a handful of fast-food restaurants, those firms essentially set wage rates for the area. n1 Researchers have found that wages drop when fewer employers in a geographic area list most jobs in an occupation. n2 Non-compete clauses can also hold down wages. n3</p><p>These massive corporations also possess substantial political clout. That's one reason they're consolidating: They don't just seek economic power; they also seek political power.</p><p>Antitrust laws were supposed to stop what's been going on.</p><p>We've Forgotten History</p><p>In America's first Gilded Age, at the end of the nineteenth century, the public viewed with growing alarm the economic and political power of the huge railroad, steel, telegraph, and oil cartels - then called \"trusts\" - that were essentially running America. A handful of corporate chieftains who came to be known as \"robber barons\" presided over these trusts - collecting great wealth at the expense of workers who toiled long hours often in dangerous conditions for little pay. Corporations gouged consumers and corrupted politics.</p><p>America responded to these abuses of power with antitrust laws that allowed the government to break up the largest concentrations. Antitrust was viewed not only in narrow economic terms but also as a means of preventing giant corporations from undermining democracy. \"If we will not endure a king as a political power,\" thundered Ohio's Senator John Sherman, the sponsor of the nation's first antitrust law in 1890, \"we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale\" of what the nation produced. (It is worth noting that when Congress enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act, no separate discipline called \"economics\" existed; the field was known as \"political economy.\")</p><p>Then in 1901 the progressive Republican reformer Teddy Roosevelt became President. By this time, the American public was demanding action. In his first message to Congress in December 1901, only two months after assuming the presidency, Roosevelt warned, \"There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people that the great corporations known as the trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare.\" Roosevelt used the Sherman Antitrust Act to sue the Northern Securities Company, a giant railroad trust run by J. P. Morgan, the nation's most powerful businessman. The U.S. Supreme Court backed Roosevelt and ordered the company dismantled.</p><p>In 1911, John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust was broken up, too. But in its decision, the Supreme Court effectively altered the Sherman Act, saying that monopolistic restraints of trade were objectionable if they were \"unreasonable\" - and that determination was to be made by the courts. What was an unreasonable restraint of trade? In the presidential election of 1912, Roosevelt, running again for president but this time as a third party candidate, opined that some concentration of industries should be allowed where there were economic efficiencies due to large scale; but these firms should be regulated the public benefit. Woodrow Wilson, who ended up winning the election, and his adviser Louis Brandeis, took a different view. They didn't think regulation would work, and thought all monopolies should be broken up.</p><p>For the next sixty-five years, both views dominated. America had strong antitrust enforcement along with regulations that held big corporations in check. Most big mergers were prohibited. Even large size alone was thought to be a problem. In 1945, in the case of United States v. Alcoa (1945), the Supreme Court ruled that even though Alcoa hadn't pursued a monopoly, it had become one by becoming so large that it was guilty of violating the Sherman Act.</p><p>All this changed in the 1980s, after Robert Bork - with whom, incidentally, I studied antitrust law with at Yale Law School, and then worked for when he became Solicitor General under President Ford - wrote an influential book called The Antitrust Paradox, which argued that the sole purpose of the Sherman Act is consumer welfare. Bork believed that mergers and large size almost always create efficiencies that lower prices, and therefore should be legal. Bork's ideas were consistent with the conservative Chicago School of Economics, and found a ready audience in the Reagan White House.</p><p>Since then, even under Democratic administrations, antitrust has all but disappeared.</p><p>The Particular Problem of Big Tech</p><p>America's first Gilded Age began with a raft of innovations - railroads, steel production, oil extraction - but culminated in mammoth trusts. We're now in a second Gilded Age - ushered in by semiconductors, software and the internet - which has spawned a handful of giant hi-tech companies.</p><p>Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches now go through Google. n4 Facebook and Google dominate advertising, carrying 58 percent of all digital ads; Amazon accounts for 4.2 percent of the digital ad market. n5</p><p>Facebook and Google are also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 percent of Americans receive news online). n6 Apple dominates smartphones, with over 40 percent of the U.S. market. n7 Google's Android accounts for 55 percent of all smartphone operating systems in the U.S.; Apple's iOS, for 44 percent. n8 Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything - and responsible for an estimated 45 percent of all retail e-commerce in the United States. n9</p><p>This consolidation at the heart of the American economy is contributing to five problems that go far beyond narrow concepts of consumer welfare.</p><p>First, it stifles innovation. Contrary to the conventional view of a US economy bubbling with inventive small companies, the rate at which new job-creating businesses have formed in the United States has been halved since 2004, according to the Census Bureau. n10 A major culprit: Big Tech.</p><p>Big Tech's sweeping patents and copyrights, huge and growing data collections, dominant networks and platforms, and capacities for predatory behavior -- combined with legions of lawyers ready to sue for infringement of intellectual property, or the poaching of employees -- have become formidable barriers to new entrants. The most that many startups can hope for is to be purchased by Big Tech; but in any such negotiations, Big Tech has the advantage of a monopsony.</p><p>The second problem is that such large size and gigantic capitalization translate into political power. They allow vast sums to be spent on lobbying, political campaigns, and public persuasion. To take one example, although the European Union filed fined Google a record $2.7 billion for forcing search engine users into its own shopping platforms, American antitrust authorities have not moved against the company.</p><p>Why not? In 2012, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition recommended that the Commission sue Google for conduct that \"has resulted--and will result--in real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets,\" but the commissioners chose not to pursue the case, and gave no explanation for their decision. As a former official of the commission, I can tell you it's unusual for the commissioners to decide against a staff recommendation without comment.</p><p>We can't be sure why the FTC chose not to pursue Google. After all, section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 gives the Commission broad authority to prevent unfair acts or practices. One distinct possibility concerns Google's political power. It has one of the biggest lobbying powerhouses in Washington, and the firm gives generously to Democrats as well as Republicans.</p><p>A clearer example of an abuse of power was revealed last November when the New York Times reported that Facebook executives withheld evidence of Russian activity on their platform far longer than previously disclosed.</p><p>Even more disturbing, Facebook employed a political opposition research firm to discredit critics. n11 How long will it be before Facebook uses its own data and platform against critics? Or before potential critics are silenced even by the possibility? As the Times's investigation made clear, economic power cannot be separated from political power.</p><p>A third problem is the ease by which misinformation can be \"weaponized\" through these giant networks. Facebook attracts most of the criticism, but Google's YouTube is generating similar problems. A number of research and news reports have shown how easily YouTube users get sucked into conspiracy theories. n12 One recent study showed that after watching YouTube conspiracy videos, a significant number of people became skeptical that the earth is round. n13</p><p>As long as Facebook and YouTube possess a virtual duopoly over information flows, the only choice for dealing with systematic misinformation flowing through these networks appears to be either requiring that Facebook and YouTube regulate - and therefore censor -- what they consider to be misinformation, or having government do the regulating and censoring. Obviously, neither of these choices is desirable in a democracy. If government does the censoring, democracy would be directly threatened. But democracy would also be threatened if Facebook or Google did the censoring. What's to prevent them from using their power to suppress political views they disagree with?</p><p>The best alternative would be to end the information duopoly itself. Absent these networks, information (and misinformation) would have to be distributed through a large number of independent channels, without a centralized platform giving them apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach.</p><p>Maintaining competition gets government out of the role of censorship. An analogy would be the Federal Communications Commission, which prohibits common ownership of a full-power broadcast station and daily newspaper if the station's reach encompasses the newspaper's city of publication, in order to maintain competition in communication markets.</p><p>The fourth problem is privacy. Big Tech is amassing huge amounts of data about the personal behavior of virtually everyone. The sheer quantity of data will soon become an entry barrier of its own, further entrenching the giants. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg predicts that \"Facebook will know every book, film, and song you ever consumed, and its predictive models will tell you what bar to go to when you arrive at a strange city, where the bartender will have your favorite drink waiting.\" Google's Eric Schmidt says, \"you give us more information about you, about your friends, and ... we don't need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you've been. We more or less know what you're thinking about.\" n14</p><p>Privacy is a cornerstone of personal freedom. As Senator Lee recognized in 2011,\"the combination of behavioral and personal information enables Google to generate consumer data that is unprecedented in scale and scope. These activities raise serious privacy concerns and may be indicative of an important market that is largely unconstrained by competition. Antitrust enforcement may unlock beneficial competition for the protection of user privacy and avert the need for additional privacy regulation.\" n15</p><p>Which brings us to the fifth problem: The concentration of data, information, and power in a few giant corporations threaten to undermine civil society. As Senator Lee has said, \"free enterprise and civil society operate in the natural human space -- between the isolated individual and the impersonal state -- where we live, and love, and flourish . . . where everyone can earn a good living and build a good life . . . where the strong and the vulnerable alike can pursue their happiness, and find it . . . together.\" n16</p><p>But the Big Tech is undermining civil society. Consider, for example, the nonprofit sector, an essential part of civil society. Google is exercising its power to stifle criticisms coming from independent researchers in that sector. As reported by The New York Times, the New America Foundation, an influential think tank, fired researcher Barry Lynn, a sharp critic of platform monopolies like Google's. Why? Lynn had posted a congratulatory note to European officials on their Google decision, and called for American antitrust officials to follow suit. Since its founding in 1999, the New America Foundation received more than $21 million from Google (and its parent company, Alphabet) and from the family foundation of Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet who previously served as chairman of New America's board. According to the Times, Schmidt didn't like Lynn's comments and communicated his displeasure to the president of the New America Foundation. She then accused Lynn of \"imperiling the institution as a whole,\" and fired him, along with his staff. n17</p><p>Colleges and universities are another important cornerstone of civil society. Big Tech is threatening their independence and integrity as well. The Wall Street Journal reports that Google has quietly financed hundreds of professors at universities such as Harvard and Berkeley to write research papers that help Google defend itself against regulatory challenges to its market dominance -- paying them from $5,000 to $400,000 on a wish-list of topics developed by Google. Google uses the resulting research in courtrooms, regulatory hearings, and congressional hearings. Some professors have allowed Google to see the papers before they are published, enabling Google to offer \"suggestions,\" according to emails obtained by the Journal. The professors' research papers have not disclosed that Google sought them out, and do not necessarily reveal Google's backing. n18</p><p>Big Tech is also undermining civil society by draining communities of their vibrancy and functions. Amazon draws customers away from local and retailers. Google and Facebook take advertising dollars away from local and regional media. Big Tech's social media platforms drain attention and interactions away social capital within our communities, on which voluntary civil society is built.</p><p>There is no easy answer to these five problems. They have become endemic to life in the twenty-first century. But I believe antitrust enforcement can help mitigate them. The biggest of Big Tech should be broken up, or at least be required to make their proprietary technology and data publicly available and to share their platforms with smaller competitors, and should be barred from further acquisitions. There would be little cost to the economy, since these giant firms rely on innovation rather than economies of scale - and, as noted, they're likely to be impeding innovation overall.</p><p>It's Time to Revive Antitrust</p><p>Antitrust is - or should be -- about more than welfare economics. The problems it should be addressing go far beyond helping individual consumers get the best possible deal for themselves.</p><p>Most fundamentally, antitrust is about maintaining a free market. As the late Robert Pitofsky, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, noted: \"Antitrust is a deregulatory philosophy.

The comments today reflect my own opinion. I have no financial relationship with the parties in the transaction. I own no securities of any telecommunications or internet firm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for a colorful title to today's hearing, which allows us an interesting starting point to reflect on the nature of competition. The key critique of this merger is that reducing the number of players reduces competition. That logic does not hold up in Game of Thrones: When you reduce the number of warring parties vying for the thrones, you will likely increase rivalry. Who wins is a function of innovation--with (a better) weapon and the superior strategy. The point is merely that what we care about in a competitive market is rivalry, not the number of firms. Remember it only take two to start a bar fight.</p><p>I am proud to be a part of the American Enterprise Institute where I am part of a team of adjunct scholars around the world studying technology policy. As an American based in Denmark at Aalborg University and Strand Consult, I have the benefit to study the global wireless market with colleagues who have studied the field in its innovation, engineering, and policy for more than 20 years. The situation facing the US is not unique. Consolidation is a feature of nearly every country's mobile market, driven primarily by exogeneous competition by the internet companies. We have had consolidation for over a decade, and the general trend of prices is downward.</p><p>Looking at the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, there are two important questions: How will this merger affect prices, and how will it affect investment in infrastructure? In practice, American consumers and businesses will still be able to access some of the world's best mobile infrastructure at competitive prices, and that infrastructure will increasingly be more accessible to Americans in all areas.</p><p>In less than a generation, the global mobile wireless industry has succeeded to connect nearly every person on the face of the earth to a mobile phone and a mobile network. It is the mobile phone, not the internet, which is the world's most quickly adopted innovation. n1 Mobile networks have been leveraged to connect people to the internet, and today about half of the world's population connects to the internet with a mobile phone. During this period, mobile subscription prices have fallen more than 90 percent, while data volumes have increased thousands of times. Market liberalization and subsequent consolidation have driven this trend. Markets have been liberated from government control and subsequently consolidated through the innovative and creative ways that mobile operators combine complementary assets. n2 We have never had more data, more products, and better prices than today.</p><p>Looking at 2012-17, the figures from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch show that averaged revenue per user (ARPU) in the US has declined from $54 to $45 (Verizon) and from $43 to $34 (T-Mobile). n3 In five years, American consumers have cut 20 percent of the cost of their mobile bill while the quality, volume, and speed of the service has increased dramatically. Despite the massive consolidation in the US and worldwide telecom market over the years, consumers prices have only gone one way: down. There are few products and services that improve in quality as they decrease in price, and consumers consistently get value for money. Their outlay for connectivity, of which mobile wireless is a vital part, takes us an increasingly smaller share of their total income. People spend more as a percentage each on housing, transportation, education, clothing, food, and vacation--in many cases seeing prices increase--whereas the price of mobile wireless has fallen. n4</p><p>Moreover, competition in the mobile market is global. The Europeans adopted the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) standard to give their phone manufacturers an edge. Verizon realized that their (code-division multiple access (CDMA) technology was not compatible with the cool smartphones on the GSM/WCDMA market. It would not have mattered if there were 100 CDMA mobile operators. People wanted the technology of the cool smartphones. Verizon did not copy the Europeans and launch 3G (WCDMA). Instead, they leapfrogged to 4G. The other US operators followed. It was not the number of players that triggered that race, but rather the technological development. Today, America's 4G economy supports five million jobs and adds $475 billion annually to GDP. n5 The rollout of a 5G network should add 3 million new jobs and contribute $1.2 trillion to the US economy. n6</p><p>America's mobile market also includes the competition from disruptive technologies such as voice over internet protocol (VOIP) in Skype and online messaging such as WhatsApp. n7 These apps have collapsed what was once a major source of revenue for mobile operators in short message service and long distance calling to essentially zero. The app market has been complemented by the growth and diversification of handsets. Consumers have been enriched significantly by these hardware and software developments for which the foundation is next generation networks. In a converging world, the lion's share of the profits have been reaped by Silicon Valley firms Apple, Google, and Facebook. While mobile operators have invested the most among all players, their balance sheets have the thinnest profit margins.</p><p>4 to 3</p><p>Let's discuss the key criticism of this merger: It reduces the number of firms from four to three. The notion of the number of firms in the market is rooted in a study of industrial organizations from the 1950s, the structure-conduct-performance paradigm. But antitrust has been revolutionized with the schools of Chicago and Harvard, as well as game theory and behavior economics, and it continues. The key finding of this sweep of history and learning is that antitrust has moved away from bright-line rules (e.g., four to three is bad) because of too many false positives. n8 Today, we put greater focus on the empirical evidence of competitive effects. n9</p><p>This four to three theory is based on a market with an identical, homogenous good market with the same strategy. This has never been an accurate picture of the mobile wireless market. Indeed, the corporate world of the 1950s was characterized by a lifetime employment, risk-averse, collectivist, groupthink mentality. n10 The CEO was the stereotypical \"organization man,\" the \"man in the gray flannel suit.\" n11 Today's CEO is the maverick in the magenta T-shirt.</p><p>The so-called maverick marketing communications and strategy and its variants have been used over the years in many countries. It is Telmore's Frank Rasumssen, CBB's Teddy Sogaard Pedersen, and Onfone's Morten Strunge in Denmark; Stan Miller of Base in Belgium; Xavier Niel of Free in France; Jorgen Bang Jensen of P4 in Poland; Rolf Hansen of Simyo in Germany; Idar Vollvik of Chess in Norway; and Masayoshi Son of Softbank in Japan. n12 It appears that T-Mobile studied the corporate strategy created by Stan Miller of KPN Mobile International, which the mobile operator E-Plus used against T-Mobile, Vodafone, and O2 in Germany.</p><p>Other critiques are that the merger would create collusion, but mavericks are not known to cooperate and frequently defect. n13 There are high transaction costs to illicit coordination. There is no standard product among the firms. Each has its own marketing strategy. The market will continue to develop as a differentiated rivalry, where each firm tries to develop a wide range of differentiated products and services that cater to all sorts of consumer niches.</p><p>In any event, there is no guarantee that the market will not consolidate to three networks anyway. A cable company could buy Sprint, or Sprint could exit the market. T-Mobile is willing to pay a premium, probably more than a cable company, because the synergies are most attractive to them.</p><p>There is more than intuition that informs this analysis. Let's look at some of the key academic papers. Regulators around the world ask the same question. It is challenging because of blunt tools, imprecise data, and outdated assumptions.</p><p>Some assert that we have a competitive market today because the ATandT acquisition of T-Mobile was rejected. I disagree because the model presented by regulators does not hold up. The Department of Justice rejected the notion of merger efficiencies because, per its analysis, most large mobile service providers have reached the point of constant or even (rarely) declining returns to scale. n14 It prepared a model that analyzed scale economies for 22 mobile carriers in seven countries. The study's period 1998-2007 covers companies at different stages of 2G and 3G development to attempt to extrapolate the future--before the key events of the launch of iPhone and later 4G. Oddly, the study omits results for the incumbents in three of the countries. We have a decade of more data to crunch with that model, so before relying on that analysis, we should at least plug in the numbers to see whether the model holds and go back and add the companies that were omitted. Again, we need to look at what actually happened, not extrapolations.</p><p>The Europeans made a retrospective of their decisions in Austria and Netherlands. They note the demonstrated global downward trend in average revenue per user (ARPU) per month (what an average mobile subscriber pays per month), which exists regardless of the level of consolidation, and they cannot prove that their efforts affected price. n15 Separately, we can confirm in the BOFML numbers that ARPU is down and traffic up in Austria with a four to three consolidation. n16 The five to four consolidation in the Netherlands also shows ARPU down and traffic up. n17</p><p>Another paper claims that four-to-three mergers not only increase investment by 19 percent with merging operator but also increase price up by 16 percent. n18 The study of 33 countries from 2002 to 2014 investigates entry via licensing, exit via mergers, and organic growth. While the impact of the merger to investment is not conclusive, the paper suggests to regulators that increased investment is worth an increase in price. The authors suggest that in-depth in-country studies could resolve the shortcomings of their research and suggest that the role of price could also be related to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), but that would require a separate study. The authors note that the pricing information in their study is imperfect. (Some countries only provide prices from two operators.) The paper focuses on the lowest priced offers but does not use the appropriate database designed to capture the relevant information. Moreover, the study does not control for differences between multi-play fixed and mobile operators (e.g., ATandT and Verizon) and \"pure play\" mobile operators (e.g., T-Mobile and Sprint). They believe their study is most representative of market entry (license) and exit (merger). They stress the potential trade-off between market power effects and efficiency gains stemming from mergers may be worthwhile.</p><p>The reason that we put more emphasis on evidence and the actual impact is that regulators have gotten it spectacularly wrong. Take the Blockbuster-Hollywood Video decision, the classic horizontal merger with two large competitors in the brick and mortar retail DVD business. In that 1950s industrial organizations mindset, the antitrust experts concluded that the deal would reduce the number of firms and hence harm consumers and competition. n19 But these experts failed to incorporate the role of technology. Netflix was transitioning its service from DVD by mail to online streaming. Hollywood and Blockbuster had a digital plan, the merger was predicated on making that investment, but the merger was denied. It possible that Netflix would have more competition had the Blockbuster-Hollywood Video been allowed. Today, Netflix has 125 million customers and almost $12 billion in annual revenue. n20 It could swallow both Sprint and T-Mobile. Indeed, I wonder why Netflix, market cap $150 billion, does not just buy them outright to create optimized distribution for its content.</p><p>There is no penalty for antitrust authorities when they get it wrong. They keep their jobs. But many jobs in forms are lost because of their decisions. Consumers and competition have suffered because of antitrust authorities and their outdated bright-line rules. Pronouncement about the preferred number of mobile operators in a mobile market is central planning, plain and simple.</p><p>Higher Prices</p><p>The other critique of this merger is that it will lead to higher prices. I find this the most absurd of all claims. Mobile wireless providers have been consolidating from five to four to three national networks for over a decade, and prices are only going one way: down. Value is going up.</p><p>First, let us recognize that mobile broadband is extremely valuable, in part because of high fixed costs, particularly price of spectrum. Logically, something with a high value has a relatively high price. But this says little about the prices consumers pay.</p><p>The key reason that prices are relatively high for consumers is misguided regulatory policy. Regulators have designed policy to force consumers to pay near 100 percent of the cost and to artificially and unfairly restrict the development of a two-sided market. Theoretically, the price of mobile broadband could be zero or very-low cost. Every single communications networks in US history allowed a two-sided market to reduce costs for end users and to increase output. When it comes to the internet, we suspend economics.</p><p>Consider when Netflix sent a DVD by the US Postal Service. The customer paid a subscription, and Netflix paid the postage. Now that Netflix is online, the customer still pays the subscription fee, but Netflix sends the postal fee to the broadband provider. The broadband provider thus must collect that fee from the entire subscriber base whether or not they subscribe to Netflix. In other terms, Netflix has been able to grow its customer base without meaningfully having to increase its delivery costs. It comprises 35 percent of downstream fixed traffic today in North America. n21 As for downstream mobile traffic, Google makes up about 21 percent of all traffic; Facebook about 14 percent. n22</p><p>Mobile operators have attempted to lower prices, but regulators, pressured by so-called consumer advocates, tried to block these efforts. n23 T-Mobile's BingeOn and MusicFreedom were wildly popular, prompting millions of customers to switch. What was the prior Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) response and now the California legislature? To shut down a program that consumers love. This regulatory discrimination extends to various welfare-enhancing activities such as health care providers subsidizing the cost of prenatal videos through ATandT or Verizon's effort to challenge the online advertising duopoly and breathe new life into Yahoo. This ideological prejudice in which regulators, not consumers, decide the products we get to have, costs our economy about $30-$40 billion annually, n24 an amount equal to four times what we spend on the Universal Service Fund annually. We could have closed the digital divide years ago had our regulatory policy not prioritized the profits of Silicon Valley over the welfare of the poor.</p><p>In any case, we will never get 5G if we do not allow a two-sided market, pricing flexibility, and business model experimentation. The wholesale market will have to multiply many times over, and resellers will come in entirely new guises. Consider a company such as Tesla, which sells about 30,000 cars a month, each one equipped with a mobile subscription. In practice, the Tesla is nothing more than a smartphone on wheels with a SIM card inside. To date, Tesla prepays the mobile data subscription and bundles it with the car price. n25 Tesla is probably the most famous de facto MVNO that you have never heard about. It, like hundreds of other companies and products such as Amazon Kindle, get to package and resell communications and never have to register at the FCC.</p><p>5G</p><p>There is no doubt much focus on 5G and how it can catalyze economic growth. Industry players make it sound easy, but past experience show how difficult and risky technological change is. Look back at the year 2000 and the dreams that ARPU would double. The 3G market did not develop as predicted, and it took years before consumers adopted it. Despite 3G's launch in 2000, the 3G Motorola RAZR phone did not appear until the fourth quarter 2006. A month later came the first iPhone, which was a 2G GSM phone. It is reasonable that companies want to merge to reduce their risk in an uncertain environment, while forging ahead with network deployment required to defend existing investment as well as to compete with other technologies.</p><p>There is a role for government here, but it is not to pick a winner or make facile pronouncements on the preferred number of players in the market. We should welcome the many American companies that want to invest in the spectrum-enabled economy, some $275 billion through 2024. n26 Market-based auctions have delivered hundreds of billions of dollars to the US economy. We need government to make substantive policy such as allocating more spectrum and promoting regulatory frameworks that encourage investment, network deployment, and business model experimentation.</p><p>Regulators have also failed us by delivering a sub-optimal spectrum policy that constrains supply, which also contributes to high prices. Indeed our wireless economy was delayed about half a century because regulators wouldn't even allow the market based auction. n27 Spectrum policy was conducted to satisfy n28 the 60 or so federal agencies that possess two-thirds of our nation's prime spectrum resources, free of charge, leaving the private sector, which actually pays for the right to use the airwaves, with less than 20% percent of the spectrum best suited for mobile broadband. n29 That the industry can create so much value for our economy with so little spectrum is a testament to innovation and proof that market actors make efficient use of scare resources.</p><p>We need more spectrum at all levels. I applaud the FCC's upcoming vote to make more mid-band spectrum available. n30 States and municipalities must streamline policies to infrastructure deployment. n31 Old siting and permitting rules designed for large cell towers must be modernized for today's smaller and less-intrusive technologies--most critically the deployment of small-cell antennas in their communities. Small-cell, shoebox-sized antennas are critical to building more dense networks needed to enable 5G. We should recognize and embrace the diversification of the mobile industry value chain, which is diversified across networks (a variety of strategies using different spectrum bands, fixed satellite, satellite, landline fiber, and cable and DSL technologies); terminals (notably smartphones and tablets at all price points, not to mention the emergence of the near-infinite number of connected devices--Americans are well on their way to adopt pre-5G products such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home n32); and the universe of apps and services. There is a lot of 5G excitement about 5G, and the operators' announcements show that the technological development drives the companies' investments.</p><p>The International Telecommunication Union is still working on the standards, but that should not stop this fertile period of experimentation, innovating a range of 4G and pre-5G services. It is not clear how much of the value that mobile operators can capture. Historically, the value has gone to Silicon Valley, The launch of the iPhone did little for operators' share price, but it has been great for Apple. n33 Looking at the great value created with the launch of smartphones and app stores that dominate the mobile services market, there is little value for operators--value added to those who make hardware as well as services such as Google and Facebook.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In 1996 Congress certified the will of the people and the bipartisan consensus that the internet should be free and unfettered from state and federal regulation. n34 The birth and growth of the commercial internet is the greatest free-market success story in history. It unleashed $1.6 trillion in private investment in next generation communications networks, n35 an amount in hard assets larger than any other American industry. n36 The US is less than 5 percent of the world's population but enjoys about 25 percent of the world's private outlay for communications networks, a staggering figure. n37 This was what was required for us to get leadership in 4G, and at a minimum we need to maintain and grow this level so that we can lead in 5G.</p><p>Telecom regulation is not driven by market failure, but rather market success. Mobile operators should be celebrated for their accomplishments, achievements made essentially without government subsidies. Instead, a chorus of regulatory advocates and media outlets claim that mobile operators block the very innovation their networks enable. This claim is not only illogical and preposterous but also harmful and distracting. While we split hairs on market definition and magic numbers, we have lost focus on a bigger, more important issue. China is about to eat our lunch in the internet economy. China already has the edge on 5G n38 and supplanted the US as the world's largest mobile app market by downloads and revenue for two years running. n39 As the New York Times describes, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent make Amazon, Google, and Facebook look tame. n40</p><p>In closing, I want to thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to reflect on our progress. Game of Thrones offers a lesson in civilization illustrated through George R. R. Martin's depiction of late medievalism inspired by actual events and characters, notably the War of the Roses in the 15th century. It is no coincidence that during that period many began to escape serfdom to the New World, heralding the Age of Discovery. The many settlers who followed fled the rule of kings so that they could live under the rule of law. What ultimately liberated the wretched European serfs was free enterprise: the rise of commerce and the merchant class and people being able to own their own property and monetize their labor and inventions.</p><p>I submit that the same powerful, transformative, and ultimately uplifting force of enterprise is exactly what is going on today in this merger and the larger digitally connected industries in general.</p><p>So back to the key questions. How will this merger affect prices, and how will it affect investment in infrastructure? In spite of or because of consolidation, consumers have never had it better than they do today, and that trend should only continue. Government should not freeze the market in place, saddle it with some arbitrary number, or favor some players in the name of the \"public interest.\" The role of government is to protect freedom, entrepreneurship, and competition. We should welcome 5G because it is another milestone in the never-ending story of our civilization as a constant, dynamic evolution, continuously improving our quality of life.</p><p>n1 \"How Americans Spend Their Money,\" Washington Times, February 10, 2008, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/02/10/opinion/10op.graphic.ready.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/02/10/opinion/10op.graphic.ready.html</url>.</p><p>n2 David Teece, \"Profiting from Technological Innovation: Implications for Integration, Collaboration, Licensing and Public Policy,\" School of Business Administration, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A., June 1986, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www4.lu.se/upload/CIRCLE/INN005/Teece_Reflections.pdf\">http://www4.lu.se/upload/CIRCLE/INN005/Teece_Reflections.pdf</url>.</p><p>n3 Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.

You'd buy ads seen mostly by people who didn't care what you were selling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In digital advertising, we aspire to not waste any money. Using powerful software and anonymous data, we try to limit advertising to the audience who cares about our ad's message. We experiment to find the conditions where being exposed to our ad makes a difference in what consumers decide to do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's been my job for 20 years: using technology to make advertising more productive, relevant and timely.</p><p>When the toughest part was convincing firms to reallocate budgets from traditional advertising to digital, Google was a great ally.</p><p>But as digital advertising matured into distinct markets for search, display and social, Google changed. The company lagged behind the pace of innovation in display. Google was not a key player in the invention of ad exchanges - the most important development in digital since 2010.</p><p>The ability to be precisely effective in display depends on ad exchanges. Exchanges allow ad buyers and sellers to connect virtually and make the best deals for each of us, without friction, a million times per second. Display auctions occur as you load a webpage. It's because of exchange transactions that any creator can monetize the attention he earns, and any business can maximize the impact of its ad dollars.</p><p>The ad exchange ecosystem thrived as long as its participants were mutually interested in a level playing field. We agreed it's best to interoperate with competitors on fair and equal terms, so that customers can mix-and-match products at will and the best ideas win. The display exchange ecosystem is nicknamed \"the open web\" because it's a free market.</p><p>A company has to be very confident about what it brings to operate in this mode - it's like owning a stall in a vast open-air market. Customers can easily compare your features, quality and price with those of other sellers within easy reach.</p><p>Though it wasn't clear at the time, antitrust investigations have produced clues of Google's strategy for ad exchanges. It seems Google saw the market efficiency of exchanges as a threat to Google's primary business: selling ads. The ad exchanges were set up to be agnostic brokers, just like stock exchanges.</p><p>In 2010, discussing Google's potential development of an exchange buying platform (or \"bidder\"), the executive in charge of its display business wrote in an internal email: \"The primary benefits on having a bidder are eliminating the disintermediation risk and substantially increasing display spend with Google from agencies (through the combined use of DFA - bidder - AdX).\" n1</p><p>DFA refers to Google's ad server; AdX was Google's exchange. Google's plan was to combine products so that what appears to be an agnostic exchange can resolve any conflicts of interest in Google's favor. Google planned to make its exchange like a shady stockbroker who steers every client to the assets his employer pays him to sell. It would use its market power in several nodes of the ecosystem to discourage comparison shopping against best-in-class point solutions. For example, a great new bidder is less enticing if your current bidder is tied to your ad server, which has almost no competition.</p><p>Display innovation abounded in the period 2010-2016, expanding on the theme of privacy-compliant, interoperable exchange transactions. By consistently adopting the latest and greatest tools, buyers found we could make display advertising more effective, per dollar, every year. We watched adtech conventions grow from dozens to thousands of startups.</p><p>Google never caught up. Instead, it leveraged market power to slow the pace of innovation in display and make exchange buying less attractive to advertisers. Google did this by expanding from the set of exclusive product integrations referred to in that 2010 email to a web of ties extensive enough to entangle the whole marketplace.</p><p>In 2016, Google combined search and display data, breaking a promise made to American regulators. Google also broke the industry's privacy standard by linking consumers' names, from Gmail, to the ID numbers assigned to browsers for exchange transactions. n2</p><p>Continuously, from 2016, Google came up with new ways to pollute the exchange ecosystem they'd previously seemed to embrace. Pollution came in the form of restrictions and exclusions that made the open web less efficient for buyers and sellers.</p><p>Google took YouTube, Google's most valuable display property, off the exchanges, while making it available through an exclusive \"pipe\" from Google's exchange bidder. Google excluded data providers from its websites and measurement partners from its platforms. Google's selling platform denied publishers' demand for a unified, exchange-vs-exchange action. To keep publishers from getting rid of Google's software, Google funnels exclusive display demand from its search platform through it. Google weaponized new privacy laws to restrict advertisers' and publishers' access to their own ad data in Google tools.</p><p>Google tightened ties among its products until the shady broker was no longer one among a set of competitors: Google became the only display company not hobbled by the exclusions and restrictions it'd placed on everyone else. The power to interoperate among buy-side, sell-side and measurement software went from being a feature of the exchange ecosystem to a capability exclusive to Google.</p><p>Now, progress on innovation is squeezed to the margins of the industry, and new adtech is rare. The majority of advertisers have stagnated or regressed.</p><p>There's more at stake than most people realize. The more efficient the ad market, the more likely it is that superior new products will find customers and thrive. When the ad exchanges function properly, the size advantage from flooding the airwaves is offset by quieter voices speaking directly to whoever's most open to any given improvement. It tilts the incentives of every business toward innovation.</p><p>Google is dominating display by breaking interoperability and subtracting the efficiencies of a symmetrical market. Pre-2016, under intense competitive pressure, ad exchanges were becoming more transparent and privacy-respectful as the ecosystem grew. Google could have coped with these developments without using its market power destructively: There was nothing to stop Google from exiting the arena or competing within its open standards. Whether or not Google competes with other big tech firms is irrelevant to the harms they've caused publishers, measurement companies, platforms and small businesses like mine in the ~$50B open web display market.</p><p>It was efficient when publishers, platforms, measurement tools and service providers all interoperated. Innovators of a great new product or service could access a global marketplace of thousands of buyers and sellers quickly at low cost. Small businesses with great ideas had a shorter ramp to success.</p><p>Now, funding for new adtech startups has been drying up and the pace of innovation slowed down. The number-one concern I hear from potential investors is Google's domination of the market my company operates in. For years, they've been breaking existing efficiencies and preventing the development of new ones.</p><p>Many expect Google to successfully mislead regulators about its conduct in the open web, and its harmful effects. I'm grateful for the opportunity to help scrutinize Google's claims. For the sake of competition, the innovation competition drives and the benefits innovation brings, Google should be forced to either exit the ad exchange market or compete within its open standards.</p><p>n1 <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/466453.pdf\">https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/466453.pdf</url> Email from Neil Mohan.</p><p>n2 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking\">https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking</url></p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/heimlich-testimonyanddownload=1\">https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/heimlich-testimonyanddownload=1</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSC91500664</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VH-YRK1-JCCP-03MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1373\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

We work to promote the integrity and availability of the global internet and are engaged on issues in the states, in Washington, and in international internet governance organizations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Introduction</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Launched in 1996 and originally christened BackRub, Google got its start when two Stanford computer science whiz kids with a knack for programming had an idea for a new search engine. n2 Two years, countless sleepless nights, and a (wise) name change later, Google incorporated and opened its headquarters in--where else?--a spare garage in Silicon Valley. n3</p><p>Few in Silicon Valley thought they'd succeed. At the time, most believed that Yahoo was so dominant in search that no one could challenge it. Fortune Magazine summed it up this way in an article titled How Yahoo! Won the Search Wars: \"Once upon a time, Yahoo! was an Internet search site with mediocre technology. Now it has a market cap of $2.8 billion. Some people say it's the next America Online.\" n4 These days we look back at former giants Yahoo and AOL and know that their dominance was anything but.</p><p>We also know that Google's gamble paid off. Today, the company works out of offices located across the United States and on every continent. It processes around 40,000 search requests per second, 3.5 billion per day, and 1.2 trillion per year. n5 And just a few months ago, it became the fourth-ever company to reach a $1 trillion market valuation, joining the ranks of competitors Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Not bad for a startup that Yahoo! once passed over and venture capitalists laughed at.</p><p>But this success was never guaranteed, and as the history of the tech industry amply demonstrates, never will be. Only with an obsessive focus on product quality and sound business decisions has Google been able to achieve its current position. And only through constant innovation that delivers ever-better benefits to American consumers will Google avoid becoming the next Ask Jeeves, Ask.com, Yahoo!, AltaVista, Lycos, or MSN Search.</p><p>Among the many Google products and services that consumers love are Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Google Drive--all amazingly useful, and all free. To many critics of \"Big Tech,\" however, when consumers enthusiastically choose these free-of-charge products, it amounts to proof that something must be wrong. Every successful new service or product that proves a winner with consumers is deemed by these critics to be just another antitrust violation. n6</p><p>But Google's greatest successes are being won in markets with the greatest competition. In the digital ads market, for example, Google faces fierce competitive pressure. You would never know that listening to the critics.</p><p>For starters, Google is no monopoly. It's wildly popular with consumers, yes. And true, it's also very popular with investors. But the company faces competition from all corners, including from other tech platforms such as Facebook and Amazon (which are simultaneously and thus illogically also dubbed monopolies).</p><p>Far from being evidence of any unlawful conduct, Google's success under these conditions offers abundant proof that it is meeting and exceeding the fundamental test that has been the bedrock of antitrust law for the last 40 decades: are consumers benefitting? There can be little doubt on this point, for Google's users vote daily with their choices. In order to dismiss this as irrelevant, the critics are now arguing that antitrust enforcement should simply abandon the consumer welfare standard, enabling them to attack \"bigness\" per se. This would undermine the very purpose of antitrust law since its inception more than a century ago.</p><p>When Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890, it enshrined in law the country's \"national values of free enterprise and economic competition.\" n7 Back then, Congress sought to stem the \"seemingly endless combinations and consolidations of industries\" that led to the \"great trusts of the day--the Standard Oils.\" n8 And even then, President Teddy Roosevelt--an aggressive \"trust buster\"-- worried that attempts to break up of Standard Oil through slow-moving antitrust cases in the courts might, in the end, succeed only in robbing consumers of efficiencies in the form of high quality and lower costs that they presently enjoyed. Roosevelt lamented, \"I do not see what good can come from dissolving the Standard Oil Company into 40 separate companies.\" n9</p><p>In his biography of T.R., Ron Chernow captured the 26th president's conflicting instincts about the most effective way to limit monopoly abuses while preserving consumer benefits. \"Roosevelt,\" he said, \"was genuinely reluctant to wield the big stick against Standard Oil.... He wanted to supervise the trusts, not break them up and sacrifice their efficiency.\" n10</p><p>But in 1906 the Roosevelt administration did sue Standard Oil under the Sherman Act. It would take five years before the company was ordered to divest itself of its major holdings-- 33 companies in all. For decades afterward, as both the executive branch and the Supreme Court struggled to arrive at a principled basis for sorting procompetitive business actions from anticompetitive ones, the default condition was the one today's critics would resurrect--that big must be bad. n11</p><p>As former Federal Trade Commissioner Joshua Wright put it, \"[t]he result of this approach was that consumers were made worse off by preventing the very competition from which they would benefit and which the competition laws were supposed to promote.\" n12 Instead of producing consumer benefits, antitrust enforcement based on size frequently led to higher prices and fewer goods, damaging consumers. n13 And, Commissioner Wright added, \"preserving inefficient firms with higher prices and lower output,\" which was the result of such antitrust enforcement, had the perverse effect of favoring \"corporate welfare over consumer welfare.\" n14</p><p>By the 1970s, a decade marked by increasing global competition and sluggish U.S. economic growth, leading antitrust scholars and economists sensed the urgency of rationalizing the purposes and methods of enforcement policy. Under the leadership of economist Alfred Kahn, the Carter administration launched a major regulatory reform initiative focusing administration policies on consumer welfare. The result was to bring competition to industries across the U.S. economy including railroads, airlines, and trucking. This turn toward consumer welfare was supported by antitrust experts across the ideological spectrum, n15 who recognized that by attacking large companies regardless of the impact on consumer welfare, antitrust enforcement had produced legal uncertainty that deterred firms from innovating, boosting productivity, and offering consumers better products and services at a lower cost.</p><p>The replacement of antitrust-by-gut-instinct with the consumer welfare standard that took place nearly a half century ago enjoys broad, bipartisan support still today. n16 It is buttressed now by the empirical evidence of two generations of enforcement policy and case law. But as the critics' attacks on Google demonstrate, that support isn't universal. While these critics are not in the main antitrust experts, it is easy to find political pundits on both the left and right who unite in their agreement that American tech companies are just too big.</p><p>Antitrust enforcement is an extraordinary remedy for an extraordinary problem. The Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights thus deserves praise for providing this \"forum to assess the most important antitrust investigation of the 21st century.\" n17 Today's hearing provides a good opportunity for Congress to dig deep into the consumer welfare standard's continued relevance and success. Using Google's advertising business as an example, I expect lawmakers will see firsthand both the benefits of the current antitrust approach and the pitfalls of upending it, which would turn back the clock to days when \"big\" meant \"guilty until proven innocent.\"</p><p>To help in that effort, NetChoice prepared this testimony. The first part imagines a hypothetical question-and-answer session about Google and the digital advertising market. This is meant to give a broad, bird's-eye view of market realities. The second part is a deep dive into Google's business model, the search engine market, the digital ads market, and business practices that touch on all three.</p><p>At bottom, this testimony makes clear that Google is no monopoly, that its business decisions are not only lawful but benefit consumers immensely, and that the consumer welfare standard works and should be retained.</p><p>Part I. QandA</p><p>1. Some say that Google controls 90% of the market. Doesn't that prove it's a monopoly?</p><p>Before determining a company's market share, the relevant market must be defined. Google's critics try to inflate its market share by narrowing the relevant market. According to them, digital advertising breaks down into (1) search ads, (2) video ads, and (3) display ads. Under this definition, they contend that Google has a market share in the search ads market. That number is of little use to antitrust analysis as the standard tells us we must look at how consumers use a product. By defining the market so narrowly, critics not only miss the forest for the trees but also fail to follow the rules laid out for antitrust analysis.</p><p>That is so because at its core Google competes in the \"attention market.\" Put simply, Google attracts users--and their eyeballs--by developing great products that it then provides to consumers for free. When consumers use those products, they may see search ads on Google Search, video ads on YouTube, or personalized ads on third-party websites such as NYTimes.com. So every minute a user spends elsewhere--on Netflix, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, etc.--is a minute Google loses to a competitor who also sells digital ads and thus competes for a user's attention.</p><p>Because digital ads boil down to getting ads before a user, the relevant market must at least include all online platforms that operate to do just that. Viewed this way, Google's market share is a modest 29%. In other words, it's nowhere close to being a monopoly, which the Supreme Court informally defines as having at least 75% market share and the DOJ defines as above 66%.</p><p>Defining the relevant market, especially when it comes to tech companies, involves looking backward in time to make decisions about the future. This job is hard to begin with, but it's even harder in digital markets where innovation routinely disrupts markets and creates new \"hybrid\" ones. Consider Walmart, for example: Is it merely the largest retailer in the US n18 with an online retailer that sells directly to consumers? Or is it a marketplace that connects buyers and third-party sellers? n19 Or is it a marketplace that also serves as a search engine for the \"100 million unique Walmart.com visitors each month\" looking for products and read reviews? n20 As it turns out, it's both. Indeed, thousands of Americans begin their product searches on the platform. Walmart also sells digital ads on its platform, which makes it a direct competitor to Google. n21</p><p>2. But if market definition is easily manipulated, isn't that a strike against the consumer welfare standard and claims that it's superior because it's objective?</p><p>No, it's a strike against those who seek to reverse engineer the consumer welfare model to yield their preferred results. While market definition is difficult and there is scholarly debate about its application, it remains essential to determining market share and the opportunity a company has to exploit market power.</p><p>Digital ads are a good example of how the consumer welfare standard helps get us to the best possible answer about market definition and market share. Because the standard tells us to look at how consumers use a product, we know right off the bat that the market can't just be digital search ads. That is because advertisers--the main purchasers of digital ads-- use search ads interchangeably with other forms of advertising, including digital display ads.</p><p>In addition, advertisers are increasingly using digital ads as a replacement for traditional ads, including those that run on television. If these competitors are considered part of the relevant market, Google's market share is even lower than 28%, because it directly competes with cable television, newspapers, and other media for these advertising revenues.</p><p>Without the objective consumer welfare standard, the government could simply define the relevant market in any way it likes. That would make it impossible for companies to comply with the law, because they could not know in advance the standard to which they must conform their conduct. Instead, businesses would be left to wonder whether doing \"x\" will irritate the government enough to bring about enforcement even though, objectively, consumers and competition are benefitting from \"x.\"</p><p>3. Google is one of the few digital ads providers that operate across the entire advertising spectrum. Isn't that cause for concern?</p><p>Google has developed a complete suite of ad products, each of which competes against different companies and different competitive products. It offers services for buyers (placing ads), sellers (selling space), an auction system (matching the two), and it offers its tools to help advertisers place ads on Google's platforms. These distinct and varied product offerings compete with hundreds of companies, including such heavyweights as Adobe, ATandT, Comcast, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Snap, Verizon, and Oracle.</p><p>The result of this vibrant competition shows that rather than cause for concern, it is a boon to consumers. Digital ad prices are down 40% since 2010, output is up significantly, and quality has never been better.</p><p>Moreover, advertisers and publishers engage in multihoming - simultaneously using multiple Demand Side Platform (DSP) and more than Sale Side Platform (SSP). On average, advertisers use 4.2 DSP n22 and publishers average 5.7. n23 For example, the LATimes.com uses twelve DSPs for display ads alone. n24</p><p>Finally, just because a business is vertically integrated is no reason to bring an antitrust action. If that were so, Starbucks would be inherently anticompetitive, because it sources and prepares its own beans. n25</p><p>4. You say Google benefits consumers--can you elaborate?</p><p>Google Search and YouTube are multisided platforms. That means that Google plays matchmaker among many participants operating in different facets of the same market.</p><p>For example, it links users with advertisers, and it links advertisers with publishers. To meet the needs of each of these different customers, Google must keep its platforms attractive to consumers. Attracting consumers is necessary both to attract advertisers and keep its services free for consumers requires keeping advertisers interested.</p><p>Google has benefitted all these groups. With digital ads prices down 40% since 2010, advertisers are getting more bang for their buck. Publishers are earning money from digital ads without having to invest in developing and maintaining the intricate technology that makes it all happen. Thanks to its advertising revenue, Google can keep its services free. And that, in turn, has put competitive pressure on the likes of Microsoft, which responded by cutting prices on its Office products after Google released its suite of office products for free.</p><p>In sum, Google's ad business, in conjunction with its innovative ecosystem of free consumer products, has produced enormous benefits for consumers.</p><p>5. But isn't Google the reason newspapers went out of business and publishers are hurting?</p><p>On the contrary, Google is helping newspapers transition to the new Information Economy. Consider the New York Times. It currently uses Google's ad tech to sell display ads, and with web traffic higher than ever before, its website is valuable real estate for advertisers. Thanks to Google, the Times can capitalize on that asset. And because it has seen just how profitable digital ads are, the Times has announced that it'll be creating its own ad tech-- thus competing with Google.</p><p>Although many critics would like to blame \"Big Tech,\" the truth is that for decades the internet itself has presented a challenge for print newspapers and publishers, who have struggled to adapt their pre-internet business models to the prevailing consumer reality.</p><p>For centuries, print newspapers relied on advertising and classified ads for the major portion of their revenue. Because newspapers were the main source of local information and in wide circulation, advertisers of all shapes and sizes bought ads. n26 But when consumers in the United States began to go online, newspapers suddenly faced a changed landscape.</p><p>Indeed, even before digital advertising developed in the mid-2000s and grew in the latter half of the decade, newspapers struggled, in part because the advent of 24/7 television and radio news rendered their product stale. Americans simply weren't buying as many print newspapers anymore. With the advent of instantaneous worldwide communication via the internet and online classified ads, the newspapers' model of delivering the news the following day and monopolizing classified advertising took an even harder hit. And because consumers could no longer be counted on to wait for the printed word to arrive at their doorstep the next weekday or the next Sunday, traditional display ad revenue fell.</p><p>6. But doesn't Google's acquisition of YouTube show anticompetitive behavior?</p><p>Google's acquisition of YouTube has benefited users and advertisers alike. It is emblematic of Google's business strategy. Consider how it unfolded.</p><p>Animated by a desire to \"prevent staleness,\" and not to become \"our father's Oldsmobile,\" Google has long sought to stay ahead of the curve. So much so that as far back as 2006 it predicted that \"social networking sites will ultimately represent a threat to our search business as people will spend more time on those sites and ultimately may do most searches from the search boxes available there.\" n27</p><p>Time would later prove Google right. But instead of falling victim to changing market dynamics, Google made three wise decisions that enabled it to compete. First, it entered the social media market by acquiring one of the several participants in that space, YouTube. Second, it committed to a policy of continuously developing consumer-friendly innovations to enhance Google Search. And third, it built out its ad tech services, connecting its social media, search, and advertising products.</p><p>Google's acquisition of YouTube in 2006 came after much internal strategizing. Their market analysis convinced them of social media's potential to transform how people spent their time online, in turn making entertainment sites likely places from which consumers would want to conduct online searches. This highlighted the value of \"own[ing] the search box on the entertainment sites\" n28--an opportunity for all of their social media competitors, and something Google itself needed to pursue. Among possible acquisition candidates, YouTube was particularly attractive because of its \"smart team\" and its \"platform [that Google] could build from.\" n29</p><p>Without Google's participation in the social media marketplace through its acquisition and subsequent development of YouTube over the last 14 years, there would be less competition, fewer offerings to consumers, diminished consumer choice, and higher prices for lower quality services.</p><p>7. But surely Google's other business practices--such as displaying publisher information directly on its search results page--are anticompetitive, right?</p><p>Search engines used to display results by displaying each publisher's URL below the branded result. By displaying the URL on top of the branded result, consumers could more easily see where the information is coming from. Giving the URL top billing means that users will naturally look there first, making it easier for them to determine whether the particular search result is a reputable site. These enhancements that add to consumer value are the result of the company's ongoing commitment to research and development. Its annual RandD spending is nearly $30 billion--reflective of a commitment to constant product improvement rather than the cheaper shortcut of anticompetitive practices.</p><p>Google has enhanced the consumer experience and the value to consumers from its various search services in other, similar ways as well. For example, it has introduced what it calls \"Universal Search,\" which integrates search results from a variety of different media sources (links, video, photos) and services including Google Maps and Google Flights.</p><p>Integrating YouTube videos with Google Search has enabled consumers to see relevant videos in their search results as links on the search engine's main page and under its \"Videos\" tab as well. No longer do consumers have to visit multiple websites to find what they're looking for.</p><p>Many of Google's rivals have pursued similar pro-consumer strategies to improve their offerings. Microsoft's Bing, as Google itself has noted, \"has explicitly made improving verticals a key part of [its] strategy to beat Google.\" n30 To do that, Microsoft began to offer consumers \"cashback (shopping), purchased Farecast (flights), partnered with Wikipedia (reference), Wolfram (calculations and facts), and built vertices for events and recipes.\" n31</p><p>This constant product improvement is necessary to compete in search because even many niche search engines that compete with Google are provided by large companies with significant resources. These include Walmart, which offers extensive search capabilities for shopping; Yelp, which provides search results for local goods and services; Kayak, which delivers comprehensive search information on flights; and a host of other specialty search providers such as Hotels.com, AllRecipes, and Edmunds that provide specially tailored search services for items ranging from lodging and cooking to car buying, and virtually every other consumer need.</p><p>8. There's one group, though, that hasn't benefitted: conservatives. How do you explain Google's censoring of them?</p><p>The oft-heard complaint from the critics is that Google has \"censored\" news and political commentary from a conservative perspective. This inaccurate criticism is based on a kernel of truth: Google does moderate content, including removing or limiting it when warranted by its community standards. But these standards are applied across the board, and empirically, have resulted in far more politically progressive content being limited and removed.</p><p>At the same time, conservatives have benefitted immensely from Google's products and free services. By offering conservative voices an enormous audience free of charge, YouTube has enabled them to bypass traditional TV, radio, and publishing to get their message out. Even better, YouTube lets conservatives monetize those messages. Prager University, for example, boasts over four billion YouTube views and earns considerable revenue from that. n32 ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, and other traditional media, including print, offer nothing like these opportunities to PragerU and other politically conservative voices.</p><p>Conservative content routinely makes up the majority of the most popular channels on YouTube. And unlike the traditional media, YouTube streamed the Republican National Convention in full, without commercial interruption.</p><p>Critics maintain that Google shouldn't do any moderating--all content should be allowed. That's neither realistic nor desirable. To use but one obvious example, in demanding that Google follow the First Amendment, critics are saying that Google should allow pornography on its site. Beyond that, Google's advertisers are very conscious of the context in which their brands appear. They won't pay to be featured alongside offensive, crude, or violent content, even if it is protected by the First Amendment. And without advertising revenue, Google could no longer offer its services including YouTube to conservatives and all others for free.</p><p>9. But what about Google Search--doesn't it suppress conservative news and amplify news critical of the president and Republican Party?</p><p>Google Search's algorithms aren't perfect--that's why the company makes an average of 1,000 tweaks every few years. But neither are they biased against conservatives.</p><p>The technology is complex, but the concept is simple: Google Search continuously crawls the internet's two billion pages to create an ever-changing, constantly updated index of the world's online content. When a user enters a search query, Google retrieves relevant results based on that index.</p><p>Once retrieved, the information is ranked based on about 200 factors. One factor is authoritativeness, determined by a site's popularity (as measured by clicks) and the number of other pages that link to that site. That may seem circular--after all, if Google helps connect users to websites, it plays a role in determining which websites get clicks. But that's true only to a small extent. What matters most is the search phrase. So, if many Americans are searching for and reading negative stories about a topic, general searches about that topic will increasingly rank those stories higher because they are the most widely read.</p><p>It's also true that many news websites with the highest viewership, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC, produce a disproportionate share of digital articles critical of conservatives and their policies. Here's an example of how this affects Google's search results: When Republicans cut tax rates for middle and low-income Americans in 2017, progressives nonetheless criticized the legislation because it also cut tax rates for higher earners. This produced a rash of stories that were critical of the tax cut. So, as Google users searched using a neutral term such as \"tax cut,\" they increasingly saw the negative stories higher up. n33</p><p>This understandably irks Republicans, but the alternative would have Google explicitly giving positive stories about conservative policies a boost. This \"affirmative action\" of sorts would force Google to make explicit political decisions--something no one wants--by singling out conservative sources for especially favorable treatment.</p><p>And to be clear, the algorithms turn up unflattering links about everything--including Google itself. One would assume that, if Google really were biasing its algorithms, it would do a better job suppressing stories critical of it. And yet here are the top results, based on several variations of the same search request. Each shows links to negative stories about Google.</p><p>Part II. Deep Dive into Tech Market Realities</p><p>What's Past is Prologue: The Gut Instinct of Big-is-Bad</p><p>Antitrust laws in the United States are meant to promote consumer benefits through competitive markets. n34 Businesses that have to compete will usually cut prices and/or improve the quality of their products or services. n35 As the Supreme Court stated in 2019, \"'protecting consumers from monopoly prices' has been 'the central concern of antitrust.'\" n36 Antitrust laws, the court added, also \"stimulate businesses to find new, innovative, and more efficient methods of production,\" which also benefits consumers. n37</p><p>But for much of our history, antitrust relied on \"confused doctrines that pursued populist notions\"--most particularly, the idea that the size of business was all that mattered, regardless of whether consumers benefitted or were injured. n38 As a result, the government's enforcement decisions often \"led to contradictory results,\" by seeking to \"advance a variety of social and political goals, but doing so at the expense of American consumers.\" n39 In the Sherman Act's first decade, for example, the Supreme Court held that the law was meant to protect \"small dealers and worthy men.\" n40 Decades later, the Court reaffirmed that interpretation, holding that antitrust law is meant to protect \"viable, small, locally owned business\" even when that protection means \"higher costs and prices.\" n41</p><p>By the 1970s, this confusion had dissipated, as antitrust experts including economists, academics, and practicing lawyers reached a general consensus that ever since has anchored antitrust analysis in consumer welfare. n42 This achievement made the United States the first country to root antitrust analysis in economics. n43 Under the consumer welfare standard, economic evidence is analyzed to assess whether a business's actions benefit or harm consumers. n44 Economists, antitrust scholars, n45 and U.S. courts n46 agree that the consumer welfare standard has succeeded in protecting consumers. That success came only once the government replaced the old model of antitrust analysis based merely on the size of an enterprise with the more logically rigorous approach of determining anticompetitive harm to consumers through objective economic analysis. n47</p><p>Ironically, given the success of this approach, today's critics of \"Big Tech\" have mounted an attack on the consumer welfare standard that is the basis of modern antitrust law. Just as in the early 20th century, generalized concerns about such social ills as corporate power, income inequality, and wage stagnation have sparked calls to \"solve\" these problems by reviving the discredited antitrust theory of \"big is bad,\" n48 in place of the consumer welfare standard.</p><p>The critics can point to Europe, where antitrust enforcement focuses far less on economic analysis than the United States does. n49 But such a move would be a major departure and a dangerous change for our nation. There is a reason Europe has no companies on the list of the top 10 tech companies in the world. Indeed, Europe has only one--Spotify--in the top 30. The United States, by contrast, leads the world in technology. Should we follow Europe's lead, only Chinese competitors like Alibaba will benefit. American consumers, by contrast, will suffer.</p><p>The European Union's experience with antitrust enforcement should serve as a cautionary tale for America. The E.U.'s main antitrust law, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), is designed \"to prevent competition from being distorted to the detriment of the public interest, individual undertakings and consumers.\" n50 By leaving it to the discretion of the courts to determine what is in \"the public interest,\" Europeans have made their standard of antitrust enforcement entirely subjective. Free to choose their own notions of what is fair, and unbounded by any rigorous economic analysis that is the sine qua non of U.S. antitrust analysis, E.U. courts have produced a smorgasbord of results, the net effect of which has been the diminution of competition, higher prices, and reduced benefits for consumers.</p><p>As explained in detail below, that's not necessary. The consumer welfare standard works well and Google's advertising business shows that.</p><p>Starting Point: Understanding Google's Business Model</p><p>Like any for-profit business, Google must make a profit. But unlike traditional for-profit businesses, Google's most famous and popular product--Google Search--is given free of charge to its users. To understand Google, therefore, it helps first to understand its unique business model and the incentive structure within which it operates in the marketplace.</p><p>Google Search is currently the most popular search engine, but because it is free, that popularity does not provide the company with any revenue, let alone profit. As with free over-the-air television, revenue comes not from viewers or users but advertising. In 2018, advertising amounted to 84% of revenues for Alphabet, Google's parent company. n51</p><p>The willingness of advertisers to pay for digital ads on Google's site is directly connected to its popularity. No one would pay to advertise on billboards dotting a rarely used road. But people would--and do--pay millions for a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl. Google's popularity thus drives its advertising revenue, and it is strongly incentivized to provide consumers with the highest-quality products and services, even though they are free.</p><p>But Google Search is only as useful to consumers as the websites that it displays to them in the form of search results. Google may build the world's best search algorithm, but if the content responsive to consumer search requests isn't itself relevant or useful, then those consumers will find using Google Search to be less useful. That means Google also has a strong incentive to see to it that publishers--those who create the wide variety of news, entertainment, research, educational material, and commentary that is published on the internet--flourish.</p><p>The relationship between Google and web publishers is largely symbiotic. Many of these publishers rely on advertising as a principal source of revenue. When their advertising revenue rises, the publishers flourish. Flourishing publishers that are in financial good health produce higher quality content. And when publishers produce higher quality content that benefits consumers, more people have reason to use Google Search.</p><p>While Google understands and lives by this market reality, many of its critics seem to believe that Google is motivated to run publishers into the ground by extracting as much money from them as possible. Common sense suggests this cannot be so: when publishers fail, Google Search suffers. And what common sense suggests, evidence confirms. As explained below, although many publishers use Google's advertising tools, they typically also use from four to six other companies' advertising tools.</p><p>In sum: Google invests heavily in its search engine so that consumers find it even more useful. Google does this not only because Google Search is the company's lifeblood, but because failing to do so would yield ground to competitors ranging from Microsoft's Bing to DuckDuckGo to Amazon and Yelp. (Google also faces competition in voice search-- Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana all compete with Google's Voice Search.) Google also invests heavily in its advertising tools and products because it relies on advertising for revenue, as do many of its rivals in the marketplace including Amazon, Facebook, and Bing.</p><p>In the world of online business, the position of any market leader is precarious, as history has shown. That is why Google continues to innovate, invest, and improve. It does not rest on its laurels or cut corners as a monopolist would. If Google did that, rather than continuously improving, it would quickly become the next MySpace.</p><p>Instead, Google is successful--for now--because it makes smart business decisions that benefit consumers.</p><p>About Display Advertising and Ad Tech</p><p>Digital advertising is a large and diverse industry that encompasses everything from search ads (ads shown on search engines), to video ads (those that you might see before, say, watching a video on YouTube), to display ads (those you might see while reading an article on NYTimes.com or while scrolling through Instagram).</p><p>Below is a screenshot of a typical display ad that I noticed while reading a Times article about the power of technology to help vulnerable Americans during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>\"Ad tech\" is the colloquial term for the software that facilitates buying, selling, and displaying these ads. As discussed later in this paper, the ad tech industry is competitive. For example, Google faces competition not only from well-known companies such as Oracle, Comcast, Adobe, Facebook, and Amazon, but also from competitors that may be unfamiliar such as The Trade Desk and Rubicon Project. Some of these companies focus solely on the demand side (buyers); others focus on the supply side (sellers); and others, like Google, do a little of both.</p><p>The fact that there is so much competition in this market has benefitted both consumers (those buying and running ads) and the public generally. The robust competition has resulted in lower prices for advertisers. And it has enabled many websites to continue to offer their content for free--especially content providers with small audiences who may struggle to attract paid subscribers, as well as news and opinion websites such as Vox.com, MotherJones.com, and NationalReview.com.</p><p>Google Search is No Monopoly</p><p>Although Google Search is highly popular, it is not a monopoly--actually, virtually, or otherwise. To be sure, Google leads the pack in its sheer number of searches and users. In the United States, Google boasts 62.5% market share of all core searches. n52 But Microsoft's search engine, Bing, launched in 2009, already has 24.7% market share today. n53 And Verizon Media, which bought Yahoo's and AOL's search engines in 2017 and 2019, respectively, has 11.5%. n54 Given this, Google Search cannot, by definition, be a monopoly as that term is understood in antitrust law.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently defined monopoly power as \"the power to control prices or exclude competition.\" n55 The price that Google charges for its search service is zero--no high-price umbrella sustained by monopoly practices here--while at the same time, it faces considerable competition. Even setting aside formal definitions, Google Search has none of the trappings of a monopoly. One of the tell-tale signs indicating that a company is relying on its market control--and not its product quality--to gain or maintain market share is that it decides to cut its investment even in good times. Economists tell us that monopolists often spend little to no money on innovation because there is no need to improve products and services once the market is consolidated. (Think of the electric power industry, a classic monopoly. When was the last time we heard of an innovation from PGandE?)</p><p>An independent evaluation by PwC found that Google spends more on research and development than every other company in America save one--Amazon, its main competitor. n56 Last year, Google spent $26 billion on research and development. Two years ago, it undertook over 650,000 experiments to improve its Search Engine. n57 Every year, as a result of this RandD, Google makes an average of 1,000 improvements to its Search Engine. n58 If Google Search were a monopoly, Google could worry a lot less about maintaining its market leadership, and it could spend a lot less on improving its flagship product.</p><p>Google Search faces considerable competitive pressure on multiple fronts. When people want to know specific information about specific things, they frequently turn to competitors that specialize in that particular field. Google faces competition from Expedia, Kayak, Orbitz, and Travelocity on travel-related searches. And it faces competition from Yelp, Angie's List, UrbanSpoon, and TripAdvisor on searches related to local restaurants and vendors. The competition in this space is so great, in fact, that even Yelp, one of Google's most vocal critics, said just last year that \"[w]e compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and we expect competition to intensify further in the future with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants.\" n59</p><p>DuckDuckGo, a rival search engine launched in 2008, promises every user that it will let them \"take back your privacy!\" n60 Contrasting its data-privacy protections with Google's protections, n61 DuckDuckGo has seen its market share grow every year since its founding. In 2010, DuckDuckGo hosted 16.4 million searches during the entire year. In April 2020, it hosted 1.8 billion searches. n62 Its most explosive growth has occurred in the last two years. Since 2018, DuckDuckGo's daily search queries have more than doubled. n63 With nearly 97% of people reporting that they are somewhat or very concerned about protecting their personal data, n64 competition on this basis can be expected to be intense.</p><p>Facebook, with its over 2.4 billion users, has announced plans to invest in building out and expanding its own search platform. According to the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, \"Facebook is uniquely positioned to answer questions that people have, like, 'What sushi restaurants have my friends gone to in New York lately and really liked?' \" These are queries that Facebook is uniquely positioned to answer. As Zuckerberg sees it, \"you couldn't do [such searches] with anything else; we just have to do it.\" n65 Facebook's entry into the search market is yet another formidable competitive challenge for Google and a further illustration of the truism that no market leader in the field of technology is ever secure.</p><p>The Google Ad Stack Isn't a Monopoly</p><p>Google is not a monopoly in the ad tech market. On the contrary, it competes against hundreds, if not thousands, of other ad tech companies, including many profitable ones. n66 These competitors include Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter, as well as other household names such as Adobe, Oracle, Verizon, Comcast, and ATandT, and less well-known companies such as The Trade Desk and Rubicon Project.</p><p>According to the principles of antitrust law, a monopolist has the power either to exclude competitors from the market or to raise prices above what the market would otherwise dictate. n67 Manifestly, Google has not excluded competitors from the market. As for prices, since Google's entrance into the ad tech market, prices have dropped by 40%. n68 In fact, prices have dropped so much that advertising expenditures--as a percentage of GDP--have never been lower in U.S. history, even though digital advertising has never been more popular. n69</p><p>That the lucrative ad tech market is competitive comes as little surprise.</p><p>In 2019, the U.S. spent $124.6 billion on digital advertising--a 15.9% increase in just one year. n70 With so much money on the line, and with consistent revenue growth, the market has enticed new entrants including one of Google's major competitors, Amazon. Although Amazon entered the market a mere three years ago, it is already the number one demand-side ad tech provider. n71</p><p>And even Amazon's success is being tested: The Trade Desk, which analysts called the \"fastest-growing\" demand-side platform, saw a 1,000% increase in its stock value since it went public in 2015. n72 Meanwhile, Rubicon--which merged with Telaria in 2019--is now the largest independent supply-side platform in the world. n73</p><p>Meanwhile, Rubicon--which merged with Telaria in 2019--is now the largest independent supply-side platform in the world.73</p><p>Even established companies that operate their own ad tech have seen their revenues increase. Last year, for example, Pinterest reported a 62% year-over-year increase in its advertising revenue; Snapchat reported a 48% increase; and, Twitter reported 21%. n74</p><p>A simple hypothetical helps explain why the critics' narrow focus on digital search ads as the relevant market is wrong at best, and deceptive at worst.</p><p>Imagine you wanted to study the market for national coffee chains in the United States. You'd learn that Starbucks' market share is about 40% and that Dunkin' Donuts' is about 26%. n75 Now imagine you focus only on coffee chains in the United States that follow Fair Trade practices. Well, those numbers wouldn't change much because both companies have signed on to Fair Trade. But now imagine you narrow your focus even more and look only at coffee chains in the United States that follow Fair Trade practices for Americano coffee. Under this scenario, Starbucks' market share would approach 100% because Dunkin' does not sell Americano coffee, let alone Americano coffee that complies with Fair Trade practices.</p><p>Starbucks and Dunkin' compete against each other, which is reflected in the first and broadest scenario, and even in the second scenario. Yet the third scenario does not capture that. On the contrary, it leaves the impression that Starbucks is a monopolist. And maybe Starbucks does have a monopoly on Americano coffee that complies with Fair Trade. But that raises the question: So, what?</p><p>Put simply, antitrust analysis is like zooming in on a digital image: the more you zoom, the more distorted the picture becomes.</p><p>Even if the critics' distorted picture were correct--and it isn't--and even if Google were the dominant or only player in this artificially defined market--the fact remains that there is no consumer harm, but rather substantial benefits to consumers as a result of Google's participation in the digital ad market. As mentioned above, the overall market is growing, while Google's share is shrinking. The output of digital advertising has never been higher. Ad prices are down by 40%. Robust investment in innovation has continued uninterruptedly for over a decade. This includes new technology that allows ads to be placed on mobile apps and websites, as well as ads specific to social media.</p><p>Turning to publishers who buy ads, we see the same results: benefits, not harm, in the form of more effective advertisements that are better targeted to their audiences, delivered at lower prices than ever before.</p><p>Although display ads run on third-party websites, they often are not made by those websites. In that sense, these ads are just like those in a printed copy of a newspaper.</p><p>When websites run such ads, they are often called \"publishers,\" just as a newspaper is called a publisher. These websites are the advertisers we refer to when we use the term \"publisher\" in the digital advertising context.</p><p>Publishers--both digital and print--use the ad revenue they receive for placing display ads to support their businesses. But digital display ads are different from printed ads in an important respect. They are far better at targeting their intended audiences.</p><p>In the past, advertisers had to rely on limited data in deciding where to place ads. They might know, for example, that the average reader of the New York Times is college-educated and has a disposable income above average. Based on this information, advertisers for Walmart may decide that their money is best spent elsewhere; advertisers for Whole Foods, however, may reach the opposite conclusion.</p><p>But with display ads, advertisers do not have to rely on such overbroad generalizations. Using tools like those provided by Google and many other companies, they can craft ads that appeal to specific consumers and then run those ads on websites those consumers are most likely to visit. To be sure, the ads (output) are only as good as their data (input). So, as some critics point out, tools that use a lot of data are often more valuable than tools that do not. n76 But what this really proves is that Google's tools are popular among publishers and other consumers precisely because their inputs and outputs are strong.</p><p>Even under the critics' framework, Google's services help publishers. In fact, publishers earn 68% of the revenue that Google itself earns from AdSense whenever those ads are placed on the publishers' websites. n77 Publishers also profit from Google's ad services that allow them to monetize their own websites and apps. The revenue this generates for publishers, in turn, supports their provision of free and diverse online content that everyone can then enjoy. All these benefits flow from the billions of dollars' worth of investment that Google makes year in and year out, resulting in products and services that are made available to publishers at little to no cost.</p><p>Advertisers benefit too. For a fraction of what they paid a decade ago, advertisers can now reach millions of more potential customers, and receive highly accurate, real-time information about which ads work and which do not, saving them even more ad dollars.</p><p>Google's Ad Tech Even Helps Competitors</p><p>Publishers who use Google's supply-side ad tools can sell to advertisers that use Google's competitors' tools. And advertisers can use Google's tools to buy ad space on ad exchanges that aren't run by Google, as well as on sites that do not use Google's services. In numerical terms, that means Google's tools give publishers access to demand from over 700 advertising platforms and give advertisers access to supply on more than 80 publisher platforms. n78</p><p>If Google were a monopolist, or if it were trying to stifle competition, providing all of this access to publishers would be counterproductive. However, Google's business model requires that it support a healthy publisher ecosystem, from which publishers and Google itself all benefit.</p><p>Looking for Help and Expertise: Google's Ad Acquisitions</p><p>Google's founders--the computer science whiz kids at Stanford--were experts in programming, not digital advertising. When it became clear that advertising revenue would be the company's main source of income, Google's entry into this new market included targeted acquisitions that allowed it to import outside help to develop and improve its ad services. In all, beginning in 2007, Google acquired nine digital advertising companies. n79 Bringing digital advertising in house had three benefits. First, Google maximized efficiencies. Second, it ensured quality control. And third, it ensured that all the facets of its business worked together.</p><p>Some former Justice Department officials have sought to portray these common-sense investments as something nefarious. They claim that \"these acquisitions reveal a sustained effort to occupy the entire tech stack as well as the related analytics market through mergers.\" n80 That is obviously not true. Far from \"occupying\" the \"entire tech stack,\" Google competes against Amazon, Facebook, Oracle, Comcast, ATandT, Verizon, Telaria, Rubicon Project, The Trade Desk, Index Exchange, MediaMath, OpenX--and more.</p><p>Even if one looks only at the narrow market of publishers, the competition is robust. Although some critics claim that Google \"coerces\" publishers to use Google's advertising products, n81 publishers say otherwise. In a study published last year, publishers reported that they routinely use, on average, no fewer than six supply-side ad platforms, and about four demand-side ad platforms. n82</p><p>It is also worth noting that far from being a market abuse, mergers and acquisitions, which occur routinely not only in the technology field but across the board in U.S. business, are a necessary and healthy part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Starting any business is risky; starting a tech company is usually even riskier. Without the prospect of a future acquisition as an \"off-ramp\" for investors, many entrepreneurs would never be able to raise the capital to start a business in the first place.</p><p>It is, of course, always up to the individual company whether it wishes to accept an offer to be acquired. Sometimes a tech company will choose to cut its risks and accept the guaranteed return on investment it receives in a merger or acquisition. Sometimes, though, companies turn down these offers. Consider Instagram and Snapchat: the former accepted Facebook's offer; the latter rejected it. Both continue to exist and thrive. It should go without saying that Google did not coerce the companies it acquired. These nine companies each decided--on their own--to sell.</p><p>Data Privacy: Google's Response to Consumer Demand</p><p>A particularly unwarranted criticism from Google's detractors is that the company has created a \"superior\" ad tech service for publishers to use. Their argument goes like this: Because Google has a lot of data, it has been better than competitors at placing ads so that the relevant consumers see them, and that competitive advantage is unfair and anticompetitive. n83</p><p>There is perhaps no better illustration of why these critics want to abandon the consumer welfare standard in antitrust. Winning market share by building a better mousetrap is how competition is supposed to work. The fact that Google's superior service--the critics' characterization--is favored by the advertisers who are the consumers of that service can hardly come as a surprise. For this criticism to succeed, the critics have to relieve themselves of the responsibility to point to anticompetitive behavior and consumer harm. In reality, there are only consumer benefits.</p><p>Moreover, observing that Google's ad tech services are \"superior\" is far different than claiming that Google faces no competition in this market. That claim is not made, nor could it be. Not only does Google face competition from numerous other ad tech companies, and not only does the typical publisher use a half-dozen different supply-side ad platforms on average, but the very same data that Google uses in its ad tech services is available to other companies. Data is neither finite nor limited to one company. Google does not own consumer data, nor does it in any way prevent consumers from providing the same data to its competitors, including Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>So although Google's data inputs make its ad tech superior to many other competitor services, they do not and cannot render it immune from competition. Indeed, Microsoft has comparable data about consumers' product searches, and likely leverages that data to improve its own advertising tools. As Facebook's CEO has stated publicly, it too possesses substantial amounts of such data that the company is eager to use.</p><p>At the same time, there is growing competition spurred by consumer privacy concerns that will restrict the amounts and kinds of data that Google and any competitor will employ in ad tech in the very near future. Apple's Safari web browser and Mozilla's Firefox web browser have already restricted third-party cookies. Like Apple and Mozilla, Google, too, is responding to public demand and has announced its intention to phase out the use of third-party cookies in its Chrome web browser. To that end, it is investing in new technologies that are less invasive than tracking cookies, making it possible for advertisers to target various demographics without identifying specific people. Since consumers drive Google's popularity--across all its platforms and products--that decision is not only necessary but strategic, impelled by the demands of a highly competitive marketplace.</p><p>In all of these ways, competition in digital advertising is strong and growing ever more intense. But Google's critics maintain the opposite. An oft-repeated claim is that Google controls about 93% of the market. n84 This would indeed define Google as a monopoly, but the claim is not true. In reality, Google's share of the ad tech market is a far more modest 29%. n85</p><p>'Self-Preferencing': A Clever Slogan in Search of Consumer Harm</p><p>\"Self-preferencing\" is the latest buzzword of the critics, meant to pejoratively re-brand the perfectly benign practice of businesses in every industry commonly known as vertical integration. n86 Vertical integration enables a business to take responsibility for producing more of the products it sells to its customers while giving it greater quality control and often yielding efficiencies reflected in lower consumer prices. It is widely accepted as good for consumers. Re-branding it as \"self-preferencing,\" however, suggests something unseemly is at work. As former Federal Trade Commissioner Joshua Wright has observed, the term reflects a \"general hostility to firm size regardless of its actual impact on competition or consumer welfare.\" n87</p><p>Today's calls to ban or restrict \"self-preferencing\" are targeted almost exclusively at digital platforms such as Google and digital marketplaces such as Amazon. n88 Indeed, brick-and-mortar marketplaces have been vertically integrating for decades, with no complaint from those now aiming their barbs at \"Big Tech.\" The \"problem\" of \"self-preferencing\" arose only once certain politicians and competitors began turning against the technology industry. Yet from the consumer's perspective, it is relatively much easier to switch digital providers in order to find more product choices, than it is to switch to a different brick-and-mortar retailer in order to find choices beyond that retailer's own branded products.</p><p>How common is vertical integration throughout the U.S. economy? The commercial world around us is replete with examples. Thinking of these well-known consumer product companies and retailers as guilty of \"self-preferencing\" illustrates the absurdity of the concept. Is Gillette harming consumers by \"preferring\" to include its own replacement blades with its razors? Is Coca-Cola harming consumers by \"preferring\" its own beverages in its vending machines?</p><p>Vertical integration operates no differently in an online marketplace than in a brick-and-mortar marketplace. But critics of American tech want to define it as a supposed antitrust violation, and they want to enforce their new rule against \"self-preferencing\" only against tech. Indeed, the creation of a new term to describe vertical integration allows the critics to discriminate against the tech industry more discreetly: brick-and-mortar marketplaces can continue to engage in \"vertical integration\"; online marketplaces must be prosecuted for engaging in \"self-preferencing.\"</p><p>New and Innovative Business Practices</p><p>Technology companies based in the United States lead the world, setting the standard for increased productivity, consumer satisfaction, and innovation. There is no comparable flagship industry that is winning the global competition to this degree. A large part of the reason for this is that the U.S. tech industry spends more on research and development than any other U.S. industry.</p><p>The U.S. tech industry also leads in capital investment:</p><p>TABLE 5: NON-ENERGY U.S. INVESTMENT HEROES: TOP 25 NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES BY ESTIMATED U.S. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE*</p><p>......Company... .........Estimated 2018 U.S. Capital Expenditures (Millions USD)</p><p>1......ALPHABET..................20.188</p><p>2......ATandT.....................19,209</p><p>3......AMAZON.COM..................15,577</p><p>4......VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS...............14,912</p><p>5......MICROSOFT.................. 11469</p><p>6......COMCAST.....................10,890</p><p>T......FACEBOOK..................10,763</p><p>8......CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS............... 9,125</p><p>9......WALMART..................... 7,683</p><p>10......INTEL..................... 7,426</p><p>11......APPLE..................... 7,129</p><p>12......FORD MOTOR.................. 6,513</p><p>13......GENERAL MOTORS.................. 5,756</p><p>14......FEOEX..................... 5,255</p><p>15......DELTA AIR LINES.................. 5,168</p><p>What's more, the technology industry innovations that flow from these investments are not restricted to semiconductors and electromagnetic waves. The digital economy has produced remarkable benefits for consumers worldwide, and innovation in business models is a big reason. It continues to provide a competitive edge for U.S. industry.</p><p>Because tech's business strategies, models, and practices benefit both consumers and the entire economy, much is at stake in ensuring that innovation can continue. As new business methods are perfected, other industries, too, will likely adopt them in order to enhance their own competitiveness in markets that are becoming ever-more integrated with the digital economy each day. To use but one example, the financial services industry, typified by banks with large marble columns and physical retail branches everywhere, is not only moving online but becoming an entirely digital market for some consumers.</p><p>Caution and circumspection are required in evaluating new and innovative business practices in the tech arena, in large measure because the pace of change is so rapid. When a new technology proves successful with consumers, the migration to that product or service can be instantaneous. This produces lopsided \"market share\" for the successful technology, particularly if the \"market\" is defined as the one dominated by that very tech innovation. The ill-wisdom of viewing the marketplace in this way should be obvious.</p><p>Failing to recognize the difference between a \"better mousetrap\" and anticompetitive business practices would likely inflict significant harm on consumers and the economy. Product innovation would suffer; lacking the opportunity for constant improvement in business models, efficiencies would be lost and prices to consumers would rise; and the consequent losses in productivity and employment would ripple across the entire U.S. economy. It is therefore of vital importance that antitrust enforcement distinguishes between business conduct that is procompetitive and yields consumer benefits, on the one hand, and conduct that is actually anticompetitive and exclusionary, on the other hand.</p><p>The two are often brewed in the same barrel. Conduct that benefits consumers also tends to increase market share, which can be viewed as circumstantial evidence of excluding competitors. So even with an eye toward consumer welfare, spotting the difference can be difficult. This is especially true in multi-sided markets--such as those in which Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google compete--where a platform's conduct that benefits consumers inevitably takes business away from a competitor.</p><p>n1 NetChoice is a trade association of e-Commerce and online businesses, at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.netchoice.org\">www.netchoice.org</url> The views expressed here do not necessarily represent the views of every NetChoice member company.</p><p>n2 Verge Staff, Google Turns 20: How an Internet Search Engine Reshaped the World, The Verge (Sept. 27, 2018), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17823490/google-20th-birthday-anniversary-history-milestones\">https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17823490/google-20th-birthday-anniversary-history-milestones</url>.</p><p>n3 Id.</p><p>n4 Randall E.

CORY BOOKER (D-N.J.) </p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CALIF.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]LEE: Welcome to this hearing on the Subcommittee on Antitrust Competition, Policy and Consumer Rights.  Today, we're pleased to have with us the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission Joseph Simons and the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice Makan Delrahim.  Welcome to both of you. </p><p>As an initial matter, as a matter of housekeeping, we've been informed that we may have a block of four votes starting about an hour from now as a practical matter.  We may well be able to push to an hour and 15, hour and a half from now before we have to recess at some point.  We likely will have to go recess to cast a few votes.  We will have to play some of that by ear.  I apologize in advance for that. </p><p>No way to predict these things in advance--it does seem, however, to be an uncanny event with antitrust subcommittee hearings--seems to be a good predictor, albeit an unintentional predictor of when votes are going to occur. </p><p>As both of you know, I've been critical of the fact that we have two federal agencies responsible for civil antitrust enforcement.  And this, of course, is not your choice.  This is a choice made by congress in years past, and so the fact that the law is the way it is has a lot to do with this branch of government and not to do with your respective offices. </p><p>And I have to say, your two agencies have done a remarkable job in recent points--in recent months of making the point that I have with regard to my concerns about having two agencies with overlapping civil antitrust enforcement authority.  It--it's true that, for many decades, the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice have jointly handled civil antitrust enforcement, but in the past, the agencies have avoided too much mischief because they've generally played well together.  And recently, this appears quite regrettably to have changed. </p><p>From what I hear, from what I can tell, clearance disputes have become more frequently, more pronounced and more prolonged.  It's bad enough that your agencies sometimes determine who will investigate a matter according to position arrows and coin tosses, but these clearance disputes impose real cost by wasting resources, creating delays and creating a certain amount of institutional pettiness. </p><p>Having two federal agencies handling civil antitrust enforcement is also creating confusion, both here and abroad, when the FTC and the DOJ are not on the same page.  This is clearly on display in the recent Qualcomm matter where your agencies are literally opposing each other in federal court.  None of this makes for effective or efficient antitrust enforcement, and not one of us would design a system from the outset if we were writing on a blank slate this way.  </p><p>Earlier this summer, we learned that your agencies have begun investigating the large tech firms, some large tech firms to see if they violated antitrust laws. And I've said before, I'm encouraged that the FTC and the DOJ are bringing much-needed antitrust scrutiny to these tech companies. But I'm also concerned about the way you but divvied up these investigations. </p><p>Now, I understand, when it comes to specific investigations, your clearance process designates a single agency to investigate a specific matter. But based on news reports, it sounds like your agencies may be pursuing monopolization investigations of the same companies, at the same time, through two different agencies. </p><p>Now, let me be clear. I don't think your agencies should be divvying up parts of a monopolization investigation of the same company, tech company or otherwise. Former FTC Chairman, Bill Kovacic, has called this nuts. And I agree. </p><p>There's no analytical basis for splitting a monopolization investigation between the FTC and the department of justice. Doing so, simply looks like both agencies simply want to have, not just a slice of the same pie, but the same slice of the same pie, at the same time. </p><p>This will have the agencies stumbling over each other and will inevitably, undermine, rather than further the enforcement efforts of both agencies. </p><p>Consumers, of course, deserve better than that. Consumers are harmed when you are tripping over each other and you are unable to do your job, effectively. </p><p>On the topic of big tech, I'd like to hear your views, today, on whether viewpoint bias should be the subject of antitrust enforcement. I share many of my colleagues concerns with what appears to be bias against certain political viewpoints, particularly conservative political viewpoints by companies like Google and like Facebook. </p><p>What I don't necessarily share is the suggestion, by some, that antitrust is necessarily the proper tool to address this issue. But I welcome your thoughts on this topic, as I certainly have more to learn. </p><p>We often hear talk that antitrust policy needs to evolve to address competitive issues in these tech markets. Advocates of the so-called hipster antitrust theory argue that antitrust is too focused on price effects. They claim that this causes antitrust enforcers to ignore anti-competitive conduct in markets where consumers receive services for free. I'd love to know your thoughts on that topic. </p><p>Finally, I hope we'll have time to discuss what the antitrust division is doing, when it comes to music. This includes what the division is considering in its review of the music licensing consent decrees. </p><p>Also, and I know this is something that my democratic colleagues have raised with you, I'd like to hear more about what the Department of Justice is doing to police anti-competitive conduct in the ticketing market. </p><p>Senator Klobuchar will now give her opening statement. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, very much, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon to Chairman Simons, as well as to Assistant Attorney General Delrahim. We're pleased to have you both here to discuss this very important issue. </p><p>These times are far from typical for antitrust and competition policy. Many new antitrust issues have arisen, since our last oversight hearing. </p><p>The American people, increasingly, understand that competition is critical for their well-being. They know how important it is for consumers, the health of our markets and the future of our economy. And that is one thing that I have noticed is a change, over the last year, as there's just more and more discussion about the need to do something about enforcement in this area. </p><p>Yet, despite this widespread recognition of how important competition is to our nation's future, we still, as a country, have a major monopoly problem. </p><p>Given the grave competition problems we are facing while, as much as I appreciate my colleague's focus on the two agencies and what he referred to as mischief, I am much more concerned about the bigger picture, which is how we're going to take on the monopoly issues of our time and how we're going to take on the competition issues, whether they are in tech or whether they are in the pharmaceutical area or so many others. </p><p>And I was thinking about the analogy of splitting the pie. I am more concerned that our consumers are going to get a big pie in their face, if we don't do something about this. </p><p>We are seeing higher levels of market concentration, across our economy, partially driven by waves of corporate consolidation. Since 2008, American firms have engaged in more than ten trillion in acquisitions and between 2012 and 2017, annual merger filings at the antitrust agencies have increased, by more than 50 percent. </p><p>And those waiting for this trend to slow down will need to wait longer, because the latest agency report shows that merger filing increased, yet again, in 2018, the sixth consecutive annual increase. </p><p>These more concentrated markets have led to decreased competition in many industries, including pharmaceutical, social media, digital technology, telecom, ag, online ticket sales, transportation and more. </p><p>Today, I sent a letter to the FTC with a number of my colleagues, raising concerns about two proposed pharmaceutical mega mergers, that would be AbbVie's acquisition of Allergan and Bristol-Myers acquisition of Celgene and their potential effects on prices. </p><p>There's one additional matter I will be raising at this hearing. Since the beginning of this administration, I have repeatedly had cause to raise concerns about reported White House attempts to interfere in antitrust enforcement efforts for political purposes. </p><p>I've sent numerous letters to the department and the White House, concerning potential interference in antitrust law, based on statements that the president and administration officials reportedly made, regarding matters, such as the Bayer, Monsanto merger, the AT&amp;T, Time Warner merger and the still pending T Mobile, Sprint merger. </p><p>Not all of my letters were answered but the responses that I did get received contained carefully worded assurances that the department had followed its procedures and that it was quote, \"Not aware of any influence by the White House,\" on any of the antitrust matters in question. </p><p>The actual extent of any contact between the White House officials and the department enforcers concerning pending antitrust matters is still a mystery. And now, we have reports of the antitrust division investigating four auto makers for negotiating with California regulators to lower California fuel emission standards to a level that would be more stringent than the standard that the Trump administration intends to impose. </p><p>The automakers reported conduct seems to be little more than an effort by regulated companies to petition a state regulator from our favorable rule, something that happens all the time between state and federal regulators. </p><p>Quite frankly, the antitrust investigation into these automakers, appears to have less to do with protecting competition than with intimidating parties that don't fall into line with the Trump administration's plan to relax emission standards. </p><p>A letter from the EPA and the Department of Transportation to the California Air Resources Board only bolsters the perception that this antitrust investigation is part of a broader effort to, by the administration, to promote its preferred emissions standard and bully those who get in the way. </p><p>For years, both antitrust agencies have talked about applying the consumer welfare standard. This investigation looks more like enforcement, guided by a corporate welfare standard for oil companies and light truck manufacturers. </p><p>I have questions about how this investigation, regarding the gas mileage standards, was initiated and why the division decided to use its limited resources to pursue it. </p><p>As a matter of prosecutorial discretion, I find it hard to believe that an investigation into four automakers trying to navigating a shifting regulatory landscape is the best way to protect competition and consumers, when we're seeing consolidation in so many industries. Sometimes, why you do something is as important as what you do.  </p><p>Also, the antitrust issues that have been received the most attention, of course, are those raised by the major tech companies. We're living in the time of rapid technological change. These changes have led to the rise of powerful technology companies that have come to dominate markets and gather massive amounts of information from consumers, raising serious concerns about competition and privacy. </p><p>At our last oversight hearing, I questioned why European enforcements have been investigating big tech, for years, while our agencies were doing nothing. </p><p>Since then, not only have we heard reports about tech antitrust investigations by the FTC and antitrust division but also by many state attorneys general. </p><p>But these new enforcement efforts, of course, occur against a backdrop of a federal judiciary that has become increasingly skeptical of antitrust enforcement, raising the procedural and evidentiary bar for government and private enforcement. And some have questioned whether the antitrust laws are up to task. I question that very much and that is why I have these bills that I think would be so helpful. </p><p>One, I appreciate the work Senator Grassley did with me on the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act that we introduced that would help with funding for both of your agencies. </p><p>And then, also, I've introduced the Consolidation Prevention and Competition Promotion Act with my colleagues to upgrade the antitrust standards to get at some of these issues that we are going to be hearing about, today. And then also, of course, the Civil Fine for Monopolization Mill, as well as the prescription drug pricing bills, one of which I have with Senator Grassley. </p><p>In closing, as a former prosecutor, I know how important it is to have enforcers that are ready and able to enforce the law without fear or favor. You both have the responsibility to ensure that your agencies act as vigorous yet, impartial, law enforcers. </p><p>Millions of Americans and the health of our free market depend on your efforts and your judgment to ensure that the economy remains fair and competitive. </p><p>Thank you and I look forward to your testimony. </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. We will now be pleased to hear from both of our witnesses, each in turn for their opening statements, before we proceed to questions. </p><p>Joseph Simons was sworn in as the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission on May 1, 2018. Earlier in his career, he had served as the Director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.  </p><p>Makan Delrahim was confirmed on September 17, 2017, as the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division in the Department of Justice. Mr. Delrahim also worked at the antitrust division, earlier in his career, having previously served as Deputy Assistant Attorney Journal. </p><p>No stranger to the Senate, Mr. Delrahim knows his way around this institution, having previously served as Chief Counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. </p><p>Mr. Simons, we'll hear, first from you. </p><p>SIMONS: Thank you, so much Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar and members of the subcommittee. </p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you, today. I am pleased to testify on behalf of the FTC regarding our current competition enforcement activities and policy priorities and, of course, also, to be alongside my esteemed colleague, Makan Delrahim. </p><p>The FTC's mission works to ensure that our nation's markets are competitive and working for American consumers. We do this through targeted, yet vigorous enforcement of the antitrust and consumer protection laws and also by using our unique research and policy tools. </p><p>Today, I will focus my remarks on the antitrust side of our mission. We promote competition through a rigorous fact intensive approach to law enforcement. We have jurisdiction over a wide swath of the economy and focus our enforcement efforts on sectors that most directly affect consumers and their wallets, such as healthcare, pharmaceuticals, consumer products and services, technology, manufacturing and energy. </p><p>In fiscal year 2019, the agency has challenged 20 mergers, so far. In June, the eighth circuit upheld our request for an injunction blocking an anti-competitive merger among healthcare providers in North Dakota. </p><p>This case is our fifth straight appellate victory in hospital, involving healthcare consolidations, following successful appeals of hospital mergers in the third, sixth, seventh, and ninth circuits. </p><p>This string of appellate victories, across multiple circuits, has solidified our analytical approach to these mergers. </p><p>The current state of the law relating to hospital mergers is no accident. It reflects the culmination of efforts to use the agency's enforcement, research and policy tools to protect healthcare consumers. </p><p>In the 1990s, the antitrust agencies lost a significant number of consecutive court challenges to hospital mergers. In response, the FTC launched a merger retrospective study that questioned the prevailing economic methodology that courts had relied on, in ruling against the agencies in these cases. </p><p>Those results, in turn, influence our subsequent enforcement work. Through our unique research capabilities, we successfully moved courts from embracing modern economic approach to analyzing competitive effects in these transactions. </p><p>On the conduct side, in 2019, we filed a complaint against Surescripts, for using vertical restraints to monopolize two markets associated with electronically transmitted prescription information and we have two other monopolization cases on appeal. </p><p>The agency has been consistently active in this area, bringing 24 monopolization cases, since the year 2000, including several, while I was the Bureau Director. </p><p>In 2013, the commission won a critical victory in FTC versus Actavis, when the Supreme Court clarified that pay for delay arrangements can violate the antitrust laws. This long-running case finally concluded this year on the eve of trial, when the defendants agreed to settle. </p><p>In March, the commission held in an administrative proceeding that impacts laboratories and Endo Pharmaceuticals and entered into a reverse payment arrangement that delay generic entry of an extended release opioid used for pain relief, Opana ER. The agency continues to monitor the use of any competitive reverse payment settlements. </p><p>I would also like to highlight our work in the technology sector. Our Bureau of Competition recently shifted resources to establish a dedicated technology task force. This task force is up and running and is actively investigating competitive activity in the U.S. technology markets. </p><p>For example, we are currently pursuing an antitrust investigation of Facebook. In addition to target law enforcement, we also have a robust research and policy function. We are in the process of concluding our hearings on competition and consumer protection in the 21st century. </p><p>We convened 14 sessions over 23 days, with thousands of people attending in person or watching via live webcast. We are distilling a large volume of stakeholder information and generating output, which likely will include reports, statements, guidance and speeches. </p><p>The FTC remains committed to marshaling its resources efficiently, in order to protect consumers and to promote competition, to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace and to meet the current and future challenges. </p><p>We look forward to continuing to work with this subcommittee and Congress and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Chairman Simons. Mr. Delrahim. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Thank you, Chairman Lee. Thank you, Ranking Member Klobuchar, former chairman of the committee, Grassley, and I see former Chairman Leahy, to his left, and distinguished members of this committee. Thank you for having me before you, today. And I also appreciate being next to my colleague, Chairman Simons.  </p><p>Chairman Simons and I go back over 20 years. We were both on the same side, I think, on the consumers in the past investigations of Microsoft from representing different parties. But our work has continued and I'm pleased to work with him now, across the street. </p><p>The importance of antitrust enforcement continues to occupy the front pages, these days, in large part, to the efforts of many on this subcommittee. </p><p>I want to thank this subcommittee for continuing the bipartisan support of the antitrust division's work to protect competition, on behalf of American consumers, workers and entrepreneurs. </p><p>When corporations or individuals fix prices, rig bids or allocate the markets, they are robbing Americans of honest competition. The antitrust division has steadfastly held culpable--the culpable actors accountable. </p><p>Numbers can only tell part of the story but I'm proud that at the close of fiscal year 2018, our criminal program had the highest number of pending grand jury investigations, 91, over the past decade. </p><p>I'm particularly proud of the guilty pleas we obtained from five South Korean fuel companies that rigged bids on Department of Defense fuel supply contracts, at the expense of the American taxpayer. </p><p>The crimes in these cases directly targeted taxpayer dollars, which fund the critical work of the U.S. military and the Korean Peninsula. We obtained criminal and civil penalties in these cases, amounting to over $350 million. </p><p>In civil enforcement, the antitrust division continues to confront multi billion-dollar mergers that involve industries, important to every consumer, ranging from media to healthcare, to transportation and telephony. </p><p>Even with our constrained resources, the antitrust division has not hesitated to litigate, when we have needed to, after we have found the merger to be anti-competitive. </p><p>Separate from and as a complement to our enforcement mission, the antitrust division has engaged in robust competition advocacy, implementing a wide range of initiatives, designed to advance competition. </p><p>For example, the division has used its amicus initiative to address developments in case law earlier and more frequently, providing the opportunity to have an outsized impact, given our resources. </p><p>For instance, the division recently filed a statement of interest and argued at a hearing in a private antitrust case. The suit alleged that two major universities entered into an unlawful agreement not to poach each other's medical school faculty. </p><p>We were able to advance important arguments before the court about the application of the Per Se, Rule of anti-trust law and also push back on overly broad assertions of antitrust immunities, in that case. </p><p>Subsequently, and I think in an innovative manner, we successfully intervened in the settlement of the parties, after we had successfully argued in that case, the parties decided to settle. </p><p>We intervened, the court accepted our motion and doing so enabled the antitrust division to obtain the same relief and protections for the American worker that we would have achieved, had we conducted our own lengthy investigation. </p><p>It also provided some transparency to the markets about our enforcement priorities, with respect to no poach arrangements. </p><p>The division has also held workshops and roundtables, including a discussion of the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act, which is up for reauthorization, in less than a year. </p><p>I'm pleased that the administration has a position to seek reauthorization of that legislation. </p><p>In addition, we held a workshop on media advertising to inform our efforts to apply long held antitrust principles to the continuing evolving digital advertising market. </p><p>As I testified before the subcommittee last fall, will the division has recently established the Jackson-Nash address. This lecture series is designed to inspire and educate division staff and the public about cutting edge issues and developments in the field of economics. </p><p>Thus far, we've been honored to hear addresses from Nobel prize-winning economists, professors Alvin Roth, George Akerlof, Roger Myerson and last year's Nobel prize winner, Professor Paul Romer. </p><p>Each have provided valuable insights into innovation, competition and possible threats facing the modern economy. </p><p>Internationally, the United States, it's businesses and consumers benefit when other nations enforce the competition laws, according to sound economic principles and in accordance with appropriate procedures and protection. </p><p>You may recall that, at my confirmation hearing before this committee, over two years ago, I identified this issue as a top priority for me at the division. I'm proud to report that our initiative for multilateral agreement and our efforts over the last year, led to the international competition networks framework on competition agency procedures. </p><p>This is an historic achievement for procedural fairness and antitrust enforcement, across the globe, with now over 70 signatories. </p><p>Many doubted that this administration would be able to achieve this. I'm also proud to share that the United States sought and is granted the privilege of hosting, for the first time, the ICN's annual conference, in 2020. We will jointly be hosting that with the Federal Trade Commission in Los Angeles. </p><p>This is the most important conference for global competition enforcing agencies. Our host status will allow the division, along with the FTC, to showcase our ideals by promoting fundamental due process, through the gap.  We also, will be able to engage with the world on a range of other important policy issues, including digital platform competition, cartel enforcement and cross border merger cooperation. </p><p>It's been nearly two years, since the Senate confirmed me to this post. Each day presents new challenges but there are two constants. First is the pride and responsibility that I feel, as I work with the talented attorneys, economists and staff of the antitrust division. </p><p>And second, it's my unwavering belief that the work we do at the antitrust division continues to provide for a competitive American workplace that benefits all Americans. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>LEE: Thank you very much, to both of you. We will now begin five-minute questioning rounds. </p><p>In response to my first three questions, I'd like a simple yes or no answer from both of you. We'll start with Mr. Simons and then go to Mr. Delrahim for each of these three questions. </p><p>Mr. Simons, do you believe that your agency could benefit from more resources to enforce the antitrust laws. </p><p>SIMONS: Yes. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Delrahim. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Yes. </p><p>LEE: Would it be a waste of resources that you have within your agency for your agency to be investigating the same conduct in the same company at the same time, as something that's already being investigated by the Department of Justice? </p><p>SIMONS: Yes. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Delrahim, likewise with respect to the FTC. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Yes. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Simons, are you aware of any instance, any matter, prior to 2018, in which your two agencies were investigating the same company for the same conduct, at the same time. </p><p>SIMONS: No, Senator. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Delrahim. </p><p>DELRAHIM: I don't recall. </p><p>LEE: Okay, thank you. Let' move on to clearance. Back in June, news reports suggested that your agencies had divvied up review of the dominant tech firms. But in July, The Justice Department announced that it is conducting a broad review of the leading online platforms. </p><p>It sounds to me, in context, like your two agencies are covering the same ground, at least, in very significant part. In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported, yesterday, that the Justice Department may conduct its own antitrust monopolization related investigation of Facebook, despite the fact that the FTC is already investigating Facebook under a monopolization theory. </p><p>Chairman Simons, are the FTC and the Department of Justice still operating under the clearance-under a clearance system to avoid duplicative efforts or have things broken down on this front? </p><p>SIMONS: For the vast majority of matters, we continue to operate under the existing clearance agreement. </p><p>LEE: I'll take that as a yes, things have broken down, at least, in part. I'm not suggesting-- </p><p>SIMONS: --Yeah, I would agree with that. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Delrahim, what can you tell us about that? Have they broken down? Are you still using it? Do you agree with Mr. Simon's suggestion? </p><p>DELRAHIM: Well, the clearance process and the agreement is a process we are continuing to use. </p><p>LEE: But you'd acknowledge that it's broken down in, at least, some cases. </p><p>DELRAHIM: I would acknowledge that there is, over the last 20 years and you might recall that Chairman Muris and Assistant Attorney General James, when they faced this back in 2002, I believe, entered into an arrangement that could have solved a lot of the problems because this has been going on, not recently, but in the past. The Senate Appropriations Committee put a provision in preventing the agencies from implementing that orderly agreement. </p><p>But it was one of the two agencies that resolved and it might have prevented some of these problems. But I cannot deny that there are instances where Chairman Simons and my time is wasted on those types of squabbles. </p><p>LEE: Thank you for your candor on that point. As I mentioned in my opening statement, I don't think there is a sound basis. I don't think one can conceive of a sound basis for splitting up a monopolization investigation, between your two agencies. </p><p>Any monopolization investigation must look at the totality of the company's efforts in attaining or in maintaining monopoly power. That cannot be done piecemeal. It doesn't work. It's something that doesn't exist in the abstract and certainly isn't going to work in practice. </p><p>Mr. Delrahim, have the Department of Justice and the FTC ever split a monopoly investigation between themselves, before? </p><p>DELRAHIM: I'm not sure if there was. </p><p>LEE: You can't think of any. </p><p>DELRAHIM: I can't. And you know, certainly not in the last two years that I discussed. But I want to clarify one thing. It's not so much the monopolization cases because, I mean, frankly, most of the antitrust laws, in Section 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, maybe a Section 8 of the Clayton Act and outside of the merger, Section 7. But we would look at different conduct, perhaps, of the same companies and that might be what we might be talking about, here. </p><p>LEE: Okay, so you might, you might have one agency more interested in one piece of conduct than the other. But by your own acknowledgment, both of these are monopolization-based investigations. Those cannot be done piecemeal/ </p><p>Mr.-Chairman Simons, the FTC and the Department of Justice are, in fact, structured differently. They have different policies, different procedures, in addition to having different personnel. </p><p>In most cases, they are bound by the same substantive provisions of antitrust law. But the FTC also, has some authority to act under a separate set of laws dealing with unfair methods of competition. </p><p>Is it even feasible for your two agencies to split between yourselves what is, in effect, a single investigation, when it comes to monopolization? </p><p>SIMONS: Well, it's not the normal thing to do, that's for sure. And we haven't done it, in my recollection. And I've been practicing for about 35 years, now. </p><p>But it's also the case that we cooperate regularly with the state attorneys general, on the same exact case, not even dividing it up. </p><p>LEE: Applying different standards of substantive law. I mean-- </p><p>SIMONS: In many cases, they're applying the same standard. And sometimes it's helpful because we, they in particular have more expertise in local areas so, sometimes, particularly like for example, on mergers involving gas stations, they know the terrain. They know what the local markets look like, so it's very helpful. </p><p>LEE: It is, in fact, a different sovereign, though. You're dealing with different sovereigns.   </p><p>SIMONS: It is a different sovereign. That's absolutely-- </p><p>LEE: --You two are agents.  </p><p>SIMONS: And let me just say. Ideally, you really do just want one agency from the federal government doing it if, for no other reason, because you, the resources that one of us is duplicating on the other could be applied to a completely different enforcement action or investigation. </p><p>LEE: Right, and as you both acknowledge, both of you could use and desperately need more resources. That being the case, makes no sense to me that we should have duplication of effort when that has a tendency, inevitably, to undermine the effectiveness of what you're doing. </p><p>Mr. Simons, I appreciate your acknowledgment a moment ago about how this may be tripping things up but it inevitably does. </p><p>Let's suppose, hypothetically, that you were asked for advice on setting up an antitrust regime, within another country, within some foreign jurisdiction that didn't already have one. Would you, in any circumstance, recommend that they follow the U.S. model and that they have two separate agencies responsible for civil antitrust enforcement, the same way we do here? </p><p>SIMONS: No, I wouldn't. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Delrahim, what's your answer to that same question? </p><p>DELRAHIM: It would be hard to imagine a system being designed, at the first instance, like we have today in multiple. Now, and as Chairman Simons says, not only do you have two federal agencies, you have, well, I guess I learned recently, with the state AG's, 52 states who also enforce the antitrust laws. And all of them, you know, based on Supreme Court precedent enforce the exact same federal law that we do, in addition to their state laws. </p><p>So, it's not the best model of efficiency. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. I see my time's expired. Senator Klobuchar. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yeah, I just look at this in such a different way. I just see there's investigations going on all over the place. All of these AGs have taken it on and I'd rather have a split investigation than no investigation. </p><p>And I assume part of the reason that why you split this is you don't have enough resources, individually, to take this on yourselves, while you're doing your other work. Is that possible? </p><p>DELRAHIM: You know, I think, just as sometimes we work with the states, both working together. As many of you know Microsoft was something that began with the Federal Trade Commission. Later, because of a 2/2 tie, that the Justice Department took that on. That happens in other matters so, the process-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Okay, that's fine. What are you guys investigating, exactly, with tech? </p><p>SIMONS: So, I can't talk specifically about individual investigations but it's, we have a technology task force that we formed in the Bureau of Competition and they are focused purely on high technology platforms. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And can you say it's a-- </p><p>SIMONS: --And they are very active. They're, anyone who has a complaint about a high-tech platform, we are all ears. Please call us. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And can you say the companies you are investigating? </p><p>SIMONS: The only one I can say that's publicly disclosed is Facebook because they disclosed it, themselves. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay, do you want to add something? </p><p>DELRAHIM: I, you know, if you follow the same model, the one that has disclosed it is Google, upon whom we have served CIDs. And I'll refer you also, to the press statement the Justice Department put out of looking at, you know, broad review, our technology section of the antitrust division at the main justice, in addition to our San Francisco field office, who has been an expert in this area, are the two that are splitting up the work we have, close to several dozen attorneys who are working on this matter. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And what do you think about the state attorneys general and what they are doing? Do you think that's helpful? </p><p>DELRAHIM: We've had very productive discussions and cooperation. I think at the early stage, we've got to make sure that we're not tripping over each other. And so, the more coordination there is, the better. </p><p>We do that with almost every one of our investigations, depending on the states involved. We'll see, at the end of the process, I do note that California attorney general decided not to join the tech investigations. And they have been a significant player with a significant interest in this matter, I would think. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay, well speaking of California, and I think, I think both of you know how focused I am and I will get back to this, if we have a second round on these tech investigations because we've been blocked from doing really legislations. That's one of the reasons I've introduced legislation on privacy, political ads, as well as the work that needs to be done, in general, on antitrust, so that our laws are sophisticated to be able to deal with the current competitive landscape. </p><p>But speaking of California, so, the New York Times is reporting, and maybe other news, as well, at 2:28 today, that in fact, the Trump administration will end California's authority to set stricter auto emission rules tomorrow.  </p><p>And I would like to know, and this is for you Mr. Delrahim, are you aware of any contacts between or efforts to exert influence by the president, any employee of the White House, or any advisor to the president and any Justice Department official or employee relating to any investigation into the automakers negotiations with the state of California, regarding vehicle emissions standards? </p><p>DELRAHIM: You're referring to the Justice Department's report investigation? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yes. </p><p>DELRAHIM: None, whatsoever. Nor have I had a communication with anybody, outside of our building. There's been reports that, somehow, we coordinated this with the EPA, DOT. And I would refer folks to the first report of this. Our inquiry and letter to the car companies was sent a couple of weeks before and the letter from those agencies went the day the news reports publicized our inquiry. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Are you aware of any contacts between officials at the EPA or the DOT and your officials, none from those agencies or from the White House? </p><p>DELRAHIM: I am not. And you know, I also should say that, you know, the Justice Department often works with different agencies in enforcing their rules so, you know, I don't-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, how about other people at the Justice Department like the attorney general or did-- </p><p>DELRAHIM: I am not. Nor did I communicate with them. And you know, there's a lot of miscommunication-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, why would you be focusing resources on this when we've just discussed all these huge investigations that should be going on, on four automakers that are simply trying to work with one state to figure out what the auto emission standard should be, when the administration is so clearly opposed to this?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: So, that's a very fair question. Let me say why. And this is not unique, in this particular instance. </p><p>We read about the car companies working together in an agreement. There's been multiple Supreme Court cases, Justice Stevens had said that, you know, we have chosen a policy of competition, not collusion. </p><p>There's nothing wrong with these companies, individually, to announce, you know, higher emission standards, if they wanted to. </p><p>There may not be anything wrong with them agreeing with the state to do so. In fact, there might be certain immunities, like state action doctrine, to do so. </p><p>They cannot cooperate amongst themselves. And I can name at least four or five other investigations, which are similar, as far as collusive activity, after which we have inquired. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: This is in the wake of so many other administration related comments, related to antitrust that I'm just so fearful that it's going to undermine our laws, undermine the work of the department. And this gets me to one specific merger, Team Mobile, Sprint. Why--I disagree with the outcome of that, of course.  </p><p>And why risk the harm to competition, when the simple solution would be to block the merger and leave Sprint, a company that is rolling out 5G, as we speak, in the market, as a competitor? </p><p>DELRAHIM: So, we investigated that transaction for about 13 months. And that's not the conclusion we reached. In fact, there was two chunks of mid band spectrum, Sprint holding about, I think, 100 MHz of 2.5 spectrum, very valuable in this space for 5G. And Dish is sitting on 95 MHz of spectrum for several years, which probably would have been going into litigation, next March. </p><p>What we did, and then, you have two major providers in AT&amp;T and Verizon, who together, had over 75 percent-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Dish doesn't even have a mobile network, right now, right. They just have a spectrum. They haven't even done this, before. </p><p>DELRAHIM: --They do not but-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: It's just this hope and a prayer that they're going to build this 5G network. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Well, I don't think it's a hope and a prayer. Our consent decree, not only commits them to doing so, they also narrowed the use, the flexible use licenses they had with the FCC. </p><p>In addition, you are now going to have Sprint, Team Mobile combined with the remedies that we put in, providing real competition to AT&amp;T and Verizon, for the first time, to consumers. On top of that, the 5G that Dish has, now look, they've spent $20 billion on the spectrum and probably committed to spend another $10 billion-$15 billion in building it. </p><p>I don't think they are doing that to fail. I hope it's not and there's going to be a number of provisions and a monitor in there to do that. So, I actually think there's a number of ways of looking at it. I think the consumer, particularly in the rural area, is going to win at the end of this, if the merger goes forward. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Right, and if I don't get a second round, here, I just want to thank you, Chairman. I know you've been working on pay for delay and are supportive of the work that we are doing, forward, and also, thank you, Mr. Delrahim, for your work with us on the Monopoly Deterrents Act and the civil penalties that Senator Grassley and I are working on.  </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Thank you. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Senator Grassley. </p><p>GRASSLEY: For the most part, I'm going to deal with some of the pieces of legislation that I'm interested in that affect you folks, in your leadership role. </p><p>So, I'll start with Chairman Simons. I introduced a bipartisan prescription pricing for people's act, passed the committee, June, and now awaits full Senate action. The bill requires the FTC to study the practices of an increasing consolidation among PBMs and other intermediaries in the healthcare marketplace. </p><p>Probably, you wouldn't be aware of studies back in 2005, but some of the FTC's previous studies, however, such as its 2005 analysis of PBMs and mail order pharmacies have been criticized for missing the point and not being critical enough of potentially anti-competitive practices. Has the PBM marketplace changed since the FTC's 2005 study and, if so, tell me how? </p><p>SIMONS: I think, if anything, it's become more concentrated and we continue to look at the PBM market and we're very grateful to you that we were able to provide technical assistance for you on your bill. And we're happy to do the study. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Okay then, if our bill, well, I guess you've answered the question. You would carry out Congress' intent and take a hard look at what we're tasking it to do in that study, okay. </p><p>SIMONS: Yes. Yeah, the one thing I would say, though, is we estimated it would cost, it would take up nine FTEs. And so, that's another reason we need more funding </p><p>GRASSLEY: Okay. And I don't mean to be disrespectful but you've always been Makan to me. So, Makan, the NOPEC bill, the No Oil Producing Exporting Cartels Act, would explicitly authorize the Justice Department to sue oil producing cartel members for antitrust violations and clarify that courts shouldn't decline to hear a case, based upon sovereign immunity or an act of the state or foreign sovereign compulsion or political question doctrine. </p><p>I've written to you, twice, about getting the antitrust division's views on NOPEC. I haven't gotten any response. What is the antitrust position on NOPEC? Do you support the bill? </p><p>DELRAHIM: Well Senator, I think, as you've stated and your bill addresses cartels in any way, you know, can harm and do harm American consumers. </p><p>The legislation and the activities of NOPEC implicate other foreign policy implications and we don't have an administration clear position. You've seen my personal positions on this matter, in the past of what we could be doing and I don't think the current law, current precedence, and the Justice Department's filings and private cases in the past, preclude the department from bringing such a case, should a deterrent decide to bring one against commercial actors involved in OPEC. </p><p>But as we see some other foreign policy matters, including over the weekend, I think it implicates certain diplomatic relations that other departments of the administration have weighed in on and would be. I look forward to seeing if we can resolve that and get a views letter to you, soon. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Well, you just answered my last question. So, I'll get an answer in my letter. </p><p>DELRAHIM: I hope so. </p><p>GRASSLEY: What do you mean, you hope so. You run that show, don't you? </p><p>DELRAHIM: Well, it's the Justice Department and then, it goes and there's' an interagency process on this view. But I can assure you that it is an area that we've given a lot of time and resources, as has the White House. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Okay, also Makan, earlier this year, I introduced a bill to provide anti-retaliation protection for antitrust whistle blowers. The bill implements the recommendations of the July, 2011, GAO study to increase greater criminal antitrust violation detection and deterrents. Versions of this bill have passed the senate several times. </p><p>I hope you're familiar with the bill. If you are, do you believe it would be helpful in going after antitrust violators? </p><p>DELRAHIM: I think it would be helpful and I believe we have expressed support for that bill. I will check on that and get back to you but I think it is a sound policy that would complement and further enhance our cartel enforcement activities. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Okay. And then, to both of you, I wrote a letter to the FTC, last October, highlighting potentially anti-competitive contracting practices by hospitals and insurers. The Wall Street Journal reported so-called anti-steering contracts that prevent insurers from steering their members to lower cost, higher quality care providers, simply because the dominant hospital doesn't want to face competition.  </p><p>Chairman Simons, has the FTC looked into these practices in more detail, since my letter, last fall? Are they problematic? What actions, if any, has the FTC taken? </p><p>SIMONS: We are very interested in looking at unilateral conduct by hospitals that are problematic under the antitrust laws. But generally, when we do that, we find that they are nonprofits and we don't have jurisdiction over them. And so, that's another reason why we've been asking the Congress to eliminate our exemption for nonprofits. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Gosh, I never gave that any thought. We ought to consider that. </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, please do. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Okay. </p><p>DELRAHIM: So, I can address that, as well, since we do. You have, Congress has given us the authority to look into nonprofit hospitals. Perhaps, another example of things you probably wouldn't start from the beginning. </p><p>But we've had two enforcement actions on exactly that type of practice, the anti-steering. One involved a North Carolina Atrium Healthcare, to which we were prepared to litigate that had been in investigation for over three years. And we entered into a consent decree, where the hospital system terminated those practices, just this past year. </p><p>And then, the second one was in Michigan, a hospital system that had done that. I can also report to you that there is a working group, within the administration, to look at if there's a regulatory way to address these types of anti-steering provisions and the White House has expressed a lot of interest in this issue. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Thanks, all of you and continue to be helpful, please. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>LEE: Senator Leahy. </p><p>LEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know Senator Klobuchar has already raised the questions on the environmental standards in California. Of course, as an average American, it appears to be totally political, especially, when the president is going out for a political event in California and would announce that he will set aside a California law as sort of, the Emperor is here, let's go with this. </p><p>And a law that Californians are in favor of because it protects their environment. I mean, the whole thing, if you had it on a TV show doing that, you'd say that's ridiculous or ludicrous. It goes beyond the pale. It has no credibility. </p><p>But be that as it may, aside from that question on decision, I do worry about the president using the levers of law enforcement to target political opponents. Earlier this year, it was revealed that President Trump, personally, admitted the Justice Department blocked the merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner, which owns CNN.  </p><p>So then, in the past, such decisions made by the professionals in the Department of Justice. So, they then following what the president said because he was concerned that the news media actually reported some of the things he had said. </p><p>They unsuccessfully, tried to block the merger in court. Now, it's worrisome because those of us who are lawyers, who have been prosecutors, think of the Justice Department being independent. And I know the Justice Department recently refused to turn over documents related to the AT&amp;T, Time Warner merger to the House Judiciary Committee. </p><p>So, let me ask you this. As Assistant to the Attorney General the antitrust division, has the White House directly or indirectly ever communicated its preference to you regarding any enforcement or potential investigative action? </p><p>DELRAHIM: I can, unequivocally, say no, Senator. And in fact, with the AT&amp;T matter, there were, I think it's been public, there were, at least, five different settlements, which would have had AT&amp;T buy CNN. And they would have resolved the competition concerns. In addition to the president, there were at least, I think 14 Senators from this body who also wrote to me with concerns about that transaction. </p><p>I have committed to you and this committee, as well as, both in person and in writing that I don't view politics having a role into our enforcement decisions, nor should it have a role from us abstaining any enforcement precision. </p><p>LEAHY: Okay, Senators have written, too. But nobody from the White House did that, nobody from the White House, directly or indirectly, indicated their preferences, that's correct? </p><p>DELRAHIM: Correct, Senator. </p><p>LEAHY: That's your answer. </p><p>DELRAHIM: That is my answer. And in fact, you mentioned the documents not being turned over to the House Judiciary Committee. There were many documents that were, you know, that were not privileged for one reason or another or document that were confidential that were turned over, not only to them, but through FOIA requests, to multiple parties. </p><p>And in fact-- </p><p>LEAHY: --During your tenure, has the antitrust division ever changed the scope or substance of any investigative enforcement or litigation decision, based on input from the White House? </p><p>DELRAHIM: No. </p><p>LEAHY: None. </p><p>DELRAHIM: None. </p><p>LEAHY: The--I asked you this because there is this appearance that the president has successfully influenced specific enforcement decisions. And the day after Team Mobile, for example, announced its intended merger with Sprint, senior executives at Team Mobile began booking rooms at a hotel the president owns here, in Washington, D.C.</p><p>A lobby in the Trump administration approved the merger but they spent some money at that hotel, $200,000. Must have been a nice room.  </p><p>Were you or any other Justice Department officials made aware that Team Mobile executives' decision to stay at the Trump Hotel before that information was reported publicly? </p><p>DELRAHIM: No, Senator, I was not. </p><p>LEAHY: Did the White House express its preferences with regards to the Team Mobile merger to DOJ? </p><p>DELRAHIM: Not that I'm aware of. Not to me, certainly, and nobody that I know of in the division. </p><p>LEAHY: Well, if they had, you would have been aware of it, correct? </p><p>DELRAHIM: I would have been. </p><p>LEAHY: Just coincidence that Team Mobile repeatedly returned to the Trump Hotel, running up that tab while seeking the Justice Department's approval for its merger. </p><p>DELRAHIM: I would direct you to the Team Mobile executives of why they did. I could give you one reason they might have. The Trump Hotel is right next door to the Justice Department building. So, I think, as a matter of convenience, it might have been. But I have no idea. </p><p>LEAHY: So is the Marriott, the Willard and several others. </p><p>DELRAHIM: It's literally, next door, Senator, at the Justice Department. So, I have no idea why they did, nor did I, does that factor into my decision. </p><p>LEAHY: I've actually been to the Justice Department. I've been in that area. I know where it is. I know that it's very important that to them they be able to have somewhere they could walk to in a matter of seconds because none of them have cars available to them or anything else. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Senator, I can assure you that my decisions are not based on the hotel stays of any merging parties. I can tell you that. You know, my enforcement decision is not bought by a couple hundred thousand bucks of hotels and-- </p><p>LEAHY: Did you commit to comply with a notice of reporting requirements provided in the Music Modernization Act, before you took any action in DOJ's review of the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees? </p><p>DELRAHIM: We have, Senator, those are important decrees but we have complied with the provision of the Music Modernization Act, which states that we should within reasonable notice, notify the committee, should we decide to terminate. </p><p>We've done even more than that. Before we published this for public comment, we notified the four, the Ranking Member, Chair of the subcommittee, as well as the full committee, here, and in the House, before we decided to do anything. We have communicated that. </p><p>I'm no stranger to this committee, having had the great privilege of serving on the staff of the committee. So, I know full well the importance. </p><p>LEAHY: I had the opportunity to be on that committee, on this committee at the same time you were here. </p><p>DELRAHIM: I had the great honor to serving alongside of you, Senator, both as Chairman and Ranking Member. </p><p>LEAHY: I will submit some other questions, if I might, for the record and I have for both, Mr. Simons and for you, sir, and ask that you respond to them. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Thank you. </p><p>LEE: Senator Hawley. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just as we start, a point about something not before us here, today. Amazon, as I'm sure many of you have seen that the Wall Street Journal's recently reported that Amazon has potentially changed its algorithms, in order to favor its own products, rather than to actually report what consumers are looking for. </p><p>I've raised concerns about this publicly. Amazon responded to me, this morning, and said there's absolutely no truth to any of those reports. So, Mr. Chairman, I've invited them to come to this committee. I'm sure you'd be happy to have them. </p><p>Amazon, you can come here to this room. You can sit at that table. You can take an oath and you can answer our questions and you can open up your books, so that we can all see. </p><p>And we invite you to do so and would love to, I'm sure, love to have you, love to have you here. So, we look forward to Amazon's response. I'm sure they have nothing to hide. </p><p>Gentlemen, thank you for being here. I have to tell you, just to put my cards on the table, I'm concerned about the state of antitrust enforcement. As somebody who believes in competition, who believes in free and open markets and thinks that competition actually is good for American individuals, American families, American consumers, I'm concerned about what I see as a pattern of lack of enforcement, pro-competition enforcement. </p><p>And I understand that both of you say that your prospective agencies need more resources. Until we can figure out some of the structural problems that you both alluded to, I don't know why we would spend more money to do things that, frankly, aren't getting results. </p><p>Chairman Simons, let me just begin with you. I want to ask you about the FTC's recent settlement with Facebook, a company you now say you're continuing to investigate. That settlement was $5 billion. Is that right? </p><p>SIMONS: Correct. </p><p>HAWLEY: Now, Facebook's revenue, last year, I believe, was $56 billion. So, the fine was worth less than seven, nine rather, 9 percent of Facebook's revenue. Mike, is that right, my guess is, am I getting the figures right? </p><p>SIMONS: Yes, sir. </p><p>HAWLEY: Did you interview Mark Zuckerberg, during your investigation? </p><p>SIMONS: No. </p><p>HAWLEY: Did you interview Sheryl Sandberg, during the investigation. </p><p>SIMONS: No, but we had their name as-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Did you ask to interview them, either of them? Did you interview other major executives? </p><p>SIMONS: I believe so. </p><p>HAWLEY: Who? </p><p>SIMONS: I don't have a list. I could get it for you. </p><p>HAWLEY: You can get it for me. Great, I'd love to see it. </p><p>SIMONS: I think it would have to be pursuant to a non-public-- </p><p>HAWLEY: You know, I'd be happy to get any information I can get out of the FTC. So, we'll take it in whatever format that you're able to give it to us.  </p><p>Let's talk about Google, for just a second. </p><p>SIMONS: So, can I say something about Facebook. </p><p>HAWLEY: Go ahead. </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, so Facebook was a situation in which we were faced with either taking the settlement which you described, which was $5 billion and a huge, very significant injunctive relief, as well. And comparing that to what we could have gotten in court, and if we had gone to court, we would have spent years litigating and, if we had won at the end of that, we would have come up with something that was far less. The court, we have to go to court and a court would have to award what, you know, what we were looking for. </p><p>And a court would have given us far less, both in terms of the civil penalty, the $5 billion and also, in terms of the injunctive relief. So, that was-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --I'm interested you say that because I notice that your agency, it doesn't take a lot of cases to trial. In fact, you don't usually go through the adjudication process on very many cases. Isn't that right?  </p><p>SIMONS: We go--we have a lot of litigation. We have a lot of litigation on the competition side-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --You settle--you settle most everything, don't you? </p><p>SIMONS: Well, that's true of every enforcer. </p><p>HAWLEY: So, that's a yes, though? </p><p>SIMONS: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>HAWLEY: I mean, here's my question. Just what I see from your agency is, frankly, a culture of paralysis. I'm tempted to call it a culture of capitulation and I worry about agency capture. I just wonder, is there something--I don't have the answer--but is there something structurally problematic at the FTC?   </p><p>I mean, what is it that the FTC is really doing with its time? I mean, I think it's fair to ask. And I don't know the answers to these questions but I think that it's time that we ask them. I don't know why we would authorize more personnel and more money for an agency that doesn't seem to be vigorously enforcing the laws. </p><p>Now, you both have talked about the overlap in jurisdiction. Maybe we should clean up that overlap in jurisdiction by removing it from one of your agencies. I mean, is that, what do you think about that? Would that be something that would make the process better?  </p><p>Mr. Delrahim, let me ask you to, give you the chance to weigh in, here. I mean, should we clearly designate enforcement authority to one agency, so that we don't have these clearance problems and this seeming lack of enforcement we've been seeing? </p><p>DELRAHIM: Well, as an administration official, I don't have a view on that. But I think it's perfectly an appropriate area of inquiry for this committee to take a look at the overall system that we have in this country. </p><p>I mean, we have, I was privileged to serve as a Commissioner on the antitrust modernization commission. There were a number of recommendations and that, 10 years ago, 12 years ago, now, that were there. </p><p>But that was one of the very small areas that we looked at. But there's a number of areas of inquiry that, I think, are worthy of your attention. </p><p>HAWLEY: You know, I just, we are reading now in the press about these fights, these interagency fights, Chairman alluded to them, earlier. You know, I just, I'm concerned that these turf wars are leading to a lack of enforcement. I mean, they're not able to actually get after the business that you should be getting after, doing the job that you should be doing. And again, maybe it's time for this Congress to do something about it. </p><p>Let's come back to something else I wanted to ask you about, Chairman Simon, I read somewhere, that two thirds of FTC commissioners and Bureau directors go on to work for or represent the tech giants. Is that, that can't be right. Is that right? </p><p>SIMONS: That's not something, that's not a statistic that I've seen. </p><p>HAWLEY: Would you, if that's accurate, would that concern you? I mean, why would that be the case? Why would that be happening? </p><p>SIMONS: Well, my sense is that the--like myself, for example. So, I represented people who are against the big tech companies. So, I represented a bunch of companies who were trying to challenge Microsoft, back in the 19--late 1990s. </p><p>So, it can be on either side of the spectrum. So, I don't think it's necessarily one way or the other. </p><p>HAWLEY: Well, here's--at the end of the day, I think that we're seeing the, we're seeing structural issues play out in the press. We're seeing a troubling lack of enforcement, whether it's Facebook, whether it's Google. I think of the fact that we know from an FTC, a leaked FTC memo report, that Google had an internal policy, this is a quote, \"To bias ourselves,\" that's Google talking in their own algorithm. The FTC, I think, had this report as early as 2012. It didn't take any action. Meanwhile, the E.U. fined Google $2.7 billion. </p><p>So, I don't know what the answer is, here. But I think that is pretty clear we have a problem and it's pretty clear what we're reading in the press about the relationship between your entities that we have a problem. And I think it's time, Mr. Chairman, that we addressed ourselves to solving it. </p><p>Thanks so much. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Can I say one thing about that. Just one thing, to just repeat my former boss, Attorney General Ashcroft, is that sometimes, as the Chairman said, you know, I think 98 percent of the work and cooperation between the two agencies work well. But as General Ashcroft used to say, the press reports about the plane crashes, not the thousands of safe landings, every day. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, I agree with that. Reminds me of the late story my late father, who was an attorney, used to tell, where he would say, people attack lawyers. It's a shame when you sully the dignity of a profession on the basis of only 800,00 or 900,000 bad apples. </p><p>Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I'm sure he didn't mean anything personal by it, Mr. Chairman. But just to quote another Senator, it's pretty clear we have a problem. It's pretty clear we have a problem, if only it's a perception problem. </p><p>And Mr. Simons, I take your point about litigation taking a long time. I was state Attorney General for 20 years and I lead, helped to lead the Microsoft case. And by the way, just so you understand, that's an example of state enforcing federal antitrust law and doing it, successfully, adding an additional dimension in partnership with the federal government. </p><p>So, this idea that two sovereigns shouldn't be enforcing the same laws or their own laws, I think, fails to take account of the great genius of our system, which is we have state enforcers. And they protect consumers. </p><p>And by the way, that $5 billion fine, it raised the price of Facebook's stock the next day and it increased the net worth of those executives. But I take issue, not so much with the size of the fine, the lack of structural change. And you found, in the course of your privacy investigation that, in fact, the company used its control over user data to sell advertising. </p><p>That has antitrust implication, does it not, Mr. Simons? </p><p>SIMONS: It's possible it could. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, it's more than possible. It's what you should be investigating. Yesterday, as my colleague indicated-- </p><p>SIMONS: --I can't talk about the details of what we're investigating with the Facebook antitrust investigation but we are investigating the antitrust file. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I'm telling you, you should be investigating it. </p><p>SIMONS: Yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And by the way, the fact that you're coming here without any specifics, I think, reinforces the impression that federal antitrust enforcement is an empty suit. Call it a culture of capitulation. What the public sees is a facade, with respect to big tech and no immediate prospect of urgency or active enforcement. </p><p>And I might just add, in addition to the report, yesterday, about Amazon changing its search algorithm to promote its own products is also a report, recently, in the New York Times, that Apple operates its Apple Store and app store to offer apps that may be tipping the scale, in favor of its own products, Google using its search engines to promote its monopoly and its own self-aggrandizement. What we see, here, is a common theme, within big tech, that dominant market share is used to cement monopoly and push competitors out of market. </p><p>That's fair to say, isn't it? </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, we have the same concerns you have. And that's why we formed the Technology Taskforce, to focus on, exactly, these issues. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: But what I'm saying to you is, we need more than a taskforce. We need action. The big tech companies are not waiting for you to finish your cases. Facebook has acquired more than 70 companies, over the past decade and a half. They are moving forward. They are cementing Instagram and WhatsApp. They are structuring their companies so that you can't unscramble the egg. </p><p>And that's why we pulled the trigger on Microsoft when we did and brought a lawsuit that we were prepared to try and we did try. So, I'm suggesting to you that the same urgency has to be brought to bear on big tech and I-- </p><p>SIMONS: --We share your urgency, Senator. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, I hope you evidence it in action, not this. </p><p>SIMONS: We're working on it. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Words. Let me ask, because my time is limited, to move to another topic. On the issue of the Ticketmaster Live Nation consent decree. Is the Department of Justice considering extending the merger conditions? </p><p>DELRAHIM: Senator, that's a--the consent decree expires next year. We have been examining allegations of violations. Beyond that, I can't comment about what we are finding or intend to do. But rest assured, it's one that we heard you loud and clear in your letter, as well as several folks. </p><p>One of the challenges that I fixed, when I arrived, is that all of our consent decrees going forward, since I've been confirmed, include provisions that forces the parties to agree to a lower standard for review. </p><p>The current, the organic standard for a violation of a consent decree, which is probably why we haven't seen enforcement of consent decrees, too many of them, is, was that a term has to be clearly unambiguous and you have to prove in the court by clear and convincing standard. I don't need to tell you how difficult of a standard that is. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: That is a difficult standard, I would agree but I hope you would agree with me that the merger conditions have been, largely, ineffective and there's a need for scrutiny and further review, here. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Absolutely. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Let me also ask you about group purchasing organization. As you know, GPOs were designed to keep cost down. But recent research has concluded that, in fact, they are a contributing factor to rising hospital costs, medication shortages and stifling introduction of innovative products from smaller companies. </p><p>What is the FTC doing to address behaviors like exclusionary and sole source contracting in GPOs and the medical device industry? </p><p>SIMONS: So, I can't talk, specifically, about any nonpublic investigation but these are things that we look at very regularly. I mean, yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Are you looking at them, now? </p><p>SIMONS: I'd have to check and get back to you. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I would appreciate you getting back--let me just suggest, that if you care about healthcare costs and every single member on a bi-partisan basis of this body cares about healthcare costs, every American cares about healthcare costs, you would answer yes, we are looking at it actively and aggressively because GPO's potentially contribute to the rising healthcare costs of our country. </p><p>So, I'd appreciate you getting back to me. </p><p>SIMONS: Yes sir.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: On that point, if I could, at the risk of interference-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Absolutely. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Is that some of the competition issues raised in that industry is due to Congress in 1997 provided an exemption from the Medicare anti-kickback statute and that exemption has been kicked in and it's a mile long and it has created a situation where some of these PPO's are buying exclusivity at the risk of innovation, at the risk of cost and the risk of lives of patients. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I have one more question and it concerns the automobile industry investigation that has been discussed. </p><p>To quote the former chief counsel to the DOJ antitrust division, Gene Kimmelman, I'm sure you both know him, he has said quote \"it has never been considered a violation of antitrust law for companies to get together and promote a policy decision\".  </p><p>Now I'm stating an axiom of antitrust law. Well known to both of you, that if manufacturers or retailers or anybody else get together to talk about a policy position, it is not a violation of the antitrust law. </p><p>How do you justify this investigation? </p><p>DELRAHIM: I'll take that one step further.  </p><p>It's not even a violation of antitrust law should they go to an agency and seek regulation or legislation. Supreme Court has said the antitrust laws don't trump the right to petition your government of the First Amendment. </p><p>However, it's been a clearly violation when there's collusive activity. In fact, there's a case in Michigan where auto dealers had agreed amongst themselves not to open on Sundays so they could observe church hours. The courts found that to be a violation.  </p><p>Attorneys agreed amongst themselves to increase the standard of representing indigent defendants. A goal that we all-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: They're simply agreeing they're going to follow existing state law. </p><p>DELRAHIM: So, we don't know, all I know is what was reported in there. That's not what they have said, and they don't need to agree amongst themselves to do so. </p><p>They could tomorrow disband the agreement and say, \"You know what, I'm going to agree to higher emission standards.\" </p><p>We don't have a problem with that, we would encourage that. I don't know why they need to agree amongst themselves to lower output. There's been an established policy to not do that and a policy towards competition rather than collusion regardless of the outcome. </p><p>We've seen that in Maricopa County where the physicians got together to set a max price for healthcare. Something we all support is lowering healthcare. </p><p>The Supreme Court said no, that's illegal you don't do it collusively. So that's-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --I hate to--have a longer discussion but I appreciate the chairman permitting me to ask that question. </p><p>LEE: You bet. Happy to do it but we've got a clock is ticking down on a vote.  </p><p>We rely on the good mercy of the cloak room staffs but Senator Whitehouse I understand you'd rather go first than after we recess and reconvene. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: If you don't mind, I'll follow up on Senator Blumenthal's questions because Mr. Delrahim every single example you just gave, it was collusive conduct by the group without the participation of a government, right? </p><p>DELRAHIM: Ah, I-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: What was your first example? </p><p>DELRAHIM: To be honest-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: The lawyers getting together. </p><p>DELRAHIM: The lawyers got together probably did not include the bar system but there have been many examples of this, including the North Carolina Dental Board, where the parties have done that. </p><p>So, it's not so much that just the government being involved in collusive conduct does not immunize that. The Supreme Court has been quite clear. You need to meet two prongs. There has to be a clearly articulated policy by the state, there also has to be-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --That's (INAUDIBLE) state action, that's different. This is like Noerr-Pennington getting together to address grievances. </p><p>DELRAHIM: They-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --How on earth is it possible that these four companies which have a very small share of the overall car market sitting down with California in these circumstances and negotiating their fuel standard with California is a violation and what the American Petroleum Institute does in this building every day, plotting and planning to try to defeat renewable energy, clean energy, electric vehicles.  </p><p>All of those groups, the entire fossil fuel industry out to try to damage its competitor. All day long they do this here. </p><p>The Koch Industries people defending their ability to refine and pollute with fossil fuel, Marathon Oil has fingerprints all over the whole auto cafe standards debacle. </p><p>It's just bizarre that of all the different political schemes that are going on right now to harm competition, the one you pick out, the one that you pick out is the one in which the White House has gotten itself enraged because its scheme on behalf of the oil industry to bust up the cafe standards got disrupted by the auto industry going to a different government and agreeing to a different rule. </p><p>DELRAHIM: If I may answer you. Two points that you've raised.  </p><p>First, it's not the one I've picked out. We have looked at the college admission counselors, we have looked at AP's in elite high schools, we have looked at-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --college admission counselors were going to a state and asking for permission to do a certain thing or asking for a certain regulation and you went after that as an antitrust violation? </p><p>DELRAHIM: No Senator, the college-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --well you're--you're, quite throwing apples when we're talking about oranges. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Well the conduct needs to be examined first. Then the immunity to that type of conduct-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --were you looking at the American Petroleum Institute? Have you looked at the fossil fuel industry's effort to combine and collude to manipulate Congress to squelch competition? That's perhaps the most obvious fact of our existence in this building. </p><p>DELRAHIM: I hear your point Senator. Let me just tell you we have not concluded there's a violation. All I have done so far is ask them for--to come in and explain to us if there was communication between them, the context of which and why they need to do that collusively. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: You don't think that the members of the American Petroleum Institute discuss with each other what they're going to ask their lobbying organization to do? </p><p>DELRAHIM: If they discussed-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: You (INAUDIBLE) the American Chemistry Council does that? </p><p>DELRAHIM: If they discussed prices and output, you would be sure I would go down on them and send them a letter, do you have any evidence? </p><p>There's been no reports that they have done that senator. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Fuel standards or prices? </p><p>DELRAHIM: Nor have I got-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Fuel standards or prices? </p><p>DELRAHIM: They have come to Congress as far as I know and just like you said that is protected under the First Amendment and I'm not defending them and I would defend their rights, these four car companies if that is what they did but that is not what has happened. </p><p>So, if you're telling me I can't even investigate four companies that might have colluded. We don't even know if they have agreed on prices. </p><p>We don't know if they have said, look any-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --you don't know if they agreed on price? Do you have any information that they've agreed on prices? </p><p>DELRAHIM: I have nothing. That's the purpose of an investigation. Doesn't mean I'm bringing a lawsuit tomorrow-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --ever heard of predication? You just fire off letters at random without any evidence that the misconduct is underway? </p><p>DELRAHIM: You fire off letters to ask them for information to see what the next step is. I don't know if you read the letter that I sent. I brought it hear, apparently some in the media have it but I'm going to read it for you because I think it should alleviate a lot of your concern. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: I doubt it but go ahead. </p><p>DELRAHIM: I'm somebody who's owned two Priuses and one of the first owners of Tesla. I'm not out there and I've lived in California. </p><p>Believe me I'm not out there to try to increase pollution into the air, but I have a duty to do and I'm not going to shirk that for political heat. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: The opposite is my suggestion to you. That you're doing this for political reasons, you're doing this because the administration is fed up and cross that they got their little scheme to bust up the cafe standards interrupted by California. </p><p>DELRAHIM: With respect senator I think once you hear the exact letter-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Put it into the record. Put it in the record, my time is up. What I would like to ask you to do though, was a question for the record is to ask for let's say a years' worth of such letters you've sent to other industries. </p><p>Again, this seems really unique. I mean I've been the Attorney General of my state. I've done antitrust work. It was always the gold standard that when a group of companies got together with a government to negotiate what the government standard would be and their adherence to it, that was protected. </p><p>So, to me, this rings all sorts of really strange bells. It's really bizarre and in the context of the long saga from the voluntary agreement with the Obama administration to the discomfort with some of the technical terms, to reopening the conversation to suddenly Marathon Oil and other companies barging in and running off with the conversation, forcing the auto industries to find a fair forum someplace to try to work this out. </p><p>The fair forum being the State of California, a government and now suddenly with the president evidently furious about having this little scheme disrupted, suddenly this very peculiar letter that doesn't seem to have either basis in Noerr-Pennington or a rationale in predication from you. </p><p>It looks an awful lot like scores are being settled here and God forbid that the Department of Justice should ever become the tool for political scores to be settled. </p><p>DELRAHIM: I agree with you on that senator and it's not what's going on here. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: We'll see. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Mr. Chairman, um, I just to follow up quickly, not a question but I've sent letters with Senator Grassley about the oil companies conduct Senator Whitehouse.  </p><p>When it comes to trying to push out anti-competitive moves for biofuels and how they've worked with gas stations and what they've done to try to limit the marketing of biofuels so I'd be happy to send those to you because I don't know if we've gotten much response when it comes to that. </p><p>LEE: We stand recessed subject to call of the chair. My best estimate is that we will be gone about 45 minutes. We'll make it back faster if we can.  </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>(RECESS) </p><p>LEE: We now reconvene. I--I apologize sincerely for the delay. It shouldn't take that long to cast four votes and it did. Welcome back. I've got a question I want to ask both of you. So given the dominant role that certain tech companies play in the public dissemination of information, dissemination of information particularly constituting news and commentary. It would be concerning if they were purposely undermining certain points of view. If there was sys--systematically doing so along partisan political lines for example.  </p><p>Should viewpoint bias--political viewpoint bias be the subject of antitrust enforcement? Mr. Delrahim, we'll start with you. </p><p>DELRAHIM: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>LEE: Hit the--hit the button if you will.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Sorry. I think senator, it's a--it's an important question as a matter of public policy and it's something that I think every American regardless of point of view should be concerned about. To the extent, it's part of the qualitative analysis of under antitrust law, I think that's a very legitimate question. So is a monopolist, somebody that has market power engaging in any kind of conduct that prevents a competitor who might, you know, have a different viewpoint or allow for different--diverse viewpoints into the marketplace, then I think the conduct that prevents that type of competition will have an impact on the viewpoint that ultimately gets to the consumer.  </p><p>So I think as if it's--is part of the qualitative analysis of monopolization in addition to price and output looking at, you know, choice and quality, I think it could be outside of that. I think it might be probably a better role. So if it's not within the four corners of traditional antitrust law as we look at it, then it's probably a better role for other public policy tools.  </p><p>SIMONS: Something similar mice--you know, the antitrust doesn't seem like it's a--like it's a tool that's well sculpted for this type of effort. So you--you know, if somebody just becomes successful and gets a big share because of their success, you could run into the same problems even though they haven't committed any--any--any competitive acts, right. You might also have a problem if, you know, the two biggest news organizations merged, you can have a problem for example. But my--my sense is that this--this would be something that would be better suited for another--another set of tools other than the ones that antitrust brings to bear.  </p><p>LEE: Got it. Mr. Delrahim, traditional market definition tools such as the hypothetical monopolist test typically rely on pricing information. Pricing information is either elusive or absent altogether in zero price markets where services are monetized through advertising. So what--what factors should the Antitrust Division consider in that type of market when conducting this type of analysis?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: It's a again an important element of our analysis. I gave a speech about zero price products and the division and the Federal Trade Commission for years, we have looked at markets that are priced zero to a set of customers, however there is a price tag. As an example, I'll give you no airplay over the radio for certain music the consumer is not paying for that however advertisers will, broadcast television is. And so we--we have to look at the tools of what is, you know, is this consumers preferences, are there substitutes for the product and ultimately, who is paying for that?  </p><p>Somebody is so let's just pick as a hypothetical example, a company that provides search services even though that search to the ultimate customer may not have actual price. The price of the search to the advertiser may be one area we could examine.  </p><p>LEE: Thank you that's helpful and so in that respect this isn't no, it's not completely unique, it is--there--there are some models you can look to. As part of your tech reviews, both of your agencies have been actively soliciting third-party complaints. I realize you have the need to talk to third party witnesses to investigate and potentially build a case, this makes sense. What I'm always fearful of is that I would never want to see U.S. antitrust policy start to look like antitrust enforcement in the EU, antitrust policy in the EU where the primary concern seems to be protecting competitors rather than competition itself. Mr. Delrahim, how will the Department of Justice ensure that U.S. antitrust policy in the tech space remains focused on competition rather than on competitors?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: That's a very important part of think of our antitrust regime and we would look at that. We have long-standing Supreme Court precedent that says the antitrust laws are not intended to protect competitors but competition itself and that's what we look at and our enforcement actions should be consistent with that we also work with our friends abroad including with the--the European Commission I think more and more we're seeing more convergence of course, they have a different regime both administratively and some of the substantive law under the treaty that they operate in. And so there are some differences but nothing more and more, I've been encouraged about the way they look at antitrust and how they apply it.  </p><p>LEE: Mr. Simons, I've heard arguments that data collected by large platforms give those platforms of--an unlawful, unfair competitive advantage and that in light of that competitive advantage, we should give these--we should require these platforms to give their competitors access to see their data. Is it appropriate in your view, Chairman Simons to treat these platforms as essential facilities and--and what--what if any concerns would you have with that kind of approach?  </p><p>SIMONS: No, I think it's not--not a good idea at all to treat them as essential facilities or public utilities because one of the great strengths of our system is that it produces innovation unlike anywhere else in the world and subjecting an industry to public utility type regulation runs the serious danger of squelching that.  </p><p>LEE: In February, the--the FTC announced the formation of its technology task force to monitor the tech industry. Is it fair to say that the FTC created the technology task force because there are benefits to having a dedicated staff focusing specifically on those issues?  </p><p>SIMONS: Yes, absolutely. </p><p>LEE: Why is that? </p><p>SIMONS: Because this--so we do this with a lot of different industries so we have a healthcare shop we haven't--we have an oil shop and those industries are such that if you have a background in the industry, it's easier to do in--a merger and valuation, easier to do an evaluation of any competitive conduct because you understand how competition occurs in that industry already.  </p><p>LEE: Did you can get that industry? So if you've got a dedicated pool of staff--of staff who are assigned to look for those factors, know what they're looking for and they know it and they find it?  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, so they've--they've--they've studied that particular industry, they know how it operates, they know the peculiarities. And--and some of the industries like, you know, hospitals for example, have a regulation overlay which is difficult to understand sometimes, and that's particularly true in--in the context of pharmaceuticals.  </p><p>LEE: So this will make you more effective in doing this?  </p><p>SIMONS: Yes.  </p><p>LEE: Then, if that's the case, if you're more effective in having a dedicated team like that, wouldn't you be more effective if you could consolidate those resources rather than having them split into two antitrust enforcement agencies?  </p><p>SIMONS: Sure.  </p><p>LEE: Do you disagree Mr. Delrahim?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Hard to disagree with that.  </p><p>LEE: See, my time is expired. Mr. Blumenthal.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your patience and thank you for continuing to be here. Chairman Simons, this past March, I sent a letter to your office urging the Federal Trade Commission to use its rulemaking authority to address non-compete clause in labor contracts. As you know, these clauses binding workers prevent them from obtaining better wages or working additions by prohibiting them from taking a job with their employer's competitors. I noted in my letter about 30 million American workers are bound by these kinds of compete clauses.  </p><p>Recently, at a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Van Hollen ask you about the timeline for completing your review of the evidence on non-compete and initiating rulemaking and you stated that the FTC's Bureau of economics would complete reviewing the relevant evidence in a matter of months, \"a matter of months.\" About four months have passed since then. Could you tell us the status of your review?  </p><p>SIMONS: Sure, I'd be happy to, senator. So we've got a--we've got a workshop that is coming up I think in October, in October. The review by the Bureau of economics has been concluded and they--they couldn't find enough econo--existing economic literature to--to justify a rule--rulemaking. So we're having this workshop to see if we can have other sources to justify it. And the point there being if--if--if we come up with sufficient support during the during the workshop, then we'll go to a rulemaking.  </p><p>And if we don't, then I think we're going to try another--another approach which would be to see if we can think about ways that we could develop evidence ourselves that would support a rule that perhaps would make non competes with--in certain situations what we call inherently suspect. So it's a presumption, its anti-competitive without having improved market power.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: So tell me again the timeline?  </p><p>SIMONS: So the timeline is--the--the workshop I think is in October. We'll see what happens with that. if we have enough support we'll go for a rulemaking, if we don't we'll develop--we'll try to develop our own economic evidence to support a rule. And this is--there's a historical example where we did--the Commission did something like this previously in the 70s with respect to restrictions on advertising.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Okay. I'm--I don't want to prejudge your workshop but I would be disappointed if you don't conclude there sufficient evidence for some kind of rulemaking there. I--I hope that will be. Let me ask you on another topic.  </p><p>I hope that you agree with me that most favored nations clauses can be anti-competitive? A number of academic articles have explained that as a matter of theory and in fact empirical practice. Under certain conditions, most favored nations clauses by a dominant internet platform can both raise prices to consumers and prevent entry stopped competitors. And I wrote you and Mr. Delrahim last year raising concerns about Amazon imposing on its sellers for use of its marketplace, a non-compete and most favored nation clause and I ask you to investigate.  </p><p>And magically, shortly after the letter, Amazon dropped the use of these clauses but Amazon is now engaging in the same behavior but in a different way. Bloomberg reported that Amazon has been penalizing or threatened to penalize sellers on its marketplace by pushing search results of their products down if they sell the same products for lower prices on other websites. You're familiar with this practice? I see you nodding.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, because I--I read the same papers that you read.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I'm not surprised so I think this practice is blatantly and obviously anti-competitive. It's in effect the same practice by a somewhat more cunning, clever, more devious approach. Isn't this a violation of law?  </p><p>SIMONS: I wouldn't want to prejudge an investigation. I--I wouldn't be able to talk about specifics-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I asked you to look into the prior practice, are you looking into this one?  </p><p>SIMONS: Sir, I can't really comment on an on public investigation but these are the types of things that the technology task force was designed to look at.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Will you perhaps provide me a more complete answer at some point? I know --understand, you know, that both of you and I've been in your shoes so to speak both as a U.S. attorney and state attorney general but I'm hoping perhaps you can be somewhat more forthcoming because again, going back to what I said before, the American public has expectations and hopes here for their enforcers.  </p><p>SIMONS: Sure.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And you can say it's under investigation without saying it violates the law.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, but we don't we don't disclose non-public investigations about specific companies as a general rule.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, let's say it wasn't by Amazon that it was by [INAUDIBLE] </p><p>SIMONS: Just--just--just--yes, just--just--no, no but just like hypothetically this is something that--that, you know, we--we review as potentially problematic.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. I have a question about the FCC's approval of SprintT-Mobile and the merger head of the Department of Justice. Mr. Delrahim, your division opposed the proposed SprintT-Mobile merger as it was originally filed and fought to require several large divestitures in the transaction.  </p><p>In its competitive impact statement, the Antitrust Division alleged that without substantial changes, this merger would \"would substantially lessen competition for retail mobile wireless service in the United States resulting in increased prices and less attractive service offerings for American consumers as the Antitrust Division stated the--this practice would violate the Clayton Act.\"  </p><p>But months before the Antitrust Division finished its assessment, the FCC chairman, Chairman Pai announced his glowing support for the same merger proposal that your division said would violate the law. And in his statement, he assured the public that T-Mobile's promises were enough and stated that \"the sale designed to address--the sale is designed to address potential competitive issues.\" The FCC required little almost nothing of T-Mobile and provided clearance before your division ultimately approved a merger with condition.  </p><p>This sequence of events strikes me as highly problematic. So my question to you is the does the Department of Justice agree with the FCC's conclusion that the original merger was \"designed to address potential competitive issues\" and when you originally reviewed the proposed merger didn't your staff find the deal to be ending competitive, anti-competitive, and recommend blocking it?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: So senator, the FCC, although Chairman Pai's a fantastic antitrust attorney who is an alumni of the Antitrust Division I should say. They look at their license transfer authority under the Public Interest test. There is some competition elements under the Supreme Court's RCA decision. However, they don't look at it the same matter nor the same markets as we do under the section seven of the Clayton Act had we not gotten--so they did what they did. They're an independent agency that has a different statutory construct and statutory mandate than we do.  </p><p>We were prepared to sue to block that transaction had we not gotten the remedies that we did and what some of the very important elements of the divestitures is that during the first three years, dish will be able to-- there's an MVNO deal that can offer without any limits on capacity the retail prices. And then there's incentivized structure by which they would have to build their own 5G network.  </p><p>It's a I think the ultimate resolution is output enhancing. It'll be pro-consumer and with the results it would have, you know--it wouldn't have been necessarily ideal but under antitrust law, the FCC's conclusions to approve that under the Public Interest test would not have had any presidential effect had we chosen to block that transaction and I was prepared to do so had we not gotten the divestiture that we got.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: But we've been talking here about overlapping jurisdictions. They--you're the ones with jurisdiction over competition and antitrust enforcement for him to say in those glowing terms that it promotes competition seems to be out of his lane.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Well, you know, the decisions of the Supreme Court with respect to the public interest says that they can look at competition as an element. However, that is not binding on our decision and had we brought a case, had the parties argued that somehow, the FCC's decision supplants ours, we would have vigorously argued against that.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, I guarantee you if you had brought a case, those words would have been stuffed down your throat in a courtroom. Correct?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Probably as would have their, you know, three-year price commitments would have been and therefore our modeling would have had to have been different. However, you know, fortunately we were able to get to a resolution that ultimately I think will be better for the consumer.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I have the this one last question Mr. Chairman, thank you. Thank you for that response. I still think there is a an issue here that since we've been talking about jurisdiction needs to be addressed. Chairman Simons, I think the Federal Trade Commission oughta be conducting retrospective reviews to determine the impact of consummated mergers. The Commission really conducts those kinds of reviews in the question for the record I submitted to you last year.  </p><p>You responded that the Commission is \"exploring the feasibility of conducting merger retrospectives in a number of industries.\" But you stated that the bureau of economic--\"the bureau of economics staff have not found a good candidate merger with data robust enough to enable a retrospective evaluation of the labor market effects.\" My question is have you found a suitable candidate for that kind of retrospective?  </p><p>SIMONS: So one thing I think we're going to look at is hospital mergers and their effect on labor. So we think that might be a really good--a good choice.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I would thoroughly recommend that review and I would appreciate the opportunity to make some suggestions to the staff within the limits that a member of Congress is permitted to do.  </p><p>SIMONS: We'd be happy to have your suggestions.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. That concludes my questions, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Chairman Simons, a little while ago, when we talked before we had to leave to go vote, I asked you if you were advising another country on how to set up its civil antitrust enforcement, would you ever set up a system where you had two agencies enforcing the same substantive law? You said no.  </p><p>I want to get back to that point briefly if we can. In light of that, why would you ever advise against combining the two agencies? Why would you advise against getting rid of the division that we have here?  </p><p>SIMONS: I haven't thought about that.  </p><p>LEE: Mr. Delrahim? </p><p>DELRAHIM: Again, as an administration official, I don't have an administration position but I don't see that we would object as far as looking at that and possibly that'd be a good solution going forward.  </p><p>SIMONS: Well one thing--one thing I do have to say is we have some characteristics of the Federal Trade Commission that are kind of unique and I think are very helpful.  </p><p>LEE: Sure. and you have authority that extends outside of antitrust law.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, and so that might not say that you should only have one but if you were only going to have one you might want to have one with those qualities. In other words, if you're just going to have one agency, you might want to have one that looked more like the FTC than the Justice Department.  </p><p>LEE: Right, that is probably a conversation reserved-- </p><p>SIMONS: I reserve the right to object, senator, right.  </p><p>LEE: Well said, I mean, each has some characteristics that the other one doesn't have. The Department of Justice has other tools that you don't have. You have a few tools that they don't have. So I get your point but thank you both for your candor on that point. Mr. Delrahim, the--the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees have been around for many decades and there is a lot of course that's changed in the music industry since then in terms of the way people experience music. But that doesn't answer the question of what--what has changed in the music industry on the licensing site itself that suggests that the consent decrees may no longer be needed.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Senator, it's a great question and it is not lost on us as far as the established reliance and the models that have been created around that. So there have been a couple of recent changes we've had some new Performing Rights organizations that have occurred in the last couple of year, that's a few years. We also have had a recent Second Circuit opinion dealing with fractional ownership and fractional licensing that has created some changes in that whole industry.  </p><p>We have made no decisions. We have recently as you well know and we informed you before we took any of these steps is that we put it out for notice and comment. From the public, we've received over 800 comments, we've made those public on our website, I think a week or so ago and now, we're in the process of taking a look to see, do those consent decrees. Are they actually serving as an--as an anti--in an anti-competitive matter to prevent new innovation or new licensing? One, two, does it make sense for the Antitrust Division to continue to be the regulator in this market again. The free market has not has not ruled as far as those. There's been a thumb on the scale with respect to the licensing and licensing rates.  </p><p>No question, it has provided some certainty within the marketplace given how many licensees there are. The number of radio stations, funeral homes, bowling alleys, hotel owners and--and such. And we are considering all of those. We will be in touch with the committee with this subcommittee and particularly knowing your interest in this and the direction and the music modernization act to communicate any direction we go in this area whether or not it needs to be modified, it needs to be sunset or to do absolutely nothing and I think we owe it to the public to examine that.  </p><p>LEE: Is there anything you can tell us about the timing of your review?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: We have not. So as I mentioned, we received the public comments, our staff who are the experts in our media and entertainment section are--are looking at it. They have not made any recommendations, they're tabulating the different comments that we have. As you can imagine, where you're drawing lines in the sand different interest within the industry have different points of view, so there's not one cohesive point of view but we have not.  </p><p>So no my guess is that within the next three to six months, we will have formulated some viewpoints. At least, we have analyzed the comments and at that time be delighted to share that with you.  </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Thank you, that's helpful.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Sure.  </p><p>LEE: I know you're both recuse from the Qualcomm matter. So I'm not going to ask you to--one of you to comment on the core merits or the theories behind those case but I--I think this case some of what has happened here illustrates the confusion and the wasted resources that can result when your two agencies don't see eye to eye.  </p><p>Now, I want to make one thing very, very clear here. I'm not--I'm not expressing frustration over the fact that you don't always see eye to eye; government agencies are not omniscient, they're not omnipotent, they're run by mortal human beings.  </p><p>Mortal human beings, sometimes, we'll look at the same close issue of law and reach different conclusions. I'm not saying that it's wrong that you've reached different conclusions. I'm saying that it's weird that we have a system set up that pits you against each other because stuff like this is inevitable. Frankly, I--as long as we're talking about things that are--are--are either mortal or immortal or fallible or not, it's nothing short of miraculous that you haven't had more of these instances in the past but I think it is--it would be an act of denial to suggest this is going to be an aberration.  </p><p>SIMONS: I think these stem from the same thing that you're--you're thinking about. So one is Qualcomm and one is the friend issue and I think it's the same view about intellectual property that causes the division with respect to both. So it's really those two are manifold and maybe pay-for-delay as well. Those--those things are manifestations of the--the same difference of opinion.  </p><p>LEE: No, I get that, I get that. But getting back to what I was saying earlier, one of my colleagues during--during questions suggested that, you know, somehow I was talking about the dual sovereign property. That's not my issue. My issue is not that there are two sovereigns involved in the issue the federal government and the state at issue. My concern is that within the federal sovereign we have two kings, two Caesars, two czars, whatever you want to call your agency.  </p><p>We have two enforcement agencies that are not always going to see eye-to-eye for this or that reason, for perhaps very legitimate reasons. So Mr. Delrahim, before Qualcomm, can you tell me when was the last time that the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice joined the litigation to oppose the position being advanced by the Federal Trade Commission?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: I am--I don't know if there was. However, I can't tell you in my last tour of duty at the department where I was the deputy for appellant international. We did file separately from another independent agency the Securities Exchange Commission. In the Second Circuit, we had two different views where we did not believe that unless there's a repugnant conflict between the two regimes, there should be an implied immunity from the antitrust laws.  </p><p>The Securities Exchange Commission at the time took a different view, the Solicitor General agreed with our point of view and we filed two separate briefs in the Second Circuit. I also-- </p><p>LEE: Yeah, that's messed up but-- </p><p>DELRAHIM: It is. I also know that again, back then, when there was the viewpoint also from the Federal Trade Commission that came to the division in the--I believe the Schering-Plough case where I belief it was the Sixth Circuit or the Eighth Circuit where they had--the Federal Trade Commission had lost on a theory that the department did not agree with and they have certain authority to independent litigate in the Supreme Court came to the division, the Solicitor General and the Antitrust Division did not agree with that theory of per se law, you know, the illegality of certain paper delays when it was within the term of the patent and the FTC went up, then the of course the Chief Justice was not unfamiliar with the solicitor's office asked for the cert worthiness view of the Solicitor General and they took an opposite position with the Supreme Court in that same case.  </p><p>So it has happened, it's unfortunate. I think we--we do our best to avoid that whenever we can but those are--those are important politics. I should also note, it's not just FTC and DOJ, you know, perhaps in the Qualcomm case with the--and the FTC there's there appeared to be at least publicly different viewpoints amongst the commissioners. So, you know, there is dissent but it's not just necessarily just the two agencies.  </p><p>LEE: Sure, sure. And within the FTC they do have rules that determine when the Commission is taking a position and when it isn't in the absence of unanimity. You want to identify in other instances like that?  </p><p>SIMONS: No, the only--the only one I was thinking of was the Schering-Plough one. That's the only one I'm aware of.  </p><p>LEE: So I--I again I want to emphasize the problem is not that these things happen the problem is that they can happen and the fact that they do sometimes happen with other agencies between other agencies other than your two doesn't make it any more acceptable here and that is and ought to be a concern especially in something like antitrust, whereas the civil enforcement agencies for antitrust laws, you have to investigate, you have to reach a conclusion and where you have even the possibility of multiple investigations involving the same conduct, the same actor or actors, the same substantive law, you've got this almost unavoidable opportunity for conflict. It really undermines either agency's ability to do what it needs to do. Senator Blumenthal.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Mr. Chairman, can I just make two quick points for the record so the records can reflect this? First is Senator Whitehouse had asked any instances where there's been collusive activity, where there's been a state actor in North Pennington and there's the case of ally tube (SP) at the Supreme Court is an important one where there was collusive activity this was about standards for, you know, different types of tube to be used. There was state--  </p><p>LEE: Tell me about one that was--with you--it's okay if you don't remember.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: I do not remember. I want to say in the late 70s--  </p><p>LEE: Like 1980.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: When was that?  </p><p>LEE: It was like 1980. </p><p>DELRAHIM: Yeah, so it was 80 when it was decided by the Supreme Court where the defense of North Pennington because there was a state actor there was advanced and Supreme Court rejected that. So that's one. The other is that you had asked a question about, you know, kind of the tech agencies and the--and the expertise and I agree with the Chairman why it's important to have that in each agency and--and commend them for creating the technology task force and I just wanted to let the record reflect and for you to know that the division has had what used to be called Network and Technology section.  </p><p>Senator Blumenthal will know because that's the section that brought the Microsoft case almost 20 years ago and that--they--they were the ones that have continued their activity in this industry and they're the ones who are engaged in--in our current inquiry in the tech industry and it continues to be an important element because they continue to build expertise in that.  </p><p>Thank you, that's helpful. Senator Blumenthal.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Let me ask you about that group within your division. Does it actively and regularly consult with the tech task force that operates within the FTC?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: That's a good question. I think the instructions have been in the areas. So I do know that in one of the matters that were involved with that is public and Google, we have been in touch with the FTC as, you know, the FTC in 2000 belief 11 and then 15 had had investigations in Google, they had certain not only documents but expertise that we could benefit from and there has been communication to coordinate on that and I believe that we intend to do that as we do with all the state AG's. Wouldn't it make sense doesn't it make sense for there to be an active and regular protocol of consultation if you're both investigating the same company.  </p><p>I mean, it's fine for the two of you to express your intent to cooperate but as a practical matter, as we all know, as law enforcers, what really matters is the staff and the investigators and the economists and the people on the ground, getting evidence in your FTC investigation as we discussed earlier, you have evidence that is highly relevant to Facebook's potential use of user information that stifles competition or consolidates and increases its monopolistic power which could be relevant to what your investigation may concern.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Absolutely, I think it makes perfect sense. We do a lot of that. There's a number of matters where we do, you know, as I mentioned before, the safe landings, there's a lot that we do jointly to try to increase each other's capacity to be better enforcers.  </p><p>LEE: Now, that happens a lot different areas as well. not just tech.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chair, yeah, that's good to hear. Let me ask you coming back to the health care issue, we talked earlier about GPOs. I'm very concerned that mergers in the pharmaceutical industry and the potential impacts of those mergers on competition, innovation prices, I apologize if you covered this ground already.  </p><p>Participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain including manufacturers and PBMs are known to engage in behaviors essentially designed for close competition. One form of competitive behavior is called a rebate wall or a rebate trap which allows manufacturers to leverage patient volume to block a competitor's access to formulary. </p><p>I know this areas somewhat complicated I'm not going to try to go into the details because we're late in the day. But it's detrimental to low-cost brand drug biosimilar access and it can have detrimental impacts on patients who could be benefiting from life-saving drugs and treatments, In fact, biosimilars which are extremely expensive to develop compared to other types of drug has struggled to take off in the U.S. market because of those rebate traps and other exclusionary predatory practices by large pharmaceutical companies.  </p><p>Those practices are designed to maintain their market share. I'm not going to repeat the exhortation that I did earlier today. But Americans are looking for you to do everything possible--both of you in reducing health care costs at every level; employers, businesses, patients. What is the FTC doing to address the practice of rebate traps and similar behaviors?  </p><p>SIMONS: Yes, in our health care shop is focused on health care and this is one of the things that they're--they're thinking about. So if this is--this is the type of thing that you're talking about market foreclosure particularly with firms that might have significant market power. This is, you know, this is the--this is the type of thing that we--that we should be looking at and are looking at.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I know you're not going to tell me whether you have specific companies under investigation but do you have an active investigation concerning rebate traps or rebate walls?  </p><p>SIMONS: I'd have to check on that.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Could you get back to me about that?  </p><p>SIMONS: Yes.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. And on September 12th as you may know, a number of consumer groups wrote a letter expressing concern about the Allergan (SP) have you--merger. One of their concerns if this acquisition is consummated is that the merge firm will have an increased ability to bundle rebates. Are you familiar with the letter and, you know, this pract--possibility concern you?  </p><p>SIMONS: I haven't seen the letter and sorry, I'm in the dark a little bit about exactly what it says. But it certainly we'll--we'll take a--take a good look at it.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And would you perhaps get back to me in writing about your response to the letter as well?  </p><p>SIMONS: Sure, I mean but you just keep in mind that again it's a non-public investigation so we couldn't provide you details about what we're doing right in the context of that.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Okay, thank you both.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Just to--related to that senator, and--and your state should be commended for its leadership in the generic pharmaceutical criminal matter that we have and that's an area where, you know, the Federal Trade Commission has great expertise in the pharmaceutical area. There's been price-fixing, we've had three guilty pleas, we had a deferred prosecution agreement that we entered into due to some complications at HHS where had we indicted the company, they would have had to be necessarily excluded from a number of federal programs. So instead of eliminating competition, we chose to do that and stay tuned, there's going to be several others coming up.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: That is--I'm delighted to hear it. Maybe you can also tell me and I--I join you in commending our present Attorney General for his aggressive pursuit of those criminal and civil potential antitrust violations in the generic market and it makes me miss my old days as attorney general. But can you tell me whether the Department of Justice has an active investigation concerning opioid manufacturers?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: It's not--I can't say anything about the with respect to the Antitrust Division or outside of the Antitrust Division. I can say there have been a number of actions on the both of the civil side as well as others but I'll--I can get back to you broadly from the department's activities in that area.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I'd appreciate that, thank you both for being here today and for your testimony. Thank you.  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Thank you.  </p><p>LEE: Next Tuesday, the subcommittee will be holding another hearing which we'll look at the acquisition--the--look at acquisitions are of nascent or potential competitors by digital platforms. As you both know, many platform markets are somewhat subject to tipping, meaning that the that the firm ends up gaining power, gaining the upper hand, early on often has very significant durable market power.  </p><p>Mr. Delrahim, in your opinion, is--is legislation needed to address this issue or can the agencies already manage this issue through their enforcement of the Clayton or Sherman Act?  </p><p>DELRAHIM: Senator, I believe that the guidelines the horizontal merger guidelines could address some of these issues where a company has significant market share and is trying to acquire that. We have recently filed a case in Delaware against Sabre who is a crime--acquiring Farelogix with exactly that theory or some variations of that, we'll let you know how that pairs out.  </p><p>I think the current laws, you know, in a I--I think with the right theory and the right set of facts a current laws should be able to address that if there is in fact a pattern of acquisition in order to kill what could be the competitor as a violation of the section two.  </p><p>LEE: You agree with that Mr. Simons?  </p><p>SIMONS: Yes. And another thing--another thing-- </p><p>LEE: Hit the button.  </p><p>SIMONS: Sorry, and yes and another thing that we're looking at is the use of section two, monopoly maintenance claims to go after acquisition programs of nascent competitors because we think in that sense, the--the burden on the plaintiff to show harm is less and so we think that might be a very advantageous Avenue.  </p><p>LEE: I want to thank both of you for coming here today and for your patience well we had to go and vote. I especially want to thank you for your service to our country and within your respective agencies and the thoroughness with which you undertake your job, the seriousness with which you take them. Our record for today will remain open for two weeks. We stand adjourned.  </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X38-CJD1-JDPT-T01J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

CORY BOOKER (D-N.J.) </p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CALIF.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]LEE: Welcome to this hearing of the subcommittee of the Antitrust Consumer Policy--Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. Today, we're pleased to have with us four distinguished witnesses to testify about digital platform acquisitions of nascent competitors. Well, we appreciate your taking the tie today and to come and share your wisdom with us. There's a bit of feeding frenzy these days, when it comes to antitrust in the world of big tech. And while I'm encouraged that the FTC and the DoJ are investigating in whether the tech giants have violated antitrust laws, I'm also concerned that we might overshoot the mark in our efforts to reign in those firms. One area where it's critical that we get the balance right is in the context of tech mergers, especially in acquisitions of nascent, or potential competitors by digital platforms.  </p><p>Clearly, we wanna ensure that the competition is not harmed in tech markets to that we can all enjoy the benefits of innovation and consumer choice, two things that have come to distinguish this sector of our economy. Platform markets are prone to tipping, which can lead to durable market power and to barriers on entry. So, acquisitions by dominant platforms that gobble up would-be rivals to eliminate them before they can pose a competitive threat should be prevented and should be something that we're concerned about. At the same time, we also need to recognize that sorting out the problematic acquisitions from the beneficial ones may not always be an easy task.  </p><p>If we restrict tech mergers too much and prevent pro-competitive acquisitions, then we run the risk of potentially harming the startup ecosystem that fuels many of the consumer innovations that we enjoy today that have occurred in this industry. I look forward to discussing how to balance those two competing interests, today. Before we get started, let me say a few words about the Oversight Hearing we held last week, with the Heads of the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. They both confirmed what I've long believed, which is that it makes no sense, no sense at all to split civil antitrust enforcement between two federal agencies.  </p><p>Once more, they've both confirmed that it would be wasteful for each agency to investigate the same conduct, by the same firm, under the same subset standard of law. Nevertheless, our federal antitrust agencies seem intent on dividing monopolization investigations, on the same tech companies and between themselves. When he was here last week. Mr. Delrahim, who of course heads the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division suggested that the DOJ and FTC can split up a monopolization investigation of the same company, so long as each agency looks at different conduct.  </p><p>But as I said at the time, there's no analytical basis for splitting up a monopolization investigation. Despite Mr. Delrahim suggestion to the contrary, you just cannot run a monopolization investigation piecemeal, it doesn't work. It wouldn't make sense to have the FTC looking into whether a platform used a series of acquisitions to maintain market power, while the DoJ was simultaneously looking into whether that same firm had exploited data in some way, to exclude rivals. It's all the same offense.  </p><p>You have to look at the totality of the company's efforts in attaining or maintain market power. So, you don't split up this exercise between two agencies and yet, that's exactly what existing law does. I know the antitrust agencies are working with limited resources. I also know that they have a lot on their plates and that they're working hard and in good faith. So, I--I expect that they'll use their resources to ensure that we have the most effective and efficient civil antitrust enforcement possible. This means we should not see both agencies wasting taxpayer money by carrying on with the same investigation of the same company at the same time, under the same substantive standards of federal law. Senator Klobuchar will now give her opening statement.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon to our witnesses and welcome, thank you for coming to this very timely hearing. As I mentioned at the hearing last week, America truly has a monopoly problem. We know the statistics, we know that--the effect that it's having, I actually started my day today with Senator Scott, we formed this entrepreneurship caucus and we had 20 women entrepreneur startups and we are now experiencing what we call the \"startup slump\" in that we are at a--a record low number of startups in decades. And as I said to them, today, there are many reasons for that but one of them I believe is that we have too much monopolization, and it's too hard to get into these markets.  </p><p>One study the non-partisan Brookings Institution observed a broad base decline in startup rates going back to 1979. Another study found a 26 percent decrease in new business formation from 2006 to 2015. The American people know that competition is key to the health of our markets, and if we want to build the next great new American company, we have to allow those ideas to take seed. And what I'm really concerned about is that it's getting harder and harder to do that. It's clear that much of the recent interest in competition issues comes from legitimate concerns about the major online platforms. This is no surprise because of the technical world we are living in, and it makes sense that these digital platforms are receiving so much attention.  </p><p>They are with us from the moment that we wake up in the morning to when we fall asleep at night. And all of us are hearing stories about some--of how some of the companies are treating users, business partners and the handful of competitors that are still independent. For instance, just yesterday the Wall Street Journal published an article about Snap's 'Project Voldemort' dossier on aggressive tactics that Facebook has used against its rivals, and that's just one of the many signs of the ever-increasing dominance of these digital platforms is threatening competition. I am encouraged that this investigation is starting with the FTC and the Justice Department, I am not nearly as concerned as my colleague as I pointed out last week, about how the pie is separated. As I said last week, I'm more concerned the consumers are gonna end up with a pie in their face if we don't start taking action soon.  </p><p>So, much of our discussion is focused on of course, big mergers in this committee, and given the limited resources compared to these sophisticated companies a lot of the Justice Department and FTC research and resources are going into these big deals: T-Mobile-Sprint, AB InBev Comcast-NBC Universal we just--I just commented on some pharmaceutical mergers and that's understandable because when a big deal is anti-competitive, it has big consequences. But as we're gonna talk about today, maybe these acquisitions that we're talking about aren't the most valuable in terms of dollars, because the acquisition targets are usually smaller companies or startups.  </p><p>Some are small enough to avoid federal merger filling requirements all together, so the agencies aren't even notified that it happens. But make moment--no mistake, if digital giants use strategic acquisitions to snuff out emerging or potential future competitor, the harm may not be as immediately obvious, but those harms are no less damaging or enduring in the long run. A recent white paper issued by Dr. Moss indicated that the five most valuable tech firms: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook have completed more than 700 acquisitions since 1987, and looking back, some of these deals raise significant concerns. It's easy to say that these deals are only troubling in hindsight and that the agencies could not have predicated what would happen when they looked at these mergers.  </p><p>But for many of these acquisitions industry observers raised concerns right away. That was true for Facebook, Instagram and Google Waze and Google AdMob and others. When Google bought DoubleClick, former Commissioner Harbour dissented from the FTC's decision to close its investigation without taking action, laying out alternative predications about how the acquisition would harm competition. Looking back, we know she was right. And digital platforms continue to buy startups. Just yesterday news broke that Facebook is looking to buy CTRL-labs, a startup that is developing an arm-worn device to read brain signals.  </p><p>This will likely be merged with the ongoing work of Facebook's Reality Labs division on brain input devices. We expect the agencies would look at this kind of deal and others like it, and I think they should be looking backwards and retroactivity at some of the deals that have already been made. As a former prosecutor, I appreciate the difficulty in weighing the evidence, and building a case that can win, under the circumstances that we are in, with a conservative court and with limited resources. But as a lawmaker with oversight responsibility for antitrust enforcement, I have questions about the enforcement agency's ability to assess the likely competitive impact of these types of acquisitions, the adequacy of the legal tools available and how agencies can, as I mentioned, look back at prior deals. </p><p>In an area of antitrust where there will always be uncertainty, I strongly urge the agencies to err on the side of protecting competition, especially when dealing with dominant digital platforms. I have some bills on this, I'm not gonna go through them again, but they involve more resource, they involve changing some of the standards when we look at some of these deals and also deterring monopolies, a bill that I recently introduced with Senator Blumenthal which would grant the antitrust agencies the power to seek serious civil fines from monopolization offenses, including those involving acquisitions that would create or maintain a monopoly.  </p><p>Finally, we need to discuss whether additional legal presumptions might be effective in preventing harmful acquisitions by digital platforms. We should also of course, talk about these retrospective merger reviews, taking a look back in time may reveal merger effects that were not apparent before closing. Although concerns with big tech go beyond competition into privacy election security bills that I have near and dear to my heart, effective antitrust enforcement has a crucial role to play. Competition lowers prices, improves quality and spurs innovation. That is why the competition enforcement is so critical to the future of the digital sector. Open competitive markets are what allowed these digital platforms to grow and to thrive. We must ensure that the next generation of American technology firms have the same opportunities. I look forward to your testimony and Mr. Chair, the subcommittee has received letters on the topic of today's hearing from consumer reports of Spiegel Center at the University of Chicago, (INAUDIBLE) and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and I would like to submit them into the record.  </p><p>LEE: Without objection.

Prior to joining Trinity Ventures, Miss Nakache worked for McKinsey &amp; Company. We'll start with you Mr. Hoffman and go down the list in the order we introduced you.  </p><p>HOFFMAN: Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to be here before you today. I'm pleased to testify on behalf of the commission about our enforcement approach to acquisitions of nascent and potential competitors by digital platforms. Let me start by nothing that the written statements submitted for this hearing represents the views of the Federal Trade Commission, but my oral statement and answers to questions today represent only my own views and not necessity the views of the Federal Trade Commission or any commissioner.  </p><p>As everyone I think is well aware, we in terms of both the United Stets economy and the world economy are in a period of huge innovation, huge change and huge--huge disruption. But I think it's also clear that that does not prevent anti-competitive conduct and mere change, mere innovation are not enough. And in fact, the Microsoft case showed us 20 years ago in a period of similar change and similar ferment in the economy that dominant firms can identify, target and attempt to extinguish developing threats, even very early in the development of those threats. We are alert to that as for example our recent monopolization case against Surescripts shows. Surescripts we allege is a digital platform in the e-prescription space, which engaged in similar conduct aimed at stifling nascent competition and we have brought a suit against them.  </p><p>The hearing today focuses on one potential form of anti-competitive conduct, which is acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors by dominant firms. Let me start by saying that this is a completely viable theory of anti-competitive harm. Buying a rival is one way of killing a rival, potentially. We share the concern that has been expressed, that is embodied in the statement of--that's articulated in this hearing and we had taken action. We actually have several pending investigations in different markets looking at nascent or potential competition issues. We recently won a trial in a case called Ottobock and Freedom Innovations involving an acquisition by a dominant firm of a competitor that was largely nascent, existing competitor, but very small where the competitive concern was more about the future than the present or the past.  </p><p>Last year, in the digital platform space, we blocked the dominant platform CDK's acquisition of its rival Auto/Mate, this was in dominant platforms for applications for car dealerships. We brought a litigation challenge against that merger, which was abandoned, as a result of our action. As laid out in our prepared testimony, the commission is committed to promote--devoting our resources to this area. This year, we formed the Technology Task Force, which is designed to marshal resources and expertise from across the commission to deal with this issue and others that are related to it, and that group is actively conducting investigations as we speak.  </p><p>Let me close by identifying I think three important issues to consider as discuss these topics. Number one, as I think was identified in both statements, every acquisition of a startup by an incumbent is not necessarily bad, nor is it good. Both things are possible acquisitions of startups can involve the acquisition of compliments, of services that are brought more quickly or better to market than would otherwise be the case, or it could involve eliminating competitive threats. The key is, what are the specific facts in the specific transaction?  </p><p>Second, even for past acquisitions, it's not also easy to tell if they were pro or anti-competitive. We have been told that acquisitions that resulted in the product that was acquired not coming to market were anti-competitive because it didn't come to market. We're also told that acquisitions that resulted in the product that was bought coming to market faster or better than it otherwise would have were anti-competitive because they had that result. Both of those things could be true, or neither could be true. It depends again on the particular facts, merger review is a very fact-specific exercise. Third, and in some respects maybe more importantly, it's important to note that our ability to review these kinds of transactions often depends on help form the public.  </p><p>The HSR Act allows us to review certain kinds of transactions before they're consummated. It covers a lot, but it does not cover every (INAUDIBLE). We scrutinize markets carefully to look for transactions that are otherwise not reportable, but we don't find everything, and we ask for the public's help in finding them, and we get it. The Ottobock case that I mentioned before was brought to us by the public. People identified and we sued and as I said, we recently won that case in trial. We take this very seriously, but we do need help. Thank you again for this opportunity to share our reviews of these important issues. We look forward to continue to work with the subcommittee and Congress, and I'd be happy to answer questions.  </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Dr. Moss?  </p><p>MOSS: Thank you Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, and members of the subcommittee, it's an honor to be here today. The large digital market players maintain broad ecosystem of business to consumer and business to business markets. Many of these comprised platforms, or sets of technologies upon which other technologies and applications interoperate. The growth of these firms is a function of several factors, including winner take all, organic growth, and expansion through acquisition. AAI recently analyzed merger enforcement data for the digital sector and concluded that the agency's record has been extraordinarily weak.  </p><p>Big tech made over 700 transactions over the last 20--32 years, the history of which involves large swaths of serial acquisition in advertising, business analytics, big data, artificial intelligence, Cloud computing e-commerce enterprise software and IT. Between 2001 and 20--2018, about 240 deals in a major category of big tech were reportable to the agencies, less than 20 percent of which were cleared to either the FTC or the DoJ. This mean that while the rate of second requests is on average higher than across all sectors, the challenge rate for big tech deals is far lower than across all sectors.  </p><p>This record may indicate that the agencies are either not finding that transactions raise concerns, or they are not comfortable challenging them. Several factors probably explain this weak enforcement record. Digital players may be strategically pursuing deals that fly under the antitrust radar. History tells us that the agencies are hesitant to challenge deals where they weigh the cost of blocking benign deals, more heavily that the costs of allowing harmful deals. It's also possible that enforcers perceive that they have inadequate tools to assess complex mergers. But we know that the consumer welfare standard can address the myriad issue such as zero price, multisided markets and non-price dimensions of competition.  </p><p>This is evident from investigations into Google DoubleClick, Google AdMeld and Google ITA. In other words, enforcers appear to have the tools they need, they just need to use them. More troubling is the idea that weak enforcement in the digital sector results from the fact that many competitive concerns are cognizable under antitrust law, but they may not be reachable in practice because evidentiary standards are too high to address unique features of the platforms.  </p><p>This includes the interconnected ecosystems of markets and the durable competitive advantage of the platforms. This is compounded, this problem is compounded by antitrust focus on narrow markets, one acquisition at a time which collectively miss the longer-term effects of serial acquisitions on raising market concentration. I wanna emphasize that antitrust is the lead tool for addressing competition concerns but it is not well-suited to address broader social policy concerns that have originated--that have arisen in the digital sector. Moreover, antitrust is not designed to be used as a vehicle for implementing industrial policy, such as comprehensive breakups that are not well-founded or based on identified competitive harms.  </p><p>Using antitrust in these ways can stymie enforcement at a time when we need to strengthen it, clarify it and invigorate it. That means that antitrust should serve as--as the tip of the spearhead, in a--in a policy portfolio approach for the digital sector that includes other complementary policy tools, such as social regulation for addressing systemic privacy breeches, access and interoperability standards to promote switching and consumer choice.  </p><p>So, what can we do to strengthen merger enforcement in the--in the digital sector? First, we need stronger presumptions. This includes new presumptions for acquisitions and potential competitors that lower evidentiary standards and shift burdens to acquiring firms. We need new vertical presumption that focus on high concentration and vertical foreclosure. And we need the rigorous application of the existing structural presumption in highly concentrative mergers. Second, we need to ramp up retrospective analysis of mergers. If there is evidence of post-merger harm, the agencies should use their authority to challenge consummated deals.  </p><p>Third, improved agency transparency is vital through press releases and closing statements. Finally, I would suggest a blue-ribbon committee should be formed and tasked with evaluating the need for possible new digital markets legislation. The committee would consider goals and parameters and proposals, including an independent regulatory oversight authority and how that authority would collaborate with antitrust enforcers to advise on technical matters that affect the agency's competition mandate. In sum, it is time to address the weak record of merger enforcement in the digital sector, with tractable and sensible policy proposals that will gain bipartisan support from our competition, protect consumers and stimulate innovation. Thank you and I look forward to your questions.  </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Professor Yun?  </p><p>YUN: Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, and members of the subcommittee, thank you very much for offering me the opportunity and privilege to appear before you here, today. I just wanna spend the first few moments just clarifying the concepts of nascent and potential competitors, simply because these are often used conjunctively but they are--they mean two separate things. Generally speaking, potential competition is a product that does not yet exist but is predicted to exist or could exist very quickly. Thus, it's really a forecast about entry or the potential for entry.  </p><p>Whereas nascent competition is about a product or technology that exists gut has not fully matured into a significant competitor, whether within or outside the same relevant product market. Like potential competition, nascent competition can be a forecast of entry reposition or expansion, but it also involves a forecast of future differentiation or development of a product or technology and its level of market success. In order to understand both concepts, we must understand the proper counterfactual. For instance, what if Google did not purchase YouTube, what would these products look like today? Would consumers be better off?  </p><p>Given the nature of the exercise, they'll always be some degree of uncertainly and we can never actually observe the counterfactual. For example, let's--let's look at Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012. At the time of the purchase, Instagram had zero revenues and a handful of employees. Since that time, Instagram has grown from 30 million users to well over 1 billion. During the same period Facebook group formed approximately 900 million to over 2 billion users. This substantial expansion in output in users in a relatively short period of time is the complete opposite of what we would normally consider a anticompetitive outcome.  </p><p>Importantly, the success of big tech platforms is not guaranteed. We don't have to look any further than Google Plus, which launched in 2011, with the support of 1,000 Google engineers. In 2019, Google Plus was perhaps mercifully shut down. Consumers clearly voted with their feet or eyeballs and directed their attention to other products and platforms. The Google Plus example illustrates the difficult in making predictions about market success and projecting future competitive effects. As the great Yogi Berra once allegedly said, \"Predications are hard, especially about the future.\" Clearly, the acquisition of a potential or nascent competitor can result in an outcome that is harmful to consumers and innovation, yet it can also unlock a great deal of value as well.  </p><p>Based on the current evidence and scholarship, I believe the U.S. Federal Antitrust Laws and the enforcement of those laws are sufficient and effective. The doctrines of potential and nascent competition are well-developed and were actually first developed by the US Antitrust authorities. The agency should and must continue to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws. As a society, we want technology companies both large and small to behave properly and to innovate within the bounds of conducts that's based on the merit, rather than on the ability to control the market, keep competitors out and lower consumer welfare.  </p><p>Are there things we can and should do right now? I believe there are three potential options that are worthy of your consideration. First, in our increasingly data-driven world, I believe that more economists should be hired at the agencies, in expertise such as machine learning, econometrics, labor and finance. Second, I believe the FTC should seriously consider exercising their 6(b) authority and looking at past acquisitions and examining whether there were good or bad for consumers.  </p><p>Finally, I would advocate for greater transparency to the public and to policy makers, for all major policy decisions from the agency, including decisions to close without action or with consent, just to give greater transparency to the public. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to today's discussion.  </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Professor Nakache.  </p><p>NAKACHE: Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My name is Patricia Nakache, and I serve as a general partner at Trinity Ventures, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, California. As an investor, I partner with world class technology entrepreneurs who are building innovative products and services for the American public. I also serve on the Board of The National Venture Capital Association and am testifying in that behalf. VC backed companies have had an outside positive impact on the economy. One academic study found that 42 percent of all US company IPOs from 1974 to 2015 were venture-backed and those companies accounted for 85 percent of all R&amp;D spending and 63 percent of the total market capitalization of public companies formed since 1974.  </p><p>When VCs like myself are evaluating whether to invest in a startup looking to compete directly against a large incumbent, we consider a number of factors. These include whether the founder has a unique and important insight into the market and is developing a differentiated product or service, whether she has crafted a marketing and sales strategy that will enable her to grow--grow with the company quickly and whether the leadership team of the startup can execute nimbly against larger competitors. Startups building products that serve customers only marginally better than large incumbents will likely find it challenging to secure a VC investment. Similarity, startups building superior products but competing in markets for incumbents are nimble and deep pocketed may also find it difficult to secure VC investment.  </p><p>I have been asked to speak to the views of the venture capital industry, as policy makers consider whether and how to apply our antitrust laws to large digital platforms. There are diverse views about this topic in the VC industry. It should come as no surprise, given that venture capital firms are partnership composed of individuals with varying professional experience and perspectives. Certainly, on the one hand, there  have been some venture capitals that have grown frustrated by practices of large tech companies that can have an outsized negative impact on startups. For example, through periodic changes to their algorithms, large technology companies that have significant consumer reach can dramatically affect, overnight the traffic flowing to startup websites and mobile apps.  </p><p>And this is a--related to the article that Ranking Member Klobuchar was--was referring to regarding Snap today. At the same time, other venture capitalists believe the startup ecosystem benefits in many ways from large technology incumbents. For example, these VCs point out startups often view larger companies as potential customers and distribution channels and that talented employees at these incumbents often go off to start their own companies and pursue their entrepreneurial dream. And of course, M&amp;A activity has always been an important avenue for liquidity, for risk-taking entrepreneurs and investors and has become even more so in recent years, with technology incumbents the most active acquirers of tech startups.  </p><p>Venture capitalists are not necessarily one or the other of the two camps I have described. In my experience, the vast majority of venture capitalists see both sides of this argument. We are passionate about the startups we invest in and want them to get a fair shake in the marketplaces they take on incredible challenges. At the same time, we recognize the large incumbents are adjacent to startups in the tech ecosystem and that action taken against these companies could have adverse and unforeseen consequences for young companies. In examining this area, it's important to understand that many young companies cannot realistically achieve the scale necessary to become standalone public companies.  </p><p>Furthermore, the public markets are not nearly as welcoming of small companies as they once were, and the result, there are now roughly half the number, of the total number of public companies than they were just 20 years ago. This means that often M&amp;A is the most viable pathway for a startup. If the government makes it more challenging for incumbents to acquire these companies, this will have a devastating effect on making it less attractive to launch a new enterprise. The end result will be harm to the American innovation economy. In the majority of acquisitions, the larger competitor is seeking to acquire a startup to complement existing business or offer new services to their customer base.  </p><p>It is likely a ministry of cases where an incumbent is engaging in the acquisition to directly stifle a future competitor. Furthermore, at times small competitors will merge in an effort to take on a larger competitor, and it's important not to stifle that activity either, as these smaller market participants do not have the resources to participate in exhaustive government proceedings. I encourage these policy makers to act deliberately in making changes. I'm very supportive of efforts to improve the IPO market but the reality is, even the best efforts will not open up the IPO markets for smaller companies in the short-term. That means that M&amp;A will remain critical to the startup ecosystem for the foreseeable future. If this option is hampered, investment into startups will suffer and cause a massive drag on innovation and mew company formation. I thank the committee for its attention and will be pleased to answer any questions.  </p><p>LEE: Thank you very much, we're each gonna begin a series of seven-minute question rounds, with taking turns between Republicans and Democrats. It seems to happen every time we have an Antitrust Subcommittee hearing, the scheduled votes for 3:30 are a series of four votes, which means at some point we will have to recess for a while. I'm not sure exactly when we will have to do it, probably won't have to recess until about 3:40-3:50 or something like that. And that--that could last 45 minutes or an hour, depending on how the procedure unfolds. So, we'll do our best to move forward as quickly as we can. If we're fortunate, maybe there will be some delay in the vote, and we can wrap up the hearing before that happens, it seems unlikely.  </p><p>Miss Nakache, I'd like to begin with you. You note in your testimony that it's important for law makers, policy makers and antitrust enforcers to strike a proper balance between on the one-hand underenforcement, which has an obvious set of problems, with--with on the other hand overenforcement, each one can create its own set of difficulties when it comes to dealing with acquisition by tech startups. Distinguishing between those acquisitions that are likely to be anti-competitive and those that are likely to be pro-competitive is of course, a difficult task, and it requires one to proceed with--with a certain amount of neutrality and--and neutral objectives in trying to predict the future. But in your line of work, you also make predictions about the likely--the likelihood of success about a particular business, is that right?  </p><p>NAKACHE: Yes.  </p><p>LEE: And would you agree that it's an efficient line of business, that is that people don't go into venture capital unless they're reasonably good at predicting outcomes, is that right?  </p><p>NAKACHE: That would be the hope.  </p><p>LEE: Even in that circumstance, even in that very efficient industry, where someone's got skin in the game, so-to-speak, money on the line, their own money, and that of a lot of other people behind them, it can be very difficult to predict which companies are likely to succeed, over the long-term and which companies are less likely to succeed.  </p><p>And you note that--that failure is a fairly common reality within venture capital, and the startup ecosystem as a whole.  On average, what can you tell us about the sort of success or fail rate, where they either end up a success making lots of money or on the other hand, eventually having little or no economic value. </p><p>NAKACHE: Thank you for your question, Chairman Lee.  There is a study by Harvard Business School that indicated that 75 percent of venture baked startups fail.  So, the failure rate is quite high.  And so, putting incentives in place that maintain the possibility of success with regards to both M&amp;A and IPO are important in order to maintain that balance the incredible risk entrepreneurs are taking on, and the potential failure rate.   </p><p>LEE: So, when you're--in light of that concern in your written testimony you note if the government is too heavy handed in preventing incumbent firms from acquiring startups, that could harm the innovation economy.  Tell us how this works and how that might impact your investors including university endowments, public foundations, and public funds. </p><p>NAKACHE: Sure.  Our--our investors as you rightly pointed out are a variety of institutions that can range from foundations to endowments funds.  And they make asset allocations all the time, and they decide how much of their capital they want to allocate towards venture capital and fostering this innovation economy.  They're looking at the returns of venture capital industry relative to those other asset classes, to the extent that action is taken that depresses potential returns in the world of venture capital that would likely drive those investors to seek other asset classes, over time. </p><p>LEE: So that--that's a very real--real world consequence of over enforcement.  Under enforcement also has its own problems as we're aware of.  But, over enforcement is certainly cost-free proposition.  I think we can all agree that some acquisitions of nascent rivals might be done for anti-competitive reasons.  I think we also should all agree that's difficult, in some cases, to identify which deals should be challenged versus which deals can't.  In part, because we can't see the future, and this is what marketplaces are built on.  They're built on a certain degree of uncertainty and some people can ascertain that certain better than others.  It's very difficult to predict in advance, especially from the vantage point of government enforcement agency, which ones are going to succeed, and which are going to fail.  That doesn't excuse the task from the outset, but it does entail some risk. </p><p>Dr. Moss has suggested that antitrust enforcers have, perhaps been reluctant to challenge mergers in the digital tech space, perhaps because some of them might be more concerned about wrongfully blocking a good merger, and not sufficiently concerned about the failing to challenge bad mergers.  Professor Yun, is this--what's your reaction to this?  Do you think the antitrust enforcement agencies have failed to challenge systematically or otherwise what are in fact, anti-competitive acquisitions among tech startups? </p><p>YUN: So, my read on the scholarship is that there's no conclusion that there's systematic basis for either, as you mentioned, a false positive or a false negative.  In fact, in the merger guidelines it's already built in that weigh the anti-competitive harms more so than the pro-competitive benefits.  It's not a one for one.  So, there's actually a greater concern for the false negative versus the false positive.  The false negative being allowing blocking a pro-competitive merger.  False negative is just, or I might have it opposite way around.  But, that's the way, there are a cost to these decisions.  And so, yeah, my read-on scholarship is that there has been, I've seen no scholarships showing a systemic finding of agency bias either way. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Hoffman, have antitrust enforcers been too timid to bring these kinds of cases? </p><p>HOFFMAN: Thank you.  I think the answer is, I'm not aware of any data that suggests that.  Dr. Moss and I talked a little bit about the AAI study.  And I want to commend AAI for doing that study.  I think it's the kind of work that needs to be done to help us understand the overall landscape.  But, as we discussed previously, the concern that we had about the specific study was that the--this is a little technical, but the data set that they looked at actually, for the most part doesn't include filings by the firms that they identify as the big tech firms.  So, it's sort of like if you want to study agriculture merger enforcement and you accidentally study airlines. </p><p>That said, I think it's the case that we are looking very hard to determine whether or not, for example, in the past missed transactions that may have been anti-competitive.  We need to ascertain whether or not there's any kind of systematic error that we're making.  I don't of evidence that supports that second proposition right now.  As far as specific past transactions, that's something we are always wanting to take a further look at. </p><p>LEE: Dr. Moss, I want to give you a chance to respond.  We may have to get back to you in a subsequent round for that because I'm over time and I want to stick as closely as we can to our seven-minute rounds.  So, I'd encourage my colleagues to do that, as we're approaching the vote. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Oh.  I get the message.  But, in a nice segue, I'll ask you to respond, Dr. Moss.  And if you could just--you know this hearing was prompted of course by concerns about lack of enforcement action when it comes to these start up purchases.  What should the agency be doing and how do you respond to Mr. Hoffman's comment? </p><p>MOSS: Thank you for the question.  So, to respond to Mr. Hoffman's comment, the AAI study was based on publicly available data through the HSR reports to Congress.  We're a non-profit organization, we base all of our analysis on publicly available data.   </p><p>We looked at NAAI CS code that corresponds directly to the digital technology industry.  That code is a primary identifier for Amazon, Facebook, and Google.  So, I guess I'm reluctant to accept lock stock and barrel, the criticism of the study, that it's looking at a very small subset or the wrong subset of transactions that are actually related to big tech firms.  But the conclusions don't change.  There have been over 700 transactions by the big five tech firms.  And one of them has been challenged in federal district court. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Right.  And you're talking about things like Facebook, Instagram, Google AdMob, Facebook, WhatsApp, Google Waze, Amazon, Diapers.com.  So, what do you think the agency should be doing now to address these skills? </p><p>MOSS: I think the agencies have, as I suggested, have--have--there are a number of factors that have contributed to this problem.  I think the agencies have the tools.  I think they need to think creatively about using their tools.  Under the Consumer Welfare Standard, which--which--which seems capable and reachable to the concerns, I do think that the agencies do apply error cost analysis.  And I would respectfully disagree with my colleagues that--and there's been empirical research done in error cost analysis, finding that the agencies are reluctant to challenge deals because they fear they are going to stifle or chill competition.  So, I think the agencies need a little bit of help-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --right-- </p><p>MOSS: --with some strong presumptions. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Ok.  So, part of this is my suggestion on legal change resources.  Mr. Hoffman, I was listening to your three things here about good and bad, and acquisitions good and bad.  But the last one was help from the public.  Would that also include help from our resources, give that this sophistication of these companies, and that your resources have not greatly improved? </p><p>HOFFMAN: Thank you, Senator. Yes, it would.  I think the fact of the matter is that we are highly resource constrained.  We are in a situation at the Federal Trade Commission where, for example, in the last two years, we challenged 42 mergers, we tried, not investigated, tried nine cases comprising over 132 days of trial time in the last two years.  That's one out of every five businesses we are in trial.  And we have a staff of about 280 people.  So, they do all the merger review, all the conduct review, all the policy work.  Everything that we do is done by those people.  So, you know, we work-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --have you figured out how many lawyers are in these companies? </p><p>HOFFMAN: So, I'll just give you one example.  So, last year over the government shutdown, we tried the Qualcomm Case.  Now, our trial team going out and tried that case in California, well over 2,000 miles from home while not being paid, faced an adversary with effectively unlimited resources who deployed against us six, I believe, of the best law firms in the world.  Who I think collectively outnumbered our team by a ratio of roughly 10 to one.  And yet, we won that trial.  So, we work really hard. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Ok. </p><p>HOFFMAN: We do the best we can, but we have limits on what we can do. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: So, let me just ask quick, some little rapid fire, here.  Should acquire intent be a factor when you look at evidence in assessing the likely impact of acquiring an emerging or potential future competitor? </p><p>HOFFMAN: It is absolutely a factor.  We ultimately look at capability and likely effect as opposed to intent itself.  We look at intent because we think it sheds light on what the actual capabilities and likely effects would be post-merger. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Ok.  Ms. Yun, we've talked about the challenges of predicting possible outcomes when looking at acquisitions.  Do you think retrospectives for these types of acquisitions make sense? </p><p>YUN: I do.  Senator, thank you for your question.  For me, that's the only way you can really look back.  And I think a number of studies have done in hospitals.  That's what really was the genesis for all the success that led up to the FT's win, FTC's wins in the hospital mergers.  They were losing eight in a row until, my understanding, is a group of economists did a retroactive study and they were on different hospital mergers.  And they developed new tools to assess those mergers, looking at new data.  And they were able to come up with new methodologies that has really been, sort of, the drive for all the wins that the FTC has had, in a good way of stopping anti-competitive hospital mergers. And so, I think the same kind done-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --you have some top picks of the ones that you think they should look at? </p><p>YUN: Yeah.  I mean, you know, we all have sort of casual observations of things such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.  And I'm open to the view that these could go either way.  And I'd like to see a detailed study, not only of prior documents, but of the data of what we would expect to happen.  Part of the problem is what Mr. Hoffman mentioned, is we don't have a good sense of what we're looking for.  If an acquisition by a nascent competitor, a nascent competitor acquisition results in it being quickly snuffed out, you know, do we chalk that up as killer acquisition or is that just a poor product where they just took the engineering talent and it was really going nowhere, so it's largely pro-competitive.  Or do we look at Facebook, Instagram where it really took off exponential growth for both companies after the acquisition and say oh those are synergies that we would expect?  Or does that mean, oh wow, they could have been a really independent strong competitor and we let that one go through? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Ok.  Dr. Moss, you want to respond? </p><p>MOSS: I just want to make one comment based on the research that we did.  You know, the big swathes of big serial acquisitions are not in social media, they're not in content and news.  They're in areas like--in areas like data analytics, AI, business intelligence, cloud computing.  Those are generally b to b types of transactions.  All the b to c stuff gets all the media attention and all the public interest.  But, all these b to b transactions seem to be flying under the radar screen.  But those are the ones--those are the sectors within big tech where we've seen, you know, huge aggression and acquisitions of companies.  Those are the ones, in my view, that need to be looked at. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Mr. Hoffman, think that's right? </p><p>HOFFMAN: So, what I would say is two things.  One is, I think merger retrospectives are really important.  I think it's important to remember though that they're not law enforcement.  There's a difference between a retrospective, which looks at an industry across the board and gives us useful information-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --yes-- </p><p>HOFFMAN: --going forward and actually look at a-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --at a transaction. </p><p>HOFFMAN: We can do both.  And I think one of the things that we have been doing is looking very hard for both.  Places where we should do retrospect but also, particular transactions where we have gotten it wrong.  And I can't talk about specific investigations, but that is something that we're very cognizant of. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Alright.  Thank you.  Thank you to all of you. </p><p>LEE: Senator Hawley. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p>Mr. Hoffman, your boss Chairman Simons was here last week and I think it's safe to say, I express my frustration of what I'm concerned is a pattern of enforcement or lack thereof at the FTC.  And I said then, I'll reiterate now, that I'm increasingly concerned about your agency's ability to do its job.  I'm concerned about some of the structural issues that the chairman has eluded to.  I'm concerned about the pattern that I see.  I'm concerned about the agency's ability to protect the public interest, to protect consumers interests, and to protect competition and make sure that we're getting good, healthy competition that actually spurs innovation.  And again, protects consumers. </p><p>And to that end, I'm going--I'm sending a letter the FTC asking for the full report, the 2012 FTC report on Google's anti-competitive business practices.  As you remember, I'm sure, the FTC launched an investigation into the anti-competitive practice by Google that culminated in a 160-page staff report in 2012.  Half of that report was then inadvertently released during an open records request.  But the FTC has never released the other half.  And I think that the remaining pages are quite pertinent to the public interest for determining whether Google has been deceiving consumers for years and years.  Google tells us that it simply returns the most relevant, useful results.  But, of course, two years ago, the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for doing just the opposite.  And the pages that we have from the report, reveal that Google may have been involved, that the FTC was aware that Google was involved in the same sort of activity in the U.S. market.  So, I look forward to your agency's attention to that. </p><p>Let me ask you about the recent report in the Wall Street Journal that several of my colleagues have already mentioned.  The Project Voldemort Report, I'm calling it, about the--detailing Facebook's aggressive tactics.  The report says the--the newspaper story says that Snap was worried that Facebook executives were using Instagram to prevent Snap consent from trending on that app.  They were also worried that Facebook was encouraging popular accountholders or influencers to not reference Snap on their own accounts on Instagram.  Is this the kind of thing that the FTC is concerned about? </p><p>HOFFMAN: So, Senator, I can't comment on a particular pending investigation, but let me make a couple of broad points.  One is, information sources like the Project Voldemort, which is by the way a name that I greatly like especially with kids who are huge fans of Harry Potter, as am I.  But, leaving that aside, that kind of information is the kind of information that we are constantly looking for and that helps us to good investigations.  And that's one of the things that we have been doing in our technology task force is going out to the market to try to build that kind of knowledge and expertise.  </p><p>Second, speaking broadly about types of practices, as opposed to the practices of any particular company that we might or might not be investigating, I can say that we would look for systematic conduct by somebody with a large share, a dominant firm that was aimed at disadvantaging rivals and potential rivals.  Particularly in ways in that don't advance competition on their merits, and again, a great example of this what have alleged and the Surescripts case, which is currently pending in litigation.  Or if you go back to the Microsoft case.  The Microsoft case was a monopolization case that was compromised, and Chairman Lee talked about this in his opening statement, it is comprised of series of forms of conduct which altogether, created the monopolistic outcome.  And that is the sort of thing, among others, that we would certainly look for. </p><p>HAWLEY: Let me just ask you at that level of generality, are you concerned about companies like Facebook acquiring competitors or would be competitors, and then using those competitor's platforms to strangle other competitors?  So, deliberately expanding into markets, as we're talking about here, I mean potentially nascent competition, but expanding into markets where the--Facebook for instance, does not have a foothold, expanding into these markets, gaining a foothold, and then using those new platforms to kill other platforms.  I mean, that's the kind of thing you're concerned about.  Is that fair to say? </p><p>HOFFMAN: That would be fair.  Just to elaborate very briefly, I think you could think of two forms of conduct but a platform in that regard that could be anti-competitive.  One is, where the platform is doing something, any kind of conduct of which that would be a type, that would be aimed at for sawing a threat to the platform, the existing platform monopoly.  And that was really what the Microsoft case about, a threat, ultimately to what Microsoft viewed as its platform that posed by the downstream disintermediation that platform  and moving into a different direction. </p><p>The second possibility is where the existing dominant firm in market A sees a potential to monopolize market B and moves into that market engaging in anti-competitive conduct to acquire a monopoly power there.  I think that's a harder case to bring, because there you're getting to speculator territory about, as you said, a situation where the firm doesn't actually already compete in the market.  But, it's by no means impossible and it's not theoretically unattainable. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you for that.   </p><p>Ms. Nakache let me just ask you in the time that I have remaining.  In your written testimony you note that the percentage of IPO's for tech companies has decreased.  And I just wanted to ask you to elaborate on that.  Are you concerned that newer companies feel that they may lack realistic ways to achieve the same size or success of earlier entrants like Facebook and Google, that are now these very large incumbents? </p><p>NAKACHE: It has become--thank you for your question.  It has become more challenging for young companies to become public companies.  And there's a number of reasons for that.  I mean, partly, there's increased regulations, Sarbanes-Oxley for one, Frank Dodd's the other, that makes it very expensive to be a public company.  And that disproportionately burdens smaller companies.  And at the same time, there's been reduced research coverage for smaller companies.  And so, it's very important to encouraging trading and of public company stock.  So, with those factors combined, there are few--it's much less attractive and there are fewer small companies going public, ergo, M&amp;A has become an even more important path to liquidity for risk taking entrepreneurs. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>LEE: Senator Blumenthal.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thanks, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p>Mr. Hoffman, I was involved in the Microsoft case.  And I, in fact, helped to lead it and obviously there are parallels between what we saw then and what we see now, correct? </p><p>HOFFMAN: Again, without talking about an specific investigation that we might have, you can certainly say that the kinds of allegations that you might read about, for example, in the Wall Street Journal article or elsewhere, sound, in many respects similar to the kind of conduct and the kind of basic fact pattern that existed in the Microsoft case. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, it only sounds similar, but it looks similar, correct? </p><p>HOFFMAN: Again, without commenting specific investigation, I would agree with that. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And I made the point to Mr. Simons when he was here last week that the failure and I don't mean a personal failure on your part, but the agency's failure to be more specific, direct, and aggressive in discussing these issues, in a way creates lack of trust, lack of reliance on the part of the public in enforcement.  Because what they see is your disclaiming knowledge or at the ability to talk about any specific investigation, when they know that these anti-competitive practices are ongoing.  And they have no way to be sure that are in fact investigating anti-competitive practices.  And I realize that you're not hear to speak for the agency about changing the ways that it talks publicly.  But that's a message I hope you will take back, the message that the FTC really owes to the public to be more direct and aggressive in the way that it talks about these issues.  If only that's the way the public will come forward with information that you need.  As any prosecutor knows, if the public can't trust the prosecutors to be aggressive and--and forthright, it won't--it won't come forward.  So, I think that is a real message here that a number of us feel is important. </p><p>In that Microsoft investigation, one of the remedies related to interoperability, the European regulators for example, required Microsoft to publish information that would allow competitors to be interoperable with its products, not just with internet browsers but across the wide range of prominent Microsoft services.  Of course, Microsoft's attempts to use its control over Windows to stifle other internet browsers and promote Internet Explorer was the gist of what we were trying to stop.  Since we see those anti-competitive practices in big tech today, let me ask you and Ms. Moss, should the FTC and the DoJ be pursuing interoperability mandates when it comes to anti-competitive practices? </p><p>HOFFMAN: So, again, Senator, first of all thank you for your points about public disclosure.  I do think that we try as best we can to say what we can.  And as you understand, there are limits on what we can say, but I take your point and will definitely take it back. </p><p>And so far as interoperability, I think the short answer is, yes.  I mean, we look at a wide range of remedies.  And as you know from your experience, the remedies available to us in monopolization cases or for that matter, in any kinds of conduct cases or retrospective merger cases that we might bring under Clayton 7 are very broad.  We have a wide range of equitable tools available to fix anti-competitive conduct.  And our mandate, when we find any anti-competitive conduct, is to fix it, to restore the competition that would have existed but for the conduct, whatever that conduct might be.  And so we look at  divestiture, splitting up companies.   We have in the past, made companies who had fully integrate acquisitions for example, actually recreate the firm that they had bought, and we would look at things like interoperability and other issues like that, as the facts would warrant. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: But there were structural changes that you required as part of the Facebook settlement, most recently.  Even though, it wasn't, obviously wasn't an antitrust settlement.  Mr. Simons said to us when he came here last week that he thought the litigation would have been time consuming, that the $5 billion fine vindicated a lot of the goals of the action and pursuit of the violation of consent.  But there were structural changes, you committed to structural changes in antitrust enforcement. </p><p>HOFFMAN: Senator, so structural changes as I've actually spoke about on some prior occasions are our general preferred remedies.  And it's particularly so where the vehicle, the form of anti-competitive conduct is a transaction.  But, it's not the case.  You would look at structural remedies as a viable option in any case if that was the best way to remedy the anti-competitive harm.  And we also err on the side of caution, we tend to take a little more remedy than maybe would be the minimal necessary.  Because we engage in what's called fencing in.  We try to make sure that a firm that's engaged in anti-competitive conduct doesn't have an easy vehicle to get the same result by some slight change in approach.  That said, again, any case as you know, really terms on what actually happened, what are the specific facts, what's going on in the market.  And so that is certainly--it would absolutely be on the table.  What we would do in a particular case, obviously I can't comment on right now. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Ms. Moss? </p><p>MOSS: Thank you for the question.  I think in interoperability technically falls into the conduct remedy bucket.  It's a remedy that as a former federal regulator, we were--was very near and dear to our hearts as part of an open access, nondiscrimination regime.  It allows or promotes consumer switching; it allows rivals to operate on platforms without fear of being discriminated against.  But, those types of remedies, because they are conduct oriented, are a little bit harder for antitrust authorities, I think, to effectively implement.  Where a structural remedy could be taken and eliminate the incentive or the ability to exercise market power, then that would preferable.  </p><p>But, I think, as you alluded to earlier, Senator Blumenthal, the platforms are really leveraging theory on steroids.  These are interconnected systems of markets.  There are scale economies, there are network effects, there are ecosystems of related markets, and to superimpose conduct remedies on those types of very complex business organisms, I think it's going to take--it's going to take sort of  a team effort between antitrust regulators should they choose to go in that direction.  But, also really facilitated by this concept of a possible digital market sector oversight authority who could advise on these technical matters. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: So, the answer in a lot of these cases to monopoly or monopolistic and predatory conduct is structural remedies.   </p><p>MOSS: That would be--that would be my preference. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Because they are easier to police and implement. </p><p>MOSS: And they are the most effective remedies. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. </p><p>LEE: Thank you.  Ms. Nakache let's get back to you for a minute.  You touched on this briefly in your opening statement.  But what factors do venture capitalists consider when they're trying to assess the likelihood that a tech startup will be able to compete against incumbent platform? </p><p>NAKACHE: Thank you for your question.  Venture capitalists consider a number of factors.  And in fact, the bar is really quite high when they're considering investment in a company that competes directly against an incumbent their core market.  They will look, in particular, at whether the product risk they're developing is truly differentiated relative to what's in the market today.  Something that's only marginally better, is--is difficult to fund.  At the same time, they'd look at the management team.  And--and the capabilities of the management team to basically execute nimbly relative to deep pocketed incumbents. So, the bar's quite high, it does happen.  And the bar is high in considering investment in any company competing against large incumbents.  But it does happen. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Hoffman, what factors do enforcers look at in answering essentially this question in figuring whether the acquisition of a start up by a larger platform is a so-called killer acquisition, or whether it's on the other hand something more pro-competitive? </p><p>HOFFMAN: So, I think there's two broad rubrics that we consider, and then there's details within them.  And just really quickly, the first broad rubric is, is the particular transaction anti-competitive?  And there, with nascent competitors what we look at primarily is what we can discern from facts that are not econometric, by which I mean, what do the parties think?  What do their documents show?  What do the witnesses say?  What do industry participants say about the likelihood that this competitor that's being acquired would have developed into a serious threat?  A threat that is larger than the current market shares, which might be very tiny, would suggest.  And that' the kind of fact pattern that saw in CDK automate and the kind of fact pattern that we say in the Ottobock case. The second broad rubric that we would look at, and this is more of a monopolization theory, would be if there is a pattern of acquisitions by a firm where some kind of methodology or system where it was like defining what it deemed to be potential competitors, and systematically targeting them for acquisition.  There we might take an approach that would focus primarily on the analysis done by that firm and then look at the acquisitions as a group as opposed to in a single, you know, one off kind of way. </p><p>LEE: Dr. Moss, you've suggested that enforcement is weak in this area, weaker than it should be.  And you tie to the evidentiary standards that are applicable.  Do you have in mind any examples of tech mergers that you think the agencies should have challenged in court and perhaps would have, had the standard been different? </p><p>MOSS: Thank you for the question.  I--I do think the FacebookInstagram merger is something that should be looked retrospectively to determine if there have been adverse effects.  And then the agency can go back with well-crafted theories of harm, well-armed with evidence of adverse effects and then possibly unpack that.  So, that was more a simple horizontal merger.  I think some of the mergers in the advertising space, the DoubleClick, AdMeld, AdMob, the advertising platforms and serial acquisitions have been rather dramatic. I think that has created a tremendous amount of market power in various advertising spaces.  And some of those should be unpacked in terms of their effects not only on advertisers, but on eyeballs and consumer attention.   </p><p>I think the question is, and it's a good question that you raise is, do the agencies, what criteria do they use for going back and using scarce resources, to do 6 B studies or to do--or to support retrospective analysis?  Should it be done within the agencies or outside the agencies?  And I think one challenge we face in the big tech sector is how do you actually measure harm?  Because you're not always dealing with prices here, you're dealing with zero price markets where people pay with their attention and their clicks, and their eyeballs.  And markets can be more complex.  And so, I think the agencies should give significant thought to this.  And we're heartened by the taskforce at the FTC, and we're heartened by what the DoJ is doing as well.  But we're not seeing any cases come out of those investigations. </p><p>LEE: If you were--If you could run the world for a day what would you do with the evidentiary standard?  What would you change it to? </p><p>MOSS: I think for the evidentiary standard for acquisitions of potential competitors should be lowered. So, I think--and there should be a burden shift, much like what Senator Klobuchar has proposed in her more general merger legislation.  Which is for the--the acquiring firm to come in with a really good story as to how this merger will actually be pro-competitive.  And--and justify the cost savings, justify the alleged or the claimed consumer benefits.  On the nascent and potential competitors' side, it is very, very difficult for the government to prove that a small startup firm would have grown into, but for the acquisition, would have grown into a viable rival.  The reason why that's difficult is because that's a very--that's a very high wall to scale when you're dealing a--an enormous platform with all these ecosystem and network effects.  And you're dealing with very small startups that can barely get their foot into the door.  So, it's a hard standard to show.  Lowering those evidentiary--to meet, lowering those evidentiary to meet, I think would--would serve to strengthen enforcement by making the government's case a little bit easier to make. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Hoffman, are the evidentiary standards, in your opinion, too high?  Are they too high so as to stop the FTC from trying to block mergers that should be blocked? </p><p>HOFFMAN: I'm not aware of any case that we've failed to pursue because we were concerned about the evidentiary standard, where we thought that the transaction was likely to be harmful.  We are willing to take risks in court and to bring hard cases where necessary.  I think it's important to remember the evidentiary standard we're talking about here is the standard civil preponderance of the evidence, which plaintiff's lawyers that I've known describe as the feather lands on the scale, you know, all you need is a feather on the scale.  So, it's not a very high standard. </p><p>I think it's also important to note that when you're talking about a horizontal merger, and I recognized Professor Moss' point that sometimes we're not talking about horizontal mergers here.  But, in a horizontal merger you already have that presumption.  Any kind of situation where you a firm that you would describe as dominant, suppose a firm with a 50 percent share, almost any acquisition it makes, even of a firm with a 1 percent share would comfortably trigger the presumption thresholds under the merger guidelines, which courts typically use.  And shift the burden of at least coming forth with evidence to show that the transaction is not anti-competitive to the merging firms.  So, a lot of that is already there. </p><p>In so far as lowering the standard broadly, like for example, presuming that all acquisitions of nascent competitors were anti-competitive, I think that raises serious questions.  I wouldn't rule it out.  I think it needs careful review, because there are potential negative consequences.  For example, would this be a general standard that would apply to all acquisitions of any start up by anybody or would it only be by tech companies?  But as a Diana--Professor Moss' paper points out, we don't know what the tech companies are in the sense that there's not a single industry into which they fall.  So, even writing a definition that would cover them to establish he presumption would be challenging.  And then if you establish a presumption that all such acquisitions are potentially anti-competitive, it's unclear to me what effects that would have on for example, the venture capital markets, and those could be significant.  So, wouldn't rule it out, but I think it's something that ought to be considered very carefully to determine if its net effects would be positive or negative given where we are. </p><p>LEE: Thank you.  Senator Klobuchar. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much.   </p><p>Ms. Nakache, excuse me, you note in your testimony that the digital platforms are now involved in venture capital, investing themselves.  Of course, the big tech companies have access to vast amounts of data about potential acquisition targets by virtue of operating their platforms.  Data, that I would guess, typical venture capitalist may lack.  Do the big tech platforms have an advantage over other venture capital investors in searching for and valuing investments related to their existing business operations? </p><p>NAKACHE: Thank you for your question.  The large incumbents--several of the large incumbents do have venture capital investing arms.  But they're not along among corporations.  There are--in the National Venture Capital Association alone, for example, there are over 50 corporate venture capital members.  And across the board, the motivation is always staying close to innovation.  There's also the objective of financial returns, but it's largely staying close-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --do you think they have unique information just because of their able to collect information? </p><p>NAKACHE: I think it's--so that would be irrespective of their venture capital arm-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --yeah-- </p><p>NACKACHE: --I think that's--I think that's entirely possible that they have--that they have information based on--from them in particular, their search assets. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And how do you--different kind of question, how do you assess investing in a company that is competing directly against big tech?  Does that make it seem harder when they have so much  market power?  Do you think it hurts companies that are trying to get in? </p><p>NACKACHE: The bar is definitely high to make an investment in a company that competes directly against one of the large incumbents.  There--we have to see that the entrepreneur has a very unique insight, is building a very different product, is able to execute and out execute the larger deep pocketed incumbents.  So, the bar is high, but it's not--but I wouldn't say that it never happens.  I-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --how about if they sold one--they do one company and they sell it to big tech, does that improve the chances then, because they've shown that they produce something that was sold to big tech? </p><p>NACKACHE: If an entrepreneur, is that your question? </p><p>Absolutely.  An entrepreneur has a track record of building a company successfully and having a successful outcome given the 75 percent failure rate in startups, absolutely improves his or her ability to raise capital in the future.  For sure. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: There was one of these things raised, not with regard to big tech, but the women entrepreneurs today.  We're talking about how it's so hard for them to credibility.  And one of the ways they do it is if they can sell to anyone.  So, they're pretty desperate to do it.  And I'm trying to see how this meshes with everything.  So, then they have credibility to do their next big thing but keep it.  So, it's pretty interesting. </p><p>NACKACHE: Exactly.  In fact-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --it can lead to some weird competitive decisions, I think.  Anyway.  Alright.   </p><p>Professor Yun and Dr. Moss, I have question for you.  It seems like predicting the future competitiveness of a nascent competitor or potential future competitor could be extremely difficult, especially in the tech sector.  My concern is that whenever there is uncertainty and there always is, the enforcers will default to doing nothing.  In your opinion, are there developed analytical tools that can help enforcers determine which startups are likely to be strong competitors?  And are you concerned that this kind of uncertainty will lead to underenforcement?   </p><p>Rapid round answer. </p><p>YUN: And I'll say, in honesty, I'm not aware of tools that would be at forecasting that. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yeah.  So, that's why you're into the--in part into the post review? </p><p>YUN: And the post review is where we could gain-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --but it can't be the only thing you do. </p><p>YUN: It can't be the only thing.  But, it's a good start. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Ok.  Dr. Moss? </p><p>MOSS: So--so the only help we have here in potential competition is sort of the--the theories of actual potential competition and perceived potential competition.  Which really, are--are not particularly good fits for the big tech space, for all the reasons we've discussed at the table here.  So, I think this is a really fertile area for economists and lawyers and institutional experts and technical experts, to put their heads together and think about how the enforcement agencies can go about thinking about what--whether a potential competitor--today or at some point in the--in the--in the merger framework future will pose a significant threat to the market.  And if it was eliminated would harm competition and consumers. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Ok.  And you've alluded to this--that this occurs in other industries as well, the so-called killer acquisition in the pharma sector are good example.  And Director Hoffman outlined a number of these prior cases in his written testimony.  In your opinion, I know you've said we should be concerned about these industries; do you want to use a few examples? </p><p>MOSS: Sure.  So, I do a lot of work in agriculture, biotechnology.  And I think there are almost equivalent concerns about the acquisition of startups in digital farming.  So, a lot of the big ag bio techs, the vertically integrated platforms of seeds, tracing chemicals are buying up digital farming startups like they're going out of style.  And this all seems to be flying under the radar screen.  I do think the DoJ did a good job by challenging the merger of Precision Planting, that sort of fit squarely into that category.  That is--that--you know--the farming sector is going digital.  And a lot of the issues-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --yeah-- </p><p>MOSS: --have been talking about in big tech apply over there as well. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And how about pharma area? </p><p>MOSS: And in pharma, I talk a lot, get a lot of calls from small businesspeople that are trying to enter with smaller, unique business models.  For example, secondary drug distribution, they have tremendous difficulty getting access to markets when they have to enter at more than one level.  For example, not a single, you know, at drug level or at distribution level, but because they're dealing with vertically integrated behemoths much like the platforms, the barriers to entry are significantly high.  And those businesses are withering on the vine. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And that's why I have promised this change and continuing to work on this, to try to get some basically, a better standard to look at these cases.  And I'm glad that Chairman Lee is interested, maybe he wants to do the bill with me or get on our bill.  Because the idea here is that what we have in place right now, either because of resources, which I think we should--I'm glad that Senator Grassley is helping with this, on trying to get more resources to the agencies.  But, also the standards and then the courts, it's like just one big obstacle that we can't seem to overcome.  And the other thing is we have to be as sophisticated as these companies.  And when you look at the past, decade by decade, changes were made to the antitrust laws to adapt to the circumstances of their time.  And we just have not been doing that in major way for a very, very long time, while an entire new marketplace has developed around us.   </p><p>Would you agree? </p><p>MOSS: I would agree.  I--I think--I think what--I think we should be going solidly in the direction of coming up with strengthening, improvements, clarifications to the antitrust laws.  So, that they can apply broadly-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --and not just one sector-- </p><p>MOSS: --to any sector. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Dr. Moss.  Thank you. </p><p>LEE: Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thanks.  I'm going to try to be brief because we have a vote ongoing.  But, in the interest of both simplicity and brevity, let me just put it in a nutshell.  We're here today because antitrust enforcement isn't working.  We see it in the pharmaceutical drug industry, we see in the airline industry, we see it in big tech.  And without meaning any disrespect to you, Mr. Hoffman, personally, the danger really is that antitrust enforcement is becoming an empty suit.  Whether its lack of where with all in resources, or lack of authority, I happen to think its as much lack of will.  </p><p>And let me just cite to your predictions that have proved to be incorrect.  I grant you, as I think Yogi Berra said, predictions are very difficult to make especially about the future.  But these predictions prove to be notoriously wrong.  In the Google AdMob merger of 2010, the FTC issued a closing statement basing on its approval on two stunningly incorrect predictions.  First, that Apple would quickly become, \"A strong mobile advertising competitor.\".  And second, that another firm would develop a smartphone to compete with the Apple iPhone and Google Android.  We now know that Apple never became a competitor in ad networking, and in fact, abandoned the field entirely in 2016 when its shutdown iAd, it's mobile advertising application.  And we still only have two smartphone operating systems.   </p><p>In Google DoubleClick, 2007, the FTC also issued a closing statement, this time saying, \"We have concluded that the ad intermediation market is not likely to tip to a single ad intermediation provider.\".  That prediction, also, was incorrect.  According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, Google now dominates that market with 70 percent share in the ad service segment and 50 percent share in the ad exchange segment.   </p><p>Finally, in FacebookInstagram transaction 2012, the FTC didn't bring an enforcement action.  Also, didn't issue a closing statement, so we really don't know the reason for that decision.  But, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading did issue a decision explaining its conclusion that the transaction was not anti-competitive, and it gave among its reasons that Google Plus would be a \"constraining influence\".  And that it would be easy for another application to duplicate Instagram's success.  Again, this predication was wrong.  Google Plus limped along for years before shutting down earlier this year and no app has since been able to come close to Instagram.   </p><p>I understand nobody can predict the future.  And I know that you're here to represent an agency that could use more resources.  But, as I listen to Mr. Simon talk about the settlement with Facebook, on privacy, not antitrust, but privacy, what I saw was in effect, as a former prosecutor, an attitude of if it looks tough, don't do it.  I know as a former prosecutor, if you're not willing to try cases, you're not going to get good settlements.  And so, I guess my question to you is, in your merger, if you were considering whether the agency has been making predictions that have systematically led to less aggressive enforcement?  This question is not meant to personal criticism.  I hope you don't take it that way.  You're a distinguished attorney, but the agency as a whole seems to lack the aggressiveness that is necessary. </p><p>HOFFMAN: Thank you, Senator.  First of all, there's  a really good lawyer I know once said, I take nothing personally.  So, that doesn't bother me at all.   </p><p>But I'd say a couple things.  First of all, I'm very proud of the enforcement history of the Federal Trade Commission.  I think we've been, and this is not just me saying this, there are multiple measures of international bodies and others on agency effectiveness and the FTC is routinely ranked at one of the best, if not the best agency in the world in terms of antitrust enforcement.  Having said that, I think it would correct that we get things wrong from time to time.  As you said, predictions are hard.  And when we look at mergers, prospectively, it is entirely possible that we get things wrong about them.  </p><p>It's also possible that sometimes courts get things wrong and that, for example, is as was illustrated in the hospital merger project that Professor Yun referred to where courts were getting wrong, we though, over and over and over again.  And we, and the DOJ, and the states lost all of the hospital merger cases we brought over a decade.  But we eventually reversed that by doing things similar to what we're doing today.  We put together a hospital merger retrospective project run by our economists.  We put together the merger litigation taskforce, the name coincidence is not accidental, it's not a coincidental if you like, which consisted of lawyers from the FTC who were dedicated to focusing primarily hospital transactions to understand them better.  We found evidence that we had been right, and the courts had been wrong, but it required a new way of analyzing the data and understanding how competition worked in that industry.  We brought cases and since then, we have won, I think we have an unbroken string now of hospital merger litigation challenges. </p><p>So, we get things wrong.  Absolutely.  We're never going to get things 100 percent right.  But, when we determine that we're getting things wrong, we work really hard to try to fix that and get it right.  And that's what we're trying to do now.  I'm not saying that its necessarily the case that we had all this wrong, I don't know.  That's what we're looking at.  But we are dedicated to doing things right and that's what this agency works really hard to do. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And I just want to make clear, I am not accusing anybody of lack of goodwill or good intentions.  I'm saying when it comes big tech, the FTC better start getting things right, because the stakes are so high, and I appreciate your comments.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>LEE: You're all going to be tremendously disappointed by this, but we're going to go ahead adjourn.  We're a ways into this vote.  We're going to have to sprint to catch this.  In light of the-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --yeah--no I'm ok with it.  But I do want to point out that I think this has been a very helpful hearing.  And I hope you get some tips, Mr. Hoffman.  And the concern that we all share, really, on a bipartisan basis, that we're going to have to look at some of these deals.  And I've got some ideas for changing the standards that I think are important.   </p><p>But I end where I began.  And that is that there's been a 26 percent decrease in new business formation from 2006 to 2015.  And we've seen a very low start up rate compared to other decades.   And we should all be really concerned for capitalism.  This is not a partisan issue.  Everyone cares about maintaining this entrepreneurship system that has done our economy so good for so many, many years.  So, let's bring it back and not have too many monopolies. </p><p>LEE: This has been a fantastic hearing.  I thank each of you for your participation.  I wish we could come down and personally thank you, but I think we're going to have to sprint to catch this. </p><p>The hearing--the record will remain open for two weeks.  And we stand adjourned.   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X50-53G1-F15W-H2KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

CORY BOOKER (D-N.J.) </p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CALIF.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]LEE: Welcome to today's hearing of the subcommittee on antitrust competition, policy, and consumer rights. The title that we have chosen for today is stacking the tech, has Google harmed competition in online advertising? </p><p>I want to thank Ranking Member Klobuchar and her staff for working closely with me and my office as we prepared for today and I also want to thank our chairman, the chairman of the full Senate Judiciary committee, Senator Graham for his support of this hearing. After I and then Senator Klobuchar give our opening remarks we will hear from to panels of witnesses with seven minute rounds of questions from members of the subcommittee. </p><p>We have something interesting to deal with in the Senate and that every time they call votes, when they call votes during a subcommittee hearing or any hearing for that matter we are at their mercy. Senator Chloe and I have both cast our votes on the first of a series of three or four. At some point we are either going to have to pause or tag team as we allow other members to sit in for us. Just don't be alarmed if that happens. </p><p>The focus of today's hearing is Google's online advertising business, whether it's a monopolist and whether it might have engaged in any conduct that harms competition and harms consumers. But before we go into that I want to say just a few things about antitrust policy more broadly. I have been a member of the subcommittee ever since 2011 when I first arrived in the Senate and I have chaired the subcommittee for almost 6 years. Over that time as the public debate surrounding antitrust policy and enforcement has grown and in some cases the evolved. So too has the gulf between the opposing sides. </p><p>One extreme there are those who would rather that we have no antitrust laws at all and the alternative they advocate for an enforcement policy that's overly differential to speculative efficiencies and quick to dismiss actual evidence of competitive harm when--whenever it might conflict with unproven economic theories. This extreme end of the continuum sort of fetishize his freedom to the exclusion of the laws that maintain that very freedom. They forget that markets like governors do not keep themselves free and that liberty is only secure when power is defused. The other extreme however is a line of arguments that has four years now been pushing an agenda to sort of transform the antitrust laws in this country from a tool based and economic science to protect and promote competitive markets into a sort of panacea for all of their perceived social ills. </p><p>Built on the economically myopic premise that big is bad and that is the beginning and the end of the question. Assuming the end of the spectrum would use antitrust to address alleged labor, income, and racial disparities these may be laudable goals but they are not problems that antitrust law is meant to solve nor are they problems that antitrust law is even capable of solving at least not without creating a whole bunch of other problems even within those areas themselves. </p><p>Attempts to repurpose antitrust law into a social justice program would have scores of unintended consequences that would cripple our economy for generations and of course there is the hypocrisy in believing that big is bad applies only to corporations and not to government bureaucracy the very type of government bureaucracy that they would expand in order to dismantle and regulate them. You may be wondering where I see myself in those two extremes. Whose side am I on? Am I on the side of the American people? Yes. Am I on the side of the law? Yes. I believe vigorous enforcement of antitrust laws is essential to maintaining the free markets that have made this the most prosperous nation on earth and I believe that our current laws are for the most part sufficient to meet the challenges of the day. </p><p>I said a moment ago that liberty is only secure when power is defused. This is a bedrock principle of our constitutional republic. The concept of federalism perhaps the greatest contribution of the founding generation and of our founding document is what makes America unique among all other nations. This principle applies equally to the economic power as it does to political power. In a way antitrust laws might properly be described as federalism for the economy. </p><p>That brings us to today. We are here to discuss what may be the seminal antitrust case of the 21st century, one whose precedent will define the terms of competition and innovation in our dynamic economy for years, in fact for decades to come. Unlike some of my colleagues in the house I am not interested in staging a political spectacle to attack, to condescend and to talk over witnesses. Naive though it may be in 2020 my hope is that by looking at this specific question we can have a serious and frank conversation about the state of competition in digital markets. </p><p>Online advertising is an incredibly complex business and one that touches every single person on the Internet. The technologies involved in connecting advertisers and publishers have evolved rapidly in the last decade and the expansion of online advertising has facilitated an explosion of online content by allowing even the smallest website owners to monetize the content they produce. Small and local businesses have also benefited from being able to quickly and easily promote their businesses without any of the same capital investments that would have been required and indispensable for that effort just a few decades ago. </p><p>So at the same time this growth and this expansion has been largely consolidated onto a single platform, Google's online ad business. As that business has grown so to have complaints that Google which both operates the ad selling and add buying platforms and sells its own inventory through those platforms has conflicts of interest and this is manipulated or rigged online ad technologies and auctions to favor its own interest and protect its own market share. Whether this is true or not matters because so many businesses depend upon digital advertising to market their products or to monetize the content that they produce. Web users in turn benefit from free online content and being connected to relevant businesses in a way that helps them to make optimal business decisions. Simply put, markets function better when businesses thrive and consumers are in form. Ideally online advertising helps accomplish this. </p><p>If however online advertising has been monopolized and constrained by opaque pricing and exclusionry conditions everyone loses to that degree. </p><p>I would also add that Google and other big tech companies have been accused of a number of bad acts unrelated to antitrust or to competition. I myself have repeatedly expressed concerns about an anti-conservative bias by these firms and I will continue to pursue those concerns but while I believe that issues like anti-conservative bias certainly have implications for antitrust such as perhaps evidencing market power today's hearing is not fundamentally about those concerns. </p><p>This hearing is about an analytically distinct issue, it's about antitrust allegations in online advertising that are a legitimate subject of inquiry in their own right and to be clear just as I reject demands to use antitrust for social justice I also emphatically reject using antitrust to solve other non-antitrust concerns. Today's discussions will I hope help everyone to better understand the online advertising market and how competition works or should work and how it might not be operating as well as it could in that space. </p><p>I look forward to hearing from our experienced and highly qualified witnesses. Thank you and I will now turn to Ranking Member Klobuchar for her opening remarks. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our witnesses, to Mr. Harrison appearing virtually. </p><p>[*]KLOBUCHAR: And I want to start by making something absolutely clear. We are not having the hearing because Google is successful. I just used it on my way here or because Google is big. That's not why, from my perspective, we're having this hearing. We are having it because even successful companies, even popular companies and even innovative companies are subject to the laws of this country including our antitrust laws. </p><p>We are all successful when we make sure that our economy is strong and our economy is working better. But the law can't be blinded by Google success or its past innovations if the company in its zeal to achieve greater success crossed the line into anti-competitive behavior. It's our job to regulate it. It's that simple. </p><p>So we are going to touch on issues I hope today of competition, technological innovation, the use of personal data. These are some of the defining issues, as the chair has said, defining issues of our time. And I personally think as we go into the months to come, this won't just be about Google. This is isn't even just about the tech industry as much as I believe we need to change our laws and look at monopsonies and look at changing the burdens and making it so that our laws are sophisticated as the companies that now occupy our economy. </p><p>I think we need to do all that and I think it should be a huge priority going into the year. But right now, as the chairman mentioned, we are focused on this issue today. Our society has never been more dependent on this technology than we are now in the midst of this global pandemic. As I noted, not just to Google, the pandemic has forced a bunch of small businesses to close their doors and the five largest tech companies continue to thrive to the point where they briefly accounted for nearly 25 percent of the value of the entire S&amp;P500 stock index just a few weeks ago. </p><p>Again, I don't quarrel with their success, but we have to start looking at do our laws really match that situation? And even if the original intent when these companies started as startups was to be innovative, which they been, at what point do you crossed the line till you squelch innovation and competition from other companies? </p><p>We start with this, the ownership and use of data. The powerful companies that provide us with these technologies are also collecting personal information. We know that. They know who our friends are. They know the books we read, where we live, whether we graduated from college, income levels, race, how many steps we took yesterday. The chairman and I share an interest in this. How long we had stayed where we are. </p><p>Machine learning analyzes troves of personal data allowing our firms to discern even more sensitive information about us. Our medical conditions, political, religious views and even preferences that we don't even know we have. And why would companies do all of this? Well put simply, to target us with digital advertisement. There's really no other reason. It is a capitalist society. That's what they do. Now, Google makes more money doing that than any company in the world. Hands down. </p><p>By leveraging its unmatched access to consumer data gained through its existing dominance in online and mobile search, mobile operating systems, Android, email, Gmail, online and mobile video, YouTube, browsers, Chrome, mobile mapping apps, Google Maps, and ad technology. So this ad technology ecosystem known as the ad tech stack consists of advertisers on one side and publishers on the other. </p><p>So let's look at these two sides. On the advertising side, Google controls access to the huge number of advertisers they place ads on Google search. which has nearly 90 percent of the search market and has unparalleled access to data, as I described. On the public publishers side, Google has privileged access to add data to inform its bidding strategies and then it also effectively controls the process, the ad auction process that gets and advertisers ad to be put on a publishers site. </p><p>Google dominates all the markets for services on both sides of the ad tech stack, the publisher side, and the advertising side and I hope that will be a lot of our focus today. Research has suggested that Google may be taking between 30 and 70 percent of every advertising dollars spent by advertisers using it servicers, depriving publishers of that revenue. Who are the publishers? Their content producers. There are things like the Minneapolis Star Tribune. </p><p>They depend on revenue. So many of our content producers, our news producers do to get by. And to me given that my dad was a journalist, to me this is one of the key elements here because if you have unfairness and how that ad ecosystem is going, then you're depriving these news organizations at a time when the first amendment is already under assault of the revenue that they need to keep going. </p><p>So whether it's happening, and we don't know all the details at the Department of Justice right now, this could be the beginning of a reckoning for our antitrust laws to start looking how we're going to grapple with the new kinds of markets that we see across our country. It would help answer the question of whether our federal antitrust laws are able to restrain the business conduct of even the largest, most successful companies in the world. </p><p>When you think of the breakup of AT&amp;T, that was our last big thing that happened in the antitrust era. Really big thing. What did that lead to? Lower prices, more competition. It really worked. But we are not able to do this right now and my hope is that we're getting the start in the Justice Department that things are going on at the FTC, but to really do that, they're going to need resources to take on the legions of lawyers at the companies and so that's my first goal. What can we do for enforcement? </p><p>My second, what do we have to do to make the laws work better, to look at some of the deals that have already been made? The third is what are the remedies? Do they make a difference? Do they make a difference in changing the behavior and allowing competition? I literally don't have personal grudges against these companies like sometimes the president has expressed about various companies. I don't. </p><p>I just want our capitalist system to work. I want it to work and to have it work, you simply can't have one company dominating areas of an industry. Our founding fathers started this country in part because they were rebelling against monopoly power. We need to keep that spirit of entrepreneurship strong in this country and this is a good way to start. </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will be --I may not be here right at the time because of the votes for my questions, but I will be here for questions. Thank you. </p><p>LEE: You'll be here in spirit either way. Thank you very much, Senator Klobuchar. OK, so we'll have two panels today. Our first panel will consist of Mr. Harrison. Mr. Harrison is joining us virtually. Mr. Harrison, if you'll stand, please, to be sworn. Mr. Harrison, do you affirm that the testimony you're about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? </p><p>HARRISON: I do. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. I'll now briefly introduce our--our witness for our first panel. Don Harrison is Google's President Of Global Partnerships And Corporate Development. As head of global partnerships, Don oversees Google's strategic partnerships worldwide and is responsible for products an ecosystem enablement and commercial partnerships across Google's product and business groups. Don manages the corporate development team that handles Google's global mergers, acquisitions, and investments and has worked on Google's largest transactions, including Nest, DeepMind, DoubleClick AdMob, and Motorola. </p><p>He also manages Google's internal incubator, area 120 and AI focused venture fund gradient ventures. Prior to joining Google, Don was a lawyer at Wilson Sonsini where in 2003 he was first introduced to Google and helped take the company public. He started his career at the Toronto law firm of Davies Ward Phillips and Veinberg after earning a degree in political science and philosophy at Douwes University (SP) and a law degree from the University of Toronto. </p><p>Thank you very much, Mr. Harrison for joining us today and we look forward to your testimony. We'll now hear your opening remarks. </p><p>HARRISON: Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, and distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. My name is Don Harrison. At Google, I lead our partnerships and corporate development teams where we support the growth of our products to partnerships working with a range of businesses to help then use our product to grow and succeed. </p><p>I also oversee area 120, our in-house incubator that helps teams build novel ideas into successful businesses fostering innovation and the development of new technologies. My job at its core is to help other businesses grow. As our partners businesses grow, ours does as well. </p><p>The same is true of Google's products. We build tools that help other businesses grow. One way we help businesses grow is through online advertising. American businesses of all sizes use our advertising tools to find more customers at home and internationally. Over 36 percent of clicks to American advertisers come from overseas. Online advertising prices in the U.S. have fallen more than 40 percent since 2010. </p><p>[*]HARRISON: The benefits of these lower prices flow directly to American businesses and consumers. We help businesses grow from advertising on our own sites and on other publishers' sites. A wide range of businesses, including many small firms, advertise on our sites and apps like Google Search and YouTube. That's where we earn a majority of our advertising revenue. </p><p>In addition to ads on our own properties, Google also helps businesses advertise in a wide range of other websites and mobile applications known as publishers. We offer technology that helps advertisers by ad space, known as the buy side, and help publishers sell their ad space, known as the sell side. This technology is often referred to ad tech. </p><p>The ad tech portion of our business accounts for a small fraction of our advertising revenue, and we share the majority of that revenue with publishers. The ad tech spaces crowded and competitive. We compete with Adobe, Amazon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, Facebook, News Corporation, Oracle, and Verizon, as well as leaders like Index Exchange, Magnite, Media Math, OpenX, the Trade Desk, and many more. </p><p>Publishers and advertisers use tools from an--from an array of providers. The average publisher uses multiple sell side tools, and the average advertiser uses multiple buy side tools. Even as online ad prices have fallen, benefiting businesses and consumers, Google has helped publishers make more money from ads. </p><p>In 2018, we paid more than $14 billion to the publishing partners in our ad network. This is up from $10 billion in 2015. In 2019, when both advertisers and publishers used our tools, publishers kept over 69 percent of the ad revenue. That is more than the industry average. </p><p>In other areas, when it comes to ad tech, we take an open approach. We make our tools interoperable with rivals, increasing choice and competition. Publishers and advertisers enjoy a wide range of choices. Our tools give publishers access to demand from over 700 advertising platforms and advertisers access to ad space on more than 80 publisher platforms. This fosters vibrant competition. </p><p>Our tools can also work seamlessly together in an integrated way, generating efficiency, speed, and security benefits for publishers, advertisers, and consumers. The free and open Internet we all enjoy is made possible by advertising. Without it, websites would be forced to shut the--adopt subscription models, putting their contents behind pay walls, or shut down their operations entirely. This would harm consumers with higher prices and reduce choice online. </p><p>Looking ahead, we'll continue investing in this space, building innovative tools that help publishers and advertisers grow their businesses, supporting the free and open Internet we all enjoy. Thank you for inviting me to participate in this discussion. I look forward to continuing to engage with the committee on these important issues. </p><p>LEE: Thank you very much, Mr. Harrison. Thanks for joining us today. We're going to now launch right into our alternating rounds of seven minute questions, and I will begin that. </p><p>At the outset, I want to address something briefly that I mentioned briefly in my opening statement. That is that I and many of my colleagues are concerned about anti-conservative bias at(PH) Google and on some other online platforms. Earlier this year, I--I expressed grave concern, and--and had to grave concern upon learning that Google reportedly had bans the conservative website, the Federalist, from monetizing its content through Google ads. </p><p>I--I want to be clear here that a private company engaging in censorship on its own platform is not a violation of antitrust laws. Nevertheless, as I pointed out in my letter to your company on this subject, isn't this behavior evidence of market power? In other words, why would any company want to treat its customers that way and--unless it was confident that its customers had no viable alternative? Can you--can you help me understand that? </p><p>HARRISON: Thank you, Senator. Just one--a couple quick points. One, the Federalist, and--and there were some comments made in--in your opening statement and--and in the Senator Klobuchar's opening statement about there being a lack of choice. Publishers like the Federalist have--have many choices on how they can monetize their content. The Federalist actually uses 30 different tools, publisher side tools, to help it monetize its content. And so, it has many choices if--if it's unhappy with how we are providing our services. </p><p>In--in the--in the example that you're talking about, there was--we--we have to have clear policies about how we show our advertisements. And no one--most advertisers do not want their content to show up--or their advertisements to show up next to harmful content. In the case of the Federalist, the Federalist comment boards that had commentary in it, some of which our systems may clear was--was racist commentary. And--and we've been clear in our policies that our ads can show up next to--to that kind of commentary. </p><p>We--we did try to work with the Federalist, and--and there are a bunch of options available to a company in this situation. First of all, they can not have a comment section. Secondly, they can moderate the comment section to take out comments that--that violate our ads policies. Or third, they can do a click through, and--and there are many large publishers like the New York Times that have a click through on their comment section so they don't show ads on the section in which their comment appears. </p><p>LEE: You're--you're not suggesting that the Federalist and its management are racist? </p><p>HARRISON: No, not at--not at all. I--I'm saying that-- </p><p>LEE: --You're talking solely about the commentary, about the--their obligation that you'd like to see them have to moderate the commentary on their site. Is that right? </p><p>HARRISON: That--yes, absolutely. We-- </p><p>LEE: --This is what I find ironic, I mean, I--ironic, some would say maybe hypocritical, that Google justifies de-platforming a website from its ad platform here, the Federalist, because of content not by the site itself that the site itself has produced, but because of content on the--the site's comment section, while Google insists that the protections it receives under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act are essential just shielded from liability from its own users content. </p><p>Now, how is that not a--a double standard? And--and again, is the fact that Google feels bold enough to act this way evidence that it perhaps doesn't feel competition, doesn't feel threatened even potentially by any competition? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, first of all, no, there--there is no allegation that the Federalist is racist. I think that any large platform has a comments sections, and those comments sections can contain bad comments. Those are comments that--that users have uploaded to the system. </p><p>First of all, you mentioned Section 230. It section 230 is--is helping many publishers deal with the fact that they shouldn't be legally responsible for the comments that are uploaded to their system. And so Section 230 is--is a helpful part of making sure that--that publishers can--and platforms can stay operating even in a world where--where they might have comments sections and people can upload those comment sections. </p><p>Secondly, we--we have these are the same problems on YouTube. YouTube has comments sections. Sometimes those comments sections contain language that's violates our own policies. And we have systems that--capture this. We have systems that can remove hundreds of millions of comments before anyone's seeing this, machine--machine learning and a--and human flags that make sure that--that these comments are taken down, that they're removed. And I think we capture almost 99 point percent of comments before they are read. </p><p>Again, we can work with sites like the Federalist and-and many others to make sure they also adopt, you know, moderation policies that--that make sure that these comments continue to operate in accord--according with the policy. They--they do have options. </p><p>And by the way, they don't only have options in terms of how to moderate--how to maintain their comment board. They have options to go to other advertising solutions if they think that our solutions aren't working. Most publishers use between four and seven different publisher tools to sell their advertising. The Federalist, I believe, uses almost 30 different tools to sell its--its advertising. And so-- </p><p>LEE: --Well-- </p><p>HARRISON: --It has many choices-- </p><p>LEE: --I'm glad to know that. I'm glad to know that. But you--you don't dispute that you are a significant part of this. And you--I still--unless I'm misunderstanding you, I--I still don't think you've answered my question. Isn't there a double standard? Like, what--help me understand why Google should be entitled to that sort of difference, but you're not willing to give that sort of deference to someone else, to another firm that you have just acknowledged isn't a racist, doesn't sponsor those sorts of things, but people sometimes comment on those sites. I don't know, per--perhaps to get them excluded from Google's platform. Is that possible? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator Lee, we didn't--it's often referred to that we de-monetized for we took away the Federalist's ability to make money. We did not do that. We--the Federalist was free to use our services in order to continue to generate money out the content that it shows. And we want to help the Federalist continue to make money off the content it shows. </p><p>They just need to make sure that their comments section is moderated. I don't think you--any advertiser and I don't think you would want any advertiser to see their advertisement showing up to con--next to content that--but they don't agree with or that's--that--objectionable or offensive. </p><p>And so, all our--our--and by the way, we apply these policies to our--our own sites as well. To the extent that--that this type of content is--is at risk of showing up at other platforms, then they need to comply with our policies in order to show advertising. </p><p>LEE: Okay. I--I--I'd love to turn back to 230 later, but--and again, this is an directly relevant to the antitrust inquiry itself, but it--it's--it's indicative of it. This is how a company behaves when it senses, perhaps correctly, that it doesn't have meaningful competition. </p><p>Now, Mr. Harrison, moving on to a--a--another point, if I'm in advertiser placing an-- </p><p>[*]LEE: --ad using Google's ad technology. It is my understanding that Google doesn't tell me how much the publisher is receiving for displaying my ad or how much money from each advertising dollar Google might be keeping for itself. It seems like that might be frustrating for an advertiser who is trying to figure out whether or not she is getting a good deal and consider comparison-shopping. Will you set the record straight today and explain where each advertiser dollar goes (INAUDIBLE) Google ad platform? </p><p>HARRISON: Thank you for the questions Senator and I would point out to the committee and happy to share this that we did recently publish to blogs and clarified both how fees work with industry and then generally across the ad tech ecosystem but let me--let me address both. First of all our--for news publishers and this is an area that are very, really got into ad tech in order to support open ecosystems. Google is a search engine, we benefit with vibrant bright ecosystems where people need to look for information. </p><p>Not only is that a benefit to the ecosystem but it's a benefit to us because we help people find information. We--we got into ad tech to start providing these two publishers. We care deeply specifically about the news industry we work closely with them. We recognize that they are going through a hard evolution in their business model right now and we have a lot of projects to try to help them including the (INAUDIBLE) which is this $300 million effort on our part to help the news industry. We also have massive investment in the tools that help them monetize their content and products that help them get subscribers. </p><p>When it comes to the tools to monetize their content which is your question I just I want to note that they keep almost $.95 of every dollar that they are from--from advertisers mainly for two reasons. One, they can sell that advertisement directly and usually mostly they sell almost 75 percent of their advertisements directly and when they do that they pay very, very small fees to use our systems where a lot of people use our serving tools we are happy that it's a popular product but we charge very, very small amounts of money to use that product and then the portion that they sell programmatically what we call programmatically where they use both of our ad site tools as well as our publisher site tools they can pay anywhere from 70 percent, they receive sorry 70 percent or more of the income from their advertisements and when you bundle these things together they keep $.95 on the dollar. </p><p>When it comes to the broader ecosystem outside of news publishers we--we have done a full analysis of our tools and I want to be clear this is all aspects of our tools. This is as if an advertiser chooses to use our ad site products and then a publisher chooses to use our publisher side products and also our ad exchanges used to connect those two points. In those situations publishers keep more than 69 percent of the revenue and that's above the industry average versus around 67 percent. </p><p>LEE:</p><p>Okay. Thank you. We've got to move on to Senator Hawley now but I--I will note that sharing how fees work isn't the same as transparency for the users on the actual bids. They know they keep 95 percent but they don't know of what, they don't know what the advertiser bid nor do they know what Google takes out of that bed so we may want to get back to that layer. In the meantime we will go to Senator Hawley. </p><p>HAWLEY: Mr. Harrison, thanks for being here. Can we just go back to the Federalist for a moment, please just to clarify something that you said to--to Senator Lee. So do I understand it now that you have a content moderation requirement in order to access Google's ad platforms, is that right? Is that your testimony? </p><p>HARRISON: No,-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Cause the Federalist had--Bay, moderate their content section and what you were saying is they--you require them now to engage in moderation in order to have access to your platforms is that right? </p><p>HARRISON: No, policy, our ads policy is that our ads will not show up against harmful or offensive content that--that is the requirement. If they want to show our ads next to their content then that content can't be harmful or offensive. </p><p>HAWLEY: So in other words they have to moderate it, right? I mean because what they--they didn't moderate their content at all this isn't even their content, it's third-party content and they just didn't moderate it at all which under the terms of section 230 they are perfectly entitled to do but you are saying now that in order to have access to your arguably the Napoli ad platform they have to engage in content moderation and they have to do it apparently according to your standards. Is that accurate? Will you tell us what the standards are that the Federalist and other sites have to meet the content moderation standards? </p><p>HARRISON: So apologies if I wasn't clear earlier but they have three choices. They can choose not to show ads, they can choose to moderate or they can choose to put their commentary behind a wall and not show advertisements again set. No, we--we were requiring them to moderate. We gave them options on how to change in order to allow our ads to show up next to their content. </p><p>HAWLEY: Okay, so basically there choices were modified their site according to your standards in one of two ways either modified their site to hide a comment section which they did not moderate, it's not their content, it's third-party content, they didn't moderate it but they either hard to hide that section, put it behind a wall you just said or they have to engage in content moderation according to your standards. I think your testimony was a moment to go you are willing to help them do that, you are willing to help them engage in this content moderation. Is that right? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, the comments here that we are talking about were highly racist comments. I think anyone (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>HAWLEY: But they weren't the Federalist comments, right? I am just trying to get at what it is you are requiring sites especially small sites like the Federalist compared to your massive sites like YouTube what do they have to do to access your ad platform and what I think you said which I think is news that they have to engage in content moderation and they have to do it according to standards that you have although I don't think any of us know what they are. I think it would be useful if everybody knew what those standards are and so I wonder if you will commit to me today in this committee that you will publish those content moderation standards that you expect sites to meet if they are going to access your ad platforms. Will you do that? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I am happy to share our ads policies with you that make it clear that we will not show ads next to offensive misleading disturbing content but those policies are published and clear and--and websites again I think they are already online but I am very, very happy to share them with your office. Again I did not require the Federalist to adopt content moderation. We gave them options on how to make sure that our ads could show up next to their content that didn't violate their policies that wasn't offensive. </p><p>HAWLEY: Yeah, it is extraordinary--as Senator Lee point the ordinary to do something like this to basically call the tune for a small independent publishers, the construction of their site to design moderation policies for third-party content that they don't monitor or use and that you are able to do this and to force them to adopt the sorts of policies or effectively cut off their revenue stream that is extraordinary. </p><p>Let's talk a little bit about your market dominance in this space since we are on the subject. Now Google operates a publisher ad server, is that correct? (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>HARRISON: That is right. </p><p>HAWLEY: And Google operates a supply side platform as well, is that correct? </p><p>HARRISON: We do. We offer--we offer platforms on both the publisher side and the advertiser side. </p><p>HAWLEY: Okay, right. So you operate a demand side platform also, correct? </p><p>HARRISON: That's right. </p><p>HAWLEY: And you operate advertiser ad servers two, correct? </p><p>HARRISON: That is correct. </p><p>HAWLEY: Right, okay. And the UK competition markets authority commission recently found that Google's market share in all of those layers at the ad stack is dominant. In the first market you have greater than 90 percent market share, in the second market between 40 percent and 60 percent, in the third between 50 percent and 70 percent, in the fourth over 90 percent. Do you know of any other company that exercises this kind of concentration and dominance across every layer of the ad stack? </p><p>HARRISON: First of all, Senator, we have built good products and I am proud that the publisher ecosystem and the advertiser ecosystem chooses to use those products. A couple of things. One, the numbers which talk about ad serving like specifically ad serving which is the sort of plumbing of the Internet that allows ads to appear on publisher websites we do have a popular product there but it doesn't take into account the richness of the entire ecosystem. Many publishers out there choose to provide their own advertising directly. Facebook does this, Amazon does this, tick-tock does this, snap(SP) does this. </p><p>HAWLEY: You but they don't provide--they don't provide advertising on the open web. Are you telling me that you think that the UK market competition markets authority statistics are incorrect? I mean do you dispute these--these statistics? </p><p>HARRISON: I do--I do dispute these statistics. I do think that they use to narrow a market definition in looking at how-- make how to--to construct the market there and I also don't think they took into account that if we tried to raise prices that there were so many other options out there that publishers or advertisers would just flip to one of these other options. </p><p>HAWLEY: I would be very curious given that to hear what you think, what you assess your market share to be in each layer of the ad (INAUDIBLE). Would you make that available to this committee? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I am very happy to cooperate with you anything we have internally to help you understand how market share works. I just want to make one point. </p><p>[*]HAWLEY: Well actually, I don't--I'm not interested in your instruction on how market share works. I'm interested in your response to the UK's long study about your dominance in each layer of the ad stack. So I'll take that as a yes. We'll look forward to those statistics. </p><p>Next, let's just--let's talk about your dominance in search and whether or not you're--how you're using your dominance in search and actually in video. YouTube as well to help give you dominance in the ad stack. It's true that in order to place a display out on YouTube, you have to go through a Google platform, is that right? </p><p>HARRISON: That is correct. In 2016-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Same for search, right? Is it the same? If I want to if I want to put an ad in search, I've got to go through a Google platform. Is that correct? </p><p>HARRISON: Like many companies, we sell our owned and operated inventory directly through our channels. Many other companies do this as well, like Facebook. </p><p>HAWLEY: And you control 90 percent of the market, approximately, for search. Does that sound right? </p><p>HARRISON: I--no. I don't agree with that at all. I think when people search for things, sometimes they use our product, which is a general search engine. But more often, they use many other types of apps and experiences to find what they were looking for. </p><p>I'll just make one point about commercial searches, we--we would love it if people came to our website when they wanted to buy a car or when they wanted to buy a bike or when they wanted to buy, you know, in California right now, it's about buying air purifiers and detecting air quality, but they go to Amazon more often than they go to us. Matter of fact, 70 percent of commercial queries start with a website other than Google. So-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Well, I'm talking--I'm talking about--I understand that you would like under your universal search aspirations(PH), you would like every search in the world to be conducted by the Google platform, but when it comes to assessing markets, your aspirations in market definition or a different things and I'm simply quoting to you the--the statistics that other authorities, including the UK authority have found when they assess your dominance in the online search market. </p><p>But again, if you have a different number, you can share that with us. I think you control 75 percent of the market for online video platforms. Here's my point. It looks like in order to advertise--in fact, it's true that in order to advertise on either of those dominant platforms, you have to use a Google ad platform. That draw--that gives you an enormous advantage, enormous advantage in this ad stack that you control every single layer of. </p><p>People come to you on the supply side and on the demand side because you control so much inventory, so much space, and also because you have so much data, which you have collected through your consumer facing applications like Gmail and search for that matter, G Suite, et cetera. So aren't you using your monopolies in search and in video in order to boost and maintain a monopoly in the ad space as well? </p><p>HARRISON: No, I think the right way to look at whether our market is functioning is to ask yourself are there lots of competitors? Are there lots of choices and prices--are prices falling and--and I think when you look at online advertising not only that search for information but online advertising, you'll see that there are a lot of companies that are doing very well. </p><p>You have--and I I know I touched on this in my opening statement, but you have large companies like Amazon. Amazon's supply side platform over the last three years has grown so that it is bigger than ours. You have small companies like the Trade Desk and Rubicon that have grown immensely in market value over the last few years. That is because all of these companies are able to participate in either broad parts of the ad tech and online advertising or narrow parts of it and they were able to use whatever advantages they have in order to produce a competing product to ours. </p><p>You know, there have--there is no lack of formats for people to advertise today whether it's on mobile, whether it's connected TV, whether it's on the web, and there are no lack of companies, including new companies like TikTok which are becoming very popular in terms of getting people new inventory to advertise against. I--I don't agree that there isn't choice. </p><p>HAWLEY: If I could just ask the indulgence of Senator Klobuchar for just--can I just ask two more questions?  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Of course. </p><p>HAWLEY: I'll be--Okay, thank you. Let me just come back to the issue of transparency that Senator Lee was asking about a moment ago. When Google participates, when Google itself participates by buying or selling on the auction, does Google disclosed what it made to either party during that transaction? </p><p>HARRISON: We have--we have contracts with advertisers. Where advertisers can see how that's what fees did they pay and we have contracts with publishers so the publishers can understand what fees they pay. So they there is transparency. They know how many dollars they have put out in the market and they know how many pennies they have gotten back. </p><p>HAWLEY: But they--but they know--so is your answer yes, they know what you, what Google itself--I'm asking about you because you, Google, you buy and sell on the auction and you do it on both sides. You do it on the supply side and on the demand side. I'm asking you when you buy and sell on the auction, do you disclose to the parties you represent what you paid? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I'm not--and not--again, we have a series of--of contracts-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Let me ask you a different way. Do your clients know how much money Google makes from transacting in the auction? </p><p>HARRISON: Well, one of the reasons that we published the blog that we published, and I'm happy to share that with you as well-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --No, no, no here you can tell me here since you're under--gets much more interesting this way. It's much more interesting to do it under oath. So tell me here. Explain it to us. </p><p>HARRISON: I'm sorry. If you are a publisher and you make--inventory available, you know what you've charged for that inventory, you know what you've received for that inventory-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Do they know what Google makes? I'm asking you do your clients know what you make for the transactions. You buy and sell on both sides of the same transaction because you control the entire ad stack. You control the whole thing. </p><p>You control the exchange, you control the buying and selling, so you buy and sell ostensibly representing other clients. I just wanted to know do your clients know how much you have made in a given transaction when you're buying and selling on both sides? </p><p>HARRISON: So if it is a publisher that is making their inventory available, they are--they are aware of how many how much they both received for the value of their inventory and how much they paid to us and to other members of the--of the chain by which advertisements are-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --But they don't know what you made. They don't know what you made, your--the value of the transaction to you. You, Google. They don't know that, right? You don't disclose that or do you? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I'm struggling with the question because I think there are so many pieces of--of the ad tech chain and so many different people that participate in it because it is an open architecture. You can use our publisher tools, but you can use other advertising tools from other--other providers. </p><p>And so it's hard for me to say publishers aren't generally aware of what the advertisers paid on that side of the equation. Advertisers aren't generally aware of what publishers paid on that side of the equation. So it isn't fully disclosed to the way through other than in each case you have contracting parties on both sides that have agreed to have signed agreements with us that make it clear to them exactly how much they are paying to us and how much they are paying to themselves. </p><p>HAWLEY: Yeah, but the concern--and Senator Klobuchar has been extremely indulgent, so I'll end here, but the concern is, and I know you're well aware of this, that because there is a transparency in this market that you control end to end, you are paying prices, you were making profits that nobody is aware of and it'--it's hard to get clear on. And so we don't actually know that your clients don't actually know what your role in the transaction is or what profit you're taking away from it because you don't disclose that. And since you control the whole stack and you buy and sell on both sides, you essentially privilege yourselves. With that, I'll yield. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Hawley. Thank you very much, Mr. Harrison. According to the UK's competition markets authority, Google has dominant market share positions in every market in the ad tech ecosystem, what I was talking about in my opening. With particularly high market shares of at least 80 percent in both the publisher ad server and advertiser add circuit markets. </p><p>In the opinion of some experts, Google gained these dominant market share positions through acquisitions, buying DoubleClick in 2007, AdMob in 2009, Invite Media in 2010, Admeld in 2011, and Adometry in 2014. That's quite the collection of names. Although some enforcers raised competition concerns about these deals when they were proposed, none were really challenged. </p><p>With the benefit of hindsight, it seems obvious that these acquisitions were undertaken by the company in order to add to its market share and without explanation I really can't think of anything else is there for the series of mergers over the course of years other than for Google to establish and maintain the monopoly power it currently has, Mr. Harrison? </p><p>HARRISON: I'm sorry, Senator. What was the question? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: The question is what--the question is what explanation is there for this series of mergers other than you were buying out what were or would have been eventual competitors? </p><p>HARRISON: So going back to the first acquisition, which was Double Click, we made a commitment because we recognized that that the vibrant, healthy publisher ecosystem was to our benefit to invest in the tools. And again, I've made--the reason it's to our benefit is because if you're using Google search and there was only one or two sites to go to, we're not a very useful proposition. If there are thousands of sites to find, then we are a good value proposition and people use us. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Do you think that Google would have had a 90 percent of the publisher ad server market if you hadn't bought Double Click? </p><p>[*]HARRISON: So, respectfully, and I--we've read the CMA's report, UK's Competition and Market Authority report. There is a--a couple things to note in that report. One, they found that competitors were able to succeed in this market. I--you know, Apple--sorry, Amazon, Twitter, Snap being three examples. They found the publishers use to between--all multi-home using between four and seven tools, that advertisers used four and six tools. So, there is tremendous choice as you work through this. </p><p>Each of the acquisitions that you outline were us trying to--finding a--a piece of innovation in connection with AdMob, which is a good example, mobile. We had no real tool to do in app advertising, and so we recognized the chance to take AdMob's technology, which was nascent at the time, invested with, you know, our ability to scale and our knowledge of--of large-scale computer systems. And I think we built AdMob into what is a very effective a product for mobile advertisers. </p><p>But we didn't buy it because--because there was an anticompetitive intent. And that didn't-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --So, are you troubled that at this point you have this market share without any real competitor in this area? </p><p>HARRISON: So, I--I just don't--I don't agree with the market share. If we could take one aspect, and--and I--I know I tried to address this earlier, but--but with--with Senator Hawley, the--the--the ad serving market, right, which is one market that--that has been--sorry, this is both publishers and ads serving the actual tags, that has been often cited as where we have a 90 percent share. </p><p>When the EC looked at this issue in connection with DoubleClick, they found that when they considered in-house tools, in-house tools that could very easily be made externalized and are used by huge companies like Facebook, that--that art market share dropped to 20 percent. I think when you look through each of these things--again, we have popular products and--and I recognize that--that without popularity comes the questions, especially good questions like the ones you're asking, but we don't agree that that--we don't agree that we are dominant. We don't agree that there isn't a ton of choice. And we think that that market is operating very effectively. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. All right. Well, we disagree on the dominance. </p><p>So, let's go to another area. Because YouTube represents nearly half of the video ad inventory available outside of--and this is outside of walled gardens like Facebook, and has a broader audience reach that FacebookYouTube video ads are--than Facebook, YouTube video ads are a must buy for advertising agencies. Initially, all demand-side platforms could've been to place ads on YouTube. But in 2015, Google limit access to only Google's DSP DV360. </p><p>This, of course, had a crippling effect on Google's rivals, because most advertising agencies prefer to use only one DSP. The limitation not only forces YouTube's ad inventory into Google DSP, it also had the effect of driving non-YouTube ad volume to Google and away from the rival DSPs. So, how does Google justify its decision to limit access to YouTube inventory to its own affiliates? </p><p>HARRISON: Yeah. So, in--in 2015, we were trying to wrestle with new European rules that were coming forward on privacy. And in response to that, we--we--we migrated to what we called a true view, a viewing platform that allowed, you know, number of features like being able to click through and not--and not see ads and--and--and some of the--some of the--the tools around how you would watch videos that no longer made it compare apples to apples with other inventory that was available on AdX, which is--which is one of our exchanges. And so, we had to make the decision to--to only provision that for our only tools, because we didn't know how to make it operate in a wide auction competing against other video advertising. </p><p>A--a couple things, and these come from the CMA report. They--they found that--that YouTube's share of--of--of display video advertising was only 10 percent to 20 percent, and looked at many of the same variables that you're looking at in terms of--of figuring out what market share was. They also--there are many other companies that have been successful in selling their video advertising directly through their platforms. And just as a final point, the rest-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: But why wouldn't you have advertisers deal directly with YouTube? </p><p>HARRISON: They--they can deal directly with YouTube. I'm sorry, Senator, I don't understand the--the question. Advertisers-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --I'm asking, if you wanted to make YouTube a walled garden, why not have them deal directly with YouTube? </p><p>HARRISON: As opposed to using our ad serving technology? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Um-hmm. Um-hmm. </p><p>HARRISON: Well, I--I that's a simply because that's how--that is--that is the tool that we have put to advertisers in order to buy ads on our platforms. I--I think you're proposing maybe creating a--a separate tool and that--that didn't seem--that doesn't seem--that doesn't seem, to--to me, to necessarily make sense. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. So, whenever we go through all these things, the answer usually is there--that Google argues that it has no incentive to harm publishers, advertisers, or users. If this is true, why are we hearing so many complaints? Why do we keep hearing this? We don't--you know, you don't hear complaints about companies all the time. </p><p>When you start hearing them over and over again, it feels like a canary in the coal mine in terms of people feeling that there's not an even playing field because of this buy side and sell side of the ad tech stack, and that there is this inherent conflict of interest that they see, and it reflects the lack of competition. I mean, have you heard those complaints? And what would you do if you were us? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, there's--there--we are a popular service. I understand that. And--and if--if I was you, I would do what you're doing, which is asking the questions that you're asking. </p><p>Just one least point, and--and I--I don't know which complaint you're talking about. But in the same period of time that--that, you know, that we this decision on TrueView, two platforms, in particular, you know, Amazon, were able to grow and to become a larger platform than us without access to this inventory. I think many--you know, I think many companies have their own successful products, their own successful ways that they can sell their advertising, are able to do that effectively directly. But again, happy to keep answering these questions. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. I think you'll be able to answer them up from Senator Blumenthal, who is here, so Senator Blumenthal? </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Welcome to the committee, even though it's virtual. I think, with all due respect, Mr. Harrison, you've been given a really thankless task of defending the indefensible. </p><p>Google claims that what it does is, in effect, preside over an open and free market, but in no other markets does the same party represent the seller, the buyer, make the rules, and conduct the auction. And I think that is the nub of the issue here from an antitrust standpoint, and seems unacceptable in a really free market and in a free enterprise system, which is why I hope there will be antitrust enforcement directed against Google. </p><p>The European authorities have already shown us the way in their leadership on these issues to protect consumers. And the point of antitrust law is to protect consumers and competition, not necessarily other businesses. But in fact, other businesses are also victimized. Local newspapers like the Hartford Courant and the New Haven Register hire Google to sell their ad space so they can make their payrolls, employ people locally, provide news to people like me, and provide their communities with a real public service. </p><p>And to sell those ads, Google collects sensitive commercial information about those newspapers and their readers. You know every single person who, like me, wakes up, reads the Courant and the Register and other newspapers. And we trust you to act as their agent on the ad market. They trust you to act as their agent. </p><p>But Google has an immense conflict of interest. You don't just represent the newspapers and the transaction, but many times the advertisers as well. And you run and control the exchanges where the actual transaction happens. You're able to use that information you have on all the parties to extract massive possible value for Google, which is why you are so immensely profitable, 40 percent on capital, according to the European authority. </p><p>So, let me begin by asking you, does Google firewall the Courant, the Register, and other publishers' data from the rest of its clients and operations?  </p><p>HARRISON: So, first of all, Senator, I want to say that we're--we're also highly, highly committed to--to news publishers and making sure that--making sure that that industry, which is a--a massively important industry to this--to--to a functioning democracy. We've committed to building products for them to help them transition to subscriptions. We know that in the time of COVID that advertising revenue has been falling for newspapers, and so we're helping them drive subscriptions. </p><p>We're also in the process of engaging in conversations with publishers worldwide about sort of resetting the economic relationship in order to make sure that the publishers, especially publishers of quality journalism, have-- </p><p>[*]BLUMENTHAL: Harrison, I apologize I'm going to interrupt you because as you--as you know time is limited not through any fault of yours but under our rules so let me answer the question for you. The answer is no. Google tags the current and the registers readers. It allows advertisers to target them elsewhere. Google says if you don't want to pay their prices I will help you target their readers still. That is in my view a breach of trust. That money should be going to the newsrooms not to Google. Do you disagree with me? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator we--we--and we published a blog on this, also happy to share information. News publishers keep more than 95 percent of the revenue that they generate from the content that they sell. They do that because they have the option to sell it directly and many of them do successfully sell it directly or the option to use our systems where the rates we take are far, far lower than the industry average. Your--your questions regarding data, data is subject to the agreements we have with the publishers and I can't understand exactly what it is that you think that were doing incorrectly with that data but we only use that data to help-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: You are using their data for your benefit, not for theirs or for their readers and you are driving them out of business. Maybe not financially out of business but you are engaging in conduct that cuts their payrolls, there are fewer employees at those newspapers, nationwide not just the current and the register go down the list. In Connecticut and around the country and it is used to your benefit not for the benefit of the people who own that data. </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I--I--respectfully I just don't see it the way that you are describing it we--we use revenue share with publishers so that we benefit when they sell advertising. Our sole goal with ad tech is to help the publishers make as much money as they can so that we in turn earn the rev share on the advertisements that they are able to sell. There--there is no conflict there. Our--our interest are aligned. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Maybe not from your point of view--your interests are aligned with your company but not with theirs. Let me ask you about the system of the AMP and exclusion of ad company I know it sounds technical but it has an immense impact on Google and on consumers. Google started to condition treatment on Google Search, a market where Google has 88 percent slowly. Google started to condition treatment on Google search, a market where Google has 88 percent market share in the United States on publishers adoption of another Google product, AMP. </p><p>It did so right at the time when publishers finally found new tools to foster competition. When Google set the rules for AMP it happened to block ad competitors and force them back into Google's own products and conveniently also handed Google a treasure trove of publisher data, publishers were facing a possible loss of 40 percent to 50 percent of incoming traffic with the top news and speed update rules unless they caved to those rules. That is quite simply a stunning abuse of Google market power and I would like to know what your explanation is. </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, we introduced a, what we call AMP, accelerated mobile pages which I think you are referring to as for--for a simple reason that when websites moved slowly and in particular when these websites were making a transition to mobile environments where--where it was new technology and--and some of these pages were loading extremely slowly, if a page loads slowly it does not monetize very well. The second that it takes seconds to load will generally move away and often it is the advertising that interferes with that load speed. We introduced AMP simply to help publishers and to try to give publishers a tool to allow their webpages to load more quickly and we were proud of that tool. </p><p>We never architected that tool so that it was the closed system. All of the tools that we use in our ad tech stack have to interoperate mainly because most of the publishers and advertisers multi-home. Every other product that is--that is operating in these systems AMP--AMP was no different. We didn't design AMP so that it would only work with Google. We didn't design AMP so that it would somehow foreclose your access to other ways to sell your inventory. It was simply about trying to get webpages to load faster and--and now that we have been clear since that AMP is not required to use any of our tools. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: My time is expired but if we have another round of question I hope we can follow up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Senator (INAUDIBLE) is going to go vote in a minute so I'm going to let her go out of turn (INAUDIBLE) follow-up. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yes, I just have yeah, one--one question here and I just--to me this conflict Mr. Harrison is pretty obvious and I know you see it differently but I am just thinking about the fact that most of your companies aren't a verb, you know your competitors Google it. They are not a verb. You are it and so that is fine except it's not fine when you are controlling as Senator Blumenthal just pointed out this advertising side, you are the dominant side, when you are controlling, you're the dominant one to publish and then you control the auction that those people--people participate in when it comes to determining the advertising. </p><p>So I guess one question I have some people have actually compared digital advertising exchanges to electronic trading in the financial markets which are of course regulated to prevent conflicts of interest in appropriate self-dealing, trading on inside information and I know this is not how you started out as a company and are now a very successful one but at some point regulators and people who are trying to insure there's competition have to start looking at models like that to make sure there's not a conflict that advantages your company, one arm of your company from the other arm. So why shouldn't the digital advertising exchanges the regulated in a way like that? </p><p>HARRISON: Thank you Senator and these are important questions that I think you look for regulation in a market where you see market failure and I--I don't want to sound like a broken record but I do not see market failure in online advertising. You asked-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I am just going to--I want you to be able to answer but you know the market failure may not be as obvious when you are talking about the prices for your email yet product which could have by the way gone a lot lower but there's a market failure for these content producers who aren't able to get advertising anymore because they are going over to you but they are still trying to provide the content. To me that's a failure of sorts, like a big failure for them. It's just something that doesn't quite look like you. </p><p>HARRISON: So I would highlight that the CMA, UK's market looked at this and found that most publishers use between four, seven tools. Most large publishers use 25, 30 tools in order to sell their advertising and the fundamental test should be are they getting dollar, are they getting valuable dollars for the advertising that they are selling and are they able to see that they are getting valuable dollars for the advertising that they are selling and I think that is the case. I--I think you wouldn't have large companies like AT&amp;T or Verizon participate in this space if they didn't think that there was a chance for them to carve out a meaningful value proposition. </p><p>I don't think you would have small companies like the trade desk which grew from $1 billion-$20 billion in market in a very short period of time with because they were also able to carve out a very good value proposition for them in this ad tech stack. I think there's tremendous choice. I think there's lots of competitors. I think prices have come down I know I talked about the fact that advertising prices and I think our tools have contributed to this were almost down 40 percent over the last 10 years so I--I don't see the market failure that would require regulation. I am happy to keep getting these good questions. </p><p>You know I would note that--that we continue to invest in research and development in almost $26 billion in 2018 which is up 10x. The reason we invest in research and development is because we compete vigorously for every place that we have and the success of our products and I would also note that the U.S.--U.S. company invested almost $20 billion in that same period of time in the United States and much of the innovation that we produced is produced here. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you and again I do not quarrel with your success or the jobs you have provided. I'm just looking at our job which is to make sure as we look at the long haul that we are encouraging competition and we are encouraging new businesses to develop and right now not just in your area but across the board those businesses, startups were in a slump before the pandemic and we are seeing more and more of that while other companies are getting more and more dominant and to me it is more than just about Google, it is a systemic issue because the laws haven't matched the sophistication of your company and others. Our regulators haven't matched it and we are where we are and that is why I think we need to make a major overhaul. Thank you. </p><p>[*]HARRISON: Thank you. </p><p>LEE: And of course, the test isn't whether publishers--whether publishers are getting dollars for ad space. The test is whether the dollars they get or are competitive rates or whether they are suppressed because of anti-competitive conduct like time. Am I missing something there? </p><p>HARRISON: I think when the--when the UK looked at this issue, they found that the industry average for, you know, how much rev share it was--share of the publishers was around 67 percent. Again, our tools or higher than, you know, approximately at or higher than 69 percent. So we're certainly market competitive with the other tools that are out there. </p><p>LEE: Okay. Let's--let's talk about YouTube--about Google and about YouTube for a minute. As you know, your company has a very strong position as an online publisher, particularly with respect to YouTube. This is an innovation. It's an it's an asset that you've got in your company that is very valuable. </p><p>And if an advertiser wants to place an ad on YouTube, as I understand it, please correct me if I'm wrong, as I understand it, since 2015, the policy has been that the advertiser wanting to place an advertisement on YouTube has no choice pursuant to Google's policy but to use Google's own ad buying platform. And so I've got some questions about this about why Google chose to implement this restriction and--and whether that doesn't have some tendency to exclude competing demand side platforms from the market. </p><p>So for example, let's assume, Mr. Harrison, that if--if YouTube we're an independent actor and as such--as an independent actor, trying to maximize demand and revenue why wouldn't YouTube in that circumstance open up its inventory to as many demand side platforms as possible, and therefore, as many bidders as possible? Wouldn't that make sense? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I think it depends on--on the goals of the platform of the website. In this case, again, we were trying to balance new features that we were introducing with the fact that those new features weren't offered by other platforms another inventory and therefore it would have been very hard to sell that inventory side-by-side. I also think, answer your question, that there are lots of examples of companies choosing to self-provision you know their own inventory. </p><p>Facebook is an example, Snap is an example, Pinterest is an example. These are all companies that have not chosen to open up their inventory but to require to use their tools in order to directly purchase their inventory. Again, in many cases, you know, I know this is the case with Snap and Pinterest, they're trying to balance privacy and that and some of the features they have around privacy with the--with the sale of advertising are very protective of that. And I--I think the confluence of those two things it gives you a reason why people have chosen different ways in order to sell their advertising. </p><p>LEE: Those companies aren't must have properties though. I mean, they--they are different than yours, right? </p><p>HARRISON: Again, I don't know what--what--must have in this context means the ability to--to reach new consumers or an advertiser to reach its consumers. I do think these are platforms that are--that have--you know, they have their specific focus, but they're very important in order to--to reach there--to reach consumers and point to the massive amount of choice that's in the ecosystem out there if you're an advertiser and want to try to--want to try to find a way to sell your product. </p><p>LEE: I know that you claim that advertisers might end up building against themselves, but surely the world's largest technology company, that is your company, Google, is capable of creating a work around to prevent that if--if advertisers--assuming the advertisers couldn't do it themselves. You being the world's biggest technology company and the most successful one, surely you could figure that out. I mean, how is this not just sort of cynical effort to leverage the market power of Google's properties like--like search and YouTube into something of a monopoly in online advertising? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I want to point out that we are not the largest technology company in the world. There are at least three other technology companies right now that are significantly larger than us and-- </p><p>LEE: --Okay, you get the point. I mean, surely, we're not going to quibble here about whether or not Google is a large technology company. I--I get your point if you want to split hairs there, that's fine. My point is I don't think there's there aren't many in the world with the skill and the expertise that you've got, right? </p><p>HARRISON: Agree. In the areas we compete in, yes. Yes. And so, Senator, your question is? </p><p>LEE: Yeah, so my question is why couldn't you just figure out a work around for that so that they didn't end up bidding against themselves? I mean got that sounds to me like something that's not really all that difficult, I would think technologically speaking (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, that's a good question. A lot of this is a complex ecosystem. A lot of the points I've tried to make are about complexities as a result of the fact that you have almost 800 participants in the ecosystem. There is an issue with the fact that there are so many platforms on one side and so many platforms on another that you have advertisers bidding into so many different platforms that may be aggregating demand from the same sources that they end up--they end up competing with themselves. </p><p>I think one of our criticisms of a tool called header bidding, which by the way, we fully work with, when header bidding came out, it was opaque to advertisers as to how they were bidding. It was better for publishers. Publishers weren't making more money. I don't--I don't quibble with that. But it was difficult for advertisers because they didn't know where--you know, how the dollars were competing with themselves. </p><p>And one of our issues was to try to stitch that back together with a new product called open bidding that tried to give this transparency back to the advertisers. I think with any large ecosystem, especially one as complex as--as AdTech, you--the more participants you have the more likely that you have the situation where advertisers can bid against themselves. In an ideal world, there's--there's one tool and then advertisers and publishers have perfect transparency across all of those tools in order to both sell and buy advertising, but that's not the state of the market today. And I don't think you want us to be that one tool that would sort of solve the issue that you're erasing. </p><p>LEE: (OFF-MIC) let's move on to a different issue. Mr. Harrison, it's my understanding that Google does not provide advertisers specific information on the effectiveness of particular ads that they run such as how many clicks an ad received or how many people who happened to click on a particular ad actually made a purchase, in other words, how many of them resulted in closing a sale. That seems like an important piece of information or an important category of information, it rather, for advertisers to have when doing comparison shopping and when making strategic decisions about how, when, whether, to what extent, in what way, through what platforms to advertise. </p><p>And from what I hear, Google's competitors provide or allowed third parties to provide this kind of information. Will Google provide advertisers with non-aggregated information about the effectiveness of particular ad impressions? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I'm--I'm surprised at this. And maybe it's because I'm not understanding you. We--we have whole teams that are dedicated to nothing but helping advertisers calculate their return on investment, their ROI on their advertising dollars spend. The--the whole reason that I think Google has been able to be successful, and particularly successful to small and medium these businesses, again, we--we level the scales a bit as opposed to when large companies could only buy television advertising or radio advertising, we allow small companies to spend very small amounts of money in order to access the advertising ecosystem. </p><p>There's a great example of a company called Strider Bikes out of South Dakota that is able to use our tools to now sell 50 percent of their inventory internationally. Not only do we provide that capability, but we also give them many, many tools in order to figure out whether or not they're getting a return on their investment. So--so I am surprised. It's possible that I'm not understanding your question, but we--we give advertisers tremendous tools to figure out whether or not they--there is value in the advertising that they're spending. </p><p>LEE: Okay, so how do you respond to those claims that you don't provide them? How do you respond to claims that--from advertisers that you don't give them that information? Is that just wrong? </p><p>HARRISON: Well, I don't--there seems to be--sorry, Senator. If I understood understanding your question, there seems to be specific types of information they were looking for. </p><p>[*]HARRISON: I--I--I don't--I'm worried that either--perhaps we restrict that information because it's-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah-- </p><p>HARRISON: --Private data or the-- </p><p>LEE: --No, I think--one of the claims they make is that the--to the extent you provide them with some information about it, it's--it's--it isn't as good. It isn't as robust. It's not as complete as what they get from--from your competitors. </p><p>HARRISON: I--I would have to--and by the way, very happy to follow up with you in order to understand your question. Let me--we give advertisers as much data as we can. It is possible that--that some of the data that you're asking for relates to specific behavior of the ad as compared to specific users or aggregations of users. And again, we're careful to protect the privacy of the people that use our platform, and--and there is a limit on how much of that information we can share with advertisers. </p><p>LEE: Okay. All right. I see my time is expired. Senator Cruz is up next. Senator Cruz? </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Harrison, welcome. Thank you for testifying at the hearing. </p><p>HARRISON: Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Google is that every stage in the advertising process. On the buy side, Google serves ads and has a buying platform. On the sell side, it has an ad exchange and is the publisher. No other company that I'm aware of is in every space, and--and no other company is nearly as prominent. Given that, would you agree that--that Google plays a dominant role in buying and selling ads online? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I--I agree that--that we have built tools, and--and again, obviously tremendous success with our own properties and how we sell advertising on our own properties. And--and we are invested in the success of the publisher ecosystem, a broad publisher ecosystem, because we think that's--that a vibrant, successful Internet ecosystem is good for Google, also good for the publishers that participate in this ecosystem. </p><p>The--whether or not--the question you're asking is whether or not we're dominant. To me, dominant implies some sort of abuse. And the--and again, all I see are--are lower prices. </p><p>CRUZ: No, I didn't talk about abuse. I'm just talking about the degree of market power you have. By--by any measure, Google is the 800 pound gorilla. Isn't that right? Is there anybody even close? </p><p>HARRISON: I--I think that--that--well, first of all, I do--I do think there are companies that--that are at or larger size than us, but I also think that the idea of dominance and market power means the ability to raise prices or lower innovation, and prices have fallen. And our investment in innovation, again, $28 billion in 2018, that's up 10x over the last 10 years. Our--our company-- </p><p>CRUZ: --What companies do believe are at or--or more dominant in buying and selling ads online? </p><p>HARRISON: Well, I think we have healthy competitors. I think Facebook is--is a very successful company. I think Amazon, and building both its own ad products as well as its supply-side capabilities, is--has also proven itself to be a capable competitor. All of these competitors exercise constraint on our ability to either charge prices or not invest in innovation. And--and to me, that is a healthy competitive environment. </p><p>CRUZ: Now, Facebook and Amazon are--are not competing with you in the search space, are they? </p><p>HARRISON: Yeah--yes, Senator, I--I would say that they are competing with this in the search space. I don't-- </p><p>CRUZ: --Look, I'll confess. I've Googled something today. I haven't Facebooked it. I haven't Amazon--I may have actually ordered something on Amazon too. But if I'm searching for something--I--I go to those sites for different purposes, is the--is that--when someone wants to find out some information, when someone wants to find out what does Joe Biden think about taxes, they search Google, and--and the Google search results are what they look to. Is that correct? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I--I think it's a great--a great question. And--and if I could share, I--I don't think--I think that we offer a general search engine. That is--that is our value proposition, and I'm happy that we have built a good general search engine. And that--maybe 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we occupied a specific space. And--and I know some of the numbers that are thrown around because people compare us as a general search engine to other general search engines. But I don't think that that's how the search for information begins. </p><p>I think that people decide that they want to buy something, right, and then they have a choice. They can go to Amazon for-- </p><p>CRUZ: --I'm--I'm not talking about purchasing something. And I agree for online purchases, if you're buying books online, Amazon has the dominant position. Let's focus on, you took issue with--with dominance and you said, well, gosh, Google isn't abusive. </p><p>There's been some discussion of this already during the hearing. But--but earlier this year, Google used its market position to threaten the Federalist, which is a conservative website, and demanded that it--it remove its comments section, that it take it down or it wouldn't be able to use Google ads. If Google isn't dominant, why does it have the power to demand of a media publisher it disagrees with that it take down the--the comments site, and why does it expect immediate obedience? </p><p>HARRISON: So--so, we have an--an ads product, and that ads product has many policies that determine what we can show at inventory against. I think that if you're someone who makes, you know, child clothes and--and what to sell child clothes using our advertising system, you do not want your children's close to appear next to harmful or offensive information. </p><p>In the Federalist case, their comments section and racist commentary in it. And we are--that violated our ads policies, and so we couldn't show ads next to that content. And those policies are clear. They're published. They're understandable. </p><p>CRUZ: So, how many other media outlets do you demand they pull down their comments pages? </p><p>HARRISON: Any--any media outlet that--that contain defensive information like--like the racist information that was in the Federalist, we would not show ads against. We're not asking them to pull it down. Let's be very, very clear about that. </p><p>CRUZ: So, Google owns YouTube, which is a dominant media viewing platform. YouTube allows comments. There are racist and offensive comments on YouTube comments. I'm assuming that Google--Google does not de-monetize its wholly-owned subsidiary, YouTube. Is that right? </p><p>HARRISON: So, we give three choices to publishers. And--and I will answer your question. We give three choices to publishers. One is they don't have a comment section. Secondly, they put their comments section behind another click(PH). And by the way, a lot of large news publishers do this, like the New York Times, where to get to the comments section you click once, it takes you to a separate webpage, and there are no ads showing on that webpage. The publisher is free to operate that comments appear on a separate page. Or, third, they can choose to moderate their comments page. </p><p>This is what YouTube does. YouTube heavily moderates its comments page. We removed almost 700 million YouTube comments in one quarter. We removed most comments at the--at the 99 percent mark before people even see them or as soon as they appear. So, we take efforts to moderate, and that's why ads can show--show next to that. The Federalist-- </p><p>CRUZ: --So, in the--in the past two years, how many websites, how many media outlets as Google used its market position and market power on ads to force them to take down or change the comment page? How--how frequently has what happened to the Federalist happened to others? </p><p>HARRISON: I would have to get back to you, Senator, with that answer. And I'm happy to get back to you with that answer. I would point out, though, that we--we--we do receive complaints on either side of the aisle on this issue. We've pull down videos on the Daily Show, on--on Last Week Tonight and Democracy Now, and have received complaints from those sites. So, we operate a wide platform. That wide platform has more views that have probably ever been expressed on--in human history in one platform, and we get complaints from both sides when we use our policies, again, clearly stated policies, to pull down content. </p><p>CRUZ: So, Mr. Harrison, I'm going to follow up with you in writing and ask you for that information. And you just represented to this committee that Google will provide that information. I've asked you for that information before, and Google has stonewalled and refused to give an answer. So, I'm hopeful that your testimony here will be followed up on by--by some--some modicum of--of transparency. </p><p>Let's talk about YouTube for a second, and our time is wrapping up here. Sometime ago, I visited with the YouTube CEO, who reports to--to Google, and she described to me with respect to Stephen Crowder, another conservative/libertarian comedian, talk show host, who Google de-monetized. She described how the left was pushing YouTube to ban him altogether, and she sat in my office and argued that we should be happy that--that YouTube didn't ban him. They simply demonetize him. They simply took away his ability to earn money. And she thought that was a middle ground, even though she conceded that he done nothing to violate--violate YouTube's terms of service. </p><p>Now, I pointed out that the demands to censor and silence are only coming from one direction. They're only coming from the left, that I was not asking for others were not asking her to censor or silence leftists, to censor or silence socialists. I'm happy for them to speak as much as they like because I think their ideas don't withstand scrutiny. Do you think it's acceptable for Google and YouTube to engage in politically motivated and biased censorship by using the monetization to punish anyone whose speech it disagrees with? </p><p>HARRISON: So, Senator, whether it's search or YouTube, political bias, political viewpoint does not influence whether content appears or doesn't appear, whether it appears at the top, where ever it appears on our website. We simply--we have designed our policies so that-- </p><p>[*]HARRISON: --political bias is not part of the equation. We have whether it's YouTube or search we have clear policies at the outset and you have a very rigorous process to make sure that new experiments, new exchanges and we do almost 400,000 experiments a year-- </p><p>CRUZ: So my time is expired but--but as a final question are you familiar with Doctor Robert Epstein's research and how would you respond to his conclusions that are directly contrary to what you just testified? </p><p>HARRISON: Yeah, Senator, I would love to follow up on that (INAUDIBLE) a quick answer. I--I am aware of the survey. I think we found that the methodology wasn't of effective and we actually ran our own searches I am sorry our own investigations actually into the Senate to figure out whether or not we could find any bios in either how YouTube ads perform--YouTube performed or a search performed. We compared both Republican and Democratic Senators. We found that they were very evenly balanced on both sides of the aisle in terms of their engagement on YouTube or how our click through rates worked on search and so we don't--you know we don't know agree with this and by the way The Economist has also reviewed both our search--you know our search (INAUDIBLE) and have found no evidence of political bias and The Economist is an outside organization. </p><p>CRUZ: Will you provide that study to this committee? </p><p>HARRISON: Yes, I will. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. </p><p>LEE: Senator Hawley? </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you Mr. Chairman--Chairman. Mr. Harrison let me just come back to this issue briefly if I could of add tying which is what Senator Lee was asking you about a moment ago. We have talked about how YouTube and search you have dominant positions in both of those areas and platforms and that you have to use a Google ad platform in order to place advertisements on search or on YouTube which means that an awful lot of people are using tools like Google ads and DB 360(SP). My question to you is do your demand side platforms like Google ads DB 360 do you offer volume discounts to advertisers? </p><p>HARRISON: The--you mean do large marketers for instance large ad--do we--do we provide different rates? Sorry, is that the question? </p><p>HAWLEY: Yes, do you offer volume discounts? </p><p>HARRISON: We--we do have programs that allow very large advertisers or very large agencies which I believe are industry-standard reduced rates. I'm not sure whether that counts as a volume discount but reduced rates when they buy our advertising. </p><p>HAWLEY: Have--have these volume commitments that are necessary in order to get the discounts, have they increased over time? </p><p>HARRISON: I--I am sure that as our systems have grown they have grown as well. </p><p>HAWLEY: And in fact, they have increased so much that you can't actually meet the volume requirements just buying advertising on YouTube or search, you now actually have to use Google's demand side platforms in order to advertise on third-party platforms, isn't that correct? </p><p>HARRISON: I'm sorry Senator. I will have to I--I don't know the answer to that question it doesn't sound like it's the case to me but I--I will need to get back to you on how that works. </p><p>HAWLEY: Wouldn't that--wouldn't that be a problem if that were correct? Wouldn't you be using your dominant position in YouTube and in search in order to incentivize and indeed monopolize the demand-side and market? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I--I don't see it that way. If--if large advertisers, brands that we know and love or agencies by a large amount of advertising it is a good thing for the various networks that can participate in that advertising to you know to benefit from that increased demand and so yes, we and many other companies if not all other companies that sell advertising use programs that incentivize large-scale ad purchases because we are in the business of selling advertising but I don't know why that would be harmful from the perspective of our--of our sell side platforms. </p><p>HAWLEY: Well it would be harmful because it gives you an advantage that nobody else has. </p><p>I mean if you have the YouTube and search platforms and other companies do not have you not only own those platforms but as has been discussed at some length on this hearing you control the entire add stack from top to bottom as well and you are using your dominant position in search and YouTube in order to give your cells a dominant position in the add stack and not just on the demand-side, not just with these volume requirements but also on the supply side because as you drive so much volume on to your demand-side platform it creates then strong incentives on the supply side for publishers to use the supply side not least because you have tremendous amounts of consumer data and there are--there are great efficiencies that you create if publishers will use your supply-side given the volume of traffic you have driven to the demand-side, right? This looks like--this looks like tying to me in the antitrust context. Am I wrong? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I--I don't agree. First of all these are small percentages, very small percentages that are used only with the largest advertisers. I think you will find that anyone who sells large amounts of advertising and I think I would include you know some of our largest competitors including some of the competitors that also operate large supply side platforms as having similar incentives with--with large advertisers. I don't--the idea that from a business perspective that you would encourage large buyers to buy a little bit more is--it seems appealing from a business perspective and I'd - my given all of the choice that I have outlined in terms of publishers and advertisers being able to use all sorts of different platforms either to buy or sell advertising I just I don't know where the harm is. </p><p>HAWLEY: Well, I think the concern is that you control YouTube and search which are the dominant platforms. You control massive amounts of consumer data that you have harvested from your other consumer facing platforms Gmail, Google maps, G Suite, etc. You then use those advantages in the add stack at every single layer, every layer of which you exercise dominant sin. This looks like monopoly upon monopoly in a classic case of tying. I mean we--we will see, right? We are going to find out I hope as these antitrust investigations proceed but the appearance I think is very troubling. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>LEE: Senator Klobuchar? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yes, since we are still going here I had a question on the privacy front and maybe talk a little bit about Google's use of consumer data. As you know Senator Cantwell and I and a number of other are trying to work out privacy legislation. It has been hard to pass and the companies for a long time have been saying no and then suddenly states are doing individual legislation and then all of the sudden there's a cry for federal privacy legislation to preempt the states and I get the logic but I want to make sure anything that we do is as strong as possible. So Google has a lot of personal data for many of its popular consumer businesses that we have just been discussing. </p><p>Senator Hawley just brought up some of them Chrome, Google maps, Google search Android, Gmail and YouTube including data as I mentioned on location, gender, buying habits, etc. and the user can sense that allow Google to collect this data are extremely broad and allow for practically any use. It doesn't seem like most people really understand what is going to be doing. I know this feeling you get on a site, you click the box and no one really understands what's going on or what they have consented to. First of all two questions. This seems like a big problem to me. Do you really think people understand that and do you see why we are trying to drive some kind of privacy legislation? </p><p>HARRISON: Yes, so yes this is--it has always been a serious issue but it is especially a serious issue especially as we are seeing legislation emerge in Europe, legislation emerge in the U.S. First of all from the beginning but certainly in a renewed push over the last five, 10 years we designed all of our products with (INAUDIBLE) transparency and control embedded in them. We try to make it as clear to users as possible you know what it is that they are consenting to. </p><p>You know I take your point that at times it appears confusing but what they are consenting to, how we use their data and then they have the control whether or not they want to delete their data, whether or not they want to provision ads against that data, how, what kind of ads we are putting against this data and I think we are getting better and better. Our--our Google-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Have you ever done a study to see if they understand what's happening to their data and told them afterward this is what happened? Did you understand that that is what you signed up for? </p><p>HARRISON: We have almost 1 billion users now that have gone to their Google accounts page to check their privacy settings. We have almost 20 million people a day going to Google - make to their Google account to--to check and verify their privacy settings. We just released our new version of android which is trying to do a much better job of making sure-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay, but I just asked that. I made up this question on the spot here but have you done those studies where you asked them to you know what you really agree to do? </p><p>HARRISON: We--we always do user studies with any change that we would make so I don't--anyone of the changes I just talked about I am sure that we--you know product managers presented on it, we have studied it, we've looked at it closely and we try to make choices that are in the best interest of our users. We want our users to be able to make the decision on how they control the data, on how they use their data. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And do you get why we have concern, some of us, about your pending acquisition of fit bit because it would just be more data to add to Google's trove of data and then that continues this big data problem with one company? </p><p>[*]HARRISON: I do understand that you have concerns. And like any acquisition that we do, that will be subject to regulatory review, is being subject to regulatory review both in the U.S. and in Europe. I want to be clear, that acquisition is not about data and--and we are willing to commit, and I'm--I'm committing today that we will never mix that data with our ads data in a way that will show ads towards--towards users of these things, that it is about, and I'm not sure you're wearing one, I think you are wearing one-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Yeah, I am wearing one-- </p><p>HARRISON: (--INAUDIBLE--)  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --You all now have the data if (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>HARRISON: Well, this deal is about devices. It is about healthcare and making sure that we are providing good health care and good decisions to the people that use these products and a lot about ads.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay.  </p><p>HARRISON: We--there are there are companies out there right now that are doing a very good job and Apple is one of them of--of developing innovative products in this space. We think people's expectations of how they interact with computers is changing and they will want watches and things to wear on their chest and glasses and--and that's what this deal is about. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. And I'll ask on the record so we can get moving with our witnesses some questions about dynamic allocation and the double click feature and how that may be unfair to other competitors and we can go over that later. All right, thank you. </p><p>HARRISON: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>LEE: Senator Blackburn. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Harrison, thank you for being here today. I want to know is there any single competitor to Google's online advertising business that offers services in every level of the ad stack? </p><p>HARRISON: There are competitors at each portion of the ad stack. </p><p>BLACKBURN: But there is no single competitor that is offering services at every level of the ad stack. </p><p>HARRISON: I think there are a few competitors that have tools that have both buy side and sell outside tools as well as the tools that allow for the provisioning of advertising. I don't want to say a name because I'm worried I'm going to get it wrong, but I will get back to you come back to you with examples of companies. </p><p>BLACKBURN: I think that that is important as we look at this issue because what you basically have built is a way that you are controlling the entry into that ad stack and--because you were dominating at every level in--in that. Let me ask you about this. In 2007, Google's general counsel David Drummond told the U.S. Senate in the context of the DoubleClick acquisition, no control over the advertising, no ownership of the data that comes with that is collected in the process of the advertising. The data is owned by the customers, publishers, and advertisers and DoubleClick or Google cannot do anything with it. </p><p>But in 2016, Google reversed course and merged users' browsing details with search history. Many stakeholders complained that Google treats consumer and pricing data as its own. Very subjective on this. Do you agree that the data collected by Google and your business DoubleClick is owned by the customers, publishers, and advertisers and is not owned by Google? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, I believe that we need to provide our users with control over their data, clear control over their data and consent and requires their--we require their consent when we want to make different uses of that data. In--in the case that you were talking about, we did make changes in 2016 about how DoubleClick data operated and Google data operated. We--we got the consent of all of our users to any changes that we made. And if users did not consent to that change then--  </p><p>BLACKBURN: --(INAUDIBLE) ask the question to you this way. When you are using a Google service online, who owns your virtual you? Is it the user or Google? </p><p>HARRISON: So users--users own their data and we do-- we do-- as we have instituted a whole bunch of tools to make sure that the choices they are making that that the uses are transparent to them and so they can control. You could go on to your Google account right now, assuming you're a Google user and delete your data. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay, let me ask this--let me ask you this, does Google collect and retain any of my data when I am using your service? Do you collect it and do you retain any user data and do you collect any of this from third party websites that I may go on and search a website through the Google search? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, it's a broad question, but to the extent that--that we collect data on a user, a signed in user, we make sure that that user knows exactly what we've collected, exactly how we use it, and gives them the control to--to change that use or to delete it if they want two. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. And let me ask you this. You know, you could look at your service and say welcome at you all have some conflicts of interest when it comes to Google's advertising technology services. And are you--how will your advertising technology services play by the same rules as other third party advertising technology services if you say you have these competitors within the ad stack? </p><p>HARRISON: So at each--at each part of that journey, right, across the ad tech stack from sell side to buy side, there are many different participants. I've listed of those participants, by large companies like AT&amp;T, Verizon, Amazon, small companies, although they are growing quickly like The Trade Desk, they all have a specific value proposition, they all have their own data that they bring together in order to define that value proposition and they all compete with each other to--to derive you to the best value for advertisers or the best value for publishers. </p><p>The rules are--are the rules, which our market rules are designed to make sure that people enter into agreements that make the most money for the website if you're a publisher or generate the most return on investment under advertisement if you're an advertiser. And the market is--is operating pretty effectively to make sure that both sides of that equation get value. </p><p>BLACKBURN: So it is working effectively for you and for Google, but I think that you all should be providing some assurance that, you know, with Chrome coming with their use that you're going to create a fair ecosystem and not preference the Google ads. And I think for many users, you have not been able to do that. But thank you for being with us today. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>LEE: Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thanks so much, chair--Chairman, and I really wanted to thank you and the ranking member for having this hearing. I think it's been extremely enlightening and I think your willingness to have this kind of a very frank exchange is very important. </p><p>You know, in a sense, all business, like all politics is local. Let me bring this down to a very local level. I was at the Long Wharf Theater just yesterday in New Haven, well known to many of us who have some connection to Yale in New Haven. When the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven wants to advertise in one of the local papers, let's say that New Haven Register or the Hartford Current, the Register cells and add on spaces other than Google.  </p><p>Let's say the theater it puts a maximum bid on Google ads for $10 and Google sells the ad spot for--to them for $9. Google might find that ad on its exchange for a lower price, let's say $4. Google then keeps the spread between those two auctions, the benefit doesn't go to the Long Warf and it doesn't go to the publishers of those newspapers. The UK competition and market authority found that Google is keeping the spread. Doesn't that strike you as an abuse of market power? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, first of all, I'm not aware of that--that finding of the CMA. Secondly, we have ever since we started, all of our ad products, we have been relentlessly focused on making sure, especially when we were trying to persuade advertisers to use a new product to make sure that they got a return on investment on what it is they were advertising. That--we know that over the long run in order to keep, you know, small businesses like what you're talking about interested in using our services, they have to see return on the investment that they make. And if they are overpaying for advertising, then--then perhaps a publisher wins in that moment, but that over the long haul, that--that that will actually do damage to both their faith--faith in the advertising systems as well as their faith in Google. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, there was a finding, and I apologize for interrupting, but I am limited in time and we have another panel of the--UK officials. </p><p>Let me go on to another area for what I think is a very great conflict of interest. Google competes with publishers to sell ad space, and an increasing portion of advertising revenue is being directed toward search, YouTube, and other Google properties. Given that Google operates the exchange and it competes with publishers on that exchange, that is a classic risk of insider trading. If you compare it, as Google has, to the stock market, Google would have been prosecuted long ago for insider trading. </p><p>Let me just ask you, Mr. Harrison, has Google ever use the data collected about publishers and their readers to develop products or steer advertising revenue toward its own properties? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, first--first of all, at a higher level, I--I don't--we don't--we're--we're--we were invested in ad tech for the reasons that I talked about earlier, where we're--where we're trying to increase the vibrancy and healthiness of that ecosystem. We think it's in our fundamental self-interest to make sure that the publisher ecosystem is successful not only because we have rev share, but that is a powerful incentive. </p><p>Rev share agreements mean that for every dollar that--the publisher makes, we make, you know, $0.10, $0.15, and that's a powerful reason for us to make sure that they are maximizing the value of their inventory. But not only because of that, because we think that if--if there are many news publishers, they will--people use Google to find news content, if there are many retailers, that people use Google to find--to find goods and services. </p><p>And so, to answer your specific question, it is sometimes complex to talk about data, and so I don't have a precise answer and I--and I am willing to follow up. I--I--the way you described it, that doesn't sound like we would use the data in order to somehow advantage the selling of search ads. I just--most search ads are--are directly connected to the context of the--of the search itself. You--you look at the query, you look at the words in the query, and then you look to match the ad with--with the language of what's being asked for. That--there's--that--that--that is--you know, I don't want to give a--that is a large amount of the formula by which we serve a search ads, and that would have nothing to do with the data that you're talking about. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Is it--is it your testimony to this committee that Google has never merged or used data collected about publishers and their readers for its own commercial benefit? </p><p>HARRISON: I--I'm sorry, Senator, the--it's such a broad question that I--I don't--I--I can't--I can't say yes or no to it. I--it--I could construe your question as saying-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --Well, that's precisely what is at issue here, that in fact you have use that data for the benefit of developing new products or steering advertising revenue toward your own properties. And I think that, again, goes to the heart of the kind of antitrust standards that have to be enforced here. </p><p>Has Google ever changed its products to steer investors or better direct them away from the open Web and toward its own content? </p><p>HARRISON: You know, Senator, to just quickly pick up your prior point, I--I meet with news publishers all the time as a regular part of my job, and I'm just not--I'm not aware of that--of that accusation. But I--again, I am willing and will follow up with you on it. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I appreciate that. </p><p>HARRISON: What--I'm sorry, repeat your second--the--the question you just made?  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Has Google ever change its products to better direct its visitors away from the open Web and toward its own content? </p><p>HARRISON: I think in--in--to answer your question, in--in 1999, 2001, we had a very simple product, which was 10 blue links. These were websites arranged in order of how our search of written believed that they should be presented in terms of relevancy to the person that was asking the question. </p><p>Over time, we've evolved this. We now--we now show a map if you're asking for where's--where is a gas station near me or where is a local restaurant. We--if you're asking a simple mathematical question, we might show a calculator. If you're asking a question about a--a location, again, we may show map. If you're asking a question about a restaurant, we may put that restaurant, we may put that restaurant in--in--in the context of an area around you. </p><p>These are improvements to search that we think--we think have made search better and more relevant. On mobile phones, it's--it's particularly important because--because you have very small real estate operated and our--and our search service has to make sure you get the right answer at the right time. These have increased, you know, the health and the--and innovativeness of our search engine. I don't--I know that people out there have complained that--is sometimes that--that diverse. We--we think it's--it's a better search experience and a natural search experience in order to--you know, as technology has developed and as people's expectations have changed. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you for that answer. My time is expired. I just want to say this is not a criticism of your products and it's not a criticism of your businesses. It is very, very grave doubts about how those businesses are put together and how the power that they give you is used to benefit the company rather than consumers and potentially stifle innovation. And I think it is classically the function of antitrust law to protect competition and consumers, which is what will be necessary in a court of law. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. Okay, we've got a second panel of witnesses that has waited patiently for quite a long time. So, I--I've got one more question for you, Mr. Harrison, and then I will, in the interest of time, choose to direct the remainder of my questions to you in writing and for the record. </p><p>So, before we go to our--our final panel, Mr. Harrison, in--in your written testimony, you make the point that prices for digital advertisements have dropped by 40 percent over the last 10 years. But isn't arguably the more important metric, the more relevant metric, a different one, one that focuses on how much advertisers have to spend to achieve the same number of sales? In other words, what good is it to say that advertisers are paying less money per ad if they have to buy more of those same ads for each conversion to a sale? </p><p>HARRISON: Senator, it's a--it's a good question. I--I think that--that if you look at the percentage of advertising in GDP, if you go back 20 years, it was almost 1.4 percent of GDP. Now it's--it's 1 percent of GDP. In aggregate, choice has improved. Advertisers are able to get their products to market and the--and advertises products easier and more cost-effective than--than they were in the past. </p><p>And so, I do think your--I do think you're asking the right question. I--I think that we've seen not only a fall in--in advertising ad tech fees, I think we've seen the fact that advertising as a cost to small and medium and large businesses in the U.S. has fallen in aggregate. </p><p>LEE: Okay. All right. Like I say, I've got a number of additional questions for you. If it's all right, I'll send those to you in writing so that we can move along to our next panel and hear from them. Thank you very much, Mr. Harrison. </p><p>HARRISON: Thank you. </p><p>LEE: Now, with regard to our second panel, you're already at the table. And so, if you'll stand and be sworn? Do you affirm that the testimony you're about to give to the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? </p><p>PANEL: (OFF-MIC)  </p><p>LEE: Thank you. Okay. Ordinarily, what we would do at this moment is I would give each of you a brief introduction. It ends up taking five or 10 minutes for me to complete those. Given that we may end up having a vote in another hour or so, we want to avoid leaving you all hanging if we--and we possibly can. </p><p>I'm going to, only in the interest of time and for your convenience, dispense with that introduction. And I--I assume that, in your opening remarks, you'll be able to tell us a little bit about yourself. And we know who you are, so we'll hand it over to you now. We'll--we'll go first to Mr. Heimlich and--and then move to our right for Mr. Dinielli and Mr. Szabo after that. Go ahead, Mr. Heimlich.     </p><p>HEIMLICH: (OFF-MIC)  </p><p>LEE: Push the red button, if you will. </p><p>HEIMLICH: How's that? All right. Right now there are Americans thinking about switching their mobile service provider or buying a used car, refinancing their mortgage, joining a virtual gym, or subscribing to an app. Businesses need to reach these people in order to pitch what they offer. </p><p>Traditionally, the only way to reach an audience and persuade them to buy your product involved wasting tons of money. You'd buy ads seen mostly by people who didn't care what you were selling. In digital, we aspire to not waste any money. Using powerful software and anonymous data, we try to limit advertising to the audience who cares about our ad's message. </p><p>[*]HEIMLICH: To find that conditions were being exposed to our ad makes a difference in what consumers decide to do. That has been my job for 20 years, using technology to make advertising more productive, relevant, and timely. When the toughest part of that job was convincing firms to reallocate budgets from traditional advertising like TV to digital Google was a great ally. But as digital advertising matured into distinct markets for search, display, and social Google changed. The company lagged behind the pace of innovation and display. Google was not a key player in the invention of ad exchanges, the most important development in digital since 2010. </p><p>The ability to be precisely effective in display depends on ad exchanges. Exchanges allow ad buyers and sellers to connect virtually and make the best deals for each of us without friction 1 million times per second. Display options occur as you load a webpage. It is because of exchange transactions that in a creator can mobile--monetized the attention he earns and any business can maximize the impact of its ad dollars. The ad exchange ecosystem thrived as long as its participants were mutually interested in a level playing field. We agreed it's best to interoperate with competitors on fair and equal terms so that customers can mix and match products that will and the best ideas win. The display exchange ecosystem is nicknamed the open web because it's a free market. </p><p>A company has to be very confident to operate in this mode. It's like owning a stall in a vast open-air flea market. Customers can easily compare your features, quality, and price with those of other sellers that in easy reach. Though it wasn't clear at the time anti-trust investigators investigations have produced clues of Google's strategy for ad exchanges. It seems Google saw the market efficiency of exchanges as a threat to Google's primary business, selling ads. The ad exchanges were set up to be agnostic brokers like stock exchanges. The 2010 internal Google email called the say disintermediation risk. </p><p>Google's concern was that unless they were in the middle of transactions then fewer dollars would end up in Google's hands. Google's plan was to combine products so that what appears to be an agnostic exchange can resolve any conflicts of interest in Google's favor. Google plan to make it exchange like a shady stockbroker who steals every client to the assets is employer pays him to sell. It would use its market power in several nodes of the ecosystem to discourage comparison-shopping against best in class solutions. For example, a great new bitter is less enticing if your current bidder is tied to your ad server which has almost no competition. </p><p>Display innovation abounded in the period 2010 to 2016 expanding on the theme of privacy compliant interoperable exchange transactions. Google never caught up. Instead it leveraged its market power to slow the pace of innovation and display and make exchange buying less attractive to advertisers. Google did this by tying its products in a web extensive enough to entangle the entire marketplace. In 2016 Google combined search and display data breaking a promise made to American regulators. Google also broke the industry's privacy standard by linking consumers names from Gmail to the ID numbers assigned to browsers for what had been anonymous exchange transactions. Continuously from 2016 Google came up with new ways to pollute the exchange ecosystem they had previously seemed to embrace. Pollution came in the form of restrictions and exclusions that made the open web less efficient for buyers and sellers. </p><p>Google tighten ties among its products until the shady broker was no longer one among a set of competitors. </p><p>Google became the only display company not hobbled by the exclusions and restrictions it had placed on everyone else. The power to interoperate among buy side, sell side and measurement software went from being a feature of the exchange ecosystem to a capability exclusive to Google. Now progress on innovation is squeezed to the margins of the industry and new ad tech is rare. There is more at stake than most people realize. The more efficient the ad market the more likely it is that superior new products will find customers and thrive. When the ad exchanges function properly the size advantage from flooding the airwaves is offset by quieter voices speaking directly to whoever is most open to any given improvement. This tilts the incentives of every business towards innovation. </p><p>Google is dominating display by breaking interoperability and subtracting the efficiencies of asymmetrical market. Pre-2016 under intense competitive pressure ad exchanges were becoming more transparent and privacy respectful as the ecosystem group. Google could have coped with these developments without using its market power destructively. There is nothing to stop Google from exiting the arena or competing within its open standards. Whether or not Google competes with other big tech firms is irrelevant to the harms they have caused publishers, measurement companies, platforms, and small businesses like mine in the $50 billion open web display market. </p><p>It was efficient when publishers platforms, measurement tools, and service providers interoperate in. Innovators of a great new product or service could access a global marketplace of thousands of buyers and sellers quickly at low cost. Small businesses with great ideas had a short ramp to success. Now funding for ad tech startups has been drying up and the pace of innovation slowed down. The number one concern I hear from potential investors is Google's domination of the market my company operates. For years they have been breaking existing efficiencies and preventing the development of new ones. Many expect Google to mislead regulars--regulators about its conduct in the open web. I'm grateful for the opportunity to help scrutinize their claims. For the sake of competition and the benefit it brings Google should be forced to either accept the ad exchange market or compete within its open standards. Thanks. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Dinielli? </p><p>DINIELLI: Thank you Chairman Lee and Ranking Member Klobuchar and the other members of the subcommittee for conducting this hearing today. My name is David Dinielli and I'm testifying on behalf of Omidyar Network which is a social change venture dedicated to ensuring the technology companies contribute to society and an economy that is fair, equitable, safe, and conducive to a thriving democracy. </p><p>Specifically, I am here today to explain why it appears likely that Google has violated current U.S. antitrust law by monopolizing the market for digital display advertising. I am not a technologist nor am I an economist. I am a litigator who began representing clients antitrust disputes and investigations over 25 years ago. I have represented antitrust plaintiffs and I have represented antitrust defendants. My expertise to the extent I have any is in determining whether private actors have violated the United States antitrust laws. I have no ideological or financial skin in this particular game. </p><p>This is what we know about this market, millions, and millions of times each day someone in America opens a webpage on their mobile phone or their laptop and when they do that portions of those pages are populated with digital advertising and advertising of this sort is a very big business. Some estimates are that in the United States $139 billion was spent in this market in 2019. That's a lot of money. Moreover as we have heard today this business has profound effects for publishers, advertisers and for consumers. For example online advertising is the lifeblood for many websites and other publishers. </p><p>As just one example that already has been discussed today we all know that newspaper circulation has fallen as more and more people get their news online. Outlets in each of your districts some of which have been mentioned today whether it be the (INAUDIBLE) news in Salt Lake City, the Star Tribune in Minneapolis, the Hartford Courant or the Williamson Herald in Williamson County, Tennessee which bills itself as the so-called voice of the greatest county in America. All of these outlets depend on digital advertising to support their critical newsgathering and their local reporting. </p><p>Additionally, small businesses across the country rely on digital advertising to grow and thrive. Healthcare providers, car dealerships, moving companies, restaurants and we expect that this need will only increase during the economic recovery from the pandemic. Online advertising also can be good for consumers. When done right it provides relevant information to people who might find utility and products and services being advertised and it reduces their search cost. </p><p>In short, online advertising is critical to our economy and to our democracy and as I indicated in my written testimony I recently co-authored a series of papers for the Yale economist about the two large digital platforms that are supported by online advertising, Google, and Facebook. We relied on information made public by the UK CMA which also has, today. But we looked at this data through the lens of current U.S. antitrust law and our analysis led us to conclude that there's a strong basis to believe that Google has illegally monopolized and/or maintained a monopoly in the market for digital advertising. </p><p>Specifically, we concluded that Google developed a dominant search engine and then use that position to expand into what is called the ad tech back, the various technological functions that match web publishers with advertisers through real-time bidding. </p><p>[*]DINIELLI: Through a series of acquisitions and vertical integration, Google occupies every layer of this ad tech stack with market shares as high as 90 percent at the most important functions. From the--from the standpoint of an antitrust lawyer, this is a big red flag. I am aware of no other market in which a single firm represents buyers and sellers and determines who buys what and at what price. </p><p>Moreover, Google appears to have undertaken a series of efforts to use its market position and vast data advantages to exclude competitors. The end result is that if you are an advertiser or if you are a publisher, all roads lead to Google. We describe 20 different instances of anticompetitive conduct in our paper, including Google's 2015 decision to make its YouTube inventory available to advertisers exclusively through its own tech tools. We've talked about that today. </p><p>In our paper, we also describe less obvious examples of anticompetitive contact such as unfair auction design, denial of interoperability and pricing arbitrage. We have heard Google today assert that the digital advertising market is thriving, that there are many place-- players, that the prices have gone down, and it is even cited increased innovation. </p><p>Let me just preview my response to those arguments by saying this, these are precisely the sorts of arguments that nearly every antitrust defendant trots out whenever it is accused of any sort of wrongdoing. There is nothing new here. For example, Google says that get faces vigorous competition because advertisers also can place digital ads on other platforms and has even named Facebook and Amazon. But that's like a company that holds a monopoly in billboards defending itself by saying that advertisers could also buy magazine inserts instead. It's simply not a defense. </p><p>Google also says that digital advertising prices have gone down and that output has increased. But as an antitrust lawyer, I'm concerned with what the world would look like if Google had not monopolized this market and not excluded its competitors. This is what we call the but for world. The questions are how much blower would prices have fallen, what innovations might Google or others have deployed if Google had faced real competition at the various layers of the ad tag stack? What service improvements such as privacy protections would that but for market offer? Would local news outlets be getting a bigger piece of the pie? </p><p>We don't know exactly what this market would look like but for Google's apparent monopolization. But my hope is that the remainder of this hearing will be an exploration of how we might get to that world through a combination of antitrust enforcement, legislative fixes, and regulation. I'm happy to answer questions about this path forward and I thank you. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Szabo. </p><p>SZABO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Klobuchar, members of the committee. My name is Carl Szabo. I am vice president and general counsel of NetChoice. I'm also an adjunct professor of Internet law at George Mason Antonin Scalia Law School. Now, I am very excited to be here because I really appreciate, as a law professor, especially what the Judiciary Committee does and work, you know, working in this area, I'm very excited because Mr. Chairman, you started by talking about the importance of the consumer welfare standard that we have here in the United States. </p><p>Now, we didn't achieve and come to the consumer welfare standard for antitrust law at the outset. It took us awhile. We had failures. We tried other systems and we found that the consumer welfare standard is the best one. In fact, antitrust experts from across the political spectrum recognize consumer welfare standards is the best standard for the world. </p><p>And why is that? Well, that's because it's an objective standard. We base it on economic economics. We base it on facts. We don't base it on feelings, opinions, or innuendo. </p><p>At home, I play board games all the time with my son and somehow the rules always change in the middle of the game and they always change in a way that benefits my son. We call that the Aiden (SP) Rule. Here we see efforts. We see it in Europe, we see it from anti tech advocates to do the Aiden Rule. They want to change antitrust law away from the clear objective standard that we have today to a subjective I know it when I see it standard. </p><p>So why is that bad? Well, you're singing a sledgehammer of antitrust law to the benefit of corporate competitors or populist policies. Now, let's use an example. If we open up antitrust law away from the consumer welfare standard too and I know it when I see it, it's essentially weaponization of antitrust for political purposes. Today, half the dais probably is angry at Google because it moderates too much, half the dais is probably angry at Google because it doesn't moderate enough. </p><p>But fortunately, we have an objective antitrust standard that does not allow political policies to interrupt the free flow of enterprise. Now, so what is the consumer welfare standard because we've talked about antitrust a lot, but we haven't really established what the three factors are that must be proven. </p><p>One, market power, two, abuse of that market power, and three, consumer harm. Now if you look at what happened just a month ago over at the House Judiciary Committee, there was no real showing of market power. It was just stated you are dominant, therefore, you are dominant. And likewise, there wasn't even an effort to show consumer harm because at the end of the day, there really isn't. </p><p>So let's look at what is market power. Well, it all comes down to how you define the market. Now, we've talked a lot about the UK CMA report. I think even the CMA, if you really ask them would recognize it's a wildly flawed report. It uses the phrase might over 100 times. It is based on data that they used only in the UK and one of the things they did was they narrowed the definition of market so small that it produced the outcome that they sought, dominance of Google. </p><p>So what is the market then? Well, the market actually is all advertising because you have to look at it in the consumer welfare standard in the eyes of the consumer. What are they doing? They are using their time differently. So let's look back at this past Sunday. Football is on. You see commercials. You're watching the game on your TV. You're following it at ESPN.com. You might even be listening to it on the radio because you like their commentating better. </p><p>At that same time, advertisers simultaneously competing across three different advertising platforms. So it's hard to narrow the market all the way down to Google in a scenario like that. Second, even if we were to narrow it down to just digital ads, let's look at total revenue. If we look at total revenue in digital ads, Google is a third, Facebook is a quarter, and Amazon is 10 percent who is actually taking market share away from Google. None of them come anywhere near the Supreme Court required 75 percent market power. </p><p>Let's look at consumer harm. We are talking about democratization of ads. To us consumers, we get amazing free services, so we benefit. To advertisers, advertising prices had plummeted. They are down 40 percent. That's an indisputable fact. Could they be lower? Maybe. Are they lower than they otherwise would have been? Yes. </p><p>Let's look at publishers now. Publishers who otherwise couldn't sell unused ad space can now easily sell it away and they do this on a multitude of platforms. Now, one of the real misconceptions we've heard here today is that Google is the Alpha and Omega of the supply and demand side of the equation. So we talked about the difficulties being seen at the Star Tribune and the Courant. </p><p>The Star Tribune does use Google for advertising, but it also uses at least half a dozen other platforms simultaneously. These include companies like Rubicon, PubMatic, AppNexus, and Verizon media. Let's look at the Current. Same scenario. They use Google, but they also used another half dozen different advertising platforms, including PubMatic, Rubicon, and Tabla (SP).  </p><p>The New York Times and Washington Post are so effective that they've actually abandoned third party advertising systems altogether and have returned to in house ads. So it's hard to see how publishers are beholden to Google and how Google has this market power when these advertisers are using multiple platforms, when the publishers are using simultaneously multiple platforms. </p><p>So since there is no market power when you actually look at the real market, which is digital ads, since there is clearly no consumer harm, then we have to ask ourselves what are we trying to accomplish? Are we trying to just convict somebody because they're big and successful or are we trying to apply the consumer welfare standard which represents putting consumers first, not corporations, which has been recognized as the best standard we have for antitrust law and is the standard that should be used, which it shows that frankly, there's not a case against Google? Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, and we welcome your questions. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. Thanks so much. Appreciate your opening remarks and we will now begin our seven minute rounds alternating between members of each partner. Mr. Szabo, I'll start with you. </p><p>[*]LEE: In your written testimony, you seem to suggest that Google has not violated antitrust laws because customers have benefited from its products and its--and its services, but that's not--not really what the consumer welfare standard means, is it? I mean, a consumer welfare standard as part of the analysis performed by enforcers of our antitrust laws and under the rule of reason, which really involves a balancing test that weighs the harm from exclusionary conduct against any pro-competitive benefits of the same conduct. Is that accurate so far? You're not disagreeing with me so far? </p><p>So, it--this means that when--when assessing those harms and those benefits, we look at the--the aggregate impact of those harms and those benefits on customers, on consumers and--and not social justice goals or political projects or arbitrary measurements of size or of concentration. So, it's easy to make the statement generally that--that Google has benefited consumers, but are all of those benefits a direct result of the--of their alleged tying conduct, and do they outweigh the harm from the conduct? </p><p>SZABO: So, Mr. Chairman, I--I don't think that there is a tying situation here. So, one of the things that I don't think is fully appreciated, and something that I didn't, you know, appreciate my first got into this whole area, is that when you use one side of the Google ad stack, you can just use that one side. You don't have to use the entire set. </p><p>So, a similar analogy would be like buying a home. I can find some--I can find a realtor to help the buy a home. I can use a realtor to sell my home. But I don't use the same person on both sides of the equation. The Google ad the stack operates similarly, where you can use one end of the ad stack and not be tied into using the other side of the equation. </p><p>LEE: So, even if--even if you--if you side with Google in--in that analysis, you do agree that--don't you, that applying the consumer welfare standard doesn't give you a freebie card. I mean, it doesn't give a--a freebie card to Google. That's not the end of the analysis, right? </p><p>SZABO: The way the analysis is structured is the--the job is on the prosecution to show consumer harm. Now, the facts laid out show that ad prices have decreased substantially. You can show that publishers are generating revenue that they otherwise wouldn't. And then finally, you can show that you and me and other consumers get free products. Also, we need to identify a cognizable consumer harm, which I don't think has yet been espoused in actual raw data. </p><p>LEE: Okay. So--but if--if Google has monopoly power in a well-defined market, and if it is engaged in tying one product to another product and it's done so with the intent--or with the effect, rather, of maintaining its monopoly in that market to the detriment of consumers, that is a violation of Section 2 of the--of the Sherman Act, correct? </p><p>SZABO: Yes. If Google did all those three things, that would satisfy each element of antitrust law. </p><p>LEE: So, I--you know, I--it--it's not about tying the two sides to the platform, the--tying the two sides of the platform. It's--it's tying the first party ads and--and the third party ads for advertisers. And the harm would then be a--a--a higher-quality adjusted price for the consumers and for the advertisers. Is that--do you disagree with me on that? </p><p>SZABO: Once again, we need to show that there has been an actual loss of revenue for each of them. So, one of the things that's been shown is--and this came out of the CMA report, Google's ad percentage is--is about 30 percent. And what that actually is is it's below some of their other competitors. Now, if they were monopoly, then they could actually price above competitors, and that's not what we're seeing in the market itself. So, the--the statement of these prices are higher for consumers isn't really being borne by the facts that we're seeing on the ground. </p><p>LEE: But--okay, so we're not necessarily looking at a loss of revenue, but couldn't--couldn't they be worse off compared to the but-for world? Couldn't--couldn't they be worse off in other ways, not necessarily resulting in a loss of revenue? </p><p>SZABO: So, but for Google being there, you would see potentially higher prices on different platforms. Now, one of the--one of the things that I think as not been made clear is advertisers do not use just one platform to advertise. They use simultaneous--four to six is usually the number I think that came out of the UK simultaneous ad platforms. What they're doing is they're competing against each other in real time. </p><p>So, what that means is if Google is not getting the best bid, then the advertisement will go to a different ad platform to be placed. So, you have competition amongst those ad platforms within the advertising side of the equation. </p><p>LEE: Has pricing by competitors been skewed by Google's tying?  </p><p>SZABO: I think it has been skewed. It's been skewed down because they're creating a quality product, which is forcing competitors to compete on price. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Dinielli, what's your response to this? And how do you see this analysis shaking out? Have--do--do you agree that the consumer welfare standard is the right tool here? </p><p>DINIELLI: Thank you, Senator. It--it's an adequate tool to bring an enforcement action in this case. The CMA recognized a number of arms to consumers that are cognizable as consumer harm in the United States. Let me list of some of them. </p><p>Assuming that the analysis is correct, that Google is acting as a monopolist in the digital advertising market, that means that it can raise its prices above the competitive level to the advertisers and pay a lower price to the publishers. We have heard that prices went down and isn't that a good thing. Yes, it is, but we don't know what they would have been absent that conduct. </p><p>Assuming that the prices to both sides are worse than they would have been, then we can deduce and observe consumer harm. For example, if advertisers are paying higher than competitive prices, then economic theory and U.S. law would allow us to presume that they're passing at least some of that down to their customers in the form of higher prices for their products and their services. If publishers are receiving a lower amount of the advertising spend then they would in a competitive market, then both U.S. law and economic theory presume that they will invest less in their content creation, yielding a lower quality of, for example, local news reporting to consumers. </p><p>Finally, because Google can control what ads are served at what frequency and where, Google has the ability, for example, to over saturate websites with irrelevant or bad ads. We've heard that we have free access to websites. That's true. But if our quality adjusted price is higher because we're getting too many are bad ads, that too is cognizable consumer harm under U.S. law. </p><p>LEE: Okay. I'm out of time for this round. We're going to go to Senator Klobuchar next. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this panel, but I was thinking of my daughter's words. I have a lot. That's what she said. Mom, that's a lot.  </p><p>But I have to--I just can't let it go, Mr. Szabo, without starting with your argument that this should all go down to the consumer welfare standard. And I think Mr. Dinielli may have some comments on that, because when you really look at what's going on with antitrust law as a whole, you have a situation where incredibly conservative courts have interpreted the laws in certain way really based on the consumer welfare standard that, by the way, as you've said is applied all over the world, yet as far as Google in other countries that use a consumer welfare standard, they have decided that they should investigate and should do something about it using the terms consumer welfare standard. So, let's put that aside. </p><p>But if we just in the antitrust area say everything is fine, when I was looking at this, experts looked at a 15 year period ending about 10 years ago, and found that plaintiffs were zero of 16 in bringing antitrust cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court under the conservative Bork interpretation of what consumer welfare means. And I just want to remind all of us, and Senator Lee and I probably disagree about this, but when Bork talked about consumer welfare, he expressed the view that the only legitimate goal of American antitrust is the maximization of consumer welfare. That sounds great. </p><p>But in fact, he defined it as minimizing restrictions of output and permitting efficiency, however gained, to have its way. </p><p>[*]KLOBUCHAR: He equated consumer welfare not with welfare for actual living, breathing, consumers but with pure efficiency and quote the maximization of wealth and so I just want to make it clear why look at how these cases have come down and then the views that Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh have brought to the court more and more decisions are being made to not bring antitrust cases and that is the very reason that I believe yes, we should up our enforcement and that is part of the work that Senator Grassley and I are doing and others on this committee to add resources to the FTC and to the Justice Department or we are never going to be able to take on the issues of our time. </p><p>And yes, we should do our best to use the laws we have but I am sorry, when you look at the changing economy and what is happening throughout history the Sherman Act was not a static act, they added the Clayton Act, they added multiple bills over time to try to get at what was happening and so I think relying on the courts right now when you look at every decision from (INAUDIBLE) to Bell Atlantic to Illinois Brick you can't say that this is going to be taken care of. Google and the Facebook issues are just going to be taken care of by this consumer welfare standard given how the courts are interpreting it and I guess I will give you a second to respond because I really want to get to my Google questions. </p><p>SZABO: Yes, thank you Senator. I am clearly going to disagree with you because I do agree the consumer welfare standard is the best approach. Now the fact that it's been 12-0 at the supreme court is not indicative of a failed standard. It is potentially indicative of a flawed prosecution or in the most case it is usually civil suits like Twombly is a good example of that. </p><p>Now one of the things that it has done is it has given America the bedrock of some of the greatest innovations in the world. Now the U.S. is somewhat unique with its consumer welfare standard. Europe does have a different standard of a I know it when I see it. I would also note that Europe is fundamentally different. I would not say Europe is terribly innovated especially in the tech space. In fact their main innovation would be what, Spotify? </p><p>Second, Europe has a fundamentally different civil suit functionality where they operate under the English rule, the English role unlike in the United States is a loser pays model and that helps to eliminate frivolous lawsuits that waste time, court time, taxpayer dollars and defendants money so if we were to even consider heading down in the European model and away from the consumer welfare standard we must be ready to take on the decrease in innovation and the basically-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Do you think there was a decrease in innovation when we broke up AT&amp;T? </p><p>SZABO: So AT&amp;T I don't think is a spot on example and the reason I say that is AT&amp;T was essentially a government created monopoly to begin with. They actually allowed a lot of the local telcos to consolidate and they actually approve them because they were the main ones. So I don't think AT&amp;T is actually a good example of breakup and subsequent innovation. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Mr. Dinielli, do you want to respond and also do you think legislation like the bill that I have to update the antitrust laws would help enforcers address a type of exclusionary conduct that we are referring to here today in the hearing? </p><p>DINIELLI: Thank you, Senator. I--I do agree that this new economy in which we live requires a multitude of tools. It requires enhanced enforcement, it requires some legislative changes including some of those that you your self have authored and proposed. I also think that this new economy could require new regulatory powers either to existing or two new regulators. On the point of consumer welfare I agree with the senator that this is a standard that sometimes has not served us well. My point was simply to say that should not stop the prosecution of Google which so obviously - might. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Agree. </p><p>DINIELLI: --is a monopolist. With respect to the breakup of AT&amp;T for example I would agree that that did lead to innovation but that came about in the context of regulation in which the telephone companies were for example required to interoperate. That is the kind of thing that might be able to help solve the problems in this market as well. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Very good point. Mr. Heimlich, thank you for testifying. I found this really interesting, your perspective and I was thinking as I listened to you I wondered what questions you would have asked Mr. Harrison if you were sitting up here because I know it must be frustrating to be in your position and hear senators asking a ton of questions as good as we are. Yeah, we are. But without maybe having the kind of experience that you have. So could you talk a little bit about that and what other things you think we need to get at and what your reactions were and what your comebacks would have been to Mr. Harrison statements about how prices are going down and everything is good and they don't really have market dominance because they are using other places to advertise as we just heard? What is your reaction to all of that? </p><p>HEIMLICH: Thank you, Senator, and thank you for having me. So they one that really jumps out at me is that kind of got glossed over is Mr. Harrison said that header bidding was good for publishers. He just kind of threw that away, header bidding was good for publishers and you know it's really hard to get your hand on the butt for world but that are butting was an example, right? It was a hack thrown together by a few Google competitors to break the dominance of Google's cell side platform, right? Specifically publishers wanted all of the demand sources to compete directly in a unified option and Google refused to deliver that, right? </p><p>So header bidding was a hack that just put all of the bids in the headers and they could compete directly and what happened two things happened, publishers made 20 percent or 30 percent more money, right, as he said header bidding was good for publishers but me on the buy side I didn't see it. Right? So what that tells you is that money was going somewhere else. It was either in the middle or we experienced it as a quality increase that it stopped cream skimming when these headers went--went into place, right? So I think that's--that's--I would love for everyone to date again on that rare example of the but for world and header bidding was not a full-blown solution, right? If Amazon who was involved in header bidding or at Nexis we are able to really develop a product instead of just a little JavaScript tag that created those headers I think it would have been much more powerful. That's a very rare example of Google failing to dominate and the effect was very dramatic. </p><p>On the definition of the industry I'm not a lawyer but I think it might be helpful for the lawyers to understand that programmatic advertising has its own teams, its own budgets, its own ad formats. People's titles are programmatic, right? There isn't--there isn't money moving from social and billboards and TV into programmatic willy-nilly. There's a programmatic budget, a programmatic team, a programmatic production of programmatic ads and programmatic tech commitments, right? Our $50 billion market is not to be glossed over as some footnote in advertising. It's as far will claiming to understand the legal definition it is a market and go dominates when you see those nine percentages and the percentages that is my experience of what it is operate in that market. </p><p>Now prices going down. The biggest reason prices go down is because will advertising is cheaper and mobile advertising has become a much, much bigger share so if you don't normalize for the--for the growth of mobile prices going down is meaningless but there's also what came up is the quality difference, right? If quality is going down and prices are going down then that's not good at all, right? So I believe economists have shown that cream skimming causes all--all prices to go down. Right, so my experience as a buyer is if you experience that your quality is going down you don't know anyone is cream skimming but you know I use to pay four dollars for this and now it's not worth four dollars anymore I'm going to bid down to three dollars, right? And I think Mr. Szabo made a statement that said Google stock forced competitors to compete on price. </p><p>So what I hear when he says that is Google was gaming options, winning with lower prices which forced everyone to bid down and then they claim it as a wind that all the prices are down and that is why Senator Blumenthal is so upset about his local paper being unable to make any money. Right? Google can cream skin and get that advantage because they are using this huge wealth of third-party data coming from places that have nothing to do with ad Tech and their control of that auction process again refusing to hold a fair meta-option among supply. It is skimmed cream. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And so what do you think would be the best way to fix it? </p><p>HEIMLICH: When--when I--when I read about U.S. versus Microsoft and about how forced interoperability was part of that I said here's a clear precedent. Google had these private API--I mean Microsoft had private API into Windows then they had to open those up so that in the body who wanted to build an application for Windows could and to me that's a clear precedent for what should--would work. I don't think Google would acquiesce to that I think ultimately the solution should be that they exit this marketplace and be like companies who run complete (INAUDIBLE) and let the arm open marketplace compete with them. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Mr. Dinielli, do you want to add to that? </p><p>[*]DINIELLI: I would go back to the point of interoperability, senator. Another option would be data markets. Right now, Google is using the threat of privacy litigation and the actuality of privacy regulation in Europe as an excuse to claim that there's no way that it could open itself up so that others could learn from the data that it gathers from its various consumer facing products. It hoards that data for itself. </p><p>There were questions from Mr. Harrison about the amount of data and the kind of data, for example, that advertisers can access about where their money goes and what happens to their ads. In actuality, what Google recently has done has created something called the Google ads hub. And what it does is it allows you basically to go into a clean room and look at data that Google has about you and your advertising campaigns, but you can't take it out, nor could a competitor gain access to that. In a true functioning market, there could be requirements the data being sold on fair conditions and prices to competitors to allow them to come in, use some of that data which Google has said belongs to the users, not to Google and then use that data for the benefit of the market.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Very good. Senator Lee. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Heim--Heimlich, let's turn into you now. In his testimony, Mr. Harrison said that Google's ad tech is interoperable with its competitors technology. Is that your experience? </p><p>HEIMLICH: Well, there are many cases where it's not. There are some cases where it is, but many, many cases where it's not. And they've been extensively documented. So it's--it's frustrating that Google keeps saying that when there's so much documentation of the cases where they refuse to interoperate. </p><p>I could talk about some of the ones that have been talked about at least. I think that buy side add server lack of interoperability's is the most nefarious that hasn't really been publicized. The buy side ad servers like a referee in the competition of buying, right? The buy side ad server is a hub and all the other buying platforms are spokes and the buy side ad server points to the spoke that produced every sale, right? </p><p>Adams DSP did that one, AppLexus drove that one. So Google is that referee, but there are also a competitor. And this is one of the markets where they have 90 percent share, right? So they have at 90 percent share. I can't really get another ad server. No one--no one can compete. It's the only ad server that integrates with search in YouTube and there's a bunch of other reasons it's very hard to switch ad servers. </p><p>So even if I'm going to use Google's ad server and I say I just don't want you to do that referee thing, I don't trust you to be the attribution vendor, right? You used to be able to just download all the ad interaction data out of there and send it to all your partners. You could say you guys go through all this ad interaction data so you can see how Google's refereeing and make sure you get as much credit as you can, right? </p><p>As of 2018, you can't even do that. Now, me as an advertiser, that's my data, right? I licensed Google's ad server to be the hub, it keeps data on every ad interaction. Not only do I want to be able to--not only do I want to be able to download it, I want an API out of that. It's going to all the DSPs so everyone can see all the ad interactions and nobody has a gaming advantage in this competition for who gets credit, right? </p><p>So the ad server market, this measurement market, that's a market that doesn't even come up when we talk about advertising markets. It's significant, right? It's--it's determinant of who else gets money, and who is perceived as being able to perform and when. So Google massively dominates it and they control it in a way that could be easily solved by interoperability. Other ad servers have APIs where all the interaction data can go wherever you want and that that would solve the problem. </p><p>LEE: You know, I--I hear that Google has proposed blocking third party tracking in its Chrome browser and that this could be the equivalent to rules already in effect for Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox browsers. What--can you tell me about what you know about this and how it might affect digital ads and whether you think this is equivalent? </p><p>HEIMLICH: Yes. Thank you, senator. That's a great question. The answer is no, it's not the same. It's an--it's an example of how Google is weaponizing privacy regulations. They are supposed to protect consumers.  </p><p>So our privacy laws say that if you're doing business with a company, they can--they can use your data for advertising. That's why your bank is always sending you credit card offers and offers for loans. If you don't like it, you cannot work with that bank, but you can't opt out of that. Our laws say you gave them the data, now they can use it. Another bank, you can opt out.  </p><p>What the laws can handle what the laws can handle is someone like Google using the data you gave them to do business with them in a completely different context, right? You give data to Google so you can use search and then they were using it too cream skin of the Hartford Courant, right? So the way that other browsers have handled this problem of cream skimming by Google is they say we're--no one can track, right? Google can't track, competitors can't track, it's going to be a level playing field in Safari, label level playing field in Firefox, none of this nonsense where you're bringing this data you collected God knows where to interactions in our browser.  </p><p>So and Google is talking about doing that in Chrome, they're going to maintain the ability to attract. They're going to block other people's cookies, but there's still a Chrome login, there's probably still a Maps login, if you're on an Android phone, there's Android login, and the privacy policies make it clear that they've merged all this data into super profiles and there's no meaningful barrier to them using all that data to have what would amount to a massive, massive advantage on auctions in the Chrome browser. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Szabo, do you want to answer that one as well? </p><p>SZABO: Yes. So one of the things that was mentioned earlier by Senator Klobuchar is actually the increased concern about privacy. Now, Chrome is a browser that competes heavily with Safari, with Mozilla, which was named, Brave is a new one that has entered the marketplace and what does Safari, Mozilla, and Brave feature? They feature privacy. </p><p>So Google in suit, because it's a competitive environment on Chrome has enabled privacy as a core feature of its browser. Now, that's being turned into an antitrust action because kind of like hammer, everything looks like a nail and every action to somebody who doesn't like Google is clearly an antitrust violation. That's not what's happening here with Chrome. </p><p>Second is why does it track you? Well, because that way you can better optimize my results and that's something I can opt out of and deactivate and go incognito. But why did Chrome make this move? Because of robust competition in the web browser space and because its competitors are fighting on privacy.  </p><p>Now, it sounds like that's something we want to encourage platforms to do. Google is doing it, but now it's being used by people who don't like it as a sign of anticompetitive behavior. So that's a real kind of vice that these platforms and businesses are being put in. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Heimlich, can you tell us what that market looks like for ad agencies working on behalf of advertisers? Are they free to use any software the day choose? </p><p>HEIMLICH: Yeah, this refers to Mr. Hawley's question on commitments, which I'm really happy to be able to address. Thank you, senator. My job at a large agency was choosing the buy side platforms and I had a deep partnership with one called The Trade Desk. I had a colleague at another big agency, I had a deep partnership with AppNexus and others in the industry. And we all had the same experience involving the agencies YouTube commitments. </p><p>Now, as Mr. Szabo said, there's nothing unusual about a commitment where you've got a low upfront rate for buying a certain amount of YouTube, right? In my agencies case, it was something like a billion dollars. And by you buy a billion dollars of YouTube, you get $10 up YouTube up front right and that's really important for the agencies competition against other agencies because big advertisers will ask what's your YouTube rate, just like they ask what's your NBC rate, right? So they understand it as part of your negotiating power. </p><p>Two weird things about these deals though. You could meet your commitment for a billion dollars by also moving money through DV360. That's weird. That's usually not that I'd like that. And the other weird thing is that that deals increased 100 percent a year. So a billion, $2 billion, $4 billion, $8 go again we're supposed to spend in YouTube. So it's like being force fed. You can't buy that much YouTube.  </p><p>So what happened to me and my colleagues at the other agencies is that CEO called us and said you need to put some money in DV360 immediately. Just to take it out of Trade Desk. I don't even care what Trade Desk is. Take it out of AppNexus. I don't care what you sold our clients. You need to move this money into DV360 because our Google Rep just called me and said they were going to claw back out YouTube rate from $10 to $12 and we're going to owe them $900 million if you don't move this money over now. </p><p>And my response would be like that this is a huge problem for me, right? I sold my clients into what I told him was the best platform for them. How am I supposed to just tell them now we're going to use DV360, which I told them convincingly as everyone knew, this is an inferior DSP.  </p><p>So what did Google do? In 2015, they just cut YouTube out of everywhere else. Now I had no choice. Now if I wanted to buy YouTube programmatically, I had to use DV360. So in a way, it was a favor to me that it gave me cover for doing what I never should have done, but that was dashed that was how it DV360 got a foothold in the big agencies. By the time I left in 2018, that agency, DV360 was the primary DSP on my trading desk. </p><p>[*]HEIMLICH: It had the most spend. And I had tried not to work with them at all. </p><p>LEE: How about publishers? Does it have a similar effect on publishers? </p><p>HEIMLICH: The stickiness for publishers is--is exclusive demand. So, publishers care about two things, their--their prices they could get, right, their CPMs, and their volume. So--and Mr. Szabo talked about them getting more--adding more and more platforms and more and more platforms. They're trying to get both of those. They're trying to get platforms that have higher CPMs and they're trying to raise the volume. </p><p>Any publisher will tell you that Google as a huge funnel of low-cost, high-volume bids coming in, right? They're coming in through Google's search platform, which also let you buy display. So, it's long tail, unsophisticated advertisers who don't know so much what they're doing in display, right? It's a huge pipe of--of volume. And if you get rid of Google's exchange, you lose all that volume. </p><p>So, publishers are stuck with Google's exchange and Google's sell side set--stack even though, and they hate this, Google mysteriously wins a huge amount of options with low bids. So, when Mr. Szabo talks about other--adding more and more demand side platforms and why they're doing header bidding and why Google was forced to innovate what they call open bidding, publishers are trying to solve this problem of this waterfall of Google demand winning tons of auctions with low bids. </p><p>LEE: When you say mysteriously, tell me what you mean by that. </p><p>HEIMLICH: Well, it's supposed to be that the highest price wins, right? So, it--as--as--incrementally, Google has been claiming we're making the auction more and more fair, right? They used to have last look. They bid last. So, that's a--that's an easy way to cheat. If you bid last, you can--you can with a lot of options at low cost. </p><p>They said we got rid of last look and, you know, we'll get rid of asynchronous and will allow some header bidding. But what hasn't happened is--publishers will tell you, is the share of auctions that Google wins as a gone down, and the average CPM Google pays hasn't gone down. So, that's mysterious. </p><p>LEE: Senator Klobuchar? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Very good. Thank you, Senator Lee. I think we have another vote so I'll just ask a few more questions here. I mentioned this earlier, but over the years the budgets of both federal antitrust agencies, FTC and the Department of Justice, have failed to keep pace with the growth of the economy despite an ever increasing workload. There's numerous studies showing increased mergers, increased complexity, and then actually less staff than we had during many actually Republican presidents of the past. And so, that is why--and this is something that's been declining over the years. </p><p>That's why, as I mentioned, Senator Grassley and I introduced one bill, the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, to ensure that companies that are engaging in mega mergers pay more of the share of what are increasingly billion-dollar mergers. As you know, we now have I think two companies over a trillion dollar--that are trillion dollar companies. And also, we could just simply budget more money because so much money comes in from these antitrust investigations, and it can basically pay for itself. </p><p>Mr. Dinielli, given the complexity of digital markets, do you have a view on whether the FTC and the antitrust division could use additional resources? </p><p>DINIELLI: Thank you, senator. I didn't make this clear in my opening statement, but I did briefly work at the Department of Justice antitrust division as special counsel, and so I have firsthand knowledge of the incredible workload those people were facing even back in 2011 and 2012 when I was there. </p><p>They work extremely hard, probably much harder than they should given the importance to our economy and to our business life. There is no doubt but that they could benefit from additional staff, additional expertise, and additional funds. I am not an expert in their current levels of funding, and so my knowledge is second and third hand. But what I hear is that people remain continually overworked and that there are not enough resources to investigate fully the kinds of mergers that have gone through, nor to bring the kinds of enforcement actions that we see. </p><p>These are difficult actions to investigate. They require lots of economists' time, lots of lawyers' time, lots of investigators' time. We know this simply by the fact that it's been reported that the Department of Justice has been investigating Google for 16 months, and there are public reports that the staff thinks they need even more time. These are complicated markets and they deserve all of the resources that Congress can allocate for them to do their job.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Mr. Szabo, you raised your hand. </p><p>SZABO: Yes. Thank you. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Um-hmm. </p><p>SZABO: Yeah, previously I worked for an FTC Commissioner way too long ago. And yes, they do great work at these agencies. I think the funding question is a good one to ask. If they don't have enough funds to do this research, that would be (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, I will tell you that both Mr. Dorhime (SP) and FTC Chair Simon (SP) have been positive about adding more resources, yes. </p><p>SZABO: I think one thing that would truly help is getting a clear delineation of authority, because right now we have two agencies basically doing the same job. One of the things that we can do is move merger and acquisition authority exclusively into the Federal Trade Commission and make enforcement exclusively a arm of the Department of Justice. That will free up resources without increasing costs and make taxpayer dollars even more efficient. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: One idea--one idea is to, as I said, change the legal standard so it's easier to bring cases and get the resources to investigate. And I--again, Senator Lee and I have disagreed about this. I just don't see this, given all of the priorities we have right now that we've discussed today with--with privacy and everything else, that this is all about a cross jurisdictional fight. This is about a major shift in our economy when the tech industry alone now is, what, 20 percent of the stock market and we haven't upgraded our laws or talked about monopsonies in our laws, or figured out how we're going to do anything when we have some bipartisan agreement that something has to change here. </p><p>So, Mr. Dinielli, Google's history of serial add technology acquisitions, which I have gone through, is certainly one of the reasons that I think we have seen, as Mr. Heimlich has explained, this dominance. More effective merger enforcement, as we look back, might have prevented that. That's one of the reasons I introduced a different bill, the Consolidation, Prevention, and Competition Promotion Act, to restore the original purpose of the Clayton Act to spot competitive problems before they fully ripen. </p><p>The bill would create a more different standard, more favorable to allow the agencies to take action. The bill also includes provisions to shift the burden to the merging parties under certain circumstances and major cases where they have to prove that the transaction, not that--it doesn't say public interest, but simply that it doesn't hurt competition, that it's not anti-competitive as opposed to having the burden on the government. </p><p>And would reforming the legal standards for assessing the competitive impact of mergers help to prevent market dominance, do you think? We also could look at look backs, at least when consent decrees are reached and the like, so that we are able to look back at whether or not they are truly working. There's all kinds of things that we could do, including, you know, in the case of Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, looking back at those purchases and what that has meant, Mr. Dinielli? </p><p>DINIELLI: Thank you, senator. Many of the bills that you have sponsored would be enormously beneficial to the enforcement community. I'm thinking in particular, for example, about the change in the merger standard from a requirement that the transaction be shown substantially to endanger competition-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Instead of material-- </p><p>DINIELLI: --To materially. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Um-hmm. </p><p>DINIELLI: I think this is important, especially in fast-moving markets, because it's difficult to predict the future, which is often required to a high degree of certainty in merger cases. We just saw a significant merger case be denied by a federal district court in New York in the case of the merger to telephone companies. One of the problems is it's difficult to know what's going to happen next. So, a change in the standard would benefit merger enforcement. </p><p>I also think that the conducting of hearings such as this airs the issues that we all should be thinking about and how the various players in these markets are acting. I also will say that politically we've been through a period in which we tended to give the technology companies the benefit of the doubt. They were new. They were chic. They seem to be ever-growing. They were exciting. I think that we have a public consciousness now that it's time to think about are they doing harm as well as benefits. The economic literature is just beginning to grow, and I hope that that will continue, and that that will aid the enforcements going forward. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Um-hmm. Well, we're going to have to get the media interested in covering these hearings. I think they're very focused on something that happened on the CNBC this morning. And look--and I don't want to go into it. I was just looking at Twitter to see if anyone was looking at our hearing. Maybe some reporter can show me they are. </p><p>And--but instead, we have this major issue-- </p><p>[*]KLOBUCHAR: --In front of us and I don't think that's what they're covering today. And so, I hope that--that you're right and that we can get a more focus on this. I think doing investigations both congressionally and both in agencies is going to make a difference. But I really think people started to have it. They see that there's too much consolidation and they understand there's not enough competition. They understand all of these small businesses are being bought out and its on us. I don't think that senators in the past like Senator Sherman said no one really gets this. I mean, they're mad about the economy, they don't get this so were not going to do anything. It's a Republican senator. </p><p>And I don't think that some of our predecessors said that in these agencies. So I think its on us for people that care about entrepreneurship and competition it's on us to take this on. And that's what I'm hoping we'll be doing next year. </p><p>DINIELLI: If I could just add I would comment that at one-point railroad--railroads were new as well.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: That's right. But now I know 90 percent of the freight traffic I believe is carried by four carriers which is the exact number of railroads on the monopoly board, so. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Szabo, did you want to respond to what Mr. Heimlich was saying a minute ago? I sensed that you were wanting to respond? </p><p>SZABO: Which--which comment? </p><p>LEE: In--in response to my question just before we went to Senator Klobuchar. If not, that's fine. I've got another question for you. </p><p>SZABO: Yeah, just real quickly. When we're looking at the definition of market if the--the argument is that money has been flowing away from television, radio and print media to online ads then clearly those are interchangeable goods for the definition of market. And they are clearly interchangeable goods means the definition of marketplace must include all advertising. We can't just narrowly define it to be Google cause yes, if you define the market as google guess what? It's going to be the--going to be a monopoly. </p><p>And that's kind of what you saw at the CMA report in the UK. </p><p>LEE: Mr. Szabo I--I have heard complaints from news publishers on occasion that they're struggling cause they can't adequately monetize their content due to what they characterize as Google's monopoly. Do you think it's also possible that they might be struggling because the news industry is itself infected with widespread bias and many Americans simply aren't inclined to spend their hard-earned money or--or their time reading biased reporting? Is that a possible explanation? </p><p>SZABO: I think one of the biggest challenges that news media is facing today is the number of options available and the fact that the notion of a reporter could be somebody as simple as having a camera and a cell phone. And the--the--the conception of a newsroom being the alpha and omega of where we get our information I think has gone away and that's--that's now growth the democratization of speech. </p><p>Now you can have something like a Drudge Report or you can have something like somebody like Huffington Post. Those are not legacy newsroom industries but I would definitely say that they are news agencies or information sources. </p><p>And so that's the thing is yes, maybe some of the old legacy industries need to change and update and I hope they do. But at the same time we have seen the New York Times and the Washington Post do quite well recently so clearly they can make it through. And yes, it's going to be harder for local news agencies when I can go to moviephone.com and not have to open up the newspaper to get the movie times and stuff like that. </p><p>LEE: OK. All right, they called another vote we're going to have to wrap up here in a second. I do have one more question I want to ask all three members of the panel to describe to me, briefly, if--if in fact--if in fact Google is operating its ad business in an anticompetitive manner what would be the appropriate remedy? We'll start with you Mr. Szabo and we'll go to Mr. Dinielli then we'll finish with Mr. Heimlich. </p><p>SZABO: If under the circumstances evidence were to be shown that Facebook not only has monopoly power (INAUDIBLE) monopoly power and causes consumer harm I think the remedy would be the least damaging to the entire ecosystem if it's an interoperability fix. I think the smallest fix that we should shoot for would be the best one--a breakup or threaten to break up will be detrimental not only to the ecosystem it will increase prices and it will decrease efficiency.  </p><p>One of the things that's often misunderstood about Teddy Roosevelt is at the end of the day he didn't really want to break up the oil barrens because he recognized doing so would just create a thousand small oil companies all with decreased efficiencies. So if a remedy is sought it should be the smallest remedy possible. And, I do cite to that Teddy Roosevelt quote in my testimony as well.  </p><p>LEE: OK. So we'd say a--a nondivestment requiring remedy-- </p><p>SZABO: Correct. The smallest change possible. </p><p>LEE: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>SZABO: Cause the unintended consequences and downstream impact all consumers.  </p><p>LEE: Mr. Dinielli? </p><p>DINIELLI: Thank you, senator. I think one difficulty in designing remedies is often times the process of enforcing the law is what teaches us exactly what is wrong. What has gone wrong and how the best fixes might be developed. So my answer, senator, would be we need to start with the most rigorous enforcement of Section 2 of the Sherman Act as we possibly can.  </p><p>And that enforcement action, in my view, must include both the search market and the digital ad market. We've heard a variety of people testifying today about the connections between these two markets. I could explain them in detail if we had the time but I know we are wrapping up. But I will say that is the place to start. We should see what that evidence is that the Department of Justice has gathered. We should examine it, we should read the complaint and then we should have further hearings. </p><p>If, during the course of that enforcement action there are opportunities to think about additional changes to the law we should enact them. If there are opportunities to provide additional authority to regulators we should provide them. But we must start with the enforcement action and the disclosure of all of the evidence that's been gathered over the past 16 months. </p><p>LEE: Finally, Mr. Heimlich.  </p><p>HEIMLICH: Thank you. I agree with everything Mr. D--Mr. Dinielli said but I'd go even further. I think this has gone on so long, unfortunately, that the remedy is going to have to be very significant. Some breakup or forced interoperability between search and the ad tech market, yes. But we can't forget Android and Chrome. It's an enormous amount of data that's--that's playing in this market and really it's the same pattern of non-ad tech products feeding Google's power in the ad tech marketplace. </p><p>LEE: But the ad tech is where the revenue comes from, right? Isn't it something like 85/90 percent of the revenue? </p><p>HEIMLICH: I would say yeah Google makes most of its money from selling ads and search in YouTube and then they use that data to dominate the ad tech and exchange market. Right? So easy solution to separate those but the deeper you go, the deeper I've researched I'm concerned that there's significant data from Android and Chrome also being tied into this ad tech market such that even if you separated search and YouTube from ad tech Android would replace what they've already done with data from Android and Chrome.  </p><p>LEE: Ok. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Just a few things. Mr. Szabo the oil industry case was successfully resolved in the oil industry standard oil was broken up under President Taft. That case went on for a while. Isn't that right? </p><p>SZABO: Yes. However, when you look at what Teddy Roosevelt has been lionized as is a trust buster it's important to look at what his intent was with respect to-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: OK. I just think it's important that the record reflect that they did break up standard oil and it went through several administrations as I think some of these cases will. But that's my own political view. (LAUGHTER) And we will eventually et to the place we have to go if I have anything to do with it. I also want to point out that simply because we want to have new standards in place that fit our economy doesn't mean that we are antibusiness and it certainly doesn't even mean that you go into it saying everything should be broken up. I don't. I've tried to be responsible by putting forward bills that I think could fit regardless of what I think of a p--particular company. And I think that's an important point to make.  </p><p>And the third thing is, I'm glad there's some interest in beefing up resources on everyone's part. And I hope that we're going to be able to make sense of all this. Because I think for too long people have just thrown up their hands and said these are cool companies so it's ok. I don't think it is OK anymore and it's not going to be ok as we see these growing monopolies and it is on us to make those changes. </p><p>I just want to put on the record before we go vote Mr. Chairman, a letter from Consumer Reports dated it is dates September 15th, to the two of us on their views on the subcommittee and their concerns about what is happening with online advertising. </p><p>LEE: That'll be admitted into the record without objection. And the record in--for this hearing will remain open for one week. The committee stands adjourned. Thank you very much for your participation and your testimony today. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Thank you. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VF-V1T1-JDPT-T0PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.
