Despite its myriad scandals - Russian propagandists exploiting the platform to spread misinformation and sway U.S. elections, the sharing of millions of users' personal data with the political data firm Cambridge Analytica and companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Netflix - Facebook's reach continues to grow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure Americans are protected and markets are competitive,\" Hughes wrote. \"It is time to break up Facebook.\"</p><p>Facebook rejected this argument in a statement Thursday afternoon, suggesting that regulation of the internet - as Zuckerberg called for in a March op-ed published in The Washington Post - was the only thing that would bring real accountability.</p><p> \"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company,\" Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a statement. \"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the Internet.\"</p><p>Hughes' calls come as Facebook faces yet another controversy after an AP investigation revealed that the platform automatically generates videos and pages that elevate extremist groups.</p><p> The op-ed painted a stark portrait of Facebook's dominance: The company is worth half a trillion dollars and its products are regularly used by billions of people. By Hughes' estimates, Facebook commands \"more than 80 percent of the world's social networking revenue.\"</p><p> Another major social networking platform hasn't been founded since 2011, and despite the movements like #deleteFacebook, it's almost impossible to avoid, with many people eschewing the core platform in favor of Instagram or WhatsApp, not realizing they are Facebook subsidiaries. The apparent avalanche of disasters hasn't dented Facebook's finances; its earnings per share increased 40% last year, despite a torrent of public failures.</p><p> \"Because Facebook so dominates social networking, it faces no market-based accountability,\" Hughes wrote. \"This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment, and finally, resignation.\"</p><p> No aspect of Facebook is more troubling than Zuckerberg's total authority, Hughes wrote, calling it \"unprecedented and un-American.\" Zuckerberg controls 60 percent of the company's voting shares and has ultimate oversight over Facebook's algorithms, its privacy settings and community guidelines. He has the money and power to copy, buy, or squash his competitors. While Hughes defended Zuckerberg as a \"good, kind person,\" he cast him as a man hellbent on domination, even when it imperils the American public and democracy.</p><p> \"I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\" Hughes wrote.</p><p>Facebook's monopoly is stifling innovation and economic growth, Hughes argued, citing the 20th century breakups of Standard Oil and AT&amp;T by the Department of Justice as examples of effective government intervention in the past. The shift toward business-friendly policy over the decades has eroded antitrust enforcement, Hughes wrote, at the expense of entrepreneurship, productivity and consumer health.</p><p>Hughes wants the government to correct the FTC's \"biggest mistake\" by forcing Instagram and WhatsApp to split from Facebook and become competitors once again. Hughes also wants the government to create an agency to monitor tech companies to ensure healthy regulation. Zuckerberg himself has called for regulation in a March op-ed published in The Post.</p><p> \"Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree,\" Zuckerberg wrote, also citing privacy, data protection and election integrity as other areas in need of government oversight. Hughes argues Zuckerberg is only interested in regulation that is \"friendly\" to Facebook's interests.</p><p> Legislators on both sides of the aisle have made a case for federal intervention with Facebook. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has made the breakup of American tech giants a pillar of her presidential campaign.</p><p> \"Today's big tech companies have too much power - over our economy, our society &amp; our democracy,\" Warren tweeted Thursday. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation.\"</p><p> Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has said he'd hit tech companies with antitrust violations or fraud charges, arguing that they unfairly censor right-leaning speech. This week, two top senators urged the FTC to go beyond its expected $5 billion fine against Facebook for its privacy practices, calling for tough punishments and accountability measures.</p><p> \"The public is rightly asking whether Facebook is too big to be held accountable,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wrote in a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simmons. \"The FTC must set a resounding precedent that is heard by Facebook and any other tech company that disregards the law in a rapacious quest for growth.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTN-2147834</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898FC6AFE8AB7 NWBKTN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2X-KJM1-JBCN-421Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401981</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Herald, Stephens Media, LLC, d/b/a The Daily Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The technology, also known as a common form of intelligent automation, leverages basic AI to perform routine tasks and operations. Using software with rule-based triggers, RPAs or \"bots\" enable businesses to streamline administrative tasks, reduce the margin of error from data entry and minimise an organisation's reliance on forms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Intelligent automation such as RPA can help to alleviate these operational burdens by accelerating the digitisation of processes without a complete overhaul of fragmented IT platforms in the short term. Instead of requiring a whole new setup, the technology operates on the surface level of an insurer's system by imitating human keystrokes and mouse clicks. RPA is a friendly entry point for insurers to implement as the software is non-invasive, complementary to existing systems, and can be set up with ease.</p><p>Global forecasts indicate that the IT-enabled RPA market will reach US$4.98 billion by 2020. This is especially meaningful as the industry takes a significant step towards the digitisation of insurance, one of the world's oldest trades.</p><p>While RPA has been discussed at length by insurance industry leaders, its full potential would not be recognised without cognitive technology. By using intelligent automation tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, analytics around video and image data, and emotion recognition, RPA can go beyond standard data parameters to automate functions that require higher perception or judgment. This natural extension is also known as Robotics and Cognitive Automation (R&amp;CA), and has potential to shake up the insurance sector.</p><p>Across the value chain, R&amp;CA has many potential applications that can extend into making routine business decisions. Robotics capable of self-learning from unstructured claims data can compute complex algorithms to identify fraud. Beyond traditional datasets, R&amp;CA can also develop deeper cognitive capabilities around image and video analytics. These upgraded bots can be used to assess the severity of motor accident claims, predict the claims outcome and recommend the payment.</p><p>R&amp;CA can also be used to perform standard underwriting tasks through assessment of simple images such as selfies. Using a machine learning technique, R&amp;CA can pinpoint facial indicators to determine body mass index, an estimated age range, gender and smoking habits.</p><p>In the long term, R&amp;CA is a more responsive way to deal with the changing shifts in today's competitive landscape. By leveraging cognitive automation, R&amp;CA has the potential to untangle complexities hardwired into insurance models.</p><p>Looking ahead, insurers may have to consider how the regulatory environment will change as solutions like R&amp;CA evolve, and if these developments will happen in tandem with emerging technologies. Further developments around such legal frameworks will help to accelerate the pace of innovation in an insurer's journey in digitisation.</p><p>Another change that the insurance sector will have to adjust to is changing customer demographics. As the oldest millennials enter their late 30s, insurers will need to improve their understanding of this segment in order to capture this significant target market.</p><p>Perhaps R&amp;CA's true value can be found in how it benefits customers. By drawing out deeper insights on customer behaviour and preferences, insurers can do more to improve their overall experience across each potential interaction point. For instance, insurers can customise products and price points for each customer by understanding the data points.</p><p>EMOTIONAL SUPPORT</p><p>In the future, an insurer can also use an R&amp;CA-enabled smart assistant to improve customer service. Powered by natural language processing and emotion-recognition API, the robot assistant can detect a customer's needs through facial or verbal expressions, and provide emotional support when needed.</p><p>According to PwC, insurance CEOs are more concerned about the pace of technological change than other business leaders. This is unsurprising when we consider how rapidly the landscape has evolved. Today's insurers are not just beset with rising pressures from cost and revenue standpoints, but have to constantly meet moving goalposts driven by shifts in technology and customer expectations.</p><p>Innovation will continue to be high on the agenda for insurers as Big Tech firms like Google and Amazon have become better positioned to enter the insurance market. According to the World Insurance Report for 2018, 29.5 per cent of customers are willing to buy at least one insurance product from a BigTech firm. The same report found that millennial and tech-savvy customers are the most inclined to switch from insurers within 12 months, with a large number of them being open to purchasing insurance from Big Tech firmss.</p><p>Nevertheless, insurers will still have an edge over Big Tech firms in terms of the wealth of underwriting experience and insurance data built up and augmented over the years. R&amp;CA can bring together existing and new data sources and help insurers to learn and analyse in more insightful and efficient ways than traditional analytics can. R&amp;CA can dovetail tailored customer service, more efficient assessment by insurers and faster pay claims, and more accurate underwriting and pricing.</p><p>In recognition of R&amp;CA's potential benefits and in anticipation of this industry-wide shift, MSIG Insurance in Singapore has started to look at ways to deploy cognitive automation into the organisation's claims and underwriting processes by building up the company's digitisation strategy and data analytic capabilities.</p><p>It is clear that RC&amp;A is a significant opportunity for the industry. While insurers may not be naturally wired to adapt to such a major change, it is a shift that is necessary to ensure that organisations continue to stay relevant to what customers expect and need.</p><p> The writer is senior vice-president, Corporate Services and Project Management Office, at MSIG Insurance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-220999</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TCX-96S1-JCF2-8016-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1015\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 2, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8K</classCode><className>COGNITIVE COMPUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001503</classCode><className>ROBOTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DMWD</classCode><className>MACHINE LEARNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DMVO</classCode><className>EMERGING TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000937</classCode><className>INTELLIGENCE &amp;

In the centuries since we have witnessed subsequent revolutions in industrial technology, from chemistry and electricity in the 19th century to computer technology in the 20th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today artificial intelligence (AI) is enabling the next industrial revolution, but this one is very different to what has come before. </p><p>All the technology developed in previous economic revolutions was about improving our ability to do something with our existing situation. Steam enabled us to move across the world and to manufacture on a grander scale. Iron and the invention of machine tools further increased our physical capabilities. </p><p>The technological revolution which brought the advent of computers and the internet vastly improved our ability to store and process large amounts of information, but that technology fell short of being able to understand that information. </p><h>Age of machines </h><p>Artificial intelligence, and all of its associated technologies, is changing that. This is the revolutionary age of machines that can understand. We are already seeing the development and use of technology that is perceptive and capable of working with us, humans, on equal footing.  </p><p>This is the cognitive industrial revolution.</p><p>The industrial revolution transformed the idea of a city. The cognitive industrial revolution will bring about the reality of cities developing a brain. Smart cities that are responsive to their inhabitants, that are cleaner, more efficient and healthier.</p><p>And what about businesses? </p><p>Businesses are collecting information all the time. They have data about employees, customers, their processes and systems and yet, until now, businesses have never really known what they know. The cognitive industrial revolution is set to change all that.</p><p>We already see applications of this intelligent technology on our smartphones with digital assistants, machine translation and face recognition, but this is only the very start. AI has broken out of the technology sphere. Well used, it will enhance every aspect of our society and lives. </p><p>The opportunities for business and enterprise are enormously exciting. The modern enterprise will have the ability to be self-reflective by using data and information it collects, exploiting AI, data science and machine learning to gain a broader and deeper understanding of its operations, its customers, employees and operating context. </p><p>All of this will be central in driving better services and better performance. </p><h>World class</h><p> A confluence of factors puts Ireland at the helm of this revolution. Academic research in AI, machine learning and data science across Irish universities and research centres is world class. Science Foundation Ireland has encouraged collaborations between academics and industry through its Centres Programme.  </p><p>As a result, research centres have many close collaborations with enterprises that wish to stay ahead of the game in this emerging cognitive industrial revolution.</p><p>Deep and broad access to enterprise data is available within the many global companies that have a R&amp;D presence here. Importantly, this data is beyond the reach of big tech companies, enabling potential disruption. </p><p>Moreover, given Ireland's membership of the EU, responsible use of sensitive enterprise data originating with employees, customers and other stakeholders will be safeguarded by GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the new EU regulatory framework on data privacy and security. </p><p>Finally, and equally importantly, Ireland offers the right investment climate of tax incentives for R&amp;D that brings academic research and the enterprise closely together, much closer than in many other countries. After a number of false starts in the 1970s and 1980s, AI is finally realising its potential in the emerging cognitive industrial revolution. </p><p>Ireland is poised to be a leader through early and consistent investment in human capital across relevant academic research while bringing this closely together with industry and other stakeholders.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3507759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SD8-MN71-DYS1-03B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 25, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST0009JYN</classCode><className>EDUCATION RESEARCH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009U6H</classCode><className>MACHINE TRANSLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST00090NP</classCode><className>MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009RXL</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001897</classCode><className>COMPUTING &amp; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001053</classCode><className>MACHINE TOOLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000CYWJ</classCode><className>SMARTPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N541930MM</classCode><className>TRANSLATORS &amp; INTERPRETERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

BERNSTEIN &amp; CO., LLC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 36th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference. I'm Harshita Rawat, the senior analyst covering IT services and payments at Bernstein. I'm delighted to be joined today by Karen McLoughlin, the CFO of Cognizant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Two quick housekeeping items for investors viewing this webcast. They're able to submit questions through the Pigeonhole link available on the left-hand side of your viewing screen. Also please complete the Procensus poll at the end of the fireside chat and you will have immediate access to the full results. The link to the poll is also on the left-hand side of your screen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now with that, let's begin. Karen, thank you very much for joining us today.</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN, CFO, COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION: Thank you, Harshita. It's a pleasure to be with you. I wish you could be there, personally with everyone but this is the best for now.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: The safest for now. So Karen, and this is going to end up with some of the top questions I have now in my inbox, too. The situation is very fluid and changing almost every day. But can you talk about the current demand environment you're seeing across different verticals and geos, and also outside of travel, even in your core verticals?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes, absolutely. And I think as everybody said, it's been a very interesting several weeks now. And I think if we go back to the later part of Q1, the March time frame, I think like many others, we started to see a little bit of a slowdown in travel and hospitality. But Q1, overall, was quite strong. And as we talked about on our earnings call, we had great TCV bookings in January and February. And we were very pleased with the way the quarter was shaping up. I think if you got towards the very end of March and countries around the world really started to shut down, you did see a fairly significant drop-off in demand at that point for a couple of weeks. And I think a lot of companies at that point were trying to understand what it meant to work from home and what do they need to get their organizations and how long this might take. So the last part of March and the first couple of weeks of April, I think were quite uncertain for a lot of our clients.</p><p>What we've noticed in the last couple of weeks is a certain level of stabilization. I don't want to certainly imply that we've returned to strong growth or anything like that. But you have seen, I think, companies start to understand a little bit about what their environment is going to be like for the next few months, trying to understand what their priorities are and how they're going to manage through, this crisis and this downturn, and then look for ways to -- both at the same time, drive savings into their business as many of our clients are struggling with top line perspective. And so also need to drive savings, but at the same time, protect their transformation agendas. And it's very different stories across the industries and particularly, within clients within industries. So travel and hospitality has, obviously, been the most impacted industry in the short term. And I think that's very easy for everybody to understand. When I look, for example, at, say, Life Sciences. So in Life Sciences, which has been a very strong practice for Cognizant over the years, we have some clients whose work is involved in dealing with the pandemic. So working on vaccines, test kits, other treatments for the pandemic. So they obviously have a lot of work going on. We also have other Life Sciences clients whose work primarily supports say, elective surgeries. And so with elective surgeries not happening in most parts of the world, their work has been significantly impacted. And so obviously, we're seeing a bigger negative impacts there. Similarly, within retail, you have certain retailers who are doing very well during this time. Other retailers whose businesses have been very impacted because they've had to shut down and perhaps don't as -- are not deemed essential services or don't have a strong online business. And so we saw a lot of pullback initially in those retailers. Now as the market starts to open up and stores are able to start reopening, those clients are beginning to get a better sense of what their recovery looks like and what their spend will look like for the rest of the year. So we're getting to see a little bit better color there.</p><p>Communications, media and entertainment. It's another one where perhaps initially, it wasn't as obvious to everybody what the impacts would be, but when you think about professional sports shutting down around the world, so clients who maybe are in that business or in the TV, the cable space that provide all the cable programming for sports, a big impact there. Theme parks, studios shutting down. All of those things are impacting certain of our clients, obviously, much more than, say, just a traditional telecom company. So very mixed behavior across clients really depending upon how the pandemic has been impacting their business specifically.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, can you talk about how Cognizant stand positioned in this demand environment, which in terms of what percentage of your revenue is exposed to critical systems and infrastructure versus revenue exposure to discretionary projects with longer payback periods? I know it's kind of like very client by client, too, in many occasions. But any color you could provide there is very, very helpful.</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Sure. I mean, if you think about it at a very macro level, if you think about the notion of outsourcing versus consulting in our business. So the outsourcing business tends to be the run-the-business spend. So it's application support, it's infrastructure services. It's digital operations or BPO-type work. And so that business, historically, has been the longer-term contracts, less sensitivity, sometimes to economic downturns and so forth. Although there's still a volume impact in that business. So particularly, when we think about some of our BPO work, a lot of that work is volume-based. So as those clients' lines go up or down, the revenue goes up or down. The consulting side of the business is where you tend to have more of a true discretionary projects. Although -- even there, given the nature of our work and the amount of our work that's in regulated industries, there's always some level of work that is more or less discretionary depending on what its objective is. But that's where a lot of our digital work, obviously, happens, a lot of the transformational work.</p><p>And going into the recession, even for the last couple of years, as people have been wondering about when the next recession would come and what its impact would be on the industry, we've had a hypothesis that a lot of the digital work, while one might deem it discretionary because it's project-based work, clients would actually look to protect a lot of that work as best they could through a downturn because it is so critical to the future of their business and what their business will look like on the other side of a recession. And I think we would still argue that, that seems to be the case. Well, certainly, we'll see a slowdown in growth in that -- even in that area in the short term, we can see -- continue to see a strong pipeline for digital work. We are continuing to work with clients on their transformation journeys, and really focused now on how do we help them maybe drive even more savings in their run-the-business side while freeing up those investment dollars to continue to drive transformation. And as we come out of this recession, when we do, we definitely expect to see that part of the business accelerate faster than potentially it even has been in recent times. Those clients continue to really look to drive resiliency and virtualization into their own businesses.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, I have a number of questions for you on the digital side. But before we get there, just 2 more follow-up questions here. So if I -- are you seeing any -- in the demand you're seeing from clients, any sizable pressures for rate reductions or any more broader pricing pressures from clients just yet?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: So we had a few requests from clients to give them some temporary breaks on specific projects or pieces of work within a client. In some cases, you may have had clients defer some work, but most of those have been quite small in nature and very short-term focused. So concessions that we're doing at this point have really been focused on just the Q2, Q3 time frame. And they've been quite limited to industries or clients that we know are really suffering in this time frame, but there's suffering, which should be a clearly, I don't want to call it a short term, but a manageable time frame, right, that their business will recover at some point. And so those are the folks we've been focused on helping whether it's through some kind of rate concessions or even some payment term extensions in that space.</p><p>You are seeing, as you would expect to see in a downturn, some pickup in vendor consolidation opportunities in captive opportunities with clients. Those tend to be larger transactions. And there, you will have a few folks competing for those types of deals as they have been for many years now, they will be competitive from a pricing perspective, but you also get a lot of scale with those deals. So I wouldn't say that I've necessarily seen a big change in pricing across the board. I think as we've always said, there's always going to be transactions in the market that one player versus another, things are particularly strategic for them that they may go after aggressively. But in terms of broad-based across the board pricing, I haven't seen a significant change. And as we know in this industry, every now and then, when a competitor tries to get very aggressive on pricing, it tends to write itself fairly quickly because the industry as a whole can move to support that.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, the demand side, the near-term demand impact, is it more deferment of projects or cancellations that you're seeing right now?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. It's been more deferment or slowing it down, right? So they may not shut a project completely, but they may say we're going to slow it down, so send X percentage of the team off for now, and we'll pick it back up in the fall. It's a little bit of a mixed bag, though, I think as you would expect by client as to -- there's been some clients who have had to cancel projects just because of the impact of their business. That's been so great. They say, we just -- we can't continue with XYZ project. But for the most part, you're seeing clients try to maintain some level of the work, but either defer new work or slow down starting new work.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, you and many of your peers also have called out the demand for -- increased demand for modernization projects, remote work, cloud in this current crisis. Can you talk about Cognizant's current capabilities there, strengths and weaknesses versus peers?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. So I think we've done a nice job over the years of building out our digital capabilities. We're particularly strong in digital engineering. We have a good cloud migration foundation in our infrastructure business and core modernization work that we can do for clients. We have continued and will continue to build out our cloud businesses, both through organic as well as inorganic acquisitions, we believe. And I think this has become -- becoming a strength of ours that perhaps wasn't as much so a few years ago, but really strong partnerships with all the various SaaS players and cloud players in the marketplace. And they are looking for partners who can scale with them and can really help with implementations and support for clients. So we're very excited about those opportunities. You've seen us do a number of acquisitions in the sales force space over the last couple of years. Most recently, we announced the collaborative solutions, an acquisition in the Workday space, which we're very excited about. So that deal hasn't closed yet, but it will close shortly, and that will be a great partnership for us with Workday. And really leveraging those partnerships, we agree. And certainly, we think cloud migration and this notion of virtualization, as we talked about, resiliency is really going to be where a lot of the growth will come from in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, just talking about the delivery side of this equation. Obviously, as COVID-19 is spreading in India, can you remind us about the changes you've made in your delivery over the last few months? What percentage of your fulfillment is now work-from-home enabled? What are you doing for your employees and your clients in India in this crisis?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. So not just in India but around the world. The vast majority of our people are working from home. In India, we have nobody doing client-facing work, really, in any of our facilities. It's all work from home. The only folks who are in our facilities today are some of our internal IT support and security and so forth that keep the buildings running. And that's true in the Philippines, that's true in India and really most of our delivery centers around the world.</p><p>In the U.S. and in Europe, we have a few folks who are working in client locations because of the type of work they do, they needed to remain in the client location. We have a few clients that are asking to bring people back to work in country. But at this point, we're not anticipating a rush back into the delivery centers in India. We will start to pilot some return to work on a very, very small scale in 1 or 2 of our centers in India in the coming weeks. But we do not expect to have everybody in the centers in any time in the near future. We will continue to have most folks work from home.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And then, Karen, just to, I guess, step back, can you compare and contrast, a potential downturn, not just what we are seeing right now, potentially, like, COVID-19 triggered down to now versus what happened back in '08, '09? Because as you can imagine, these also been the top questions investors are now trying to figure out because, obviously, there's many differences. We've talked about it a couple of weeks ago. You no longer have offshoring as a secular growth driver. It's probably best pushing for margins, but then on the flip side, digital is a driver of growth. You -- Financial Services, not in the front line this time. So what should investors keep in mind?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. I think that's a real key to this, this Financial Services, right? Because as you said in the last recession, a lot of it was about Financial Services and the banks were under a lot of pressure, money dried up and so forth. This time. I think obviously, the financial institutions are in better shape. The governments are supporting the economy more rapidly and so access to capital has not really been an issue at this point for most organizations. And so certainly, the behavior that we're seeing from clients is that desire to really protect the transformation work. That agenda seems to be, and I believe it is, more critical to clients now than it was 10 years ago. 10 years ago, it really was about the cost cutting. And as you said, you could drive a lot of work offshore. There were lots of levers. A lot of those levers still exist today. And so when we think about clients who are looking on the cost side of the business, they are a lot of opportunities for vendor consolidation. We're seeing a lot of clients say, \"I don't want to run my captive anymore, right? Can you come and take my captive over?\" So there's still a lot of opportunities on the cost side of the business to help clients but it's really then about how do they take those savings and continue to protect that digital transformation investment that we're seeing. It is really quite different than what we saw 10, 12 years ago. I do -- it's still a question in my mind of if this becomes a prolonged recession, what does happen to the financial institutions and the capital markets, and does it have a different impact from what we're seeing today? But certainly, right now, it feels very different than it did last time.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, let's talk about Cognizant's turnaround journey. It's been more than a year since Brian became CEO. I know it's been a very busy last 12 months for Cognizant. Looking back at the last year, what are some of the key changes you and Brian have put in place to put Cognizant back in a good trajectory?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. I think first and foremost, is the energy and getting everybody focused back on our clients, which is what this company has always done best. And so making sure that people across the board are out in front of clients every day. And even though now it's virtually, we're still doing client meetings and client sales calls and so forth, we're engaging with clients proactively. And really keeping people focused on that. As he talked about when he joined -- unfortunately, he had gone to see several clients where he didn't feel like the executive team or other leaders in the company have really been out in front of our clients and not really showcasing what the organization can do for our clients. So that's been a big focus. And I think with some of the leadership changes we've made last year, in particular, in some of the North America changes where we moved DK Sinha to run North America. We've got new leadership in many of our businesses in North America has really reenergized the teams, and we've been able to make some great internal promotions where folks have really taken off, such as our Healthcare business, where we have an internal promotion. Even as difficult as our retail and travel and hospitality businesses there, we have an internal promotion there and that team has been doing great as well as our communications and tech businesses. So lots of great stories coming about from that. And you could really feel that energy, I think, in the company, particularly in Q1. And then as we got into the COVID situation, in April, Cognizant did what it does best, which is it rallies around a crisis. And the energy and the passion coming from our teams during that first couple of weeks of trying to get everybody set up to work from home and really getting our teams to do it, whatever they could do to support clients through this time, it's just amazing to see. And certainly, as we closed out the March revenue, and into the first part of the second quarter, the performance of the company certainly was better than we might have hoped for going into this. So it's been great to see that energy level.</p><p>I think at the same time, I think we've also gotten more disciplined on the cost side. And I think importantly, really thinking about the bifurcation in the types of services we offer. So we've been so fortunate over the years to be such a high-growth company, and we didn't have to really necessarily think about whether we were going to invest in one business versus the other because we had enough funding to invest in everybody. But at this scale, and when you have businesses that are at different growth rates, different margin profiles, more mature businesses versus less mature businesses, we have to be more thoughtful about where we spend our dollars and where we want to make investments. So I think we've been able to bring some of that rigor and discipline to the company, at the same time as we continue to invest for growth.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, you hit upon a lot of really good points there. And I want to zoom in on some of those. So the one of 2 most critical aspects of Cognizant's turnaround or pivot towards digital and also at the same time, optimizing the cost structure. So let's -- starting with digital, and we kind of touched upon that a little bit earlier, but can you talk about Cognizant's digital capabilities holistically as they stand today? How have they changed over the last few years? And how does that compare versus your peers? And more broadly, how does a part to accelerate the digital growth look like for Cognizant?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: So I think if we go back, we were really one of the initial companies to start talking about digital with SMAC back in the day, and Horizon 1, 2 and 3 businesses. So I think we really coined a lot of that. So I do think we've got an early head start. I think so, particularly in the last, call it, 12 to 15 months, I think we've done a better job of focusing in on what are the areas of digital we want to be strong in. And while you need to play across the board, obviously, I think each firm will have its own strengths. And for us, we've chosen to focus a lot on digital engineering and analytics and cloud and core modernization and so forth, while we'll continue to have a strong interactive business, that is not necessarily just the primary focus of our investments. So I think we've done a better job of thinking about that and building out those capabilities, both organically and inorganically.</p><p>I think we've also done a much better job in the last year or so building out partnerships. So with SaaS providers and other cloud providers and really having those strong engagements and relationships and getting their support to help grow our business, which is important. And partnerships wasn't always a really strong point for us. But I think that is something that as soon as Brian came on board, he realized the need for that. He came from a strong alliance of partnership background. And so we've worked very quickly to put a lot of that in place.</p><p>And so I think when we look at some of the parts of our digital practice, we are one of the top couple of firms in that space. And we do think that coming out of this downturn, this will be the driver of growth, not to say that other parts of the business won't grow, but in terms of where we expect meaningful growth to come from, it will be from our digital businesses. And we will continue to drive investment there, both organically and inorganically in the coming months and quarters.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, you touched upon the cost structure. Your cost structure today is higher versus your peers. And this is something you and Brian have also highlighted. Why is that? And what does the journey look like for optimizing the cost structure for Cognizant?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. So I think it depends which peers you're obviously comparing to. So I think while it's fair to say that our cost structure is higher than some of the India pure-plays -- or India players, rather, when you look at some of the other firms, like Accenture and then even some of the more pure-play digital firms, the digital engineering firms and so forth, their margins are actually lower than ours. So I do think it's a balance, and I do think it matters where you're playing in the space. I think when we look at the sort of heritage Cognizant business and the sort of the core legacy IT business, we do know that our delivery structure was more expensive. There it always was. And that was by design in the early days of the company. When you think back to the days when we were targeting a 19% to 20% operating margin, we intentionally had a higher cost structure than the competitors, which allowed us to grow faster than the marketplace. Now as that business has matured, obviously, the reality is it needs less investment than it did, say, 5, 10 years ago. And I think that's the pivot we have to make is how do we think about that cost structure on that part of the business differently. And I'm not sure it will ever get to the levels of a TCS. They do a remarkable job on that and driving margins. But certainly, we know that we can deliver those services at a more effective cost and ultimately price point to clients so that you can compete effectively in that business, and that's what we've been working on, certainly for the last year or so</p><p>At the same time, we do want to continue to increase the investments on the digital side of the business. Digital in and of itself is a very high value business, and we've got great pricing in that market, and it can drive great margins. But it is still very much in an investment phase, and particularly with the acquisitions and so forth that we're bringing in, we do need to make sure that we can free up some costs from the other parts of the business to fund that.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, can you talk about the employee morale as you navigate Cognizant through this crisis as well as the turnaround? How do you attract and retain talent in this environment?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Sure. So I think a lot of it was getting the energy back into the company. So certainly, attrition has been higher than it historically had run and voluntary attrition -- both voluntary and involuntary, obviously, involuntary, we were pushing, but voluntary has been a little bit higher. I think part of it is the market. So certainly before COVID, right, we were at a very hot job market around the world, and particularly in India, which obviously, where our largest people base is. The market in India is vastly different than it was a few years ago. A few years ago, really, firms like ourselves were the market in India, and that's where all the young engineers started to come to work. They get an opportunity to go on-site to whether it be the U.S. or Europe, work with clients and so forth. And it was a great vision for employees. As the market in India has changed and you now have a lot more captives in India, all the big tech companies have moved into India, the banks have moved into India. We have a lot of start-ups now in India that didn't really exist the same level that they do now. And so the market for talent in India is much different than it was a few years ago. And folks who come to a firm, whether it be Cognizant, Infosys, TCS, Accenture in India, get this great training background, and then they're giving these wonderful opportunities to potentially go and join other firms, which didn't exist before. So I think, certainly, it's fair to say that unless there's a big change in the market that attrition for that purpose will probably stay a little bit high. Now slowed down considerably, obviously with COVID, but if we were still in a normal economy, I think we would continue to see some fairly high voluntary attrition.</p><p>The flip side is though, we are really focused on getting the company back to growth. There is a certain amount of energy that has come back to the organization. We certainly went through a lot of change last year, and we're still going through some of that. Any big transformation program doesn't happen overnight. But as we bring new talent in and as we bring in some of the new sales teams, some of the leadership that Brian has brought it, they bring a wealth of experience to us, and you can really start to see those teams starting to settle in and become part of the fabric of the company, and getting off to a strong start in the first quarter certainly helped with that.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, one of the most encouraging aspects coming out of the first quarter earnings call was this win rates improving considerably. Can you give a little bit more color on where are you seeing those win rates in terms of the workloads, verticals, tiers? Where are you seeing that?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. So we saw strong growth across the industries. It's built a really nice balance of particularly strong growth in digital as well as in some of the core IT work, very good growth in North America as well as some of the growth markets. But I think North America was the piece that we really needed to reaccelerate in many ways. Obviously, such a big piece of all of our Healthcare business is in North America, such a big piece of our banking and insurance businesses are there as well. And so it's important to really get those markets back on a growth trajectory. And as we looked at the pipeline and the wins that we had in Q1, it really was across the spectrum, particularly strong in health care, which is great to see that our Healthcare business, as we know, has been struggling a little bit the last couple of years. And with the new leadership we've put in there and the energy that, that team has put into being back on the road, getting in front of clients and making sure that we have the right solutions to deliver to clients. They're very quickly starting to see a nice turnaround there. So that was particularly exciting and encouraging to see and great for that team. But the strength was really across the board, and that's what was great. We really could feel this great sense of energy and passion across the board and a lot of opportunity to celebrate.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, Brian has talked about this difference which had emerged over the last few years in terms of the true capabilities of Cognizant and clients' perception of it. Do you think that in some of your core verticals, you're seeing evidence that some of this energy is starting to come back, that client perception starting to change?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: I do. We really have seen a marked turnaround with some of our client conversations. And the notion that we do have solutions that we can bring to bear upon clients and making sure that the sales teams and our client partners had the confidence to go into clients and deliver these opportunities, and to make sure that they were bringing in the right talent from around the company to do that. And a lot of that was -- some of those comp changes, obviously, we've put in place, but those are recent. The comp changes are really a 2020 initiative. But it was really about making sure that our teams are working together and just opening up the doors to each other. We have become probably a little bit too siloed or matrix organization. And so by definition, those could be hard. But I think putting the right leaders in place who are much more open to collaboration and bringing teams in, and Brian, leading by example, frankly. He spent the vast majority of his time until the middle of March on a plane, not just every week, but almost every day. I think he was really out there helping teams and sort of leading by example and encouraging them to get reengaged.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, just switching gears a little bit. Over the last few years, Cognizant had a little bit of volatility in its financial performance relative to its guidance. And I know there's a lot of factors there, especially with regard to concentration in Financial Services and Healthcare, where just a few clients could really impact your financial performance. But more broadly, has your guidance and forecasting framework changed under Brian's leadership?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: I don't think it's necessarily changed. Certainly, Brian is a believer of beat and raise as a philosophy and certainly always make sure we guide to something that we think we can achieve. And so we certainly have tried to make sure that we do that the last few quarters. But it is somewhat of a science, but there's a lot of art as well. I mean in forecasting, particularly, when you're in a time like this, where things are moving so quickly. But I think it really is about making sure we get the energy back and setting targets and creating an environment where the team can be successful.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And can I just zoom in on your 2 key verticals, Financial Services and Healthcare? Starting with Financial Services. Can you talk about the structural dynamics there? It was a growth sector many years ago because of this secular shift towards offshoring, and there's also this compliance-related spend. But now this vertical is not just weak for Cognizant, weak for almost everybody. So in terms of Financial Services so important for Cognizant, what's your strategy to accelerate the growth here?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: And I think I would break banking and insurance into separate thesis because, to your point, I think banking across the board, it is a much more mature industry for the services players. And I think everybody has struggled a little bit with growth in banking. I do think, certainly, for us, that has been focused on a handful of clients. And so certainly, as we look to build out the rest of the portfolio, there's still a number of banks around the world that are not part of -- certainly part of our business and part of our model. We did -- we've done some nice work with smaller regional banks in the U.S., and that was certainly a good driver of growth. And I would assume we'll continue to be, but there's still pockets of those institutions that are really not in the market yet. I think as we look into other geographies, I think there's one for geographic expansion in Financial Services. But I do think it is a different footprint. And certainly, I wouldn't expect it to get back to the growth that it had several years ago. If it does, that's wonderful, but I'm not banking on that right now. No pun intended. But as I think about insurance, we are seeing a lot of traction in insurance, particularly around captives and some bigger transformation deals in the insurance space. So I do think that has the potential to be a bigger opportunity in the short-term than seeing a lot of growth on the banking side.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And on the Healthcare side. The last year or so has been weak because of M&amp;A happening in health care. There's also political uncertainty. How should we think about the long-term growth potential in Healthcare for Cognizant?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. So again, I'd separate Life Sciences and Healthcare, but Life Sciences has been doing quite well. Obviously, some impact with COVID on certain Life Sciences clients, particularly those in the elective surgery space, as we talked about. But other parts of Life Sciences is continuing to do very well. And we're really excited about some of the investments we've made in Life Sciences growth in the platforms. And then more recently, last year with the Zenith acquisition, which is in the IoT space for Life Sciences manufacturing. So I think that will continue to be a nice driver of growth for us. More recently, with Healthcare, as you said, Healthcare was impacted by acquisitions and lots of different things, I think we've lapsed the acquisition impact at this point. So again, barring the COVID situation, I think we would have seen some much better performance in Q2, all else being equal, just because of lapping the acquisitions and the impact of a client building out a captive last year. But at the same time, we've seen very nice recent wins in Healthcare across the spectrum. So both with some of our larger existing clients as well as starting to expand the footprint beyond that core group of clients. And we have a real strength in Healthcare on the back of the TriZetto acquisition. There's a lot of things we can do in Healthcare in terms of delivering real solutions in the health care industry. And as I mentioned with the leadership change we've made in that practice recently, that team has really been out working with clients on building out solutions that they know clients are looking for that we can take to market using the experience we have with TriZetto and with the product side of the business. So I actually have always been bullish on our Healthcare business knowing -- despite its troubles over the last few years, I think there is -- and will continue to be a big opportunity there over the next couple of years.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, you have accelerated M&amp;A as you pivot towards digital over the last year or so. How should investors monitor the success for -- of M&amp;A for Cognizant? Especially because M&amp;A is such a wildcard in IT services more broadly. It has worked really well for some of your peers, but for some of your peers, it hasn't.</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. Look, in this business, it's a people business. So when you're looking at acquisitions, a lot of it really does come down to the people. And can you integrate that acquisition effectively into your culture? When we do acquisitions, we are doing acquisitions to drive growth. And our intent is that we are able to help the acquired company grow faster, and they are able to help us grow faster in the space that they are in. And it's always comes down to a build versus buy decision. And so with acquisitions, we're looking to really attain talent, first and foremost. And so we spend a lot of time thinking about that cultural fit with the talent. And it doesn't always mean that we're going to impose the Cognizant culture on the acquisition. A lot of times, particularly with the digital acquisitions, we're looking to take some of their culture and bring it to Cognizant in terms of how we think about work and engagement with employees and clients and so forth. But is there a good fit there between the 2 organizations, where we know we can synergistically come together to make us better as a whole? And that's really the key for us when we think about these.</p><p>Also, when you're buying smaller companies, which tends to be more of the acquisitions in our industry, we also assume that these are founder-led companies. The founder themselves, hopefully, is a true entrepreneur, and we'll probably need to go do their next deal. And so you're looking at that next layer of management, and those are the folks who are really going to be able to grow with our organization and to sustain the value from the acquisition. So there's a lot of things that go into looking at these deals and which ones will make sense and which ones won't.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And just switching gears a little bit, Karen. One of the most frequently asked questions I receive in Cognizant is balancing revenue growth with profitability. Can you have both, especially with this urgent need for reinvestment in the business?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: So I think it's a balance, and you give way to make decisions. But I think, first and foremost, this is still a growth market, particularly when we think about digital. And so you want to make sure that you are equipped to take advantage of that and to gain market share, which is certainly our first priority. I think you can manage to a balance of reasonable margins. So I don't intend in any way to suggest that we will get to mid-20% on the margins. It's not our intention. Certainly not when we see this kind of opportunity for growth over the next few years. But I think it's possible to have reasonable margins and also drive strong growth and certainly better growth than we had last year.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And let's talk about the recent ransomware attack, Karen. You -- I think it was very thoughtful color you gave on the earnings call around the near-term impact that you foresee. What's the long-term impact that we can expect from this? You talked about, so the legal and security costs for the remainder of the year, but is there any impact on reputational damage or litigation compliance that we should think about?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. I think it's a bit early to say on that. Clearly, our focus, first and foremost, was to bring all of our systems back up and ensure that we were able to support the clients that we have today, which we've been able to do. Certainly, as I think about the pipeline of deals right now, it continues to be strong. We've had 1 or 2 companies that we're concerned about, proposals, RFPs that they hit underway. But as far as I know, they've all agreed to keep us in the process. Now they may choose to go with us or not down the road, I think, that's really to be seen. It is likely that there could be some reputational damage, but at this point, we haven't really seen any significant evidence of that.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And then, Karen, we talked about many different aspects of turnaround for Cognizant. What do you think, more broadly, are the biggest risks as you execute your growth plan over the next few years?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: We're making big bets in areas that we believe are relevant to clients' agenda. And I think making sure we continue to invest enough in those areas of focus for us that we stay in touch with clients, right? First and foremost, we can't presume we know what's on clients' minds unless we're out talking to clients. And so I think always engaging with clients and partners in those conversations about where are we investing, what are the different solutions that we are planning to build to bring to market is really key, making sure we have access to the right talent, and that our folks on the ground to our sales teams, our client partners who are really our front line with our clients have the skill set they need to have the business conversations, which is most important today, right? While technology is a component of the solution, first and foremost, these are business problems that our clients are trying to solve. And so if we don't have the right relationships within the senior ranks of our clients and have people who have the ability to have the right business conversations, then obviously, it's harder to get a seat at the table. So those are all things we're very aware of and have been focused on investing in, but I think that's where we need to keep our focus at all times.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And then what aspects about Cognizant's business, do you think, Karen, is the most underappreciated by investors right now?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: So I think, certainly, some of our digital capability and the innovation that our teams are able to drive. And I don't think that's just an issue with investors. I think that was an issue with clients that Brian realized when came in, that we had all this great work going on but we weren't doing a great job of showcasing it to clients. So I think, first and foremost, it's been that. I also think there is just such a sense of this company when it's faced with a challenge, being able to come together to overcome. And we've seen this time and time again, whenever there's, what I call real challenges in the world, so whether it was the Chennai floods back in 2015 or the COVID situation and even the ransomware situation where this team and our -- particularly, our account teams just never lose sight of our customers. And that our job is to be here to serve and help our customers. And the passion and the energy and the collaboration that comes together, when we're faced with a challenge, until you see it, I don't think people can really appreciate it. But it's really quite remarkable to watch when it comes into action.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: And Karen, we're almost running out of time. So my final question for you is, as you think through and beyond this pandemic, how do you expect your priorities to shift, especially as it relates to cutting costs or increasing levels of investments?</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Yes. So I think we really want to protect the investments we're making. So both inorganic and organic acquisitions or investments, we are continuing with the sales hiring that we had underway at the beginning of the quarter. As we talked about on our earnings call, we will protect digital resources. So even if, for some reason, we have digital talent that becomes unutilized during this time frame, assuming that they have the right skills and capabilities and so forth, we will protect that talent for the recovery.</p><p>On the cost side of the business, we are continuing with our Fit for Growth program. And as we have said, most of those resources would be exited by the middle of the year, we're still on track for that. Lost a little bit of time in April, but we think we're still generally on track with that timing. And then if the bench grows beyond the levels that we think are reasonable for maintaining good utilization rates and what we see in terms of the demand environment, as we said, we will manage the bench. We've put in place some voluntary programs. So for folks who come to the bench, we do have a voluntary separation package that people can avail of if they want to or they could stay on the bench and follow the normal bench policies. But that's really focused on skills that we think are fairly reasonably and easy to replace in the marketplace. So for skills that are harder to find in the marketplace, we will retain that talent as best we can, but there are certain skills in the market that we all understand are easier to find at any point in time. And so those are the folks that would be on the bench.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: I think that's about all the time we have. For those of you who are listening in, please complete the Procensus poll and you will have immediate access to the poll results. And thank you very much, Karen, for the great discussion today. Thank you, everyone, for listening in.</p><p>KAREN A. MCLOUGHLIN: Thank you very much. Take care.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT: You too.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, CNN announced a bombshell that Michael Cohen said President  Trump knew about that meeting between his son and a Russian claiming to  have dirt on Hillary.  Something as rare as air.  It was one of a thousand  final nails in the coffin of Trump's presidency.  But then, Lanny Davis,  Hillary's creepy fixer, who's now defending Trump's creepy fixer, figure  that out, says it's creepy client didn't have such info, which is odd since  now it's revealed that creepy Davis was the anonymous creepy source who  supplied creepy CNN with that creepy info that the network then milked to  death while lecturing us on ethics.  So CNN is in a creepy pickle.  There  source for their biggest story of the year is giving us the creeps.  So  you're following this?  Which I wasn't.  I need to run my soul through a  car wash after all this.  </p><p>Unlike the rest of the media who eat this stuff up no matter the sourcing.   They're like a drunk frat boy at 3 AM.  They'll eat a pop tart off the  floor as long as there's ketchup.  So when Avenatti comes knocking, CNN  shrieks like Bieber fans with backstage passes, and why?  Only because it  perpetuates a story that the media can't stop feeding on.  Two years ago,  they were gorging on electing Trump.  Now they gorge on impeaching him.   Avenatti, Cohen, and Davis, three square meals the media devours daily.   But gluttony is a sin, no wonder they all seem so dumb and slow.  And  what's called reporting now is just rumor, spoon-fed from creep seeking  money, power, or fame.  I wish I could ignore them all, but what is it that  that guy keeps saying?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Long week?  Relax with a glass and let's get after it.   Lots to figure out.  What do you say?  Let's get after it.  It's going to  us two hours to do it, so what do you say?  Let's get after it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Let's get after it.  I've got something better.  How about let's  get accurate?  This is an amazing, blockbuster story, Kilmeade.  I want you  to try to get your head around it.  I know it might be tough for you  because you're working all the time.  But this is CNN's source  contradicting what they said to CNN, so somebody is lying.  Do you think  this will be on Michael Stelter's reliable sources?  </p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:  I say they rather have a test pattern to  put this on his reliable sources.  Lanny Davis is also a crisis expert.   That's where he wrote a book on.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>KILMEADE:  So here his crisis.  How do I solve the crisis?  Take  responsibility for it.  I'll take the heat and I can handle it.  He also  said the reporting got mixed up through the cross of the criminal  investigation.  No, that didn't work.  I made a mistake.  I did not mean to  be cute.  Never was.  Says he didn't lie to CNN.  He unintentionally  misspoke.  Said he, his instinct -- his instinct --this is what he said  about what Cohen knows.  His instinct was that his client might have  something to say about Mueller, about hacking, but he shouldn't have said  anything.  That is your lawyer.  This is nothing to do with Cohen.  It's  all about Hillary Clinton and Lanny Davis.  Cohen doesn't come up.  </p><p>So the question is, is he worried that Michael Cohen put his hand on the  bible and swore that he was telling the truth and said he had nothing to do  with this -- that Trump knew nothing about this Trump Tower situation.  And  when he came out and says now he knows, then Cohen suddenly looks as though  he created -- he committed perjury, so then he had to backtrack?  Or did he  just make it up and Michael Cohen said you're doing a really bad job.  I  know I'm not paying you, but you can't make things up.  There's more to  this story.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, you know -- OK, Dana, I want to stick to the CNN thing  because why not?  It's fun.  That was a natulite 26 story.  CNN said Lanny  Davis didn't make any comment on that.  So, this is from Glenn Greenwald.   I'm actually quoting a Glenn Greenwald article.  But, no.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: . but he's right.  CNN says Lanny Davis refused to comment, so  either CNN lied to its audience about Davis, or Davis is lying now.  </p><p>PERINO:  Or they were -- or they're protecting -- they were trying to  protect him at the time.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>PERINO: . to protect their source and say it wasn't that why people do  disagree with using background sources.  But in a case -- a situation like  this, then you're dealing with people's lives, including the president in  terms of their future judicial or legal problems, then people do leak and  they do speak on background.  The other thing that's happening here is you  have both camps trying to advance their story with the media on background  trying to be cute.  Then they go on the record.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>PERINO: . on cable news and they get a little bit crossed wide.  But I  believe CNN says they're sticking with the story.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, they are.</p><p>PERINO:  Because maybe they have another source that told them that the  story is true.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  And who could that source be?  Is there another lawyer that we're  missing out on?  </p><p>PERINO:  Probably</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, some other guy.  Tammy, if this were -- this would be -- if  this were on the other side, this would be yet another smoking gun.</p><p>TAMMY Bruce, FOX NEWS HOST:  Sure.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But the media doesn't see this as anything special.  </p><p>BRUCE:  No, and they're going to make it go away.  But, of course, this is  why when the president says fake news, everybody goes nuts.  This is  exactly what he's talking about, the use of an individual.  And this is  almost -- on the theory like too good to check, right?  That they get what  they need from their source to move several days with a huge story at the  time -- it was another nail in the thousand nails, as you've noted.  And  then they get that mileage and they figure that that's all that they need  and that they gin this up in this way, and then it just goes away.  It  floats away.  But the viewers know it.  CNN is now losing their programs to  things like Ancient Aliens.  So, obviously, Ancient Aliens doing things  that CNN won't do and can't do.  So this is what the president complains  about.  It's what you see the crowds at the rallies, you know, yelling at  CNN about.  It hurts not just Cohen and this entire process legally but how  media is viewed again.  It's another nail in a coffin, but it's not  President Trump.  It's a legacy media and what they're willing to do.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Juan, I'm just severely disappointed in the whole legal world  right now.  Aren't you saddened?  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Of the legal world?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.  These lawyers are just terrible, Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Giuliani, yeah, I would agree.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm way, way, way, in disagreement with all of you on this one  because it seems to me like you're in the weeds and you're just playing out  this tired theme of, oh, the right wing hates the elite mainstream media.   This is not a big story in terms of CNN says they're standing by their  story.  They say they have corroboration for the story.  They've had every  opportunity to say, hey, we made a mistake.  In addition to which,  remember, CNN fired reporters when reporters got an earlier story about  Trump wrong.  So I would think that people on the right would say, huh, CNN  is not firing anybody in this case.  They're not backing off.  And the one  who is saying that he did something wrong is Lanny Davis.  Lanny Davis is a  stand-up guy here and saying, hey. </p><p>KILMEADE:  Stand-up guy?  He made stuff up about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  And then he lied about it.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He said he was speculating, Brian.  And he has acknowledged that  he was wrong.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that, right?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that he was speculating?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what he said.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm just saying if you want to know the important story here,  the important story was when Cohen stood up in court and implicated the  president in an illegal payoff of a porn star.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But when everyone involved is lying at some point.  Look, if you  see a crowd of people who are lying at some point about a variety of  issues, and then you got a guy who's been threatened with life in prison  but pledging that he knows something, no wonder people don't take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He was in court.  He had -- he put his -- I mean, he could be in  jail.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Don't liberals all the time argue that people will say -- and  they'll confess to things they've never done before simply because of the  pressure by law enforcement?  </p><p>PERINO:  Can I just make one point though, several times and I think Maggie  Haberman reporting the New York Times, at least twice, stories broken,  legal camp on the president side had said not true.  Or the president even  -- fake news or spokesmen said not true.  Then five or six months later you  turn -- oh, it actually is true.  So I think that the media is being played  a little bit but both sides on the legal side of things.  It's difficult to  try these cases on the court of public.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But, you know what?  The thing is there's one side that  definitely wants their story to be true, so they're willing to pay -- play  more fast and loose.  Can we talk about Bruce Ohr?  Is that not a story,  the former DOJ guy who's testifying in a closed door hearing over his  relations with Christopher Steele, the spy who tried to bring Trump down  with that dossier.  This -- in my opinion, this is a pretty, damn, big  story.  He's pushing the dossier created by Fusion GPS, where his wife  works, and then he says he feared of being exposed by this when Comey got  fired.  This is -- I mean, we make fun of the phrase deep state, but this  ain't shallow state.  </p><p>PERINO:  Which is why he's testifying behind closed doors.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right.  Which I think both sides want now because they feel as  though not enough gets done when they're out in public, although I think  Peter Strzok exposing his demeanor, his smugness goes a long way  understanding what goes on -- what was really going on behind closed doors.   This is what Catherine Herridge has told us so far.  She did a great job  standing outside.  So, Bruce Ohr, according to Darrell Issa, his memory is  in-perfect, but he does say he's never had a case like this in 20 years.   He goes on to say when they're caught lying, Simpson said, the first time,  Glenn Simpson who owns Fusion GPS, where Bruce Ohr's wife works, said the  first time that I was dealing with Bruce Ohr was at thanksgiving.  The  problem is there's email exchanges that shows they'd been communicating  since August.  Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, and Glenn Simpson all contradict each  other.  And there's no way that that should be allowed if you're trying to  do an investigation.  And if the FBI or Department of Justice was doing  this investigation, they would not be tolerating this.  So they've got to  get all three out there in front of us and tried to contradict each other.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And you know what we're seeing here is the weaponising, as we've  discussed, of the federal law enforcement framework against a presidential  election and a presidential nominee, a candidate, which is what they  wanted, which was an insurance policy to keep something from happening.  So  when you look at that -- and this is another -- it's a blessing for  conservatives everywhere.  Particular communities in this country talk  about law enforcement, framing people, making up evidence, targeting  individuals to get them -- deciding that the ends justifies the means, and  a lot of people who don't go through that experience say, oh, that could  never really happen.  We're now seeing it happen at a federal level.  So  it's an education for all of us.  Not just at that level but at the local  level as well when it comes to what law enforcement is willing to do.  And  the cleanup that has to happen around the country for all of us just when  it comes to who we trust and whether or not we're going to really take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  So, in other words -- so you're just happy defaming the FBI, the  Justice Department, anybody that's questioning President Trump.  This is  the story again.  So here we are.  Oh, this means that there's nothing,  nothing that the president has done wrong.  President Trump is a victim.   This is madness.  I mean, you have to ignore the facts on the ground.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  We're just reporting the story about this guy.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  You have to ignore the fact that Bruce Ohr is an  expert on Russia.  You have to ignore the fact that therefore people like  Christopher Steele would be going to Bruce Ohr and saying, hey, guess what,  Sally Yates just got tossed.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan, you should be upset too, because all these corruptions and  all of these back-and-forth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What corruption?</p><p>BRUCE:  And Bruce Ohr saying we're going to get caught, that obscures any  legitimate investigation that people may be would have wanted.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  All I know is.</p><p>BRUCE:  Because this becomes the story.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me just say, I think we had the president going after Jeff  Sessions, his own Republican attorney general.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Who recused himself.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He's not doing anything.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  So he's going after Rod Rosenstein.  He's going after  the FBI.  Who else -- who isn't he going after?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  All I can say is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just look at this.  Juan, just look at this.  Nobody said Donald  Trump is playing the perfect game so far.  All we're saying is look at the  text messages and the exchanges.  Look at the facts.  You should be as  outraged as anybody.  And then, pick your time when Trump is out of control  and say this is out of control.  But this is not Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  You know what?  Feels like this Ohr is in hot water.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Republicans warning voters about what will happen if Nancy Pelosi  becomes speaker again.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO:  The Trump effect being put to the test again in key primaries  today.  Trump backed Congressman Ron Desantis is trying to secure the  Republican nomination to replace outgoing Florida Governor Rick Scott.  And  Scott is looking to wrap up the GOP senate nodded with a big boost from  Trump.  And in Arizona, it's a senate Republican primary featuring three  candidates who are all strongly behind the president's agenda.  In the  backdrop of tonight races, a major warning sign for Republican midterm  voters.  GOP lawmakers are circulating a list of potential issues Democrats  may investigate if they retake the house.  Will this threat helped turn out  the base?  </p><p>The list is pretty amazing.  It's basically of all the list that the house  Democrats have sent requesting hearings on such issues as President Trump's  tax returns, President Trump's family business, the payment to Stormy  Daniels, James Comey's firing, cabinet secretary travel, the travel ban,  family separation, on and on.  It's basically, pretty much, nothing else  would get done except for investigations, if this were to actually happen.   So the Republicans -- sometimes, Tammy, you have to scare your base into  turning out.  </p><p>BRUCE:  You do.  And yet, this is pretty much what people want to do.   They're still talking about impeachment even though some people are saying,  well, that's not really a good idea.  Even Adam Schiff the other day said,  well, we really can't really talk about that right now.  But if President  Trump is everything they say he is.  I mean, he's Hitler.  He's carrying  babies away from moms.  Why wouldn't you want to?  Why suddenly if he's the  worst guy in the world but then you really don't want to investigate  anything or you don't want to impeach him.  And so that's what we're  looking at.  And these are serious things that the Democrats have been  running on and have been talking to their base about.  And we can expect  them to do it partly because they don't want to govern.  That's been a big  problem with Democrats.  They gin up the bases, they get people all  excited, but they don't want to govern.  And this.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Where did you get that from?  </p><p>BRUCE:  From the last eight years with Barack Obama.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  Oh, please, are you kidding?  I think  Republicans, in fact, thought that he -- it was overreaching, doing too  much, and had to obstruct him.  I could go on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Bill Clinton governed.  And that's why that administration, even  with impeachment, worked because he enjoyed the process.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think -- look, I think, just seriously, Dana has a point here  about who's stirring up the base.  That this is an action being taken by  Republicans right now to say if you allow Democrats to take control of the  house, we are going to lose President Trump because he may be impeached.   And they see this, and I think rightly, as stirring up the GOP base because  it's so strongly pro-Trump.  And that those people then will turn out and  not turn off, given all the bad news that Trump is experiencing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  So stirring up the base though -- let's go back to this because  telling the truth can actually stir up the base.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  And I like how the Democrats are pretending that they  aren't really interested impeachment.  That's like a teenager trying to  sneak a bottle of booze outside the house -- outside the house in front of  their parents.  Oh, no, it's just a water bottle.  We know the Democrats  are waiting to spring this on if they get the house.  They're playing this  down so they can then raise it when they can.  So I do believe telling --  telling the truth can be stirring the base, by the way.  Democrats stir the  base by painting Trump is Hitler.  You know as.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, she said separating children from their parents.  Boy, I  think that's true.  Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Stirring the base.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about this?  Democrats want to do away with ICE, how about  that?  Oh, yeah, they want to do away with ICE. </p><p>PERINO:  The point about family separation policy, there're already was a  hearing about that.  And so.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And then we'll have to deal with Barack Obama's establishment of  it, and the fact that.  </p><p>PERINO:  The other thing is that the Democrats -- you know, they're finding  out that some of their fringe on the left that come up with ideas like  abolishing ICE, and it's not just the fringe, some mainstream Democrats as  well.  It's not going over so well.  There was a poll taken by A.P., 57  percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, but the number that don't  -- there's only 18 percent of Democrats favor dismantling this, Ok?  So  they're having to answer questions for things that their left, far left is  suggesting.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But some of that -- high profile people are saying it.  Bernie  Sanders, Gillibrand, and they're the ones saying it.  And you can just say  OK.  You deal with it because it's not somebody writing this and they're  not putting their name on it, these are major speeches given in front of  major audiences to get a loud round of applause.  The Democrats who have  been successful in the special election, he's the close the gap or walk  away with the win are the ones who are in the middle that still clearly  criticize Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian, you want to get rid of the Ice Capades, which I think is  heartless.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Why do you feel that way about the Ice Capades?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  The Ice Capades, I feel like it never ends.  There's no  beginning and there's no end.  I feel like.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And by the way, there's no scoring either at Ice Capades.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Crickets scares me.</p><p>PERINO:  All right, up next, President Trump with a new warning for Google  after claiming the company is silencing conservatives, up next.</p><p>GUTFELD:  What is a Capades?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  President Trump going after Google this morning on twitter,  accusing the tech giant of being politically biased against conservatives.   The president claims searched results are, quote, rigged, end quote,  against him and other Republicans as well to suppress any good news about  the Trump presidency.  Now, the president doubling down this very  afternoon. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Yeah, I think  Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a  very serious thing and it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and  what others are doing, if you look at what's going-on on twitter, if you  look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you  can't do that to people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Google firing back saying its searches don't promote a political  agenda.  So what do you think?  </p><p>BRUCE:  Look, we have a history with all of the social media, and Facebook  is also mentioned as a very good example.  Remember their trending stories  column that they said was the trending news of the day based on their  algorithms.  And then we realize that there was no real conservative sites,  there's no conservative stories, there was nothing pro-conservative, and  former editors came out and said that they routinely suppressed  conservative news, things that conservatives would make them look good or  would be of interest to conservatives, and then they had to eventually  shutdown that entire framework.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me pick up on this and ask you a question.  Much of it has  to do, according to Google, with the idea that if you are searching  something they give you what they call accredited sites like big newspapers  that they have a sense of trust in their content as opposed to giving them  simply opinionated sites that are likely tilted.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But that's the problem is that when you're liberal and you see a  liberal side, that is the one that is legitimate to you, and you're going  to view an opposing website in a different way because you don't agree with  it.  So if you're going to rank certain websites, you're going to rank them  based on whether or not it looks like real life to you.  That, look, if  you're a liberal or a conservative, you're not going to look at your own  material as being biased because it's what you also believe.  And this is  why when you've got 80 percent -- 85 percent of American media identifies  effectively as liberal, as not conservative, and then you're going to have  a Google determine which sites are going to be more legitimate, they're  going to rate more legitimate the sites that they agree with that looks  like their worldview.  And automatically.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What about -- and it seems to me like saying there's no truth,  there's no fact, there's no accurate news coverage in the country, so you  just give me liberal opinion or give me conservative opinions.  Is that  we're saying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, I think they're talking about -- this is the hottest issue  in the country and there's no easy answer.  This is the stem cell research  of our generation, of this decade, because everyone thinks social media is  the problem for their own reasons.  I don't necessarily have the reason but  Amazon, Google, Facebook, and twitter, they have to -- we have to come up  with something that will work.  I think, fundamentally, they actually want  to get it to work.  I think there's legitimate criticisms of those sites.   My frustration is when -- for example, CEO Jack Dorsey comes to Capitol  Hill to go in front of the energy committee on September 5th, next week, is  there going to be anyone who's an expert to be able to ask him the types of  questions.  They're going to move the conversation forward or we going to  see a bunch.  </p><p>PERINO:  So you think those hearings are unsatisfying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Well, I know you're being sarcastic.  But we need somebody in  the middle that is unbiased to say here's an idea of what to do because  lawmakers who belong to a party are not capable of coming up with an  answer.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  By the way, Brian, Larry Kudlow said today, well, he's looking  at the possibility of regulating them.  And I think. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I don't know where you start?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  But that is so shocking to me that he would  suggest that the government now. </p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow, I mean, he's a free-market guy and  conservatives typically are not for more regulation.  I would add that --  1:40 PM today, before the Daily Briefings, I checked Google News --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Your show.</p><p>PERINO:  -- to see what was there.  And the No. 1 story was a CNN story  about debunking a Trump myth of some sort.  A CNN Money story was about how  Google is rigged against conservatives, based on the president's tweet.   And the third story was the FOX News story about Tiger Woods.  And I think  we're going to talk about that later.  </p><p>So I think that there's -- there's a lot of room for this algorithm to be  manipulated.  And all of these sites are privately-held companies.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And they're powerful.</p><p>PERINO:  But they also would say to you, \"It doesn't make sense for us to  alienate half of the country\" when they're trying to make money.  Remember,  it was Michael Jordan said Republicans buy shoes, too.  So they're going to  try to make a free-market argument next week.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Greg, so I was surprised to see that the president's going  after Google.  He had a bad week, and I guess he does his rage Googling --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That was last week.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- and says, \"Oh, my God.  Look at -- they've got negative  stories here from New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.\" </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"I don't like these stories.  Give me some conservative thing.\"  But here's Trump back in July.  He says the European Union is fining  Google, and they're one of America's greatest companies.  </p><p>PERINO:  Oh, right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But today, it's a different story.  </p><p>PERINO:  That's right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  I mean, it surprises you Trump changes his opinion?  I mean, it's  been going on for two years.  I think what Google is guilty of, everyone  else in the media.  They're chasing words and not deeds.  </p><p>The deeds are good news.  We have an 18-year high in optimism right now.   That's not being reported.  If you want onto Google and Googled Mexican  trade, you would've gotten the top stories about the awkward phone call.   You wouldn't have gotten the Mexican trade story.  </p><p>And he's just like us.  He Googles his name, and he gets mad when there's  bad news.  If you Google \"Kilmeade,\" the first thing --</p><p>KILMEADE:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>GUTFELD:  -- you're going to get is \"hairpiece.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right, right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But don't Google Kilmeade and hairpiece, because then you'll see  what happens.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, but 99 percent of the stuff on us is negative.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, yes, yes.  And I'm used to it.</p><p>And if you look at Google Doodles, which I love.  You know, instead of  Easter, they'll have an activist.  Instead of Christmas, they'll do some  kind of festival.  Instead of Burning Man -- I mean, they'll do Burning Man  instead of Lou Dobbs's birthday.  They're the king of virtue signaling.  </p><p>You ask, like, why would you alienate half the conversation?  It's to keep  activists at bay.  They would rather alienate half a population than have  somebody come after them and say, \"You're bigoted.  You're sexist.  You're  racists.\"</p><p>They need to do a Google search on wisdom.  Because right now, what they're  doing is they're helping China in their A.I.   Correct?  But they are  leaving -- they want to leave helping the military and making more precise  drones that actually save lives.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK, I've got a question for you about Alex Jones.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Because we know that some of these sites pushed Alex Jones and  his conspiracy theories off on the idea that it's hate speech.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Why wouldn't you want to support that, Greg? </p><p>GUTFELD:  I think Alex Jones is hate speech.  It's the same way I feel  about Louis Farrakhan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK.  ESPN melting down --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Where is he?  On Twitter wearing a bowtie.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- over Tiger Woods's refusal to criticize President Trump.  The  growing controversy -- you heard Dana reference it -- when we return.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you say to people who might find it interesting  that you have, I guess, a friendly relationship with him?  </p><p>TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER:  Well, he's our -- he's the president of  the United States.  And you have to respect the office, and no matter who's  in the office.  You may like, dislike personality or the politics.  But we  all must respect the office.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KILMEADE:  But he's done that.  What was wrong with that answer?  ESPN  host, though, hears that answer and thinks Tiger Woods bailed out.  They  are teeing off on Tiger Woods, refusing to take the reporters bait and  criticized President Trump or complement President Trump.  So they start  lashing out against Tiger Woods because he wouldn't lash out against the  president.  For example.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, ESPN CO-HOST, \"FIRST TAKE\":  Tiger Woods is being -- you  said, being slick.  Here, he is being slick.  He says we must respect the  office.  Therefore, that confers respect to the occupant.  Tiger, is that  what you're saying?  If that's what you're saying, that is a stupid  comment.  I don't -- but I don't even know if he believes that that's when  he said.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, first of all, we don't know what Tiger Woods  believes.  He's camblination (ph); he's not black.  When he was arrested,  he was black.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Stephen Hayes Smith is one of the brighter people on television.   I would love to hear him long form.  But Max Kellerman thinks it's just  unthinkable, Dana, that Tiger Woods would--</p><p>PERINO:  Respect the office of the president?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  -- respect the office.  And he probably likes President Trump in  golf has his holes together (ph).</p><p>PERINO:  I thought -- well, all people sports, who play sports, athletes,  thank you.  Looking for the word.  They are going to -- thank you for the  word -- are going to be asked questions about President Trump, because  reporters can't help themselves.  And they're always trying to figure out a  way, how can can they make headlines?  How can they make news?</p><p>The only way to make news, apparently, is the world today is if you ask  somebody how they feel about President Trump, even if that has nothing to  do about their golf game.  </p><p>What I thought is that Tiger Woods knew that a question like that was  probably coming.  And I took it as a sincere genuine answer of how he feels  about the presidency of the United States.  And I think that ESPN, they can  do whatever they want on their show.  But Tiger Woods was prepared for that  question.  But it wasn't like he was reading somebody else's talking  points.  I think he believed it.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Max Kellerman is a virtue-signaling jackass, and here's evidence.   Would he have said that to Jim Brown last week?  Would he have said it to  Jim Brown, you know?  Because Jim Brown would have wiped the floor with  him.  He would have gone to the studio, so he did it because he thought he  could get away with it.  </p><p>This is the problem with injecting politics into bodies that do not have an  immune system for it.  So when you inject politics into sports, sports gets  sick.  When you inject politics into the entertainment world, the  entertainment gets world -- the entertainment world gets sick.  When you  inject politics into academia, what do you get?  You get a poison, toxic  campus.  Whenever you put politics, it gets sick, except on \"The Five.\"   Because we are real.  </p><p>PERINO:  When you put sports -- inject sports into me, I get sick, because  I can't even come up with the word \"athlete.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Put it this way.  If people know President Trump, they have a  different opinion of President Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Tell us about it, Brian.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Mike Tyson knows him.  Dennis Rodman knows him.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Herschel Walker knows him.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just be jotting this down.  Tim Scott got a chance to spend a  lot of time with him.  And guess what?  So did Tiger Woods?</p><p>So Jim Brown joined us this morning on \"FOX &amp; Friends.\"  He is getting  blowback in the black community --</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  -- for saying \"I like President Trump.  I think he's doing a  decent job.\"  Listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JIM BROWN, NFL HALL OF FAME:  The greatest thing about America is that we  all have our opinions and our thoughts.  Nobody is totally correct in  everything that they do.  I have access to the president; and any time I  have access to the president and he will listen to my thoughts, that's all  I can ask of him.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And that's all that he said: \"I have access to the president.\"   That's just like Kanye West: \"I have access, and therefore, I want to be\" - - what'd he say, Yeezy?</p><p>KILMEADE:  You didn't hear the whole thing, but he does say he liked what  he's doing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  More than Obama gave them.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  But you know, what's interesting about the Tiger Woods thing is  Tiger Woods was asked, \"So what about the politics, then?  If you say you  respect the office.\"  </p><p>And by the way, Max Kellerman, he was right when he said this was a slick  move that allowed him to say, \"I respect the office\" without saying, \"Well,  what do you think about this president?\" </p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm sorry?</p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What's the right answer?</p><p>KILMEADE:  He respects the office of the president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not -- that's not an answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Why isn't it?</p><p>PERINO:  Why not?  That's a great answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's perfect</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me tell you why.  It's like saying you respect X, Y, Z.  And  you saying, \"I respect X, Y, G but not -- let's not talk about X, Y, Z.\"   Here's what he said.  He said, \"I just finished 72 holes, and I'm really  hungry.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  At the end.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Does that sound like a kid who's trying to get away from  --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He's 43, and it's the fifth follow-up.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's a big boy, and in this era, President Trump, not the  athletes, have made the issue.  President Trump has gone after NFL players,  who are protesting.  He's gone after Stephen Curry, LeBron James.  Shut up  and dribble?  Because why?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He didn't say that.  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's always saying that these -- </p><p>KILMEADE:  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- people --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He said they're not going to the Oval Office.  Don't bother.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- they don't want anything to do with him for a very real  reason.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CO-HOST:  There is one reason why this is happening.  The  latest poll, 36 percent of African-Americans support the president --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, please.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- because their economy is better.  Lowest unemployment rate in  history for African-Americans.  The future is brighter again.  They're  realizing that the conservative ideal is worthwhile and should be  considered.  They're hearing other African-Americans they like, like Kanye  West, say, \"Wait a minute.  Maybe we should be thinking about things.\"  </p><p>Tiger Woods and others are not conforming, and that's what they expect of  the gay community, African-Americans, women.  Even if your lives are  better, you will be punished if you say that's OK, because that's all they  have left.  That's Tiger Woods's crime, apparently.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not.  Tiger Woods plays a game.  </p><p>BRUCE:  He likes the presidency and the president, and African-American  lives are better under this president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  This is such a cheap argument about  unemployment rates.  Let me just say, Tiger Woods plays the game.</p><p>BRUCE:  The lowest unemployment rate in history is a cheap argument? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That is a cheap argument.  That's ridiculous.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  If you were saying to me, \"Oh, you know what?\"</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"President Trump is now about lowering black unemployment so  that it matches white unemployment.  Or President Obama [SIC] -- President  Trump is doing something\" --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Going after MS-13.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \" -- to encourage job training.\"  No, he's not doing any of  that.  </p><p>Here's what Tiger Woods is about.  Tiger Woods realizes that his sponsors  and the people who play golf, generally white, maybe Republican.  And he is  not taking the risk of speaking truth to power.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- you're just projecting what you think Tiger Woods is  thinking.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, I don't know what he thinks.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Mind reading.</p><p>KILMEADE:  I project this.  He's known him for 15, 20 years, and likes him.   I'll project that.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And we all seem to recall --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's probably a better idea.  </p><p>PERINO:  He also -- I didn't have a chance to talk.  He also has to -- a  responsibility to himself and to his business and to --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There we go.</p><p>PERINO:  So look, if I were his P.R. advisor and I anticipated that  question, I'm like, that is a great answer.  You might get dinged on ESPN,  but if you want to focus, you really want to make a comeback in golf,  you've got to focus on this and not allow a distraction with politics.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like, politics in other arenas, sucks.  Politics kills  everything.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  All right.  So I guess Greg gets the last word.  Meanwhile,  coming up straight ahead, keeping a room cold is apparently now sexist.   That story is next.  Please gradually zoom out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  All right, everybody.  Cries of sexism in the New York  gubernatorial race, not about politics but about room temperature.  </p><p>Cynthia Nixon's team is accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being sexist for  trying to debate in a chilly room when they face off tomorrow night.  </p><p>Turns out this is a battle many Americans face.  A recent survey says 43  percent of coworkers have clashed --</p><p>KILMEADE:  To battle.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- over being too hot or too cold in the workplace.  </p><p>Obviously, Cynthia Nixon is Goldilocks.  Look, if she can't handle a room  temperature properly, how can she handle being in a variety of different  rooms, dealing with politicians, et cetera?  Greg, I'm sure you might have  something to say about that.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  She -- she wants 76 degrees in a packed auditorium? </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's freezing.</p><p>GUTFELD:  If you take the body heat of the -- you're going to put it into  the 80s, and they are going to despise her.  </p><p>By the way, this is -- it is a fact.  This is a biological difference among  many.  And if you deny it, you're a science denier.  We all have -- we have  different metabolic rates.  So men actually can handle, I guess, the cold  better.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Women are hotter.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  That will -- that will end up somewhere.  Take it out of context  and put it on a blog.  There you go.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think it's good news for you, Brian.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Also, Dana, we -- men and women dress differently in the office.   You know?</p><p>PERINO:  I'm freezing every day, so I would give her a little tip.  In my  mug is hot water.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  No, but that's a good idea.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  If I drank rum, that would be a good idea.  It's hot water.  I  hold my cup and it's hot; and then I get -- I don't have to complain too  much about how freezing it is.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But is it sexist?  That's the problem.  Is it sexist?</p><p>PERINO:  No, it's not.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Is it sexist.</p><p>PERINO:  Remember Charlie Crist in Florida?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  And he was going to have a debate.  And one of the big demands is  that he had to have a fan at all times. </p><p>GUTFELD:  And where was the fan?</p><p>PERINO:  Underneath the podium.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  It was right at an odd level.  It was the strangest thing.  </p><p>PERINO:  Yes, it's a very strange thing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like a fan --</p><p>PERINO:  And that is not sexist.  That is just a demand.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, because there's a reality here.  There's a political  reality that if you go back, I think it's the 1960 campaign with  Nixon/Kennedy.  That they had a debate, and Nixon -- Nixon starts to pop  sweat.</p><p>GUTFELD:  So she wants him to sweat.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And he looks terrible on TV.  He looks like he's fleeing a crime  scene.  </p><p>BRUCE:  They have to adjusts, but these days, everything either --  everything has to be sexist.  But when you're running -- when our argument  is, is that we are the same; women can do what men do.  But now everything  has to be adjusted because we can't handle a room temperature? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, no.  That's not what they're saying.  They're saying --  she's saying that she wants to eliminate his demand that it be freezing.   And he has said he likes a cold environment.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  In the past, but the thing is, it's like boxing, Juan.</p><p>BRUCE:  And she wants it at 76.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're a boxing fan.  If you're the champion, you get to pick  the ring, the venue.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what she said.  She said CBS, the local CBS, the  affiliate here in New York, negotiated exclusively with him.  Because she  wanted several debates.  She's only getting one debate on his terms.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Because he's -- he's leading.  And he doesn't even really need to  do it, because he's ahead.  But thank you for man-splaining that for me.  </p><p>Yes, I mean, this is -- this is what you're going to see, and this is what  we want.  I want women to run for office, but we don't want it to all be  about sexism.  </p><p>PERINO:  I do want it to be comfortable in the room.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But 76 isn't even comfortable.  Right?  I mean, she's asking -- </p><p>PERINO:  No, see it depends.  Like, at 75, I'm cold.  At 76, I'm hot.  So  it's, like, 75.5 would be perfect.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Do you want to talk about sexism, though?  Think about all of the  men who built buildings, who built the buildings that people actually use,  who risked their lives on girders in the 1960s and the 1970s, who built the  bridges.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And then blew the money on the track.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Or if the -- oh, no, they fell.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  They fell.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Brooklyn Bridge, look at the numbers of people who died on the  Brooklyn Bridge.  </p><p>BRUCE:  All the men who made things possible and now women can help make  them possible, too.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  There you go.</p><p>BRUCE:  Coming up, \"One More Thing\" is coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"OMT\" -- Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Gregory, you know what?  Dreams do come true. </p><p>GUTFELD:  No, they don't.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And sometimes in doubles.  Yes, because that's what happened for  Sophia Sanchez, an 11-year-old awaiting a heart transplant in Chicago.  She  posted a video of her dancing in the hospital with an I.V. in her arm to  rapper Drake's \"In My Feelings.\"  So then she asked Drake to come visit  her.  Against all odds, guess what happened?  He did.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOPHIA SANCHEZ, HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT:  Oh, my God! </p><p>DRAKE, RAP ARTIST:  You asked me to come, I'm here.

So yesterday, Sophia had the heart implanted and,  according to her mom, Natalie, Sophia is doing well.  I want you to know,  Sophia, you've got five people here at FOX rooting and praying for you. </p><p>PERINO:  Like, 500 million.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Really. </p><p>GUTFELD:  You have proven me wrong, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wow.  What?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Now I need to find a heart.  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  No one's going to give you a heart.</p><p>GUTFELD:  No one's going to give me a heart.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Especially after this.</p><p>GRAPHIC:  Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News.\"  Got a lot of big news in  the Brian Kilmeade spelling arena.

THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, CNN announced a bombshell that Michael Cohen said President  Trump knew about that meeting between his son and a Russian claiming to  have dirt on Hillary.  Something as rare as air.  It was one of a thousand  final nails in the coffin of Trump's presidency.  But then, Lanny Davis,  Hillary's creepy fixer, who's now defending Trump's creepy fixer, figure  that out, says it's creepy client didn't have such info, which is odd since  now it's revealed that creepy Davis was the anonymous creepy source who  supplied creepy CNN with that creepy info that the network then milked to  death while lecturing us on ethics.  So CNN is in a creepy pickle.  There  source for their biggest story of the year is giving us the creeps.  So  you're following this?  Which I wasn't.  I need to run my soul through a  car wash after all this.  </p><p>Unlike the rest of the media who eat this stuff up no matter the sourcing.   They're like a drunk frat boy at 3 AM.  They'll eat a pop tart off the  floor as long as there's ketchup.  So when Avenatti comes knocking, CNN  shrieks like Bieber fans with backstage passes, and why?  Only because it  perpetuates a story that the media can't stop feeding on.  Two years ago,  they were gorging on electing Trump.  Now they gorge on impeaching him.   Avenatti, Cohen, and Davis, three square meals the media devours daily.   But gluttony is a sin, no wonder they all seem so dumb and slow.  And  what's called reporting now is just rumor, spoon-fed from creep seeking  money, power, or fame.  I wish I could ignore them all, but what is it that  that guy keeps saying?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Long week?  Relax with a glass and let's get after it.   Lots to figure out.  What do you say?  Let's get after it.  It's going to  us two hours to do it, so what do you say?  Let's get after it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Let's get after it.  I've got something better.  How about let's  get accurate?  This is an amazing, blockbuster story, Kilmeade.  I want you  to try to get your head around it.  I know it might be tough for you  because you're working all the time.  But this is CNN's source  contradicting what they said to CNN, so somebody is lying.  Do you think  this will be on Michael Stelter's reliable sources?  </p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:  I say they rather have a test pattern to  put this on his reliable sources.  Lanny Davis is also a crisis expert.   That's where he wrote a book on.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>KILMEADE:  So here his crisis.  How do I solve the crisis?  Take  responsibility for it.  I'll take the heat and I can handle it.  He also  said the reporting got mixed up through the cross of the criminal  investigation.  No, that didn't work.  I made a mistake.  I did not mean to  be cute.  Never was.  Says he didn't lie to CNN.  He unintentionally  misspoke.  Said he, his instinct -- his instinct --this is what he said  about what Cohen knows.  His instinct was that his client might have  something to say about Mueller, about hacking, but he shouldn't have said  anything.  That is your lawyer.  This is nothing to do with Cohen.  It's  all about Hillary Clinton and Lanny Davis.  Cohen doesn't come up.  </p><p>So the question is, is he worried that Michael Cohen put his hand on the  bible and swore that he was telling the truth and said he had nothing to do  with this -- that Trump knew nothing about this Trump Tower situation.  And  when he came out and says now he knows, then Cohen suddenly looks as though  he created -- he committed perjury, so then he had to backtrack?  Or did he  just make it up and Michael Cohen said you're doing a really bad job.  I  know I'm not paying you, but you can't make things up.  There's more to  this story.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, you know -- OK, Dana, I want to stick to the CNN thing  because why not?  It's fun.  That was a natulite 26 story.  CNN said Lanny  Davis didn't make any comment on that.  So, this is from Glenn Greenwald.   I'm actually quoting a Glenn Greenwald article.  But, no.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: . but he's right.  CNN says Lanny Davis refused to comment, so  either CNN lied to its audience about Davis, or Davis is lying now.  </p><p>PERINO:  Or they were -- or they're protecting -- they were trying to  protect him at the time.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>PERINO: . to protect their source and say it wasn't that why people do  disagree with using background sources.  But in a case -- a situation like  this, then you're dealing with people's lives, including the president in  terms of their future judicial or legal problems, then people do leak and  they do speak on background.  The other thing that's happening here is you  have both camps trying to advance their story with the media on background  trying to be cute.  Then they go on the record.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>PERINO: . on cable news and they get a little bit crossed wide.  But I  believe CNN says they're sticking with the story.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, they are.</p><p>PERINO:  Because maybe they have another source that told them that the  story is true.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  And who could that source be?  Is there another lawyer that we're  missing out on?  </p><p>PERINO:  Probably</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, some other guy.  Tammy, if this were -- this would be -- if  this were on the other side, this would be yet another smoking gun.</p><p>TAMMY Bruce, FOX NEWS HOST:  Sure.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But the media doesn't see this as anything special.  </p><p>BRUCE:  No, and they're going to make it go away.  But, of course, this is  why when the president says fake news, everybody goes nuts.  This is  exactly what he's talking about, the use of an individual.  And this is  almost -- on the theory like too good to check, right?  That they get what  they need from their source to move several days with a huge story at the  time -- it was another nail in the thousand nails, as you've noted.  And  then they get that mileage and they figure that that's all that they need  and that they gin this up in this way, and then it just goes away.  It  floats away.  But the viewers know it.  CNN is now losing their programs to  things like Ancient Aliens.  So, obviously, Ancient Aliens doing things  that CNN won't do and can't do.  So this is what the president complains  about.  It's what you see the crowds at the rallies, you know, yelling at  CNN about.  It hurts not just Cohen and this entire process legally but how  media is viewed again.  It's another nail in a coffin, but it's not  President Trump.  It's a legacy media and what they're willing to do.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Juan, I'm just severely disappointed in the whole legal world  right now.  Aren't you saddened?  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Of the legal world?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.  These lawyers are just terrible, Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Giuliani, yeah, I would agree.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm way, way, way, in disagreement with all of you on this one  because it seems to me like you're in the weeds and you're just playing out  this tired theme of, oh, the right wing hates the elite mainstream media.   This is not a big story in terms of CNN says they're standing by their  story.  They say they have corroboration for the story.  They've had every  opportunity to say, hey, we made a mistake.  In addition to which,  remember, CNN fired reporters when reporters got an earlier story about  Trump wrong.  So I would think that people on the right would say, huh, CNN  is not firing anybody in this case.  They're not backing off.  And the one  who is saying that he did something wrong is Lanny Davis.  Lanny Davis is a  stand-up guy here and saying, hey. </p><p>KILMEADE:  Stand-up guy?  He made stuff up about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  And then he lied about it.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He said he was speculating, Brian.  And he has acknowledged that  he was wrong.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that, right?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that he was speculating?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what he said.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm just saying if you want to know the important story here,  the important story was when Cohen stood up in court and implicated the  president in an illegal payoff of a porn star.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But when everyone involved is lying at some point.  Look, if you  see a crowd of people who are lying at some point about a variety of  issues, and then you got a guy who's been threatened with life in prison  but pledging that he knows something, no wonder people don't take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He was in court.  He had -- he put his -- I mean, he could be in  jail.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Don't liberals all the time argue that people will say -- and  they'll confess to things they've never done before simply because of the  pressure by law enforcement?  </p><p>PERINO:  Can I just make one point though, several times and I think Maggie  Haberman reporting the New York Times, at least twice, stories broken,  legal camp on the president side had said not true.  Or the president even  -- fake news or spokesmen said not true.  Then five or six months later you  turn -- oh, it actually is true.  So I think that the media is being played  a little bit but both sides on the legal side of things.  It's difficult to  try these cases on the court of public.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But, you know what?  The thing is there's one side that  definitely wants their story to be true, so they're willing to pay -- play  more fast and loose.  Can we talk about Bruce Ohr?  Is that not a story,  the former DOJ guy who's testifying in a closed door hearing over his  relations with Christopher Steele, the spy who tried to bring Trump down  with that dossier.  This -- in my opinion, this is a pretty, damn, big  story.  He's pushing the dossier created by Fusion GPS, where his wife  works, and then he says he feared of being exposed by this when Comey got  fired.  This is -- I mean, we make fun of the phrase deep state, but this  ain't shallow state.  </p><p>PERINO:  Which is why he's testifying behind closed doors.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right.  Which I think both sides want now because they feel as  though not enough gets done when they're out in public, although I think  Peter Strzok exposing his demeanor, his smugness goes a long way  understanding what goes on -- what was really going on behind closed doors.   This is what Catherine Herridge has told us so far.  She did a great job  standing outside.  So, Bruce Ohr, according to Darrell Issa, his memory is  in-perfect, but he does say he's never had a case like this in 20 years.   He goes on to say when they're caught lying, Simpson said, the first time,  Glenn Simpson who owns Fusion GPS, where Bruce Ohr's wife works, said the  first time that I was dealing with Bruce Ohr was at thanksgiving.  The  problem is there's email exchanges that shows they'd been communicating  since August.  Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, and Glenn Simpson all contradict each  other.  And there's no way that that should be allowed if you're trying to  do an investigation.  And if the FBI or Department of Justice was doing  this investigation, they would not be tolerating this.  So they've got to  get all three out there in front of us and tried to contradict each other.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And you know what we're seeing here is the weaponising, as we've  discussed, of the federal law enforcement framework against a presidential  election and a presidential nominee, a candidate, which is what they  wanted, which was an insurance policy to keep something from happening.  So  when you look at that -- and this is another -- it's a blessing for  conservatives everywhere.  Particular communities in this country talk  about law enforcement, framing people, making up evidence, targeting  individuals to get them -- deciding that the ends justifies the means, and  a lot of people who don't go through that experience say, oh, that could  never really happen.  We're now seeing it happen at a federal level.  So  it's an education for all of us.  Not just at that level but at the local  level as well when it comes to what law enforcement is willing to do.  And  the cleanup that has to happen around the country for all of us just when  it comes to who we trust and whether or not we're going to really take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  So, in other words -- so you're just happy defaming the FBI, the  Justice Department, anybody that's questioning President Trump.  This is  the story again.  So here we are.  Oh, this means that there's nothing,  nothing that the president has done wrong.  President Trump is a victim.   This is madness.  I mean, you have to ignore the facts on the ground.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  We're just reporting the story about this guy.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  You have to ignore the fact that Bruce Ohr is an  expert on Russia.  You have to ignore the fact that therefore people like  Christopher Steele would be going to Bruce Ohr and saying, hey, guess what,  Sally Yates just got tossed.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan, you should be upset too, because all these corruptions and  all of these back-and-forth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What corruption?</p><p>BRUCE:  And Bruce Ohr saying we're going to get caught, that obscures any  legitimate investigation that people may be would have wanted.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  All I know is.</p><p>BRUCE:  Because this becomes the story.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me just say, I think we had the president going after Jeff  Sessions, his own Republican attorney general.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Who recused himself.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He's not doing anything.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  So he's going after Rod Rosenstein.  He's going after  the FBI.  Who else -- who isn't he going after?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  All I can say is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just look at this.  Juan, just look at this.  Nobody said Donald  Trump is playing the perfect game so far.  All we're saying is look at the  text messages and the exchanges.  Look at the facts.  You should be as  outraged as anybody.  And then, pick your time when Trump is out of control  and say this is out of control.  But this is not Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  You know what?  Feels like this Ohr is in hot water.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Republicans warning voters about what will happen if Nancy Pelosi  becomes speaker again.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO:  The Trump effect being put to the test again in key primaries  today.  Trump backed Congressman Ron Desantis is trying to secure the  Republican nomination to replace outgoing Florida Governor Rick Scott.  And  Scott is looking to wrap up the GOP senate nodded with a big boost from  Trump.  And in Arizona, it's a senate Republican primary featuring three  candidates who are all strongly behind the president's agenda.  In the  backdrop of tonight races, a major warning sign for Republican midterm  voters.  GOP lawmakers are circulating a list of potential issues Democrats  may investigate if they retake the house.  Will this threat helped turn out  the base?  </p><p>The list is pretty amazing.  It's basically of all the list that the house  Democrats have sent requesting hearings on such issues as President Trump's  tax returns, President Trump's family business, the payment to Stormy  Daniels, James Comey's firing, cabinet secretary travel, the travel ban,  family separation, on and on.  It's basically, pretty much, nothing else  would get done except for investigations, if this were to actually happen.   So the Republicans -- sometimes, Tammy, you have to scare your base into  turning out.  </p><p>BRUCE:  You do.  And yet, this is pretty much what people want to do.   They're still talking about impeachment even though some people are saying,  well, that's not really a good idea.  Even Adam Schiff the other day said,  well, we really can't really talk about that right now.  But if President  Trump is everything they say he is.  I mean, he's Hitler.  He's carrying  babies away from moms.  Why wouldn't you want to?  Why suddenly if he's the  worst guy in the world but then you really don't want to investigate  anything or you don't want to impeach him.  And so that's what we're  looking at.  And these are serious things that the Democrats have been  running on and have been talking to their base about.  And we can expect  them to do it partly because they don't want to govern.  That's been a big  problem with Democrats.  They gin up the bases, they get people all  excited, but they don't want to govern.  And this.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Where did you get that from?  </p><p>BRUCE:  From the last eight years with Barack Obama.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  Oh, please, are you kidding?  I think  Republicans, in fact, thought that he -- it was overreaching, doing too  much, and had to obstruct him.  I could go on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Bill Clinton governed.  And that's why that administration, even  with impeachment, worked because he enjoyed the process.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think -- look, I think, just seriously, Dana has a point here  about who's stirring up the base.  That this is an action being taken by  Republicans right now to say if you allow Democrats to take control of the  house, we are going to lose President Trump because he may be impeached.   And they see this, and I think rightly, as stirring up the GOP base because  it's so strongly pro-Trump.  And that those people then will turn out and  not turn off, given all the bad news that Trump is experiencing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  So stirring up the base though -- let's go back to this because  telling the truth can actually stir up the base.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  And I like how the Democrats are pretending that they  aren't really interested impeachment.  That's like a teenager trying to  sneak a bottle of booze outside the house -- outside the house in front of  their parents.  Oh, no, it's just a water bottle.  We know the Democrats  are waiting to spring this on if they get the house.  They're playing this  down so they can then raise it when they can.  So I do believe telling --  telling the truth can be stirring the base, by the way.  Democrats stir the  base by painting Trump is Hitler.  You know as.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, she said separating children from their parents.  Boy, I  think that's true.  Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Stirring the base.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about this?  Democrats want to do away with ICE, how about  that?  Oh, yeah, they want to do away with ICE. </p><p>PERINO:  The point about family separation policy, there're already was a  hearing about that.  And so.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And then we'll have to deal with Barack Obama's establishment of  it, and the fact that.  </p><p>PERINO:  The other thing is that the Democrats -- you know, they're finding  out that some of their fringe on the left that come up with ideas like  abolishing ICE, and it's not just the fringe, some mainstream Democrats as  well.  It's not going over so well.  There was a poll taken by A.P., 57  percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, but the number that don't  -- there's only 18 percent of Democrats favor dismantling this, Ok?  So  they're having to answer questions for things that their left, far left is  suggesting.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But some of that -- high profile people are saying it.  Bernie  Sanders, Gillibrand, and they're the ones saying it.  And you can just say  OK.  You deal with it because it's not somebody writing this and they're  not putting their name on it, these are major speeches given in front of  major audiences to get a loud round of applause.  The Democrats who have  been successful in the special election, he's the close the gap or walk  away with the win are the ones who are in the middle that still clearly  criticize Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian, you want to get rid of the Ice Capades, which I think is  heartless.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Why do you feel that way about the Ice Capades?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  The Ice Capades, I feel like it never ends.  There's no  beginning and there's no end.  I feel like.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And by the way, there's no scoring either at Ice Capades.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Crickets scares me.</p><p>PERINO:  All right, up next, President Trump with a new warning for Google  after claiming the company is silencing conservatives, up next.</p><p>GUTFELD:  What is a Capades?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  President Trump going after Google this morning on twitter,  accusing the tech giant of being politically biased against conservatives.   The president claims searched results are, quote, rigged, end quote,  against him and other Republicans as well to suppress any good news about  the Trump presidency.  Now, the president doubling down this very  afternoon. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Yeah, I think  Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a  very serious thing and it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and  what others are doing, if you look at what's going-on on twitter, if you  look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you  can't do that to people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Google firing back saying its searches don't promote a political  agenda.  So what do you think?  </p><p>BRUCE:  Look, we have a history with all of the social media, and Facebook  is also mentioned as a very good example.  Remember their trending stories  column that they said was the trending news of the day based on their  algorithms.  And then we realize that there was no real conservative sites,  there's no conservative stories, there was nothing pro-conservative, and  former editors came out and said that they routinely suppressed  conservative news, things that conservatives would make them look good or  would be of interest to conservatives, and then they had to eventually  shutdown that entire framework.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me pick up on this and ask you a question.  Much of it has  to do, according to Google, with the idea that if you are searching  something they give you what they call accredited sites like big newspapers  that they have a sense of trust in their content as opposed to giving them  simply opinionated sites that are likely tilted.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But that's the problem is that when you're liberal and you see a  liberal side, that is the one that is legitimate to you, and you're going  to view an opposing website in a different way because you don't agree with  it.  So if you're going to rank certain websites, you're going to rank them  based on whether or not it looks like real life to you.  That, look, if  you're a liberal or a conservative, you're not going to look at your own  material as being biased because it's what you also believe.  And this is  why when you've got 80 percent -- 85 percent of American media identifies  effectively as liberal, as not conservative, and then you're going to have  a Google determine which sites are going to be more legitimate, they're  going to rate more legitimate the sites that they agree with that looks  like their worldview.  And automatically.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What about -- and it seems to me like saying there's no truth,  there's no fact, there's no accurate news coverage in the country, so you  just give me liberal opinion or give me conservative opinions.  Is that  we're saying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, I think they're talking about -- this is the hottest issue  in the country and there's no easy answer.  This is the stem cell research  of our generation, of this decade, because everyone thinks social media is  the problem for their own reasons.  I don't necessarily have the reason but  Amazon, Google, Facebook, and twitter, they have to -- we have to come up  with something that will work.  I think, fundamentally, they actually want  to get it to work.  I think there's legitimate criticisms of those sites.   My frustration is when -- for example, CEO Jack Dorsey comes to Capitol  Hill to go in front of the energy committee on September 5th, next week, is  there going to be anyone who's an expert to be able to ask him the types of  questions.  They're going to move the conversation forward or we going to  see a bunch.  </p><p>PERINO:  So you think those hearings are unsatisfying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Well, I know you're being sarcastic.  But we need somebody in  the middle that is unbiased to say here's an idea of what to do because  lawmakers who belong to a party are not capable of coming up with an  answer.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  By the way, Brian, Larry Kudlow said today, well, he's looking  at the possibility of regulating them.  And I think. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I don't know where you start?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  But that is so shocking to me that he would  suggest that the government now. </p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow, I mean, he's a free-market guy and  conservatives typically are not for more regulation.  I would add that --  1:40 PM today, before the Daily Briefings, I checked Google News --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Your show.</p><p>PERINO:  -- to see what was there.  And the No. 1 story was a CNN story  about debunking a Trump myth of some sort.  A CNN Money story was about how  Google is rigged against conservatives, based on the president's tweet.   And the third story was the FOX News story about Tiger Woods.  And I think  we're going to talk about that later.  </p><p>So I think that there's -- there's a lot of room for this algorithm to be  manipulated.  And all of these sites are privately-held companies.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And they're powerful.</p><p>PERINO:  But they also would say to you, \"It doesn't make sense for us to  alienate half of the country\" when they're trying to make money.  Remember,  it was Michael Jordan said Republicans buy shoes, too.  So they're going to  try to make a free-market argument next week.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Greg, so I was surprised to see that the president's going  after Google.  He had a bad week, and I guess he does his rage Googling --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That was last week.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- and says, \"Oh, my God.  Look at -- they've got negative  stories here from New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.\" </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"I don't like these stories.  Give me some conservative thing.\"  But here's Trump back in July.  He says the European Union is fining  Google, and they're one of America's greatest companies.  </p><p>PERINO:  Oh, right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But today, it's a different story.  </p><p>PERINO:  That's right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  I mean, it surprises you Trump changes his opinion?  I mean, it's  been going on for two years.  I think what Google is guilty of, everyone  else in the media.  They're chasing words and not deeds.  </p><p>The deeds are good news.  We have an 18-year high in optimism right now.   That's not being reported.  If you want onto Google and Googled Mexican  trade, you would've gotten the top stories about the awkward phone call.   You wouldn't have gotten the Mexican trade story.  </p><p>And he's just like us.  He Googles his name, and he gets mad when there's  bad news.  If you Google \"Kilmeade,\" the first thing --</p><p>KILMEADE:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>GUTFELD:  -- you're going to get is \"hairpiece.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right, right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But don't Google Kilmeade and hairpiece, because then you'll see  what happens.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, but 99 percent of the stuff on us is negative.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, yes, yes.  And I'm used to it.</p><p>And if you look at Google Doodles, which I love.  You know, instead of  Easter, they'll have an activist.  Instead of Christmas, they'll do some  kind of festival.  Instead of Burning Man -- I mean, they'll do Burning Man  instead of Lou Dobbs's birthday.  They're the king of virtue signaling.  </p><p>You ask, like, why would you alienate half the conversation?  It's to keep  activists at bay.  They would rather alienate half a population than have  somebody come after them and say, \"You're bigoted.  You're sexist.  You're  racists.\"</p><p>They need to do a Google search on wisdom.  Because right now, what they're  doing is they're helping China in their A.I.   Correct?  But they are  leaving -- they want to leave helping the military and making more precise  drones that actually save lives.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK, I've got a question for you about Alex Jones.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Because we know that some of these sites pushed Alex Jones and  his conspiracy theories off on the idea that it's hate speech.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Why wouldn't you want to support that, Greg? </p><p>GUTFELD:  I think Alex Jones is hate speech.  It's the same way I feel  about Louis Farrakhan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK.  ESPN melting down --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Where is he?  On Twitter wearing a bowtie.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- over Tiger Woods's refusal to criticize President Trump.  The  growing controversy -- you heard Dana reference it -- when we return.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you say to people who might find it interesting  that you have, I guess, a friendly relationship with him?  </p><p>TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER:  Well, he's our -- he's the president of  the United States.  And you have to respect the office, and no matter who's  in the office.  You may like, dislike personality or the politics.  But we  all must respect the office.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KILMEADE:  But he's done that.  What was wrong with that answer?  ESPN  host, though, hears that answer and thinks Tiger Woods bailed out.  They  are teeing off on Tiger Woods, refusing to take the reporters bait and  criticized President Trump or complement President Trump.  So they start  lashing out against Tiger Woods because he wouldn't lash out against the  president.  For example.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, ESPN CO-HOST, \"FIRST TAKE\":  Tiger Woods is being -- you  said, being slick.  Here, he is being slick.  He says we must respect the  office.  Therefore, that confers respect to the occupant.  Tiger, is that  what you're saying?  If that's what you're saying, that is a stupid  comment.  I don't -- but I don't even know if he believes that that's when  he said.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, first of all, we don't know what Tiger Woods  believes.  He's camblination (ph); he's not black.  When he was arrested,  he was black.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Stephen Hayes Smith is one of the brighter people on television.   I would love to hear him long form.  But Max Kellerman thinks it's just  unthinkable, Dana, that Tiger Woods would--</p><p>PERINO:  Respect the office of the president?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  -- respect the office.  And he probably likes President Trump in  golf has his holes together (ph).</p><p>PERINO:  I thought -- well, all people sports, who play sports, athletes,  thank you.  Looking for the word.  They are going to -- thank you for the  word -- are going to be asked questions about President Trump, because  reporters can't help themselves.  And they're always trying to figure out a  way, how can can they make headlines?  How can they make news?</p><p>The only way to make news, apparently, is the world today is if you ask  somebody how they feel about President Trump, even if that has nothing to  do about their golf game.  </p><p>What I thought is that Tiger Woods knew that a question like that was  probably coming.  And I took it as a sincere genuine answer of how he feels  about the presidency of the United States.  And I think that ESPN, they can  do whatever they want on their show.  But Tiger Woods was prepared for that  question.  But it wasn't like he was reading somebody else's talking  points.  I think he believed it.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Max Kellerman is a virtue-signaling jackass, and here's evidence.   Would he have said that to Jim Brown last week?  Would he have said it to  Jim Brown, you know?  Because Jim Brown would have wiped the floor with  him.  He would have gone to the studio, so he did it because he thought he  could get away with it.  </p><p>This is the problem with injecting politics into bodies that do not have an  immune system for it.  So when you inject politics into sports, sports gets  sick.  When you inject politics into the entertainment world, the  entertainment gets world -- the entertainment world gets sick.  When you  inject politics into academia, what do you get?  You get a poison, toxic  campus.  Whenever you put politics, it gets sick, except on \"The Five.\"   Because we are real.  </p><p>PERINO:  When you put sports -- inject sports into me, I get sick, because  I can't even come up with the word \"athlete.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Put it this way.  If people know President Trump, they have a  different opinion of President Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Tell us about it, Brian.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Mike Tyson knows him.  Dennis Rodman knows him.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Herschel Walker knows him.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just be jotting this down.  Tim Scott got a chance to spend a  lot of time with him.  And guess what?  So did Tiger Woods?</p><p>So Jim Brown joined us this morning on \"FOX &amp; Friends.\"  He is getting  blowback in the black community --</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  -- for saying \"I like President Trump.  I think he's doing a  decent job.\"  Listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JIM BROWN, NFL HALL OF FAME:  The greatest thing about America is that we  all have our opinions and our thoughts.  Nobody is totally correct in  everything that they do.  I have access to the president; and any time I  have access to the president and he will listen to my thoughts, that's all  I can ask of him.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And that's all that he said: \"I have access to the president.\"   That's just like Kanye West: \"I have access, and therefore, I want to be\" - - what'd he say, Yeezy?</p><p>KILMEADE:  You didn't hear the whole thing, but he does say he liked what  he's doing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  More than Obama gave them.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  But you know, what's interesting about the Tiger Woods thing is  Tiger Woods was asked, \"So what about the politics, then?  If you say you  respect the office.\"  </p><p>And by the way, Max Kellerman, he was right when he said this was a slick  move that allowed him to say, \"I respect the office\" without saying, \"Well,  what do you think about this president?\" </p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm sorry?</p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What's the right answer?</p><p>KILMEADE:  He respects the office of the president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not -- that's not an answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Why isn't it?</p><p>PERINO:  Why not?  That's a great answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's perfect</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me tell you why.  It's like saying you respect X, Y, Z.  And  you saying, \"I respect X, Y, G but not -- let's not talk about X, Y, Z.\"   Here's what he said.  He said, \"I just finished 72 holes, and I'm really  hungry.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  At the end.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Does that sound like a kid who's trying to get away from  --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He's 43, and it's the fifth follow-up.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's a big boy, and in this era, President Trump, not the  athletes, have made the issue.  President Trump has gone after NFL players,  who are protesting.  He's gone after Stephen Curry, LeBron James.  Shut up  and dribble?  Because why?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He didn't say that.  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's always saying that these -- </p><p>KILMEADE:  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- people --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He said they're not going to the Oval Office.  Don't bother.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- they don't want anything to do with him for a very real  reason.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CO-HOST:  There is one reason why this is happening.  The  latest poll, 36 percent of African-Americans support the president --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, please.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- because their economy is better.  Lowest unemployment rate in  history for African-Americans.  The future is brighter again.  They're  realizing that the conservative ideal is worthwhile and should be  considered.  They're hearing other African-Americans they like, like Kanye  West, say, \"Wait a minute.  Maybe we should be thinking about things.\"  </p><p>Tiger Woods and others are not conforming, and that's what they expect of  the gay community, African-Americans, women.  Even if your lives are  better, you will be punished if you say that's OK, because that's all they  have left.  That's Tiger Woods's crime, apparently.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not.  Tiger Woods plays a game.  </p><p>BRUCE:  He likes the presidency and the president, and African-American  lives are better under this president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  This is such a cheap argument about  unemployment rates.  Let me just say, Tiger Woods plays the game.</p><p>BRUCE:  The lowest unemployment rate in history is a cheap argument? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That is a cheap argument.  That's ridiculous.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  If you were saying to me, \"Oh, you know what?\"</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"President Trump is now about lowering black unemployment so  that it matches white unemployment.  Or President Obama [SIC] -- President  Trump is doing something\" --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Going after MS-13.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \" -- to encourage job training.\"  No, he's not doing any of  that.  </p><p>Here's what Tiger Woods is about.  Tiger Woods realizes that his sponsors  and the people who play golf, generally white, maybe Republican.  And he is  not taking the risk of speaking truth to power.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- you're just projecting what you think Tiger Woods is  thinking.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, I don't know what he thinks.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Mind reading.</p><p>KILMEADE:  I project this.  He's known him for 15, 20 years, and likes him.   I'll project that.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And we all seem to recall --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's probably a better idea.  </p><p>PERINO:  He also -- I didn't have a chance to talk.  He also has to -- a  responsibility to himself and to his business and to --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There we go.</p><p>PERINO:  So look, if I were his P.R. advisor and I anticipated that  question, I'm like, that is a great answer.  You might get dinged on ESPN,  but if you want to focus, you really want to make a comeback in golf,  you've got to focus on this and not allow a distraction with politics.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like, politics in other arenas, sucks.  Politics kills  everything.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  All right.  So I guess Greg gets the last word.  Meanwhile,  coming up straight ahead, keeping a room cold is apparently now sexist.   That story is next.  Please gradually zoom out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  All right, everybody.  Cries of sexism in the New York  gubernatorial race, not about politics but about room temperature.  </p><p>Cynthia Nixon's team is accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being sexist for  trying to debate in a chilly room when they face off tomorrow night.  </p><p>Turns out this is a battle many Americans face.  A recent survey says 43  percent of coworkers have clashed --</p><p>KILMEADE:  To battle.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- over being too hot or too cold in the workplace.  </p><p>Obviously, Cynthia Nixon is Goldilocks.  Look, if she can't handle a room  temperature properly, how can she handle being in a variety of different  rooms, dealing with politicians, et cetera?  Greg, I'm sure you might have  something to say about that.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  She -- she wants 76 degrees in a packed auditorium? </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's freezing.</p><p>GUTFELD:  If you take the body heat of the -- you're going to put it into  the 80s, and they are going to despise her.  </p><p>By the way, this is -- it is a fact.  This is a biological difference among  many.  And if you deny it, you're a science denier.  We all have -- we have  different metabolic rates.  So men actually can handle, I guess, the cold  better.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Women are hotter.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  That will -- that will end up somewhere.  Take it out of context  and put it on a blog.  There you go.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think it's good news for you, Brian.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Also, Dana, we -- men and women dress differently in the office.   You know?</p><p>PERINO:  I'm freezing every day, so I would give her a little tip.  In my  mug is hot water.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  No, but that's a good idea.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  If I drank rum, that would be a good idea.  It's hot water.  I  hold my cup and it's hot; and then I get -- I don't have to complain too  much about how freezing it is.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But is it sexist?  That's the problem.  Is it sexist?</p><p>PERINO:  No, it's not.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Is it sexist.</p><p>PERINO:  Remember Charlie Crist in Florida?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  And he was going to have a debate.  And one of the big demands is  that he had to have a fan at all times. </p><p>GUTFELD:  And where was the fan?</p><p>PERINO:  Underneath the podium.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  It was right at an odd level.  It was the strangest thing.  </p><p>PERINO:  Yes, it's a very strange thing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like a fan --</p><p>PERINO:  And that is not sexist.  That is just a demand.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, because there's a reality here.  There's a political  reality that if you go back, I think it's the 1960 campaign with  Nixon/Kennedy.  That they had a debate, and Nixon -- Nixon starts to pop  sweat.</p><p>GUTFELD:  So she wants him to sweat.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And he looks terrible on TV.  He looks like he's fleeing a crime  scene.  </p><p>BRUCE:  They have to adjusts, but these days, everything either --  everything has to be sexist.  But when you're running -- when our argument  is, is that we are the same; women can do what men do.  But now everything  has to be adjusted because we can't handle a room temperature? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, no.  That's not what they're saying.  They're saying --  she's saying that she wants to eliminate his demand that it be freezing.   And he has said he likes a cold environment.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  In the past, but the thing is, it's like boxing, Juan.</p><p>BRUCE:  And she wants it at 76.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're a boxing fan.  If you're the champion, you get to pick  the ring, the venue.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what she said.  She said CBS, the local CBS, the  affiliate here in New York, negotiated exclusively with him.  Because she  wanted several debates.  She's only getting one debate on his terms.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Because he's -- he's leading.  And he doesn't even really need to  do it, because he's ahead.  But thank you for man-splaining that for me.  </p><p>Yes, I mean, this is -- this is what you're going to see, and this is what  we want.  I want women to run for office, but we don't want it to all be  about sexism.  </p><p>PERINO:  I do want it to be comfortable in the room.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But 76 isn't even comfortable.  Right?  I mean, she's asking -- </p><p>PERINO:  No, see it depends.  Like, at 75, I'm cold.  At 76, I'm hot.  So  it's, like, 75.5 would be perfect.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Do you want to talk about sexism, though?  Think about all of the  men who built buildings, who built the buildings that people actually use,  who risked their lives on girders in the 1960s and the 1970s, who built the  bridges.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And then blew the money on the track.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Or if the -- oh, no, they fell.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  They fell.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Brooklyn Bridge, look at the numbers of people who died on the  Brooklyn Bridge.  </p><p>BRUCE:  All the men who made things possible and now women can help make  them possible, too.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  There you go.</p><p>BRUCE:  Coming up, \"One More Thing\" is coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"OMT\" -- Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Gregory, you know what?  Dreams do come true. </p><p>GUTFELD:  No, they don't.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And sometimes in doubles.  Yes, because that's what happened for  Sophia Sanchez, an 11-year-old awaiting a heart transplant in Chicago.  She  posted a video of her dancing in the hospital with an I.V. in her arm to  rapper Drake's \"In My Feelings.\"  So then she asked Drake to come visit  her.  Against all odds, guess what happened?  He did.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOPHIA SANCHEZ, HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT:  Oh, my God! </p><p>DRAKE, RAP ARTIST:  You asked me to come, I'm here.  What's up?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Sophia -- Sophia also asked -- and this is the double, Gregory - - Sophia asked for a new heart, because she was struggling.  And guess  what?  The second dream also came true. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're getting a heart.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  I'm getting a heart, Mom!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, my gosh.  So yesterday, Sophia had the heart implanted and,  according to her mom, Natalie, Sophia is doing well.  I want you to know,  Sophia, you've got five people here at FOX rooting and praying for you. </p><p>PERINO:  Like, 500 million.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Really. </p><p>GUTFELD:  You have proven me wrong, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wow.  What?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Now I need to find a heart.  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  No one's going to give you a heart.</p><p>GUTFELD:  No one's going to give me a heart.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Especially after this.</p><p>GRAPHIC:  Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News.\"  Got a lot of big news in  the Brian Kilmeade spelling arena.  Let's go live to tape.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  There's a word that  Canada has trouble with.  It's M-I-L-K.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Now, in terms of Canada, I guess Canada hates milk.  I mean,  hates to talk about milk, M-A-L-K.  </p><p>STEVE DOOCY, CO-HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  They're lactose intolerant.</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's what you've got.</p><p>DOOCY:  By the way, Brian -- Brian, did you say -- it's \"M-I-L-K\". </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're right.  Thank you very much.</p><p>DOOCY:  Not \"M-A-L-K.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- thanks for correcting me.  You helped me, saved a  headline.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  How nice of Larry to correct you on television.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  That would have slipped by the Gutfeld staff, except for Larry  corrected me. </p><p>PERINO:  I thought I heard you say \"I\" in my -- OK, you didn't. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I know how to spell \"milk,\" just not in the morning. </p><p>GUTFELD:  Dana. </p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about \"potato\"? </p><p>PERINO:  I have something to promote.  I'm going to be on Tucker Carlson  tonight at 8 p.m., so you can check that out there.  We have a graphic.   Yes, I have a graphic today.  </p><p>Marie Unanue, she has a new book.  She's a friend of mine.  And it is  called \"The Adventures of Phatty and Payaso: Central Park,\" ad it's a  children's book, a chapter book, actually.  So if you are a little more  advanced, you might like it.  Phatty and Payaso, they go to Central Park.   They want to go take a stand against bullying, but then they get -- all  sorts of adventures.  They have a LetsBeKind.com adventure that goes with  it, if you want to check it out.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Real quick, my paperback of \"Andrew Jackson: Miracle of New  Orleans,\" includes what other presidents thought of Andrew Jackson, because  he's so controversial today.  It's coming out in October.  And I'm going to  couple it with three events.  One in Tampa, one in Norfolk, one in  Nashville.  His BrianKilmeade.com.  </p><p>I want to talk about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli  pirates, as well as \"Andrew Jackson: Miracle of New Orleans.\"  \"America  Great from the Start.\"  Because so many people have problems with our  history, I wanted to have a live event where people can ask questions.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Excellent, brain.  Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  And for everyone's books and events, you can now get a pumpkin  spice latte.  I know fall does not start until the 22, but already the  pumpkin spice latte is out.  It is their biggest selling drink of all time.</p><p>GUTFELD:  I love it.  I love it.</p><p>BRUCE:  I -- I love it as well.</p><p>PERINO:  You do?</p><p>BRUE:  Normally, I like regular coffee but in this case, that's for me -- </p><p>PERINO:  In 95 degree heat? </p><p>BRUCE:  In season, sure.</p><p>KILMEADE:  But they use real pumpkin.</p><p>BRUCE:  They use real pumpkin, and you can get a pumpkin scones.  You can  get, like, a cookie in the shape of an owl that's a pumpkin.  So welcome to  fall, and enjoy the pumpkin spice latte.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  All right.  Set your DVRs.  Never miss an episode of THE FIVE.   \"SPECIAL REPORT\" up next.  Hey, Bret.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Greg, thanks.

THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, CNN announced a bombshell that Michael Cohen said President Trump knew about that meeting between his son and a Russian claiming to have dirt on Hillary. Something as rare as air. It was one of a thousand final nails in the coffin of Trump's presidency. But then, Lanny Davis, Hillary's creepy fixer, who's now defending Trump's creepy fixer, figure that out, says it's creepy client didn't have such info, which is odd since now it's revealed that creepy Davis was the anonymous creepy source who supplied creepy CNN with that creepy info that the network then milked to death while lecturing us on ethics. So CNN is in a creepy pickle. There source for their biggest story of the year is giving us the creeps. So you're following this? Which I wasn't. I need to run my soul through a car wash after all this.</p><p>Unlike the rest of the media who eat this stuff up no matter the sourcing. They're like a drunk frat boy at 3 AM. They'll eat a pop tart off the floor as long as there's ketchup. So when Avenatti comes knocking, CNN shrieks like Bieber fans with backstage passes, and why? Only because it perpetuates a story that the media can't stop feeding on. Two years ago, they were gorging on electing Trump. Now they gorge on impeaching him. Avenatti, Cohen, and Davis, three square meals the media devours daily. But gluttony is a sin, no wonder they all seem so dumb and slow. And what's called reporting now is just rumor, spoon-fed from creep seeking money, power, or fame. I wish I could ignore them all, but what is it that that guy keeps saying?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Long week? Relax with a glass and let's get after it. Lots to figure out. What do you say? Let's get after it. It's going to us two hours to do it, so what do you say? Let's get after it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Let's get after it. I've got something better. How about let's get accurate? This is an amazing, blockbuster story, Kilmeade. I want you to try to get your head around it. I know it might be tough for you because you're working all the time. But this is CNN's source contradicting what they said to CNN, so somebody is lying. Do you think this will be on Michael Stelter's reliable sources?</p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST: I say they rather have a test pattern to put this on his reliable sources. Lanny Davis is also a crisis expert. That's where he wrote a book on.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah.</p><p>KILMEADE: So here his crisis. How do I solve the crisis? Take responsibility for it. I'll take the heat and I can handle it. He also said the reporting got mixed up through the cross of the criminal investigation. No, that didn't work. I made a mistake. I did not mean to be cute. Never was. Says he didn't lie to CNN. He unintentionally misspoke. Said he, his instinct -- his instinct --this is what he said about what Cohen knows. His instinct was that his client might have something to say about Mueller, about hacking, but he shouldn't have said anything. That is your lawyer. This is nothing to do with Cohen. It's all about Hillary Clinton and Lanny Davis. Cohen doesn't come up.</p><p>So the question is, is he worried that Michael Cohen put his hand on the bible and swore that he was telling the truth and said he had nothing to do with this -- that Trump knew nothing about this Trump Tower situation. And when he came out and says now he knows, then Cohen suddenly looks as though he created -- he committed perjury, so then he had to backtrack? Or did he just make it up and Michael Cohen said you're doing a really bad job. I know I'm not paying you, but you can't make things up. There's more to this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, you know -- OK, Dana, I want to stick to the CNN thing because why not? It's fun. That was a natulite 26 story. CNN said Lanny Davis didn't make any comment on that. So, this is from Glenn Greenwald. I'm actually quoting a Glenn Greenwald article. But, no.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: . but he's right. CNN says Lanny Davis refused to comment, so either CNN lied to its audience about Davis, or Davis is lying now.</p><p>PERINO: Or they were -- or they're protecting -- they were trying to protect him at the time.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: . to protect their source and say it wasn't that why people do disagree with using background sources. But in a case -- a situation like this, then you're dealing with people's lives, including the president in terms of their future judicial or legal problems, then people do leak and they do speak on background. The other thing that's happening here is you have both camps trying to advance their story with the media on background trying to be cute. Then they go on the record.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah.</p><p>PERINO: . on cable news and they get a little bit crossed wide. But I believe CNN says they're sticking with the story.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they are.</p><p>PERINO: Because maybe they have another source that told them that the story is true.</p><p>GUTFELD: And who could that source be? Is there another lawyer that we're missing out on?</p><p>PERINO: Probably</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, some other guy. Tammy, if this were -- this would be -- if this were on the other side, this would be yet another smoking gun.</p><p>TAMMY Bruce, FOX NEWS HOST: Sure.</p><p>GUTFELD: But the media doesn't see this as anything special.</p><p>BRUCE: No, and they're going to make it go away. But, of course, this is why when the president says fake news, everybody goes nuts. This is exactly what he's talking about, the use of an individual. And this is almost -- on the theory like too good to check, right? That they get what they need from their source to move several days with a huge story at the time -- it was another nail in the thousand nails, as you've noted. And then they get that mileage and they figure that that's all that they need and that they gin this up in this way, and then it just goes away. It floats away. But the viewers know it. CNN is now losing their programs to things like Ancient Aliens. So, obviously, Ancient Aliens doing things that CNN won't do and can't do. So this is what the president complains about. It's what you see the crowds at the rallies, you know, yelling at CNN about. It hurts not just Cohen and this entire process legally but how media is viewed again. It's another nail in a coffin, but it's not President Trump. It's a legacy media and what they're willing to do.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I'm just severely disappointed in the whole legal world right now. Aren't you saddened?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Of the legal world?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. These lawyers are just terrible, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Giuliani, yeah, I would agree.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm way, way, way, in disagreement with all of you on this one because it seems to me like you're in the weeds and you're just playing out this tired theme of, oh, the right wing hates the elite mainstream media. This is not a big story in terms of CNN says they're standing by their story. They say they have corroboration for the story. They've had every opportunity to say, hey, we made a mistake. In addition to which, remember, CNN fired reporters when reporters got an earlier story about Trump wrong. So I would think that people on the right would say, huh, CNN is not firing anybody in this case. They're not backing off. And the one who is saying that he did something wrong is Lanny Davis. Lanny Davis is a stand-up guy here and saying, hey.</p><p>KILMEADE: Stand-up guy? He made stuff up about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE: And then he lied about it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: He said he was speculating, Brian. And he has acknowledged that he was wrong.</p><p>KILMEADE: You don't buy that, right?</p><p>WILLIAMS: What?</p><p>KILMEADE: You don't buy that he was speculating?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what he said.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm just saying if you want to know the important story here, the important story was when Cohen stood up in court and implicated the president in an illegal payoff of a porn star.</p><p>BRUCE: But when everyone involved is lying at some point. Look, if you see a crowd of people who are lying at some point about a variety of issues, and then you got a guy who's been threatened with life in prison but pledging that he knows something, no wonder people don't take it seriously.</p><p>WILLIAMS: He was in court. He had -- he put his -- I mean, he could be in jail.</p><p>BRUCE: Don't liberals all the time argue that people will say -- and they'll confess to things they've never done before simply because of the pressure by law enforcement?</p><p>PERINO: Can I just make one point though, several times and I think Maggie Haberman reporting the New York Times, at least twice, stories broken, legal camp on the president side had said not true. Or the president even -- fake news or spokesmen said not true. Then five or six months later you turn -- oh, it actually is true. So I think that the media is being played a little bit but both sides on the legal side of things. It's difficult to try these cases on the court of public.</p><p>GUTFELD: But, you know what? The thing is there's one side that definitely wants their story to be true, so they're willing to pay -- play more fast and loose. Can we talk about Bruce Ohr? Is that not a story, the former DOJ guy who's testifying in a closed door hearing over his relations with Christopher Steele, the spy who tried to bring Trump down with that dossier. This -- in my opinion, this is a pretty, damn, big story. He's pushing the dossier created by Fusion GPS, where his wife works, and then he says he feared of being exposed by this when Comey got fired. This is -- I mean, we make fun of the phrase deep state, but this ain't shallow state.</p><p>PERINO: Which is why he's testifying behind closed doors.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah.</p><p>KILMEADE: Right. Which I think both sides want now because they feel as though not enough gets done when they're out in public, although I think Peter Strzok exposing his demeanor, his smugness goes a long way understanding what goes on -- what was really going on behind closed doors. This is what Catherine Herridge has told us so far. She did a great job standing outside. So, Bruce Ohr, according to Darrell Issa, his memory is in-perfect, but he does say he's never had a case like this in 20 years. He goes on to say when they're caught lying, Simpson said, the first time, Glenn Simpson who owns Fusion GPS, where Bruce Ohr's wife works, said the first time that I was dealing with Bruce Ohr was at thanksgiving. The problem is there's email exchanges that shows they'd been communicating since August. Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, and Glenn Simpson all contradict each other. And there's no way that that should be allowed if you're trying to do an investigation. And if the FBI or Department of Justice was doing this investigation, they would not be tolerating this. So they've got to get all three out there in front of us and tried to contradict each other.</p><p>BRUCE: And you know what we're seeing here is the weaponising, as we've discussed, of the federal law enforcement framework against a presidential election and a presidential nominee, a candidate, which is what they wanted, which was an insurance policy to keep something from happening. So when you look at that -- and this is another -- it's a blessing for conservatives everywhere. Particular communities in this country talk about law enforcement, framing people, making up evidence, targeting individuals to get them -- deciding that the ends justifies the means, and a lot of people who don't go through that experience say, oh, that could never really happen. We're now seeing it happen at a federal level. So it's an education for all of us. Not just at that level but at the local level as well when it comes to what law enforcement is willing to do. And the cleanup that has to happen around the country for all of us just when it comes to who we trust and whether or not we're going to really take it seriously.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, in other words -- so you're just happy defaming the FBI, the Justice Department, anybody that's questioning President Trump. This is the story again. So here we are. Oh, this means that there's nothing, nothing that the president has done wrong. President Trump is a victim. This is madness. I mean, you have to ignore the facts on the ground.</p><p>GUTFELD: We're just reporting the story about this guy.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hang on. You have to ignore the fact that Bruce Ohr is an expert on Russia. You have to ignore the fact that therefore people like Christopher Steele would be going to Bruce Ohr and saying, hey, guess what, Sally Yates just got tossed.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE: Juan, you should be upset too, because all these corruptions and all of these back-and-forth.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What corruption?</p><p>BRUCE: And Bruce Ohr saying we're going to get caught, that obscures any legitimate investigation that people may be would have wanted.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All I know is.</p><p>BRUCE: Because this becomes the story.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let me just say, I think we had the president going after Jeff Sessions, his own Republican attorney general.</p><p>KILMEADE: Who recused himself.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE: He's not doing anything.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. So he's going after Rod Rosenstein. He's going after the FBI. Who else -- who isn't he going after?</p><p>GUTFELD: All I can say is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE: Just look at this. Juan, just look at this. Nobody said Donald Trump is playing the perfect game so far. All we're saying is look at the text messages and the exchanges. Look at the facts. You should be as outraged as anybody. And then, pick your time when Trump is out of control and say this is out of control. But this is not Trump.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what? Feels like this Ohr is in hot water.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: Republicans warning voters about what will happen if Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker again. That's next.</p><p>PERINO: The Trump effect being put to the test again in key primaries today. Trump backed Congressman Ron Desantis is trying to secure the Republican nomination to replace outgoing Florida Governor Rick Scott. And Scott is looking to wrap up the GOP senate nodded with a big boost from Trump. And in Arizona, it's a senate Republican primary featuring three candidates who are all strongly behind the president's agenda. In the backdrop of tonight races, a major warning sign for Republican midterm voters. GOP lawmakers are circulating a list of potential issues Democrats may investigate if they retake the house. Will this threat helped turn out the base?</p><p>The list is pretty amazing. It's basically of all the list that the house Democrats have sent requesting hearings on such issues as President Trump's tax returns, President Trump's family business, the payment to Stormy Daniels, James Comey's firing, cabinet secretary travel, the travel ban, family separation, on and on. It's basically, pretty much, nothing else would get done except for investigations, if this were to actually happen. So the Republicans -- sometimes, Tammy, you have to scare your base into turning out.</p><p>BRUCE: You do. And yet, this is pretty much what people want to do. They're still talking about impeachment even though some people are saying, well, that's not really a good idea. Even Adam Schiff the other day said, well, we really can't really talk about that right now. But if President Trump is everything they say he is. I mean, he's Hitler. He's carrying babies away from moms. Why wouldn't you want to? Why suddenly if he's the worst guy in the world but then you really don't want to investigate anything or you don't want to impeach him. And so that's what we're looking at. And these are serious things that the Democrats have been running on and have been talking to their base about. And we can expect them to do it partly because they don't want to govern. That's been a big problem with Democrats. They gin up the bases, they get people all excited, but they don't want to govern. And this.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Where did you get that from?</p><p>BRUCE: From the last eight years with Barack Obama.</p><p>WILLIAMS: This is ridiculous. Oh, please, are you kidding? I think Republicans, in fact, thought that he -- it was overreaching, doing too much, and had to obstruct him. I could go on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE: Bill Clinton governed. And that's why that administration, even with impeachment, worked because he enjoyed the process.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think -- look, I think, just seriously, Dana has a point here about who's stirring up the base. That this is an action being taken by Republicans right now to say if you allow Democrats to take control of the house, we are going to lose President Trump because he may be impeached. And they see this, and I think rightly, as stirring up the GOP base because it's so strongly pro-Trump. And that those people then will turn out and not turn off, given all the bad news that Trump is experiencing.</p><p>GUTFELD: So stirring up the base though -- let's go back to this because telling the truth can actually stir up the base.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah. And I like how the Democrats are pretending that they aren't really interested impeachment. That's like a teenager trying to sneak a bottle of booze outside the house -- outside the house in front of their parents. Oh, no, it's just a water bottle. We know the Democrats are waiting to spring this on if they get the house. They're playing this down so they can then raise it when they can. So I do believe telling -- telling the truth can be stirring the base, by the way. Democrats stir the base by painting Trump is Hitler. You know as.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, she said separating children from their parents. Boy, I think that's true. Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: Stirring the base.</p><p>WILLIAMS: How about this? Democrats want to do away with ICE, how about that? Oh, yeah, they want to do away with ICE.</p><p>PERINO: The point about family separation policy, there're already was a hearing about that. And so.</p><p>BRUCE: And then we'll have to deal with Barack Obama's establishment of it, and the fact that.</p><p>PERINO: The other thing is that the Democrats -- you know, they're finding out that some of their fringe on the left that come up with ideas like abolishing ICE, and it's not just the fringe, some mainstream Democrats as well. It's not going over so well. There was a poll taken by A.P., 57 percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, but the number that don't -- there's only 18 percent of Democrats favor dismantling this, Ok? So they're having to answer questions for things that their left, far left is suggesting.</p><p>KILMEADE: But some of that -- high profile people are saying it. Bernie Sanders, Gillibrand, and they're the ones saying it. And you can just say OK. You deal with it because it's not somebody writing this and they're not putting their name on it, these are major speeches given in front of major audiences to get a loud round of applause. The Democrats who have been successful in the special election, he's the close the gap or walk away with the win are the ones who are in the middle that still clearly criticize Trump.</p><p>GUTFELD: Brian, you want to get rid of the Ice Capades, which I think is heartless.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: Why do you feel that way about the Ice Capades?</p><p>KILMEADE: The Ice Capades, I feel like it never ends. There's no beginning and there's no end. I feel like.</p><p>GUTFELD: And by the way, there's no scoring either at Ice Capades.</p><p>KILMEADE: Crickets scares me.</p><p>PERINO: All right, up next, President Trump with a new warning for Google after claiming the company is silencing conservatives, up next.</p><p>GUTFELD: What is a Capades?</p><p>WILLIAMS: President Trump going after Google this morning on twitter, accusing the tech giant of being politically biased against conservatives. The president claims searched results are, quote, rigged, end quote, against him and other Republicans as well to suppress any good news about the Trump presidency. Now, the president doubling down this very afternoon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Yeah, I think Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a very serious thing and it's a very serious charge. I think what Google and what others are doing, if you look at what's going-on on twitter, if you look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you can't do that to people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Google firing back saying its searches don't promote a political agenda. So what do you think?</p><p>BRUCE: Look, we have a history with all of the social media, and Facebook is also mentioned as a very good example. Remember their trending stories column that they said was the trending news of the day based on their algorithms. And then we realize that there was no real conservative sites, there's no conservative stories, there was nothing pro-conservative, and former editors came out and said that they routinely suppressed conservative news, things that conservatives would make them look good or would be of interest to conservatives, and then they had to eventually shutdown that entire framework.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let me pick up on this and ask you a question. Much of it has to do, according to Google, with the idea that if you are searching something they give you what they call accredited sites like big newspapers that they have a sense of trust in their content as opposed to giving them simply opinionated sites that are likely tilted.</p><p>BRUCE: But that's the problem is that when you're liberal and you see a liberal side, that is the one that is legitimate to you, and you're going to view an opposing website in a different way because you don't agree with it. So if you're going to rank certain websites, you're going to rank them based on whether or not it looks like real life to you. That, look, if you're a liberal or a conservative, you're not going to look at your own material as being biased because it's what you also believe. And this is why when you've got 80 percent -- 85 percent of American media identifies effectively as liberal, as not conservative, and then you're going to have a Google determine which sites are going to be more legitimate, they're going to rate more legitimate the sites that they agree with that looks like their worldview. And automatically.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What about -- and it seems to me like saying there's no truth, there's no fact, there's no accurate news coverage in the country, so you just give me liberal opinion or give me conservative opinions. Is that we're saying?</p><p>KILMEADE: No, I think they're talking about -- this is the hottest issue in the country and there's no easy answer. This is the stem cell research of our generation, of this decade, because everyone thinks social media is the problem for their own reasons. I don't necessarily have the reason but Amazon, Google, Facebook, and twitter, they have to -- we have to come up with something that will work. I think, fundamentally, they actually want to get it to work. I think there's legitimate criticisms of those sites. My frustration is when -- for example, CEO Jack Dorsey comes to Capitol Hill to go in front of the energy committee on September 5th, next week, is there going to be anyone who's an expert to be able to ask him the types of questions. They're going to move the conversation forward or we going to see a bunch.</p><p>PERINO: So you think those hearings are unsatisfying?</p><p>KILMEADE: Well, I know you're being sarcastic. But we need somebody in the middle that is unbiased to say here's an idea of what to do because lawmakers who belong to a party are not capable of coming up with an answer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, Brian, Larry Kudlow said today, well, he's looking at the possibility of regulating them. And I think.</p><p>KILMEADE: I don't know where you start?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. But that is so shocking to me that he would suggest that the government now.</p><p>PERINO: Especially Larry Kudlow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: Especially Larry Kudlow, I mean, he's a free-market guy and conservatives typically are not for more regulation. I would add that -- 1:40 PM today, before the Daily Briefings, I checked Google News --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Your show.</p><p>PERINO: -- to see what was there. And the No. 1 story was a CNN story about debunking a Trump myth of some sort. A CNN Money story was about how Google is rigged against conservatives, based on the president's tweet. And the third story was the FOX News story about Tiger Woods. And I think we're going to talk about that later.</p><p>So I think that there's -- there's a lot of room for this algorithm to be manipulated. And all of these sites are privately-held companies.</p><p>KILMEADE: And they're powerful.</p><p>PERINO: But they also would say to you, \"It doesn't make sense for us to alienate half of the country\" when they're trying to make money. Remember, it was Michael Jordan said Republicans buy shoes, too. So they're going to try to make a free-market argument next week.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, Greg, so I was surprised to see that the president's going after Google. He had a bad week, and I guess he does his rage Googling --</p><p>KILMEADE: That was last week.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- and says, \"Oh, my God. Look at -- they've got negative stories here from New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: \"I don't like these stories. Give me some conservative thing.\" But here's Trump back in July. He says the European Union is fining Google, and they're one of America's greatest companies.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But today, it's a different story.</p><p>PERINO: That's right.</p><p>GUTFELD: I mean, it surprises you Trump changes his opinion? I mean, it's been going on for two years. I think what Google is guilty of, everyone else in the media. They're chasing words and not deeds.</p><p>The deeds are good news. We have an 18-year high in optimism right now. That's not being reported. If you want onto Google and Googled Mexican trade, you would've gotten the top stories about the awkward phone call. You wouldn't have gotten the Mexican trade story.</p><p>And he's just like us. He Googles his name, and he gets mad when there's bad news. If you Google \"Kilmeade,\" the first thing --</p><p>KILMEADE: Oh, my goodness.</p><p>GUTFELD: -- you're going to get is \"hairpiece.\"</p><p>KILMEADE: Right, right.</p><p>GUTFELD: But don't Google Kilmeade and hairpiece, because then you'll see what happens.</p><p>KILMEADE: No, but 99 percent of the stuff on us is negative.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, yes, yes. And I'm used to it.</p><p>And if you look at Google Doodles, which I love. You know, instead of Easter, they'll have an activist. Instead of Christmas, they'll do some kind of festival. Instead of Burning Man -- I mean, they'll do Burning Man instead of Lou Dobbs's birthday. They're the king of virtue signaling.</p><p>You ask, like, why would you alienate half the conversation? It's to keep activists at bay. They would rather alienate half a population than have somebody come after them and say, \"You're bigoted. You're sexist. You're racists.\"</p><p>They need to do a Google search on wisdom. Because right now, what they're doing is they're helping China in their A.I. Correct? But they are leaving -- they want to leave helping the military and making more precise drones that actually save lives.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK, I've got a question for you about Alex Jones.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Because we know that some of these sites pushed Alex Jones and his conspiracy theories off on the idea that it's hate speech.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why wouldn't you want to support that, Greg?</p><p>GUTFELD: I think Alex Jones is hate speech. It's the same way I feel about Louis Farrakhan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. ESPN melting down --</p><p>GUTFELD: Where is he? On Twitter wearing a bowtie.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- over Tiger Woods's refusal to criticize President Trump. The growing controversy -- you heard Dana reference it -- when we return.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you say to people who might find it interesting that you have, I guess, a friendly relationship with him?</p><p>TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: Well, he's our -- he's the president of the United States. And you have to respect the office, and no matter who's in the office. You may like, dislike personality or the politics. But we all must respect the office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KILMEADE: But he's done that. What was wrong with that answer? ESPN host, though, hears that answer and thinks Tiger Woods bailed out. They are teeing off on Tiger Woods, refusing to take the reporters bait and criticized President Trump or complement President Trump. So they start lashing out against Tiger Woods because he wouldn't lash out against the president. For example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, ESPN CO-HOST, \"FIRST TAKE\": Tiger Woods is being -- you said, being slick. Here, he is being slick. He says we must respect the office. Therefore, that confers respect to the occupant. Tiger, is that what you're saying? If that's what you're saying, that is a stupid comment. I don't -- but I don't even know if he believes that that's when he said.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, first of all, we don't know what Tiger Woods believes. He's camblination (ph); he's not black. When he was arrested, he was black.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KILMEADE: Stephen Hayes Smith is one of the brighter people on television. I would love to hear him long form. But Max Kellerman thinks it's just unthinkable, Dana, that Tiger Woods would--</p><p>PERINO: Respect the office of the president?</p><p>KILMEADE: -- respect the office. And he probably likes President Trump in golf has his holes together (ph).</p><p>PERINO: I thought -- well, all people sports, who play sports, athletes, thank you. Looking for the word. They are going to -- thank you for the word -- are going to be asked questions about President Trump, because reporters can't help themselves. And they're always trying to figure out a way, how can can they make headlines? How can they make news?</p><p>The only way to make news, apparently, is the world today is if you ask somebody how they feel about President Trump, even if that has nothing to do about their golf game.</p><p>What I thought is that Tiger Woods knew that a question like that was probably coming. And I took it as a sincere genuine answer of how he feels about the presidency of the United States. And I think that ESPN, they can do whatever they want on their show. But Tiger Woods was prepared for that question. But it wasn't like he was reading somebody else's talking points. I think he believed it.</p><p>KILMEADE: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: Max Kellerman is a virtue-signaling jackass, and here's evidence. Would he have said that to Jim Brown last week? Would he have said it to Jim Brown, you know? Because Jim Brown would have wiped the floor with him. He would have gone to the studio, so he did it because he thought he could get away with it.</p><p>This is the problem with injecting politics into bodies that do not have an immune system for it. So when you inject politics into sports, sports gets sick. When you inject politics into the entertainment world, the entertainment gets world -- the entertainment world gets sick. When you inject politics into academia, what do you get? You get a poison, toxic campus. Whenever you put politics, it gets sick, except on \"The Five.\" Because we are real.</p><p>PERINO: When you put sports -- inject sports into me, I get sick, because I can't even come up with the word \"athlete.\"</p><p>KILMEADE: Put it this way. If people know President Trump, they have a different opinion of President Trump.</p><p>GUTFELD: Tell us about it, Brian.</p><p>KILMEADE: Mike Tyson knows him. Dennis Rodman knows him.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE: Herschel Walker knows him.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE: Just be jotting this down. Tim Scott got a chance to spend a lot of time with him. And guess what? So did Tiger Woods?</p><p>So Jim Brown joined us this morning on \"FOX &amp; Friends.\" He is getting blowback in the black community --</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE: -- for saying \"I like President Trump. I think he's doing a decent job.\" Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM BROWN, NFL HALL OF FAME: The greatest thing about America is that we all have our opinions and our thoughts. Nobody is totally correct in everything that they do. I have access to the president; and any time I have access to the president and he will listen to my thoughts, that's all I can ask of him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: And that's all that he said: \"I have access to the president.\" That's just like Kanye West: \"I have access, and therefore, I want to be\" - - what'd he say, Yeezy?</p><p>KILMEADE: You didn't hear the whole thing, but he does say he liked what he's doing.</p><p>GUTFELD: More than Obama gave them.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know, what's interesting about the Tiger Woods thing is Tiger Woods was asked, \"So what about the politics, then? If you say you respect the office.\"</p><p>And by the way, Max Kellerman, he was right when he said this was a slick move that allowed him to say, \"I respect the office\" without saying, \"Well, what do you think about this president?\"</p><p>KILMEADE: What's wrong with the right answer?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm sorry?</p><p>KILMEADE: What's wrong with the right answer?</p><p>WILLIAMS: What's the right answer?</p><p>KILMEADE: He respects the office of the president.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's not -- that's not an answer.</p><p>KILMEADE: Why isn't it?</p><p>PERINO: Why not? That's a great answer.</p><p>KILMEADE: It's perfect</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let me tell you why. It's like saying you respect X, Y, Z. And you saying, \"I respect X, Y, G but not -- let's not talk about X, Y, Z.\" Here's what he said. He said, \"I just finished 72 holes, and I'm really hungry.\"</p><p>KILMEADE: At the end.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Does that sound like a kid who's trying to get away from --</p><p>KILMEADE: He's 43, and it's the fifth follow-up.</p><p>WILLIAMS: He's a big boy, and in this era, President Trump, not the athletes, have made the issue. President Trump has gone after NFL players, who are protesting. He's gone after Stephen Curry, LeBron James. Shut up and dribble? Because why?</p><p>KILMEADE: He didn't say that. He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: He's always saying that these --</p><p>KILMEADE: He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- people --</p><p>KILMEADE: He said they're not going to the Oval Office. Don't bother.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- they don't want anything to do with him for a very real reason.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CO-HOST: There is one reason why this is happening. The latest poll, 36 percent of African-Americans support the president --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, please.</p><p>BRUCE: -- because their economy is better. Lowest unemployment rate in history for African-Americans. The future is brighter again. They're realizing that the conservative ideal is worthwhile and should be considered. They're hearing other African-Americans they like, like Kanye West, say, \"Wait a minute. Maybe we should be thinking about things.\"</p><p>Tiger Woods and others are not conforming, and that's what they expect of the gay community, African-Americans, women. Even if your lives are better, you will be punished if you say that's OK, because that's all they have left. That's Tiger Woods's crime, apparently.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's not. Tiger Woods plays a game.</p><p>BRUCE: He likes the presidency and the president, and African-American lives are better under this president.</p><p>WILLIAMS: This is ridiculous. This is such a cheap argument about unemployment rates. Let me just say, Tiger Woods plays the game.</p><p>BRUCE: The lowest unemployment rate in history is a cheap argument?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That is a cheap argument. That's ridiculous.</p><p>BRUCE: Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: If you were saying to me, \"Oh, you know what?\"</p><p>BRUCE: Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: \"President Trump is now about lowering black unemployment so that it matches white unemployment. Or President Obama [SIC] -- President Trump is doing something\" --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE: Going after MS-13.</p><p>WILLIAMS: \" -- to encourage job training.\" No, he's not doing any of that.</p><p>Here's what Tiger Woods is about. Tiger Woods realizes that his sponsors and the people who play golf, generally white, maybe Republican. And he is not taking the risk of speaking truth to power.</p><p>KILMEADE: You're -- you're just projecting what you think Tiger Woods is thinking.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I don't know what he thinks.</p><p>GUTFELD: Mind reading.</p><p>KILMEADE: I project this. He's known him for 15, 20 years, and likes him. I'll project that.</p><p>BRUCE: And we all seem to recall --</p><p>KILMEADE: That's probably a better idea.</p><p>PERINO: He also -- I didn't have a chance to talk. He also has to -- a responsibility to himself and to his business and to --</p><p>WILLIAMS: There we go.</p><p>PERINO: So look, if I were his P.R. advisor and I anticipated that question, I'm like, that is a great answer. You might get dinged on ESPN, but if you want to focus, you really want to make a comeback in golf, you've got to focus on this and not allow a distraction with politics.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like, politics in other arenas, sucks. Politics kills everything.</p><p>KILMEADE: All right. So I guess Greg gets the last word. Meanwhile, coming up straight ahead, keeping a room cold is apparently now sexist. That story is next. Please gradually zoom out.</p><p>BRUCE: All right, everybody. Cries of sexism in the New York gubernatorial race, not about politics but about room temperature.</p><p>Cynthia Nixon's team is accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being sexist for trying to debate in a chilly room when they face off tomorrow night.</p><p>Turns out this is a battle many Americans face. A recent survey says 43 percent of coworkers have clashed --</p><p>KILMEADE: To battle.</p><p>BRUCE: -- over being too hot or too cold in the workplace.</p><p>Obviously, Cynthia Nixon is Goldilocks. Look, if she can't handle a room temperature properly, how can she handle being in a variety of different rooms, dealing with politicians, et cetera? Greg, I'm sure you might have something to say about that.</p><p>GUTFELD: She -- she wants 76 degrees in a packed auditorium?</p><p>KILMEADE: It's freezing.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you take the body heat of the -- you're going to put it into the 80s, and they are going to despise her.</p><p>By the way, this is -- it is a fact. This is a biological difference among many. And if you deny it, you're a science denier. We all have -- we have different metabolic rates. So men actually can handle, I guess, the cold better.</p><p>KILMEADE: Women are hotter.</p><p>GUTFELD: That will -- that will end up somewhere. Take it out of context and put it on a blog. There you go.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think it's good news for you, Brian.</p><p>BRUCE: Also, Dana, we -- men and women dress differently in the office. You know?</p><p>PERINO: I'm freezing every day, so I would give her a little tip. In my mug is hot water.</p><p>GUTFELD: Rum. Rum.</p><p>PERINO: No, but that's a good idea.</p><p>GUTFELD: Rum.</p><p>PERINO: If I drank rum, that would be a good idea. It's hot water. I hold my cup and it's hot; and then I get -- I don't have to complain too much about how freezing it is.</p><p>KILMEADE: But is it sexist? That's the problem. Is it sexist?</p><p>PERINO: No, it's not.</p><p>KILMEADE: Is it sexist.</p><p>PERINO: Remember Charlie Crist in Florida?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And he was going to have a debate. And one of the big demands is that he had to have a fan at all times.</p><p>GUTFELD: And where was the fan?</p><p>PERINO: Underneath the podium.</p><p>GUTFELD: It was right at an odd level. It was the strangest thing.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, it's a very strange thing.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like a fan --</p><p>PERINO: And that is not sexist. That is just a demand.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, because there's a reality here. There's a political reality that if you go back, I think it's the 1960 campaign with Nixon/Kennedy. That they had a debate, and Nixon -- Nixon starts to pop sweat.</p><p>GUTFELD: So she wants him to sweat.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And he looks terrible on TV. He looks like he's fleeing a crime scene.</p><p>BRUCE: They have to adjusts, but these days, everything either -- everything has to be sexist. But when you're running -- when our argument is, is that we are the same; women can do what men do. But now everything has to be adjusted because we can't handle a room temperature?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no. That's not what they're saying. They're saying -- she's saying that she wants to eliminate his demand that it be freezing. And he has said he likes a cold environment.</p><p>KILMEADE: In the past, but the thing is, it's like boxing, Juan.</p><p>BRUCE: And she wants it at 76.</p><p>KILMEADE: You're a boxing fan. If you're the champion, you get to pick the ring, the venue.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what she said. She said CBS, the local CBS, the affiliate here in New York, negotiated exclusively with him. Because she wanted several debates. She's only getting one debate on his terms.</p><p>BRUCE: Because he's -- he's leading. And he doesn't even really need to do it, because he's ahead. But thank you for man-splaining that for me.</p><p>Yes, I mean, this is -- this is what you're going to see, and this is what we want. I want women to run for office, but we don't want it to all be about sexism.</p><p>PERINO: I do want it to be comfortable in the room.</p><p>BRUCE: But 76 isn't even comfortable. Right? I mean, she's asking --</p><p>PERINO: No, see it depends. Like, at 75, I'm cold. At 76, I'm hot. So it's, like, 75.5 would be perfect.</p><p>GUTFELD: Do you want to talk about sexism, though? Think about all of the men who built buildings, who built the buildings that people actually use, who risked their lives on girders in the 1960s and the 1970s, who built the bridges.</p><p>KILMEADE: And then blew the money on the track.</p><p>GUTFELD: Or if the -- oh, no, they fell.</p><p>KILMEADE: They fell.</p><p>GUTFELD: Brooklyn Bridge, look at the numbers of people who died on the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><p>BRUCE: All the men who made things possible and now women can help make them possible, too.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>BRUCE: Coming up, \"One More Thing\" is coming up next.</p><p>GUTFELD: \"OMT\" -- Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, Gregory, you know what? Dreams do come true.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, they don't.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And sometimes in doubles. Yes, because that's what happened for Sophia Sanchez, an 11-year-old awaiting a heart transplant in Chicago. She posted a video of her dancing in the hospital with an I.V. in her arm to rapper Drake's \"In My Feelings.\" So then she asked Drake to come visit her. Against all odds, guess what happened? He did.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOPHIA SANCHEZ, HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT: Oh, my God!</p><p>DRAKE, RAP ARTIST: You asked me to come, I'm here. What's up?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Sophia -- Sophia also asked -- and this is the double, Gregory - - Sophia asked for a new heart, because she was struggling. And guess what? The second dream also came true.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're getting a heart.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Congratulations.</p><p>SANCHEZ: I'm getting a heart, Mom!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh. So yesterday, Sophia had the heart implanted and, according to her mom, Natalie, Sophia is doing well. I want you to know, Sophia, you've got five people here at FOX rooting and praying for you.</p><p>PERINO: Like, 500 million.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Really.</p><p>GUTFELD: You have proven me wrong, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wow. What?</p><p>GUTFELD: Now I need to find a heart. All right.</p><p>PERINO: No one's going to give you a heart.</p><p>GUTFELD: No one's going to give me a heart.</p><p>KILMEADE: Especially after this.</p><p>GRAPHIC: Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News</p><p>GUTFELD: \"Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News.\" Got a lot of big news in the Brian Kilmeade spelling arena.

THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Last month, CNN announced a bombshell that Michael Cohen said President  Trump knew about that meeting between his son and a Russian claiming to  have dirt on Hillary.  Something as rare as air.  It was one of a thousand  final nails in the coffin of Trump's presidency.  But then, Lanny Davis,  Hillary's creepy fixer, who's now defending Trump's creepy fixer, figure  that out, says it's creepy client didn't have such info, which is odd since  now it's revealed that creepy Davis was the anonymous creepy source who  supplied creepy CNN with that creepy info that the network then milked to  death while lecturing us on ethics.  So CNN is in a creepy pickle.  There  source for their biggest story of the year is giving us the creeps.  So  you're following this?  Which I wasn't.  I need to run my soul through a  car wash after all this.  </p><p> Unlike the rest of the media who eat this stuff up no matter the sourcing.   They're like a drunk frat boy at 3 AM.  They'll eat a pop tart off the  floor as long as there's ketchup.  So when Avenatti comes knocking, CNN  shrieks like Bieber fans with backstage passes, and why?  Only because it  perpetuates a story that the media can't stop feeding on.  Two years ago,  they were gorging on electing Trump.  Now they gorge on impeaching him.   Avenatti, Cohen, and Davis, three square meals the media devours daily.   But gluttony is a sin, no wonder they all seem so dumb and slow.  And  what's called reporting now is just rumor, spoon-fed from creep seeking  money, power, or fame.  I wish I could ignore them all, but what is it that  that guy keeps saying?  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Long week?  Relax with a glass and let's get after it.   Lots to figure out.  What do you say?  Let's get after it.  It's going to  us two hours to do it, so what do you say?  Let's get after it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GUTFELD:  Let's get after it.  I've got something better.  How about let's  get accurate?  This is an amazing, blockbuster story, Kilmeade.  I want you  to try to get your head around it.  I know it might be tough for you  because you're working all the time.  But this is CNN's source  contradicting what they said to CNN, so somebody is lying.  Do you think  this will be on Michael Stelter's reliable sources?  </p><p> BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:  I say they rather have a test pattern to  put this on his reliable sources.  Lanny Davis is also a crisis expert.   That's where he wrote a book on.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p> KILMEADE:  So here his crisis.  How do I solve the crisis?  Take  responsibility for it.  I'll take the heat and I can handle it.  He also  said the reporting got mixed up through the cross of the criminal  investigation.  No, that didn't work.  I made a mistake.  I did not mean to  be cute.  Never was.  Says he didn't lie to CNN.  He unintentionally  misspoke.  Said he, his instinct -- his instinct --this is what he said  about what Cohen knows.  His instinct was that his client might have  something to say about Mueller, about hacking, but he shouldn't have said  anything.  That is your lawyer.  This is nothing to do with Cohen.  It's  all about Hillary Clinton and Lanny Davis.  Cohen doesn't come up.  </p><p> So the question is, is he worried that Michael Cohen put his hand on the  bible and swore that he was telling the truth and said he had nothing to do  with this -- that Trump knew nothing about this Trump Tower situation.  And  when he came out and says now he knows, then Cohen suddenly looks as though  he created -- he committed perjury, so then he had to backtrack?  Or did he  just make it up and Michael Cohen said you're doing a really bad job.  I  know I'm not paying you, but you can't make things up.  There's more to  this story.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Well, you know -- OK, Dana, I want to stick to the CNN thing  because why not?  It's fun.  That was a natulite 26 story.  CNN said Lanny  Davis didn't make any comment on that.  So, this is from Glenn Greenwald.   I'm actually quoting a Glenn Greenwald article.  But, no.</p><p> DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Wow.</p><p> GUTFELD: . but he's right.  CNN says Lanny Davis refused to comment, so  either CNN lied to its audience about Davis, or Davis is lying now.  </p><p> PERINO:  Or they were -- or they're protecting -- they were trying to  protect him at the time.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p> PERINO: . to protect their source and say it wasn't that why people do  disagree with using background sources.  But in a case -- a situation like  this, then you're dealing with people's lives, including the president in  terms of their future judicial or legal problems, then people do leak and  they do speak on background.  The other thing that's happening here is you  have both camps trying to advance their story with the media on background  trying to be cute.  Then they go on the record.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p> PERINO: . on cable news and they get a little bit crossed wide.  But I  believe CNN says they're sticking with the story.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes, they are.</p><p> PERINO:  Because maybe they have another source that told them that the  story is true.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  And who could that source be?  Is there another lawyer that we're  missing out on?  </p><p> PERINO:  Probably</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes, some other guy.  Tammy, if this were -- this would be -- if  this were on the other side, this would be yet another smoking gun.</p><p> TAMMY Bruce, FOX NEWS HOST:  Sure.</p><p> GUTFELD:  But the media doesn't see this as anything special.  </p><p> BRUCE:  No, and they're going to make it go away.  But, of course, this is  why when the president says fake news, everybody goes nuts.  This is  exactly what he's talking about, the use of an individual.  And this is  almost -- on the theory like too good to check, right?  That they get what  they need from their source to move several days with a huge story at the  time -- it was another nail in the thousand nails, as you've noted.  And  then they get that mileage and they figure that that's all that they need  and that they gin this up in this way, and then it just goes away.  It  floats away.  But the viewers know it.  CNN is now losing their programs to  things like Ancient Aliens.  So, obviously, Ancient Aliens doing things  that CNN won't do and can't do.  So this is what the president complains  about.  It's what you see the crowds at the rallies, you know, yelling at  CNN about.  It hurts not just Cohen and this entire process legally but how  media is viewed again.  It's another nail in a coffin, but it's not  President Trump.  It's a legacy media and what they're willing to do.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Juan, I'm just severely disappointed in the whole legal world  right now.  Aren't you saddened?  </p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Of the legal world?  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes.  These lawyers are just terrible, Juan.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Giuliani, yeah, I would agree.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  I'm way, way, way, in disagreement with all of you on this one  because it seems to me like you're in the weeds and you're just playing out  this tired theme of, oh, the right wing hates the elite mainstream media.   This is not a big story in terms of CNN says they're standing by their  story.  They say they have corroboration for the story.  They've had every  opportunity to say, hey, we made a mistake.  In addition to which,  remember, CNN fired reporters when reporters got an earlier story about  Trump wrong.  So I would think that people on the right would say, huh, CNN  is not firing anybody in this case.  They're not backing off.  And the one  who is saying that he did something wrong is Lanny Davis.  Lanny Davis is a  stand-up guy here and saying, hey. </p><p> KILMEADE:  Stand-up guy?  He made stuff up about.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BRUCE:  And then he lied about it.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  He said he was speculating, Brian.  And he has acknowledged that  he was wrong.</p><p> KILMEADE:  You don't buy that, right?</p><p> WILLIAMS:  What?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  You don't buy that he was speculating?  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  That's what he said.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  I'm just saying if you want to know the important story here,  the important story was when Cohen stood up in court and implicated the  president in an illegal payoff of a porn star.  </p><p> BRUCE:  But when everyone involved is lying at some point.  Look, if you  see a crowd of people who are lying at some point about a variety of  issues, and then you got a guy who's been threatened with life in prison  but pledging that he knows something, no wonder people don't take it  seriously.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  He was in court.  He had -- he put his -- I mean, he could be in  jail.  </p><p> BRUCE:  Don't liberals all the time argue that people will say -- and  they'll confess to things they've never done before simply because of the  pressure by law enforcement?  </p><p> PERINO:  Can I just make one point though, several times and I think Maggie  Haberman reporting the New York Times, at least twice, stories broken,  legal camp on the president side had said not true.  Or the president even  -- fake news or spokesmen said not true.  Then five or six months later you  turn -- oh, it actually is true.  So I think that the media is being played  a little bit but both sides on the legal side of things.  It's difficult to  try these cases on the court of public.</p><p> GUTFELD:  But, you know what?  The thing is there's one side that  definitely wants their story to be true, so they're willing to pay -- play  more fast and loose.  Can we talk about Bruce Ohr?  Is that not a story,  the former DOJ guy who's testifying in a closed door hearing over his  relations with Christopher Steele, the spy who tried to bring Trump down  with that dossier.  This -- in my opinion, this is a pretty, damn, big  story.  He's pushing the dossier created by Fusion GPS, where his wife  works, and then he says he feared of being exposed by this when Comey got  fired.  This is -- I mean, we make fun of the phrase deep state, but this  ain't shallow state.  </p><p> PERINO:  Which is why he's testifying behind closed doors.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yeah.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Right.  Which I think both sides want now because they feel as  though not enough gets done when they're out in public, although I think  Peter Strzok exposing his demeanor, his smugness goes a long way  understanding what goes on -- what was really going on behind closed doors.   This is what Catherine Herridge has told us so far.  She did a great job  standing outside.  So, Bruce Ohr, according to Darrell Issa, his memory is  in-perfect, but he does say he's never had a case like this in 20 years.   He goes on to say when they're caught lying, Simpson said, the first time,  Glenn Simpson who owns Fusion GPS, where Bruce Ohr's wife works, said the  first time that I was dealing with Bruce Ohr was at thanksgiving.  The  problem is there's email exchanges that shows they'd been communicating  since August.  Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, and Glenn Simpson all contradict each  other.  And there's no way that that should be allowed if you're trying to  do an investigation.  And if the FBI or Department of Justice was doing  this investigation, they would not be tolerating this.  So they've got to  get all three out there in front of us and tried to contradict each other.  </p><p> BRUCE:  And you know what we're seeing here is the weaponising, as we've  discussed, of the federal law enforcement framework against a presidential  election and a presidential nominee, a candidate, which is what they  wanted, which was an insurance policy to keep something from happening.  So  when you look at that -- and this is another -- it's a blessing for  conservatives everywhere.  Particular communities in this country talk  about law enforcement, framing people, making up evidence, targeting  individuals to get them -- deciding that the ends justifies the means, and  a lot of people who don't go through that experience say, oh, that could  never really happen.  We're now seeing it happen at a federal level.  So  it's an education for all of us.  Not just at that level but at the local  level as well when it comes to what law enforcement is willing to do.  And  the cleanup that has to happen around the country for all of us just when  it comes to who we trust and whether or not we're going to really take it  seriously.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  So, in other words -- so you're just happy defaming the FBI, the  Justice Department, anybody that's questioning President Trump.  This is  the story again.  So here we are.  Oh, this means that there's nothing,  nothing that the president has done wrong.  President Trump is a victim.   This is madness.  I mean, you have to ignore the facts on the ground.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  We're just reporting the story about this guy.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  You have to ignore the fact that Bruce Ohr is an  expert on Russia.  You have to ignore the fact that therefore people like  Christopher Steele would be going to Bruce Ohr and saying, hey, guess what,  Sally Yates just got tossed.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BRUCE:  Juan, you should be upset too, because all these corruptions and  all of these back-and-forth.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  What corruption?</p><p> BRUCE:  And Bruce Ohr saying we're going to get caught, that obscures any  legitimate investigation that people may be would have wanted.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  All I know is.</p><p> BRUCE:  Because this becomes the story.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Let me just say, I think we had the president going after Jeff  Sessions, his own Republican attorney general.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Who recused himself.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Yes.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  He's not doing anything.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Right.  So he's going after Rod Rosenstein.  He's going after  the FBI.  Who else -- who isn't he going after?  </p><p> GUTFELD:  All I can say is.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KILMEADE:  Just look at this.  Juan, just look at this.  Nobody said Donald  Trump is playing the perfect game so far.  All we're saying is look at the  text messages and the exchanges.  Look at the facts.  You should be as  outraged as anybody.  And then, pick your time when Trump is out of control  and say this is out of control.  But this is not Trump.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  You know what?  Feels like this Ohr is in hot water.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GUTFELD:  Republicans warning voters about what will happen if Nancy Pelosi  becomes speaker again.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> PERINO:  The Trump effect being put to the test again in key primaries  today.  Trump backed Congressman Ron Desantis is trying to secure the  Republican nomination to replace outgoing Florida Governor Rick Scott.  And  Scott is looking to wrap up the GOP senate nodded with a big boost from  Trump.  And in Arizona, it's a senate Republican primary featuring three  candidates who are all strongly behind the president's agenda.  In the  backdrop of tonight races, a major warning sign for Republican midterm  voters.  GOP lawmakers are circulating a list of potential issues Democrats  may investigate if they retake the house.  Will this threat helped turn out  the base?  </p><p> The list is pretty amazing.  It's basically of all the list that the house  Democrats have sent requesting hearings on such issues as President Trump's  tax returns, President Trump's family business, the payment to Stormy  Daniels, James Comey's firing, cabinet secretary travel, the travel ban,  family separation, on and on.  It's basically, pretty much, nothing else  would get done except for investigations, if this were to actually happen.   So the Republicans -- sometimes, Tammy, you have to scare your base into  turning out.  </p><p> BRUCE:  You do.  And yet, this is pretty much what people want to do.   They're still talking about impeachment even though some people are saying,  well, that's not really a good idea.  Even Adam Schiff the other day said,  well, we really can't really talk about that right now.  But if President  Trump is everything they say he is.  I mean, he's Hitler.  He's carrying  babies away from moms.  Why wouldn't you want to?  Why suddenly if he's the  worst guy in the world but then you really don't want to investigate  anything or you don't want to impeach him.  And so that's what we're  looking at.  And these are serious things that the Democrats have been  running on and have been talking to their base about.  And we can expect  them to do it partly because they don't want to govern.  That's been a big  problem with Democrats.  They gin up the bases, they get people all  excited, but they don't want to govern.  And this.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Where did you get that from?  </p><p> BRUCE:  From the last eight years with Barack Obama.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  Oh, please, are you kidding?  I think  Republicans, in fact, thought that he -- it was overreaching, doing too  much, and had to obstruct him.  I could go on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BRUCE:  Bill Clinton governed.  And that's why that administration, even  with impeachment, worked because he enjoyed the process.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  I think -- look, I think, just seriously, Dana has a point here  about who's stirring up the base.  That this is an action being taken by  Republicans right now to say if you allow Democrats to take control of the  house, we are going to lose President Trump because he may be impeached.   And they see this, and I think rightly, as stirring up the GOP base because  it's so strongly pro-Trump.  And that those people then will turn out and  not turn off, given all the bad news that Trump is experiencing.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  So stirring up the base though -- let's go back to this because  telling the truth can actually stir up the base.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yeah.  And I like how the Democrats are pretending that they  aren't really interested impeachment.  That's like a teenager trying to  sneak a bottle of booze outside the house -- outside the house in front of  their parents.  Oh, no, it's just a water bottle.  We know the Democrats  are waiting to spring this on if they get the house.  They're playing this  down so they can then raise it when they can.  So I do believe telling --  telling the truth can be stirring the base, by the way.  Democrats stir the  base by painting Trump is Hitler.  You know as.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  No, no, she said separating children from their parents.  Boy, I  think that's true.  Oh, my God.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Stirring the base.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  How about this?  Democrats want to do away with ICE, how about  that?  Oh, yeah, they want to do away with ICE. </p><p> PERINO:  The point about family separation policy, there're already was a  hearing about that.  And so.  </p><p> BRUCE:  And then we'll have to deal with Barack Obama's establishment of  it, and the fact that.  </p><p> PERINO:  The other thing is that the Democrats -- you know, they're finding  out that some of their fringe on the left that come up with ideas like  abolishing ICE, and it's not just the fringe, some mainstream Democrats as  well.  It's not going over so well.  There was a poll taken by A.P., 57  percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, but the number that don't  -- there's only 18 percent of Democrats favor dismantling this, Ok?  So  they're having to answer questions for things that their left, far left is  suggesting.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  But some of that -- high profile people are saying it.  Bernie  Sanders, Gillibrand, and they're the ones saying it.  And you can just say  OK.  You deal with it because it's not somebody writing this and they're  not putting their name on it, these are major speeches given in front of  major audiences to get a loud round of applause.  The Democrats who have  been successful in the special election, he's the close the gap or walk  away with the win are the ones who are in the middle that still clearly  criticize Trump.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Brian, you want to get rid of the Ice Capades, which I think is  heartless.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PERINO:  Why do you feel that way about the Ice Capades?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  The Ice Capades, I feel like it never ends.  There's no  beginning and there's no end.  I feel like.</p><p> GUTFELD:  And by the way, there's no scoring either at Ice Capades.</p><p> KILMEADE:  Crickets scares me.</p><p> PERINO:  All right, up next, President Trump with a new warning for Google  after claiming the company is silencing conservatives, up next.</p><p> GUTFELD:  What is a Capades?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  President Trump going after Google this morning on twitter,  accusing the tech giant of being politically biased against conservatives.   The president claims searched results are, quote, rigged, end quote,  against him and other Republicans as well to suppress any good news about  the Trump presidency.  Now, the president doubling down this very  afternoon. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Yeah, I think  Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a  very serious thing and it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and  what others are doing, if you look at what's going-on on twitter, if you  look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you  can't do that to people.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Google firing back saying its searches don't promote a political  agenda.  So what do you think?  </p><p> BRUCE:  Look, we have a history with all of the social media, and Facebook  is also mentioned as a very good example.  Remember their trending stories  column that they said was the trending news of the day based on their  algorithms.  And then we realize that there was no real conservative sites,  there's no conservative stories, there was nothing pro-conservative, and  former editors came out and said that they routinely suppressed  conservative news, things that conservatives would make them look good or  would be of interest to conservatives, and then they had to eventually  shutdown that entire framework.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Let me pick up on this and ask you a question.  Much of it has  to do, according to Google, with the idea that if you are searching  something they give you what they call accredited sites like big newspapers  that they have a sense of trust in their content as opposed to giving them  simply opinionated sites that are likely tilted.  </p><p> BRUCE:  But that's the problem is that when you're liberal and you see a  liberal side, that is the one that is legitimate to you, and you're going  to view an opposing website in a different way because you don't agree with  it.  So if you're going to rank certain websites, you're going to rank them  based on whether or not it looks like real life to you.  That, look, if  you're a liberal or a conservative, you're not going to look at your own  material as being biased because it's what you also believe.  And this is  why when you've got 80 percent -- 85 percent of American media identifies  effectively as liberal, as not conservative, and then you're going to have  a Google determine which sites are going to be more legitimate, they're  going to rate more legitimate the sites that they agree with that looks  like their worldview.  And automatically.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  What about -- and it seems to me like saying there's no truth,  there's no fact, there's no accurate news coverage in the country, so you  just give me liberal opinion or give me conservative opinions.  Is that  we're saying?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  No, I think they're talking about -- this is the hottest issue  in the country and there's no easy answer.  This is the stem cell research  of our generation, of this decade, because everyone thinks social media is  the problem for their own reasons.  I don't necessarily have the reason but  Amazon, Google, Facebook, and twitter, they have to -- we have to come up  with something that will work.  I think, fundamentally, they actually want  to get it to work.  I think there's legitimate criticisms of those sites.   My frustration is when -- for example, CEO Jack Dorsey comes to Capitol  Hill to go in front of the energy committee on September 5th, next week, is  there going to be anyone who's an expert to be able to ask him the types of  questions.  They're going to move the conversation forward or we going to  see a bunch.  </p><p> PERINO:  So you think those hearings are unsatisfying?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Well, I know you're being sarcastic.  But we need somebody in  the middle that is unbiased to say here's an idea of what to do because  lawmakers who belong to a party are not capable of coming up with an  answer.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  By the way, Brian, Larry Kudlow said today, well, he's looking  at the possibility of regulating them.  And I think. </p><p> KILMEADE:  I don't know where you start?  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  But that is so shocking to me that he would  suggest that the government now. </p><p> PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow, I mean, he's a free-market guy and  conservatives typically are not for more regulation.  I would add that --  1:40 PM today, before the Daily Briefings, I checked Google News --</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Your show.</p><p> PERINO:  -- to see what was there.  And the No. 1 story was a CNN story  about debunking a Trump myth of some sort.  A CNN Money story was about how  Google is rigged against conservatives, based on the president's tweet.   And the third story was the FOX News story about Tiger Woods.  And I think  we're going to talk about that later.  </p><p> So I think that there's -- there's a lot of room for this algorithm to be  manipulated.  And all of these sites are privately-held companies.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  And they're powerful.</p><p> PERINO:  But they also would say to you, \"It doesn't make sense for us to  alienate half of the country\" when they're trying to make money.  Remember,  it was Michael Jordan said Republicans buy shoes, too.  So they're going to  try to make a free-market argument next week.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, Greg, so I was surprised to see that the president's going  after Google.  He had a bad week, and I guess he does his rage Googling --</p><p> KILMEADE:  That was last week.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  -- and says, \"Oh, my God.  Look at -- they've got negative  stories here from New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.\" </p><p> GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  \"I don't like these stories.  Give me some conservative thing.\"  But here's Trump back in July.  He says the European Union is fining  Google, and they're one of America's greatest companies.  </p><p> PERINO:  Oh, right.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  But today, it's a different story.  </p><p> PERINO:  That's right.</p><p> GUTFELD:  I mean, it surprises you Trump changes his opinion?  I mean, it's  been going on for two years.  I think what Google is guilty of, everyone  else in the media.  They're chasing words and not deeds.  </p><p> The deeds are good news.  We have an 18-year high in optimism right now.   That's not being reported.  If you want onto Google and Googled Mexican  trade, you would've gotten the top stories about the awkward phone call.   You wouldn't have gotten the Mexican trade story.  </p><p> And he's just like us.  He Googles his name, and he gets mad when there's  bad news.  If you Google \"Kilmeade,\" the first thing --</p><p> KILMEADE:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p> GUTFELD:  -- you're going to get is \"hairpiece.\"  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Right, right.</p><p> GUTFELD:  But don't Google Kilmeade and hairpiece, because then you'll see  what happens.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  No, but 99 percent of the stuff on us is negative.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes, yes, yes.  And I'm used to it.</p><p> And if you look at Google Doodles, which I love.  You know, instead of  Easter, they'll have an activist.  Instead of Christmas, they'll do some  kind of festival.  Instead of Burning Man -- I mean, they'll do Burning Man  instead of Lou Dobbs's birthday.  They're the king of virtue signaling.  </p><p> You ask, like, why would you alienate half the conversation?  It's to keep  activists at bay.  They would rather alienate half a population than have  somebody come after them and say, \"You're bigoted.  You're sexist.  You're  racists.\"</p><p> They need to do a Google search on wisdom.  Because right now, what they're  doing is they're helping China in their A.I.   Correct?  But they are  leaving -- they want to leave helping the military and making more precise  drones that actually save lives.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  OK, I've got a question for you about Alex Jones.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Because we know that some of these sites pushed Alex Jones and  his conspiracy theories off on the idea that it's hate speech.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Why wouldn't you want to support that, Greg? </p><p> GUTFELD:  I think Alex Jones is hate speech.  It's the same way I feel  about Louis Farrakhan.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  OK.  ESPN melting down --</p><p> GUTFELD:  Where is he?  On Twitter wearing a bowtie.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  -- over Tiger Woods's refusal to criticize President Trump.  The  growing controversy -- you heard Dana reference it -- when we return.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you say to people who might find it interesting  that you have, I guess, a friendly relationship with him?  </p><p> TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER:  Well, he's our -- he's the president of  the United States.  And you have to respect the office, and no matter who's  in the office.  You may like, dislike personality or the politics.  But we  all must respect the office.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KILMEADE:  But he's done that.  What was wrong with that answer?  ESPN  host, though, hears that answer and thinks Tiger Woods bailed out.  They  are teeing off on Tiger Woods, refusing to take the reporters bait and  criticized President Trump or complement President Trump.  So they start  lashing out against Tiger Woods because he wouldn't lash out against the  president.  For example.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX KELLERMAN, ESPN CO-HOST, \"FIRST TAKE\":  Tiger Woods is being -- you  said, being slick.  Here, he is being slick.  He says we must respect the  office.  Therefore, that confers respect to the occupant.  Tiger, is that  what you're saying?  If that's what you're saying, that is a stupid  comment.  I don't -- but I don't even know if he believes that that's when  he said.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, first of all, we don't know what Tiger Woods  believes.  He's camblination (ph); he's not black.  When he was arrested,  he was black.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KILMEADE:  Stephen Hayes Smith is one of the brighter people on television.   I would love to hear him long form.  But Max Kellerman thinks it's just  unthinkable, Dana, that Tiger Woods would--</p><p> PERINO:  Respect the office of the president?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  -- respect the office.  And he probably likes President Trump in  golf has his holes together (ph).</p><p> PERINO:  I thought -- well, all people sports, who play sports, athletes,  thank you.  Looking for the word.  They are going to -- thank you for the  word -- are going to be asked questions about President Trump, because  reporters can't help themselves.  And they're always trying to figure out a  way, how can can they make headlines?  How can they make news?</p><p> The only way to make news, apparently, is the world today is if you ask  somebody how they feel about President Trump, even if that has nothing to  do about their golf game.  </p><p> What I thought is that Tiger Woods knew that a question like that was  probably coming.  And I took it as a sincere genuine answer of how he feels  about the presidency of the United States.  And I think that ESPN, they can  do whatever they want on their show.  But Tiger Woods was prepared for that  question.  But it wasn't like he was reading somebody else's talking  points.  I think he believed it.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Yes.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Max Kellerman is a virtue-signaling jackass, and here's evidence.   Would he have said that to Jim Brown last week?  Would he have said it to  Jim Brown, you know?  Because Jim Brown would have wiped the floor with  him.  He would have gone to the studio, so he did it because he thought he  could get away with it.  </p><p> This is the problem with injecting politics into bodies that do not have an  immune system for it.  So when you inject politics into sports, sports gets  sick.  When you inject politics into the entertainment world, the  entertainment gets world -- the entertainment world gets sick.  When you  inject politics into academia, what do you get?  You get a poison, toxic  campus.  Whenever you put politics, it gets sick, except on \"The Five.\"   Because we are real.  </p><p> PERINO:  When you put sports -- inject sports into me, I get sick, because  I can't even come up with the word \"athlete.\"  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Put it this way.  If people know President Trump, they have a  different opinion of President Trump.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Tell us about it, Brian.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Mike Tyson knows him.  Dennis Rodman knows him.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p> KILMEADE:  Herschel Walker knows him.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p> KILMEADE:  Just be jotting this down.  Tim Scott got a chance to spend a  lot of time with him.  And guess what?  So did Tiger Woods?</p><p> So Jim Brown joined us this morning on \"FOX &amp; Friends.\"  He is getting  blowback in the black community --</p><p> PERINO:  Yes.</p><p> KILMEADE:  -- for saying \"I like President Trump.  I think he's doing a  decent job.\"  Listen. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JIM BROWN, NFL HALL OF FAME:  The greatest thing about America is that we  all have our opinions and our thoughts.  Nobody is totally correct in  everything that they do.  I have access to the president; and any time I  have access to the president and he will listen to my thoughts, that's all  I can ask of him.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  And that's all that he said: \"I have access to the president.\"   That's just like Kanye West: \"I have access, and therefore, I want to be\" - - what'd he say, Yeezy?</p><p> KILMEADE:  You didn't hear the whole thing, but he does say he liked what  he's doing.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  More than Obama gave them.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  But you know, what's interesting about the Tiger Woods thing is  Tiger Woods was asked, \"So what about the politics, then?  If you say you  respect the office.\"  </p><p> And by the way, Max Kellerman, he was right when he said this was a slick  move that allowed him to say, \"I respect the office\" without saying, \"Well,  what do you think about this president?\" </p><p> KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p> WILLIAMS:  I'm sorry?</p><p> KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p> WILLIAMS:  What's the right answer?</p><p> KILMEADE:  He respects the office of the president.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  That's not -- that's not an answer.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Why isn't it?</p><p> PERINO:  Why not?  That's a great answer.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  It's perfect</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Let me tell you why.  It's like saying you respect X, Y, Z.  And  you saying, \"I respect X, Y, G but not -- let's not talk about X, Y, Z.\"   Here's what he said.  He said, \"I just finished 72 holes, and I'm really  hungry.\"</p><p> KILMEADE:  At the end.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Does that sound like a kid who's trying to get away from  --</p><p> KILMEADE:  He's 43, and it's the fifth follow-up.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  He's a big boy, and in this era, President Trump, not the  athletes, have made the issue.  President Trump has gone after NFL players,  who are protesting.  He's gone after Stephen Curry, LeBron James.  Shut up  and dribble?  Because why?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  He didn't say that.  He never said that.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  He's always saying that these -- </p><p> KILMEADE:  He never said that.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  -- people --</p><p> KILMEADE:  He said they're not going to the Oval Office.  Don't bother.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  -- they don't want anything to do with him for a very real  reason.</p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, CO-HOST:  There is one reason why this is happening.  The  latest poll, 36 percent of African-Americans support the president --</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Oh, please.</p><p> BRUCE:  -- because their economy is better.  Lowest unemployment rate in  history for African-Americans.  The future is brighter again.  They're  realizing that the conservative ideal is worthwhile and should be  considered.  They're hearing other African-Americans they like, like Kanye  West, say, \"Wait a minute.  Maybe we should be thinking about things.\"  </p><p> Tiger Woods and others are not conforming, and that's what they expect of  the gay community, African-Americans, women.  Even if your lives are  better, you will be punished if you say that's OK, because that's all they  have left.  That's Tiger Woods's crime, apparently.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  That's not.  Tiger Woods plays a game.  </p><p> BRUCE:  He likes the presidency and the president, and African-American  lives are better under this president.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  This is such a cheap argument about  unemployment rates.  Let me just say, Tiger Woods plays the game.</p><p> BRUCE:  The lowest unemployment rate in history is a cheap argument? </p><p> WILLIAMS:  That is a cheap argument.  That's ridiculous.  </p><p> BRUCE:  Juan.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  If you were saying to me, \"Oh, you know what?\"</p><p> BRUCE:  Juan.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  \"President Trump is now about lowering black unemployment so  that it matches white unemployment.  Or President Obama [SIC] -- President  Trump is doing something\" --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BRUCE:  Going after MS-13.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  \" -- to encourage job training.\"  No, he's not doing any of  that.  </p><p> Here's what Tiger Woods is about.  Tiger Woods realizes that his sponsors  and the people who play golf, generally white, maybe Republican.  And he is  not taking the risk of speaking truth to power.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  You're -- you're just projecting what you think Tiger Woods is  thinking.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  No, I don't know what he thinks.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Mind reading.</p><p> KILMEADE:  I project this.  He's known him for 15, 20 years, and likes him.   I'll project that.  </p><p> BRUCE:  And we all seem to recall --</p><p> KILMEADE:  That's probably a better idea.  </p><p> PERINO:  He also -- I didn't have a chance to talk.  He also has to -- a  responsibility to himself and to his business and to --</p><p> WILLIAMS:  There we go.</p><p> PERINO:  So look, if I were his P.R. advisor and I anticipated that  question, I'm like, that is a great answer.  You might get dinged on ESPN,  but if you want to focus, you really want to make a comeback in golf,  you've got to focus on this and not allow a distraction with politics.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Like, politics in other arenas, sucks.  Politics kills  everything.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  All right.  So I guess Greg gets the last word.  Meanwhile,  coming up straight ahead, keeping a room cold is apparently now sexist.   That story is next.  Please gradually zoom out.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BRUCE:  All right, everybody.  Cries of sexism in the New York  gubernatorial race, not about politics but about room temperature.  </p><p> Cynthia Nixon's team is accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being sexist for  trying to debate in a chilly room when they face off tomorrow night.  </p><p> Turns out this is a battle many Americans face.  A recent survey says 43  percent of coworkers have clashed --</p><p> KILMEADE:  To battle.</p><p> BRUCE:  -- over being too hot or too cold in the workplace.  </p><p> Obviously, Cynthia Nixon is Goldilocks.  Look, if she can't handle a room  temperature properly, how can she handle being in a variety of different  rooms, dealing with politicians, et cetera?  Greg, I'm sure you might have  something to say about that.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  She -- she wants 76 degrees in a packed auditorium? </p><p> KILMEADE:  It's freezing.</p><p> GUTFELD:  If you take the body heat of the -- you're going to put it into  the 80s, and they are going to despise her.  </p><p> By the way, this is -- it is a fact.  This is a biological difference among  many.  And if you deny it, you're a science denier.  We all have -- we have  different metabolic rates.  So men actually can handle, I guess, the cold  better.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Women are hotter.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  That will -- that will end up somewhere.  Take it out of context  and put it on a blog.  There you go.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  I think it's good news for you, Brian.  </p><p> BRUCE:  Also, Dana, we -- men and women dress differently in the office.   You know?</p><p> PERINO:  I'm freezing every day, so I would give her a little tip.  In my  mug is hot water.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Rum.  Rum.</p><p> PERINO:  No, but that's a good idea.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Rum.</p><p> PERINO:  If I drank rum, that would be a good idea.  It's hot water.  I  hold my cup and it's hot; and then I get -- I don't have to complain too  much about how freezing it is.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  But is it sexist?  That's the problem.  Is it sexist?</p><p> PERINO:  No, it's not.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Is it sexist.</p><p> PERINO:  Remember Charlie Crist in Florida?  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p> PERINO:  And he was going to have a debate.  And one of the big demands is  that he had to have a fan at all times. </p><p> GUTFELD:  And where was the fan?</p><p> PERINO:  Underneath the podium.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  It was right at an odd level.  It was the strangest thing.  </p><p> PERINO:  Yes, it's a very strange thing.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Like a fan --</p><p> PERINO:  And that is not sexist.  That is just a demand.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Yes, because there's a reality here.  There's a political  reality that if you go back, I think it's the 1960 campaign with  Nixon/Kennedy.  That they had a debate, and Nixon -- Nixon starts to pop  sweat.</p><p> GUTFELD:  So she wants him to sweat.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  And he looks terrible on TV.  He looks like he's fleeing a crime  scene.  </p><p> BRUCE:  They have to adjusts, but these days, everything either --  everything has to be sexist.  But when you're running -- when our argument  is, is that we are the same; women can do what men do.  But now everything  has to be adjusted because we can't handle a room temperature? </p><p> WILLIAMS:  No, no, no.  That's not what they're saying.  They're saying --  she's saying that she wants to eliminate his demand that it be freezing.   And he has said he likes a cold environment.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  In the past, but the thing is, it's like boxing, Juan.</p><p> BRUCE:  And she wants it at 76.</p><p> KILMEADE:  You're a boxing fan.  If you're the champion, you get to pick  the ring, the venue.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  That's what she said.  She said CBS, the local CBS, the  affiliate here in New York, negotiated exclusively with him.  Because she  wanted several debates.  She's only getting one debate on his terms.  </p><p> BRUCE:  Because he's -- he's leading.  And he doesn't even really need to  do it, because he's ahead.  But thank you for man-splaining that for me.  </p><p> Yes, I mean, this is -- this is what you're going to see, and this is what  we want.  I want women to run for office, but we don't want it to all be  about sexism.  </p><p> PERINO:  I do want it to be comfortable in the room.  </p><p> BRUCE:  But 76 isn't even comfortable.  Right?  I mean, she's asking -- </p><p> PERINO:  No, see it depends.  Like, at 75, I'm cold.  At 76, I'm hot.  So  it's, like, 75.5 would be perfect.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Do you want to talk about sexism, though?  Think about all of the  men who built buildings, who built the buildings that people actually use,  who risked their lives on girders in the 1960s and the 1970s, who built the  bridges.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  And then blew the money on the track.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Or if the -- oh, no, they fell.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  They fell.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Brooklyn Bridge, look at the numbers of people who died on the  Brooklyn Bridge.  </p><p> BRUCE:  All the men who made things possible and now women can help make  them possible, too.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  There you go.</p><p> BRUCE:  Coming up, \"One More Thing\" is coming up next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GUTFELD:  \"OMT\" -- Juan.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, Gregory, you know what?  Dreams do come true. </p><p> GUTFELD:  No, they don't.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  And sometimes in doubles.  Yes, because that's what happened for  Sophia Sanchez, an 11-year-old awaiting a heart transplant in Chicago.  She  posted a video of her dancing in the hospital with an I.V. in her arm to  rapper Drake's \"In My Feelings.\"  So then she asked Drake to come visit  her.  Against all odds, guess what happened?  He did.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SOPHIA SANCHEZ, HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT:  Oh, my God! </p><p> DRAKE, RAP ARTIST:  You asked me to come, I'm here.  What's up?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Sophia -- Sophia also asked -- and this is the double, Gregory - - Sophia asked for a new heart, because she was struggling.  And guess  what?

THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, CNN announced a bombshell that Michael Cohen said President  Trump knew about that meeting between his son and a Russian claiming to  have dirt on Hillary.  Something as rare as air.  It was one of a thousand  final nails in the coffin of Trump's presidency.  But then, Lanny Davis,  Hillary's creepy fixer, who's now defending Trump's creepy fixer, figure  that out, says it's creepy client didn't have such info, which is odd since  now it's revealed that creepy Davis was the anonymous creepy source who  supplied creepy CNN with that creepy info that the network then milked to  death while lecturing us on ethics.  So CNN is in a creepy pickle.  There  source for their biggest story of the year is giving us the creeps.  So  you're following this?  Which I wasn't.  I need to run my soul through a  car wash after all this.  </p><p>Unlike the rest of the media who eat this stuff up no matter the sourcing.   They're like a drunk frat boy at 3 AM.  They'll eat a pop tart off the  floor as long as there's ketchup.  So when Avenatti comes knocking, CNN  shrieks like Bieber fans with backstage passes, and why?  Only because it  perpetuates a story that the media can't stop feeding on.  Two years ago,  they were gorging on electing Trump.  Now they gorge on impeaching him.   Avenatti, Cohen, and Davis, three square meals the media devours daily.   But gluttony is a sin, no wonder they all seem so dumb and slow.  And  what's called reporting now is just rumor, spoon-fed from creep seeking  money, power, or fame.  I wish I could ignore them all, but what is it that  that guy keeps saying?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Long week?  Relax with a glass and let's get after it.   Lots to figure out.  What do you say?  Let's get after it.  It's going to  us two hours to do it, so what do you say?  Let's get after it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Let's get after it.  I've got something better.  How about let's  get accurate?  This is an amazing, blockbuster story, Kilmeade.  I want you  to try to get your head around it.  I know it might be tough for you  because you're working all the time.  But this is CNN's source  contradicting what they said to CNN, so somebody is lying.  Do you think  this will be on Michael Stelter's reliable sources?  </p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:  I say they rather have a test pattern to  put this on his reliable sources.  Lanny Davis is also a crisis expert.   That's where he wrote a book on.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>KILMEADE:  So here his crisis.  How do I solve the crisis?  Take  responsibility for it.  I'll take the heat and I can handle it.  He also  said the reporting got mixed up through the cross of the criminal  investigation.  No, that didn't work.  I made a mistake.  I did not mean to  be cute.  Never was.  Says he didn't lie to CNN.  He unintentionally  misspoke.  Said he, his instinct -- his instinct --this is what he said  about what Cohen knows.  His instinct was that his client might have  something to say about Mueller, about hacking, but he shouldn't have said  anything.  That is your lawyer.  This is nothing to do with Cohen.  It's  all about Hillary Clinton and Lanny Davis.  Cohen doesn't come up.  </p><p>So the question is, is he worried that Michael Cohen put his hand on the  bible and swore that he was telling the truth and said he had nothing to do  with this -- that Trump knew nothing about this Trump Tower situation.  And  when he came out and says now he knows, then Cohen suddenly looks as though  he created -- he committed perjury, so then he had to backtrack?  Or did he  just make it up and Michael Cohen said you're doing a really bad job.  I  know I'm not paying you, but you can't make things up.  There's more to  this story.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, you know -- OK, Dana, I want to stick to the CNN thing  because why not?  It's fun.  That was a natulite 26 story.  CNN said Lanny  Davis didn't make any comment on that.  So, this is from Glenn Greenwald.   I'm actually quoting a Glenn Greenwald article.  But, no.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: . but he's right.  CNN says Lanny Davis refused to comment, so  either CNN lied to its audience about Davis, or Davis is lying now.  </p><p>PERINO:  Or they were -- or they're protecting -- they were trying to  protect him at the time.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>PERINO: . to protect their source and say it wasn't that why people do  disagree with using background sources.  But in a case -- a situation like  this, then you're dealing with people's lives, including the president in  terms of their future judicial or legal problems, then people do leak and  they do speak on background.  The other thing that's happening here is you  have both camps trying to advance their story with the media on background  trying to be cute.  Then they go on the record.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>PERINO: . on cable news and they get a little bit crossed wide.  But I  believe CNN says they're sticking with the story.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, they are.</p><p>PERINO:  Because maybe they have another source that told them that the  story is true.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  And who could that source be?  Is there another lawyer that we're  missing out on?  </p><p>PERINO:  Probably</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, some other guy.  Tammy, if this were -- this would be -- if  this were on the other side, this would be yet another smoking gun.</p><p>TAMMY Bruce, FOX NEWS HOST:  Sure.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But the media doesn't see this as anything special.  </p><p>BRUCE:  No, and they're going to make it go away.  But, of course, this is  why when the president says fake news, everybody goes nuts.  This is  exactly what he's talking about, the use of an individual.  And this is  almost -- on the theory like too good to check, right?  That they get what  they need from their source to move several days with a huge story at the  time -- it was another nail in the thousand nails, as you've noted.  And  then they get that mileage and they figure that that's all that they need  and that they gin this up in this way, and then it just goes away.  It  floats away.  But the viewers know it.  CNN is now losing their programs to  things like Ancient Aliens.  So, obviously, Ancient Aliens doing things  that CNN won't do and can't do.  So this is what the president complains  about.  It's what you see the crowds at the rallies, you know, yelling at  CNN about.  It hurts not just Cohen and this entire process legally but how  media is viewed again.  It's another nail in a coffin, but it's not  President Trump.  It's a legacy media and what they're willing to do.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Juan, I'm just severely disappointed in the whole legal world  right now.  Aren't you saddened?  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Of the legal world?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.  These lawyers are just terrible, Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Giuliani, yeah, I would agree.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm way, way, way, in disagreement with all of you on this one  because it seems to me like you're in the weeds and you're just playing out  this tired theme of, oh, the right wing hates the elite mainstream media.   This is not a big story in terms of CNN says they're standing by their  story.  They say they have corroboration for the story.  They've had every  opportunity to say, hey, we made a mistake.  In addition to which,  remember, CNN fired reporters when reporters got an earlier story about  Trump wrong.  So I would think that people on the right would say, huh, CNN  is not firing anybody in this case.  They're not backing off.  And the one  who is saying that he did something wrong is Lanny Davis.  Lanny Davis is a  stand-up guy here and saying, hey. </p><p>KILMEADE:  Stand-up guy?  He made stuff up about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  And then he lied about it.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He said he was speculating, Brian.  And he has acknowledged that  he was wrong.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that, right?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that he was speculating?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what he said.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm just saying if you want to know the important story here,  the important story was when Cohen stood up in court and implicated the  president in an illegal payoff of a porn star.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But when everyone involved is lying at some point.  Look, if you  see a crowd of people who are lying at some point about a variety of  issues, and then you got a guy who's been threatened with life in prison  but pledging that he knows something, no wonder people don't take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He was in court.  He had -- he put his -- I mean, he could be in  jail.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Don't liberals all the time argue that people will say -- and  they'll confess to things they've never done before simply because of the  pressure by law enforcement?  </p><p>PERINO:  Can I just make one point though, several times and I think Maggie  Haberman reporting the New York Times, at least twice, stories broken,  legal camp on the president side had said not true.  Or the president even  -- fake news or spokesmen said not true.  Then five or six months later you  turn -- oh, it actually is true.  So I think that the media is being played  a little bit but both sides on the legal side of things.  It's difficult to  try these cases on the court of public.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But, you know what?  The thing is there's one side that  definitely wants their story to be true, so they're willing to pay -- play  more fast and loose.  Can we talk about Bruce Ohr?  Is that not a story,  the former DOJ guy who's testifying in a closed door hearing over his  relations with Christopher Steele, the spy who tried to bring Trump down  with that dossier.  This -- in my opinion, this is a pretty, damn, big  story.  He's pushing the dossier created by Fusion GPS, where his wife  works, and then he says he feared of being exposed by this when Comey got  fired.  This is -- I mean, we make fun of the phrase deep state, but this  ain't shallow state.  </p><p>PERINO:  Which is why he's testifying behind closed doors.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right.  Which I think both sides want now because they feel as  though not enough gets done when they're out in public, although I think  Peter Strzok exposing his demeanor, his smugness goes a long way  understanding what goes on -- what was really going on behind closed doors.   This is what Catherine Herridge has told us so far.  She did a great job  standing outside.  So, Bruce Ohr, according to Darrell Issa, his memory is  in-perfect, but he does say he's never had a case like this in 20 years.   He goes on to say when they're caught lying, Simpson said, the first time,  Glenn Simpson who owns Fusion GPS, where Bruce Ohr's wife works, said the  first time that I was dealing with Bruce Ohr was at thanksgiving.  The  problem is there's email exchanges that shows they'd been communicating  since August.  Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, and Glenn Simpson all contradict each  other.  And there's no way that that should be allowed if you're trying to  do an investigation.  And if the FBI or Department of Justice was doing  this investigation, they would not be tolerating this.  So they've got to  get all three out there in front of us and tried to contradict each other.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And you know what we're seeing here is the weaponising, as we've  discussed, of the federal law enforcement framework against a presidential  election and a presidential nominee, a candidate, which is what they  wanted, which was an insurance policy to keep something from happening.  So  when you look at that -- and this is another -- it's a blessing for  conservatives everywhere.  Particular communities in this country talk  about law enforcement, framing people, making up evidence, targeting  individuals to get them -- deciding that the ends justifies the means, and  a lot of people who don't go through that experience say, oh, that could  never really happen.  We're now seeing it happen at a federal level.  So  it's an education for all of us.  Not just at that level but at the local  level as well when it comes to what law enforcement is willing to do.  And  the cleanup that has to happen around the country for all of us just when  it comes to who we trust and whether or not we're going to really take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  So, in other words -- so you're just happy defaming the FBI, the  Justice Department, anybody that's questioning President Trump.  This is  the story again.  So here we are.  Oh, this means that there's nothing,  nothing that the president has done wrong.  President Trump is a victim.   This is madness.  I mean, you have to ignore the facts on the ground.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  We're just reporting the story about this guy.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  You have to ignore the fact that Bruce Ohr is an  expert on Russia.  You have to ignore the fact that therefore people like  Christopher Steele would be going to Bruce Ohr and saying, hey, guess what,  Sally Yates just got tossed.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan, you should be upset too, because all these corruptions and  all of these back-and-forth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What corruption?</p><p>BRUCE:  And Bruce Ohr saying we're going to get caught, that obscures any  legitimate investigation that people may be would have wanted.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  All I know is.</p><p>BRUCE:  Because this becomes the story.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me just say, I think we had the president going after Jeff  Sessions, his own Republican attorney general.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Who recused himself.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He's not doing anything.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  So he's going after Rod Rosenstein.  He's going after  the FBI.  Who else -- who isn't he going after?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  All I can say is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just look at this.  Juan, just look at this.  Nobody said Donald  Trump is playing the perfect game so far.  All we're saying is look at the  text messages and the exchanges.  Look at the facts.  You should be as  outraged as anybody.  And then, pick your time when Trump is out of control  and say this is out of control.  But this is not Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  You know what?  Feels like this Ohr is in hot water.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Republicans warning voters about what will happen if Nancy Pelosi  becomes speaker again.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO:  The Trump effect being put to the test again in key primaries  today.  Trump backed Congressman Ron Desantis is trying to secure the  Republican nomination to replace outgoing Florida Governor Rick Scott.  And  Scott is looking to wrap up the GOP senate nodded with a big boost from  Trump.  And in Arizona, it's a senate Republican primary featuring three  candidates who are all strongly behind the president's agenda.  In the  backdrop of tonight races, a major warning sign for Republican midterm  voters.  GOP lawmakers are circulating a list of potential issues Democrats  may investigate if they retake the house.  Will this threat helped turn out  the base?  </p><p>The list is pretty amazing.  It's basically of all the list that the house  Democrats have sent requesting hearings on such issues as President Trump's  tax returns, President Trump's family business, the payment to Stormy  Daniels, James Comey's firing, cabinet secretary travel, the travel ban,  family separation, on and on.  It's basically, pretty much, nothing else  would get done except for investigations, if this were to actually happen.   So the Republicans -- sometimes, Tammy, you have to scare your base into  turning out.  </p><p>BRUCE:  You do.  And yet, this is pretty much what people want to do.   They're still talking about impeachment even though some people are saying,  well, that's not really a good idea.  Even Adam Schiff the other day said,  well, we really can't really talk about that right now.  But if President  Trump is everything they say he is.  I mean, he's Hitler.  He's carrying  babies away from moms.  Why wouldn't you want to?  Why suddenly if he's the  worst guy in the world but then you really don't want to investigate  anything or you don't want to impeach him.  And so that's what we're  looking at.  And these are serious things that the Democrats have been  running on and have been talking to their base about.  And we can expect  them to do it partly because they don't want to govern.  That's been a big  problem with Democrats.  They gin up the bases, they get people all  excited, but they don't want to govern.  And this.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Where did you get that from?  </p><p>BRUCE:  From the last eight years with Barack Obama.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  Oh, please, are you kidding?  I think  Republicans, in fact, thought that he -- it was overreaching, doing too  much, and had to obstruct him.  I could go on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Bill Clinton governed.  And that's why that administration, even  with impeachment, worked because he enjoyed the process.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think -- look, I think, just seriously, Dana has a point here  about who's stirring up the base.  That this is an action being taken by  Republicans right now to say if you allow Democrats to take control of the  house, we are going to lose President Trump because he may be impeached.   And they see this, and I think rightly, as stirring up the GOP base because  it's so strongly pro-Trump.  And that those people then will turn out and  not turn off, given all the bad news that Trump is experiencing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  So stirring up the base though -- let's go back to this because  telling the truth can actually stir up the base.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  And I like how the Democrats are pretending that they  aren't really interested impeachment.  That's like a teenager trying to  sneak a bottle of booze outside the house -- outside the house in front of  their parents.  Oh, no, it's just a water bottle.  We know the Democrats  are waiting to spring this on if they get the house.  They're playing this  down so they can then raise it when they can.  So I do believe telling --  telling the truth can be stirring the base, by the way.  Democrats stir the  base by painting Trump is Hitler.  You know as.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, she said separating children from their parents.  Boy, I  think that's true.  Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Stirring the base.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about this?  Democrats want to do away with ICE, how about  that?  Oh, yeah, they want to do away with ICE. </p><p>PERINO:  The point about family separation policy, there're already was a  hearing about that.  And so.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And then we'll have to deal with Barack Obama's establishment of  it, and the fact that.  </p><p>PERINO:  The other thing is that the Democrats -- you know, they're finding  out that some of their fringe on the left that come up with ideas like  abolishing ICE, and it's not just the fringe, some mainstream Democrats as  well.  It's not going over so well.  There was a poll taken by A.P., 57  percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, but the number that don't  -- there's only 18 percent of Democrats favor dismantling this, Ok?  So  they're having to answer questions for things that their left, far left is  suggesting.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But some of that -- high profile people are saying it.  Bernie  Sanders, Gillibrand, and they're the ones saying it.  And you can just say  OK.  You deal with it because it's not somebody writing this and they're  not putting their name on it, these are major speeches given in front of  major audiences to get a loud round of applause.  The Democrats who have  been successful in the special election, he's the close the gap or walk  away with the win are the ones who are in the middle that still clearly  criticize Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian, you want to get rid of the Ice Capades, which I think is  heartless.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Why do you feel that way about the Ice Capades?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  The Ice Capades, I feel like it never ends.  There's no  beginning and there's no end.  I feel like.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And by the way, there's no scoring either at Ice Capades.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Crickets scares me.</p><p>PERINO:  All right, up next, President Trump with a new warning for Google  after claiming the company is silencing conservatives, up next.</p><p>GUTFELD:  What is a Capades?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  President Trump going after Google this morning on twitter,  accusing the tech giant of being politically biased against conservatives.   The president claims searched results are, quote, rigged, end quote,  against him and other Republicans as well to suppress any good news about  the Trump presidency.  Now, the president doubling down this very  afternoon. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Yeah, I think  Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a  very serious thing and it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and  what others are doing, if you look at what's going-on on twitter, if you  look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you  can't do that to people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Google firing back saying its searches don't promote a political  agenda.  So what do you think?  </p><p>BRUCE:  Look, we have a history with all of the social media, and Facebook  is also mentioned as a very good example.  Remember their trending stories  column that they said was the trending news of the day based on their  algorithms.  And then we realize that there was no real conservative sites,  there's no conservative stories, there was nothing pro-conservative, and  former editors came out and said that they routinely suppressed  conservative news, things that conservatives would make them look good or  would be of interest to conservatives, and then they had to eventually  shutdown that entire framework.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me pick up on this and ask you a question.  Much of it has  to do, according to Google, with the idea that if you are searching  something they give you what they call accredited sites like big newspapers  that they have a sense of trust in their content as opposed to giving them  simply opinionated sites that are likely tilted.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But that's the problem is that when you're liberal and you see a  liberal side, that is the one that is legitimate to you, and you're going  to view an opposing website in a different way because you don't agree with  it.  So if you're going to rank certain websites, you're going to rank them  based on whether or not it looks like real life to you.  That, look, if  you're a liberal or a conservative, you're not going to look at your own  material as being biased because it's what you also believe.  And this is  why when you've got 80 percent -- 85 percent of American media identifies  effectively as liberal, as not conservative, and then you're going to have  a Google determine which sites are going to be more legitimate, they're  going to rate more legitimate the sites that they agree with that looks  like their worldview.  And automatically.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What about -- and it seems to me like saying there's no truth,  there's no fact, there's no accurate news coverage in the country, so you  just give me liberal opinion or give me conservative opinions.  Is that  we're saying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, I think they're talking about -- this is the hottest issue  in the country and there's no easy answer.  This is the stem cell research  of our generation, of this decade, because everyone thinks social media is  the problem for their own reasons.  I don't necessarily have the reason but  Amazon, Google, Facebook, and twitter, they have to -- we have to come up  with something that will work.  I think, fundamentally, they actually want  to get it to work.  I think there's legitimate criticisms of those sites.   My frustration is when -- for example, CEO Jack Dorsey comes to Capitol  Hill to go in front of the energy committee on September 5th, next week, is  there going to be anyone who's an expert to be able to ask him the types of  questions.  They're going to move the conversation forward or we going to  see a bunch.  </p><p>PERINO:  So you think those hearings are unsatisfying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Well, I know you're being sarcastic.  But we need somebody in  the middle that is unbiased to say here's an idea of what to do because  lawmakers who belong to a party are not capable of coming up with an  answer.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  By the way, Brian, Larry Kudlow said today, well, he's looking  at the possibility of regulating them.  And I think. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I don't know where you start?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  But that is so shocking to me that he would  suggest that the government now. </p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow, I mean, he's a free-market guy and  conservatives typically are not for more regulation.  I would add that --  1:40 PM today, before the Daily Briefings, I checked Google News --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Your show.</p><p>PERINO:  -- to see what was there.  And the No. 1 story was a CNN story  about debunking a Trump myth of some sort.  A CNN Money story was about how  Google is rigged against conservatives, based on the president's tweet.   And the third story was the FOX News story about Tiger Woods.  And I think  we're going to talk about that later.  </p><p>So I think that there's -- there's a lot of room for this algorithm to be  manipulated.  And all of these sites are privately-held companies.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And they're powerful.</p><p>PERINO:  But they also would say to you, \"It doesn't make sense for us to  alienate half of the country\" when they're trying to make money.  Remember,  it was Michael Jordan said Republicans buy shoes, too.  So they're going to  try to make a free-market argument next week.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Greg, so I was surprised to see that the president's going  after Google.  He had a bad week, and I guess he does his rage Googling --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That was last week.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- and says, \"Oh, my God.  Look at -- they've got negative  stories here from New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.\" </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"I don't like these stories.  Give me some conservative thing.\"  But here's Trump back in July.  He says the European Union is fining  Google, and they're one of America's greatest companies.  </p><p>PERINO:  Oh, right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But today, it's a different story.  </p><p>PERINO:  That's right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  I mean, it surprises you Trump changes his opinion?  I mean, it's  been going on for two years.  I think what Google is guilty of, everyone  else in the media.  They're chasing words and not deeds.  </p><p>The deeds are good news.  We have an 18-year high in optimism right now.   That's not being reported.  If you want onto Google and Googled Mexican  trade, you would've gotten the top stories about the awkward phone call.   You wouldn't have gotten the Mexican trade story.  </p><p>And he's just like us.  He Googles his name, and he gets mad when there's  bad news.  If you Google \"Kilmeade,\" the first thing --</p><p>KILMEADE:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>GUTFELD:  -- you're going to get is \"hairpiece.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right, right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But don't Google Kilmeade and hairpiece, because then you'll see  what happens.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, but 99 percent of the stuff on us is negative.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, yes, yes.  And I'm used to it.</p><p>And if you look at Google Doodles, which I love.  You know, instead of  Easter, they'll have an activist.  Instead of Christmas, they'll do some  kind of festival.  Instead of Burning Man -- I mean, they'll do Burning Man  instead of Lou Dobbs's birthday.  They're the king of virtue signaling.  </p><p>You ask, like, why would you alienate half the conversation?  It's to keep  activists at bay.  They would rather alienate half a population than have  somebody come after them and say, \"You're bigoted.  You're sexist.  You're  racists.\"</p><p>They need to do a Google search on wisdom.  Because right now, what they're  doing is they're helping China in their A.I.   Correct?  But they are  leaving -- they want to leave helping the military and making more precise  drones that actually save lives.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK, I've got a question for you about Alex Jones.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Because we know that some of these sites pushed Alex Jones and  his conspiracy theories off on the idea that it's hate speech.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Why wouldn't you want to support that, Greg? </p><p>GUTFELD:  I think Alex Jones is hate speech.  It's the same way I feel  about Louis Farrakhan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK.  ESPN melting down --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Where is he?  On Twitter wearing a bowtie.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- over Tiger Woods's refusal to criticize President Trump.  The  growing controversy -- you heard Dana reference it -- when we return.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you say to people who might find it interesting  that you have, I guess, a friendly relationship with him?  </p><p>TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER:  Well, he's our -- he's the president of  the United States.  And you have to respect the office, and no matter who's  in the office.  You may like, dislike personality or the politics.  But we  all must respect the office.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KILMEADE:  But he's done that.  What was wrong with that answer?  ESPN  host, though, hears that answer and thinks Tiger Woods bailed out.  They  are teeing off on Tiger Woods, refusing to take the reporters bait and  criticized President Trump or complement President Trump.  So they start  lashing out against Tiger Woods because he wouldn't lash out against the  president.  For example.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, ESPN CO-HOST, \"FIRST TAKE\":  Tiger Woods is being -- you  said, being slick.  Here, he is being slick.  He says we must respect the  office.  Therefore, that confers respect to the occupant.  Tiger, is that  what you're saying?  If that's what you're saying, that is a stupid  comment.  I don't -- but I don't even know if he believes that that's when  he said.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, first of all, we don't know what Tiger Woods  believes.  He's camblination (ph); he's not black.  When he was arrested,  he was black.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Stephen Hayes Smith is one of the brighter people on television.   I would love to hear him long form.  But Max Kellerman thinks it's just  unthinkable, Dana, that Tiger Woods would--</p><p>PERINO:  Respect the office of the president?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  -- respect the office.  And he probably likes President Trump in  golf has his holes together (ph).</p><p>PERINO:  I thought -- well, all people sports, who play sports, athletes,  thank you.  Looking for the word.  They are going to -- thank you for the  word -- are going to be asked questions about President Trump, because  reporters can't help themselves.  And they're always trying to figure out a  way, how can can they make headlines?  How can they make news?</p><p>The only way to make news, apparently, is the world today is if you ask  somebody how they feel about President Trump, even if that has nothing to  do about their golf game.  </p><p>What I thought is that Tiger Woods knew that a question like that was  probably coming.  And I took it as a sincere genuine answer of how he feels  about the presidency of the United States.  And I think that ESPN, they can  do whatever they want on their show.  But Tiger Woods was prepared for that  question.  But it wasn't like he was reading somebody else's talking  points.  I think he believed it.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Max Kellerman is a virtue-signaling jackass, and here's evidence.   Would he have said that to Jim Brown last week?  Would he have said it to  Jim Brown, you know?  Because Jim Brown would have wiped the floor with  him.  He would have gone to the studio, so he did it because he thought he  could get away with it.  </p><p>This is the problem with injecting politics into bodies that do not have an  immune system for it.  So when you inject politics into sports, sports gets  sick.  When you inject politics into the entertainment world, the  entertainment gets world -- the entertainment world gets sick.  When you  inject politics into academia, what do you get?  You get a poison, toxic  campus.  Whenever you put politics, it gets sick, except on \"The Five.\"   Because we are real.  </p><p>PERINO:  When you put sports -- inject sports into me, I get sick, because  I can't even come up with the word \"athlete.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Put it this way.  If people know President Trump, they have a  different opinion of President Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Tell us about it, Brian.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Mike Tyson knows him.  Dennis Rodman knows him.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Herschel Walker knows him.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just be jotting this down.  Tim Scott got a chance to spend a  lot of time with him.  And guess what?  So did Tiger Woods?</p><p>So Jim Brown joined us this morning on \"FOX &amp; Friends.\"  He is getting  blowback in the black community --</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  -- for saying \"I like President Trump.  I think he's doing a  decent job.\"  Listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JIM BROWN, NFL HALL OF FAME:  The greatest thing about America is that we  all have our opinions and our thoughts.  Nobody is totally correct in  everything that they do.  I have access to the president; and any time I  have access to the president and he will listen to my thoughts, that's all  I can ask of him.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And that's all that he said: \"I have access to the president.\"   That's just like Kanye West: \"I have access, and therefore, I want to be\" - - what'd he say, Yeezy?</p><p>KILMEADE:  You didn't hear the whole thing, but he does say he liked what  he's doing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  More than Obama gave them.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  But you know, what's interesting about the Tiger Woods thing is  Tiger Woods was asked, \"So what about the politics, then?  If you say you  respect the office.\"  </p><p>And by the way, Max Kellerman, he was right when he said this was a slick  move that allowed him to say, \"I respect the office\" without saying, \"Well,  what do you think about this president?\" </p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm sorry?</p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What's the right answer?</p><p>KILMEADE:  He respects the office of the president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not -- that's not an answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Why isn't it?</p><p>PERINO:  Why not?  That's a great answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's perfect</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me tell you why.  It's like saying you respect X, Y, Z.  And  you saying, \"I respect X, Y, G but not -- let's not talk about X, Y, Z.\"   Here's what he said.  He said, \"I just finished 72 holes, and I'm really  hungry.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  At the end.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Does that sound like a kid who's trying to get away from  --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He's 43, and it's the fifth follow-up.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's a big boy, and in this era, President Trump, not the  athletes, have made the issue.  President Trump has gone after NFL players,  who are protesting.  He's gone after Stephen Curry, LeBron James.  Shut up  and dribble?  Because why?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He didn't say that.  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's always saying that these -- </p><p>KILMEADE:  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- people --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He said they're not going to the Oval Office.  Don't bother.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- they don't want anything to do with him for a very real  reason.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CO-HOST:  There is one reason why this is happening.  The  latest poll, 36 percent of African-Americans support the president --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, please.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- because their economy is better.  Lowest unemployment rate in  history for African-Americans.  The future is brighter again.  They're  realizing that the conservative ideal is worthwhile and should be  considered.  They're hearing other African-Americans they like, like Kanye  West, say, \"Wait a minute.  Maybe we should be thinking about things.\"  </p><p>Tiger Woods and others are not conforming, and that's what they expect of  the gay community, African-Americans, women.  Even if your lives are  better, you will be punished if you say that's OK, because that's all they  have left.  That's Tiger Woods's crime, apparently.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not.  Tiger Woods plays a game.  </p><p>BRUCE:  He likes the presidency and the president, and African-American  lives are better under this president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  This is such a cheap argument about  unemployment rates.  Let me just say, Tiger Woods plays the game.</p><p>BRUCE:  The lowest unemployment rate in history is a cheap argument? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That is a cheap argument.  That's ridiculous.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  If you were saying to me, \"Oh, you know what?\"</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"President Trump is now about lowering black unemployment so  that it matches white unemployment.  Or President Obama [SIC] -- President  Trump is doing something\" --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Going after MS-13.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \" -- to encourage job training.\"  No, he's not doing any of  that.  </p><p>Here's what Tiger Woods is about.  Tiger Woods realizes that his sponsors  and the people who play golf, generally white, maybe Republican.  And he is  not taking the risk of speaking truth to power.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- you're just projecting what you think Tiger Woods is  thinking.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, I don't know what he thinks.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Mind reading.</p><p>KILMEADE:  I project this.  He's known him for 15, 20 years, and likes him.   I'll project that.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And we all seem to recall --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's probably a better idea.  </p><p>PERINO:  He also -- I didn't have a chance to talk.  He also has to -- a  responsibility to himself and to his business and to --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There we go.</p><p>PERINO:  So look, if I were his P.R. advisor and I anticipated that  question, I'm like, that is a great answer.  You might get dinged on ESPN,  but if you want to focus, you really want to make a comeback in golf,  you've got to focus on this and not allow a distraction with politics.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like, politics in other arenas, sucks.  Politics kills  everything.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  All right.  So I guess Greg gets the last word.  Meanwhile,  coming up straight ahead, keeping a room cold is apparently now sexist.   That story is next.  Please gradually zoom out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  All right, everybody.  Cries of sexism in the New York  gubernatorial race, not about politics but about room temperature.  </p><p>Cynthia Nixon's team is accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being sexist for  trying to debate in a chilly room when they face off tomorrow night.  </p><p>Turns out this is a battle many Americans face.  A recent survey says 43  percent of coworkers have clashed --</p><p>KILMEADE:  To battle.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- over being too hot or too cold in the workplace.  </p><p>Obviously, Cynthia Nixon is Goldilocks.  Look, if she can't handle a room  temperature properly, how can she handle being in a variety of different  rooms, dealing with politicians, et cetera?  Greg, I'm sure you might have  something to say about that.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  She -- she wants 76 degrees in a packed auditorium? </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's freezing.</p><p>GUTFELD:  If you take the body heat of the -- you're going to put it into  the 80s, and they are going to despise her.  </p><p>By the way, this is -- it is a fact.  This is a biological difference among  many.  And if you deny it, you're a science denier.  We all have -- we have  different metabolic rates.  So men actually can handle, I guess, the cold  better.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Women are hotter.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  That will -- that will end up somewhere.  Take it out of context  and put it on a blog.  There you go.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think it's good news for you, Brian.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Also, Dana, we -- men and women dress differently in the office.   You know?</p><p>PERINO:  I'm freezing every day, so I would give her a little tip.  In my  mug is hot water.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  No, but that's a good idea.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  If I drank rum, that would be a good idea.  It's hot water.  I  hold my cup and it's hot; and then I get -- I don't have to complain too  much about how freezing it is.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But is it sexist?  That's the problem.  Is it sexist?</p><p>PERINO:  No, it's not.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Is it sexist.</p><p>PERINO:  Remember Charlie Crist in Florida?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  And he was going to have a debate.  And one of the big demands is  that he had to have a fan at all times. </p><p>GUTFELD:  And where was the fan?</p><p>PERINO:  Underneath the podium.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  It was right at an odd level.  It was the strangest thing.  </p><p>PERINO:  Yes, it's a very strange thing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like a fan --</p><p>PERINO:  And that is not sexist.  That is just a demand.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, because there's a reality here.  There's a political  reality that if you go back, I think it's the 1960 campaign with  Nixon/Kennedy.  That they had a debate, and Nixon -- Nixon starts to pop  sweat.</p><p>GUTFELD:  So she wants him to sweat.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And he looks terrible on TV.  He looks like he's fleeing a crime  scene.  </p><p>BRUCE:  They have to adjusts, but these days, everything either --  everything has to be sexist.  But when you're running -- when our argument  is, is that we are the same; women can do what men do.  But now everything  has to be adjusted because we can't handle a room temperature? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, no.  That's not what they're saying.  They're saying --  she's saying that she wants to eliminate his demand that it be freezing.   And he has said he likes a cold environment.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  In the past, but the thing is, it's like boxing, Juan.</p><p>BRUCE:  And she wants it at 76.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're a boxing fan.  If you're the champion, you get to pick  the ring, the venue.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what she said.  She said CBS, the local CBS, the  affiliate here in New York, negotiated exclusively with him.  Because she  wanted several debates.  She's only getting one debate on his terms.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Because he's -- he's leading.  And he doesn't even really need to  do it, because he's ahead.  But thank you for man-splaining that for me.  </p><p>Yes, I mean, this is -- this is what you're going to see, and this is what  we want.  I want women to run for office, but we don't want it to all be  about sexism.  </p><p>PERINO:  I do want it to be comfortable in the room.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But 76 isn't even comfortable.  Right?  I mean, she's asking -- </p><p>PERINO:  No, see it depends.  Like, at 75, I'm cold.  At 76, I'm hot.  So  it's, like, 75.5 would be perfect.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Do you want to talk about sexism, though?  Think about all of the  men who built buildings, who built the buildings that people actually use,  who risked their lives on girders in the 1960s and the 1970s, who built the  bridges.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And then blew the money on the track.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Or if the -- oh, no, they fell.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  They fell.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Brooklyn Bridge, look at the numbers of people who died on the  Brooklyn Bridge.  </p><p>BRUCE:  All the men who made things possible and now women can help make  them possible, too.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  There you go.</p><p>BRUCE:  Coming up, \"One More Thing\" is coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"OMT\" -- Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Gregory, you know what?  Dreams do come true. </p><p>GUTFELD:  No, they don't.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And sometimes in doubles.  Yes, because that's what happened for  Sophia Sanchez, an 11-year-old awaiting a heart transplant in Chicago.  She  posted a video of her dancing in the hospital with an I.V. in her arm to  rapper Drake's \"In My Feelings.\"  So then she asked Drake to come visit  her.  Against all odds, guess what happened?  He did.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOPHIA SANCHEZ, HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT:  Oh, my God! </p><p>DRAKE, RAP ARTIST:  You asked me to come, I'm here.  What's up?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Sophia -- Sophia also asked -- and this is the double, Gregory - - Sophia asked for a new heart, because she was struggling.  And guess  what?  The second dream also came true. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're getting a heart.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  I'm getting a heart, Mom!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, my gosh.  So yesterday, Sophia had the heart implanted and,  according to her mom, Natalie, Sophia is doing well.  I want you to know,  Sophia, you've got five people here at FOX rooting and praying for you. </p><p>PERINO:  Like, 500 million.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Really. </p><p>GUTFELD:  You have proven me wrong, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wow.  What?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Now I need to find a heart.  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  No one's going to give you a heart.</p><p>GUTFELD:  No one's going to give me a heart.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Especially after this.</p><p>GRAPHIC:  Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News.\"  Got a lot of big news in  the Brian Kilmeade spelling arena.  Let's go live to tape.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  There's a word that  Canada has trouble with.  It's M-I-L-K.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Now, in terms of Canada, I guess Canada hates milk.  I mean,  hates to talk about milk, M-A-L-K.  </p><p>STEVE DOOCY, CO-HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  They're lactose intolerant.</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's what you've got.</p><p>DOOCY:  By the way, Brian -- Brian, did you say -- it's \"M-I-L-K\". </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're right.  Thank you very much.</p><p>DOOCY:  Not \"M-A-L-K.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- thanks for correcting me.  You helped me, saved a  headline.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  How nice of Larry to correct you on television.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  That would have slipped by the Gutfeld staff, except for Larry  corrected me. </p><p>PERINO:  I thought I heard you say \"I\" in my -- OK, you didn't. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I know how to spell \"milk,\" just not in the morning. </p><p>GUTFELD:  Dana. </p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about \"potato\"? </p><p>PERINO:  I have something to promote.  I'm going to be on Tucker Carlson  tonight at 8 p.m., so you can check that out there.  We have a graphic.   Yes, I have a graphic today.  </p><p>Marie Unanue, she has a new book.  She's a friend of mine.  And it is  called \"The Adventures of Phatty and Payaso: Central Park,\" ad it's a  children's book, a chapter book, actually.  So if you are a little more  advanced, you might like it.  Phatty and Payaso, they go to Central Park.   They want to go take a stand against bullying, but then they get -- all  sorts of adventures.  They have a LetsBeKind.com adventure that goes with  it, if you want to check it out.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Real quick, my paperback of \"Andrew Jackson: Miracle of New  Orleans,\" includes what other presidents thought of Andrew Jackson, because  he's so controversial today.  It's coming out in October.  And I'm going to  couple it with three events.  One in Tampa, one in Norfolk, one in  Nashville.  His BrianKilmeade.com.  </p><p>I want to talk about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli  pirates, as well as \"Andrew Jackson: Miracle of New Orleans.\"  \"America  Great from the Start.\"  Because so many people have problems with our  history, I wanted to have a live event where people can ask questions.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Excellent, brain.  Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  And for everyone's books and events, you can now get a pumpkin  spice latte.  I know fall does not start until the 22, but already the  pumpkin spice latte is out.  It is their biggest selling drink of all time.</p><p>GUTFELD:  I love it.  I love it.</p><p>BRUCE:  I -- I love it as well.</p><p>PERINO:  You do?</p><p>BRUE:  Normally, I like regular coffee but in this case, that's for me -- </p><p>PERINO:  In 95 degree heat? </p><p>BRUCE:  In season, sure.</p><p>KILMEADE:  But they use real pumpkin.</p><p>BRUCE:  They use real pumpkin, and you can get a pumpkin scones.  You can  get, like, a cookie in the shape of an owl that's a pumpkin.  So welcome to  fall, and enjoy the pumpkin spice latte.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  All right.  Set your DVRs.

THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Last month, CNN announced a bombshell that Michael Cohen said President  Trump knew about that meeting between his son and a Russian claiming to  have dirt on Hillary.  Something as rare as air.  It was one of a thousand  final nails in the coffin of Trump's presidency.  But then, Lanny Davis,  Hillary's creepy fixer, who's now defending Trump's creepy fixer, figure  that out, says it's creepy client didn't have such info, which is odd since  now it's revealed that creepy Davis was the anonymous creepy source who  supplied creepy CNN with that creepy info that the network then milked to  death while lecturing us on ethics.  So CNN is in a creepy pickle.  There  source for their biggest story of the year is giving us the creeps.  So  you're following this?  Which I wasn't.  I need to run my soul through a  car wash after all this.  </p><p> Unlike the rest of the media who eat this stuff up no matter the sourcing.   They're like a drunk frat boy at 3 AM.  They'll eat a pop tart off the  floor as long as there's ketchup.  So when Avenatti comes knocking, CNN  shrieks like Bieber fans with backstage passes, and why?  Only because it  perpetuates a story that the media can't stop feeding on.  Two years ago,  they were gorging on electing Trump.  Now they gorge on impeaching him.   Avenatti, Cohen, and Davis, three square meals the media devours daily.   But gluttony is a sin, no wonder they all seem so dumb and slow.  And  what's called reporting now is just rumor, spoon-fed from creep seeking  money, power, or fame.  I wish I could ignore them all, but what is it that  that guy keeps saying?  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Long week?  Relax with a glass and let's get after it.   Lots to figure out.  What do you say?  Let's get after it.  It's going to  us two hours to do it, so what do you say?  Let's get after it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GUTFELD:  Let's get after it.  I've got something better.  How about let's  get accurate?  This is an amazing, blockbuster story, Kilmeade.  I want you  to try to get your head around it.  I know it might be tough for you  because you're working all the time.  But this is CNN's source  contradicting what they said to CNN, so somebody is lying.  Do you think  this will be on Michael Stelter's reliable sources?  </p><p> BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:  I say they rather have a test pattern to  put this on his reliable sources.  Lanny Davis is also a crisis expert.   That's where he wrote a book on.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p> KILMEADE:  So here his crisis.  How do I solve the crisis?  Take  responsibility for it.  I'll take the heat and I can handle it.  He also  said the reporting got mixed up through the cross of the criminal  investigation.  No, that didn't work.  I made a mistake.  I did not mean to  be cute.  Never was.  Says he didn't lie to CNN.  He unintentionally  misspoke.  Said he, his instinct -- his instinct --this is what he said  about what Cohen knows.  His instinct was that his client might have  something to say about Mueller, about hacking, but he shouldn't have said  anything.  That is your lawyer.  This is nothing to do with Cohen.  It's  all about Hillary Clinton and Lanny Davis.  Cohen doesn't come up.  </p><p> So the question is, is he worried that Michael Cohen put his hand on the  bible and swore that he was telling the truth and said he had nothing to do  with this -- that Trump knew nothing about this Trump Tower situation.  And  when he came out and says now he knows, then Cohen suddenly looks as though  he created -- he committed perjury, so then he had to backtrack?  Or did he  just make it up and Michael Cohen said you're doing a really bad job.  I  know I'm not paying you, but you can't make things up.  There's more to  this story.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Well, you know -- OK, Dana, I want to stick to the CNN thing  because why not?  It's fun.  That was a natulite 26 story.  CNN said Lanny  Davis didn't make any comment on that.  So, this is from Glenn Greenwald.   I'm actually quoting a Glenn Greenwald article.  But, no.</p><p> DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Wow.</p><p> GUTFELD: . but he's right.  CNN says Lanny Davis refused to comment, so  either CNN lied to its audience about Davis, or Davis is lying now.  </p><p> PERINO:  Or they were -- or they're protecting -- they were trying to  protect him at the time.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p> PERINO: . to protect their source and say it wasn't that why people do  disagree with using background sources.  But in a case -- a situation like  this, then you're dealing with people's lives, including the president in  terms of their future judicial or legal problems, then people do leak and  they do speak on background.  The other thing that's happening here is you  have both camps trying to advance their story with the media on background  trying to be cute.  Then they go on the record.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p> PERINO: . on cable news and they get a little bit crossed wide.  But I  believe CNN says they're sticking with the story.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes, they are.</p><p> PERINO:  Because maybe they have another source that told them that the  story is true.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  And who could that source be?  Is there another lawyer that we're  missing out on?  </p><p> PERINO:  Probably</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes, some other guy.  Tammy, if this were -- this would be -- if  this were on the other side, this would be yet another smoking gun.</p><p> TAMMY Bruce, FOX NEWS HOST:  Sure.</p><p> GUTFELD:  But the media doesn't see this as anything special.  </p><p> BRUCE:  No, and they're going to make it go away.  But, of course, this is  why when the president says fake news, everybody goes nuts.  This is  exactly what he's talking about, the use of an individual.  And this is  almost -- on the theory like too good to check, right?  That they get what  they need from their source to move several days with a huge story at the  time -- it was another nail in the thousand nails, as you've noted.  And  then they get that mileage and they figure that that's all that they need  and that they gin this up in this way, and then it just goes away.  It  floats away.  But the viewers know it.  CNN is now losing their programs to  things like Ancient Aliens.  So, obviously, Ancient Aliens doing things  that CNN won't do and can't do.  So this is what the president complains  about.  It's what you see the crowds at the rallies, you know, yelling at  CNN about.  It hurts not just Cohen and this entire process legally but how  media is viewed again.  It's another nail in a coffin, but it's not  President Trump.  It's a legacy media and what they're willing to do.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Juan, I'm just severely disappointed in the whole legal world  right now.  Aren't you saddened?  </p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Of the legal world?  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes.  These lawyers are just terrible, Juan.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Giuliani, yeah, I would agree.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  I'm way, way, way, in disagreement with all of you on this one  because it seems to me like you're in the weeds and you're just playing out  this tired theme of, oh, the right wing hates the elite mainstream media.   This is not a big story in terms of CNN says they're standing by their  story.  They say they have corroboration for the story.  They've had every  opportunity to say, hey, we made a mistake.  In addition to which,  remember, CNN fired reporters when reporters got an earlier story about  Trump wrong.  So I would think that people on the right would say, huh, CNN  is not firing anybody in this case.  They're not backing off.  And the one  who is saying that he did something wrong is Lanny Davis.  Lanny Davis is a  stand-up guy here and saying, hey. </p><p> KILMEADE:  Stand-up guy?  He made stuff up about.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BRUCE:  And then he lied about it.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  He said he was speculating, Brian.  And he has acknowledged that  he was wrong.</p><p> KILMEADE:  You don't buy that, right?</p><p> WILLIAMS:  What?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  You don't buy that he was speculating?  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  That's what he said.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  I'm just saying if you want to know the important story here,  the important story was when Cohen stood up in court and implicated the  president in an illegal payoff of a porn star.  </p><p> BRUCE:  But when everyone involved is lying at some point.  Look, if you  see a crowd of people who are lying at some point about a variety of  issues, and then you got a guy who's been threatened with life in prison  but pledging that he knows something, no wonder people don't take it  seriously.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  He was in court.  He had -- he put his -- I mean, he could be in  jail.  </p><p> BRUCE:  Don't liberals all the time argue that people will say -- and  they'll confess to things they've never done before simply because of the  pressure by law enforcement?  </p><p> PERINO:  Can I just make one point though, several times and I think Maggie  Haberman reporting the New York Times, at least twice, stories broken,  legal camp on the president side had said not true.  Or the president even  -- fake news or spokesmen said not true.  Then five or six months later you  turn -- oh, it actually is true.  So I think that the media is being played  a little bit but both sides on the legal side of things.  It's difficult to  try these cases on the court of public.</p><p> GUTFELD:  But, you know what?  The thing is there's one side that  definitely wants their story to be true, so they're willing to pay -- play  more fast and loose.  Can we talk about Bruce Ohr?  Is that not a story,  the former DOJ guy who's testifying in a closed door hearing over his  relations with Christopher Steele, the spy who tried to bring Trump down  with that dossier.  This -- in my opinion, this is a pretty, damn, big  story.  He's pushing the dossier created by Fusion GPS, where his wife  works, and then he says he feared of being exposed by this when Comey got  fired.  This is -- I mean, we make fun of the phrase deep state, but this  ain't shallow state.  </p><p> PERINO:  Which is why he's testifying behind closed doors.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yeah.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Right.  Which I think both sides want now because they feel as  though not enough gets done when they're out in public, although I think  Peter Strzok exposing his demeanor, his smugness goes a long way  understanding what goes on -- what was really going on behind closed doors.   This is what Catherine Herridge has told us so far.  She did a great job  standing outside.  So, Bruce Ohr, according to Darrell Issa, his memory is  in-perfect, but he does say he's never had a case like this in 20 years.   He goes on to say when they're caught lying, Simpson said, the first time,  Glenn Simpson who owns Fusion GPS, where Bruce Ohr's wife works, said the  first time that I was dealing with Bruce Ohr was at thanksgiving.  The  problem is there's email exchanges that shows they'd been communicating  since August.  Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, and Glenn Simpson all contradict each  other.  And there's no way that that should be allowed if you're trying to  do an investigation.  And if the FBI or Department of Justice was doing  this investigation, they would not be tolerating this.  So they've got to  get all three out there in front of us and tried to contradict each other.  </p><p> BRUCE:  And you know what we're seeing here is the weaponising, as we've  discussed, of the federal law enforcement framework against a presidential  election and a presidential nominee, a candidate, which is what they  wanted, which was an insurance policy to keep something from happening.  So  when you look at that -- and this is another -- it's a blessing for  conservatives everywhere.  Particular communities in this country talk  about law enforcement, framing people, making up evidence, targeting  individuals to get them -- deciding that the ends justifies the means, and  a lot of people who don't go through that experience say, oh, that could  never really happen.  We're now seeing it happen at a federal level.  So  it's an education for all of us.  Not just at that level but at the local  level as well when it comes to what law enforcement is willing to do.  And  the cleanup that has to happen around the country for all of us just when  it comes to who we trust and whether or not we're going to really take it  seriously.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  So, in other words -- so you're just happy defaming the FBI, the  Justice Department, anybody that's questioning President Trump.  This is  the story again.  So here we are.  Oh, this means that there's nothing,  nothing that the president has done wrong.  President Trump is a victim.   This is madness.  I mean, you have to ignore the facts on the ground.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  We're just reporting the story about this guy.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  You have to ignore the fact that Bruce Ohr is an  expert on Russia.  You have to ignore the fact that therefore people like  Christopher Steele would be going to Bruce Ohr and saying, hey, guess what,  Sally Yates just got tossed.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BRUCE:  Juan, you should be upset too, because all these corruptions and  all of these back-and-forth.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  What corruption?</p><p> BRUCE:  And Bruce Ohr saying we're going to get caught, that obscures any  legitimate investigation that people may be would have wanted.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  All I know is.</p><p> BRUCE:  Because this becomes the story.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Let me just say, I think we had the president going after Jeff  Sessions, his own Republican attorney general.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Who recused himself.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Yes.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  He's not doing anything.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Right.  So he's going after Rod Rosenstein.  He's going after  the FBI.  Who else -- who isn't he going after?  </p><p> GUTFELD:  All I can say is.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KILMEADE:  Just look at this.  Juan, just look at this.  Nobody said Donald  Trump is playing the perfect game so far.  All we're saying is look at the  text messages and the exchanges.  Look at the facts.  You should be as  outraged as anybody.  And then, pick your time when Trump is out of control  and say this is out of control.  But this is not Trump.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  You know what?  Feels like this Ohr is in hot water.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GUTFELD:  Republicans warning voters about what will happen if Nancy Pelosi  becomes speaker again.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> PERINO:  The Trump effect being put to the test again in key primaries  today.  Trump backed Congressman Ron Desantis is trying to secure the  Republican nomination to replace outgoing Florida Governor Rick Scott.  And  Scott is looking to wrap up the GOP senate nodded with a big boost from  Trump.  And in Arizona, it's a senate Republican primary featuring three  candidates who are all strongly behind the president's agenda.  In the  backdrop of tonight races, a major warning sign for Republican midterm  voters.  GOP lawmakers are circulating a list of potential issues Democrats  may investigate if they retake the house.  Will this threat helped turn out  the base?  </p><p> The list is pretty amazing.  It's basically of all the list that the house  Democrats have sent requesting hearings on such issues as President Trump's  tax returns, President Trump's family business, the payment to Stormy  Daniels, James Comey's firing, cabinet secretary travel, the travel ban,  family separation, on and on.  It's basically, pretty much, nothing else  would get done except for investigations, if this were to actually happen.   So the Republicans -- sometimes, Tammy, you have to scare your base into  turning out.  </p><p> BRUCE:  You do.  And yet, this is pretty much what people want to do.   They're still talking about impeachment even though some people are saying,  well, that's not really a good idea.  Even Adam Schiff the other day said,  well, we really can't really talk about that right now.  But if President  Trump is everything they say he is.  I mean, he's Hitler.  He's carrying  babies away from moms.  Why wouldn't you want to?  Why suddenly if he's the  worst guy in the world but then you really don't want to investigate  anything or you don't want to impeach him.  And so that's what we're  looking at.  And these are serious things that the Democrats have been  running on and have been talking to their base about.  And we can expect  them to do it partly because they don't want to govern.  That's been a big  problem with Democrats.  They gin up the bases, they get people all  excited, but they don't want to govern.  And this.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Where did you get that from?  </p><p> BRUCE:  From the last eight years with Barack Obama.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  Oh, please, are you kidding?  I think  Republicans, in fact, thought that he -- it was overreaching, doing too  much, and had to obstruct him.  I could go on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BRUCE:  Bill Clinton governed.  And that's why that administration, even  with impeachment, worked because he enjoyed the process.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  I think -- look, I think, just seriously, Dana has a point here  about who's stirring up the base.  That this is an action being taken by  Republicans right now to say if you allow Democrats to take control of the  house, we are going to lose President Trump because he may be impeached.   And they see this, and I think rightly, as stirring up the GOP base because  it's so strongly pro-Trump.  And that those people then will turn out and  not turn off, given all the bad news that Trump is experiencing.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  So stirring up the base though -- let's go back to this because  telling the truth can actually stir up the base.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yeah.  And I like how the Democrats are pretending that they  aren't really interested impeachment.  That's like a teenager trying to  sneak a bottle of booze outside the house -- outside the house in front of  their parents.  Oh, no, it's just a water bottle.  We know the Democrats  are waiting to spring this on if they get the house.  They're playing this  down so they can then raise it when they can.  So I do believe telling --  telling the truth can be stirring the base, by the way.  Democrats stir the  base by painting Trump is Hitler.  You know as.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  No, no, she said separating children from their parents.  Boy, I  think that's true.  Oh, my God.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Stirring the base.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  How about this?  Democrats want to do away with ICE, how about  that?  Oh, yeah, they want to do away with ICE. </p><p> PERINO:  The point about family separation policy, there're already was a  hearing about that.  And so.  </p><p> BRUCE:  And then we'll have to deal with Barack Obama's establishment of  it, and the fact that.  </p><p> PERINO:  The other thing is that the Democrats -- you know, they're finding  out that some of their fringe on the left that come up with ideas like  abolishing ICE, and it's not just the fringe, some mainstream Democrats as  well.  It's not going over so well.  There was a poll taken by A.P., 57  percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, but the number that don't  -- there's only 18 percent of Democrats favor dismantling this, Ok?  So  they're having to answer questions for things that their left, far left is  suggesting.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  But some of that -- high profile people are saying it.  Bernie  Sanders, Gillibrand, and they're the ones saying it.  And you can just say  OK.  You deal with it because it's not somebody writing this and they're  not putting their name on it, these are major speeches given in front of  major audiences to get a loud round of applause.  The Democrats who have  been successful in the special election, he's the close the gap or walk  away with the win are the ones who are in the middle that still clearly  criticize Trump.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Brian, you want to get rid of the Ice Capades, which I think is  heartless.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PERINO:  Why do you feel that way about the Ice Capades?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  The Ice Capades, I feel like it never ends.  There's no  beginning and there's no end.  I feel like.</p><p> GUTFELD:  And by the way, there's no scoring either at Ice Capades.</p><p> KILMEADE:  Crickets scares me.</p><p> PERINO:  All right, up next, President Trump with a new warning for Google  after claiming the company is silencing conservatives, up next.</p><p> GUTFELD:  What is a Capades?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  President Trump going after Google this morning on twitter,  accusing the tech giant of being politically biased against conservatives.   The president claims searched results are, quote, rigged, end quote,  against him and other Republicans as well to suppress any good news about  the Trump presidency.  Now, the president doubling down this very  afternoon. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Yeah, I think  Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a  very serious thing and it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and  what others are doing, if you look at what's going-on on twitter, if you  look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you  can't do that to people.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Google firing back saying its searches don't promote a political  agenda.  So what do you think?  </p><p> BRUCE:  Look, we have a history with all of the social media, and Facebook  is also mentioned as a very good example.  Remember their trending stories  column that they said was the trending news of the day based on their  algorithms.  And then we realize that there was no real conservative sites,  there's no conservative stories, there was nothing pro-conservative, and  former editors came out and said that they routinely suppressed  conservative news, things that conservatives would make them look good or  would be of interest to conservatives, and then they had to eventually  shutdown that entire framework.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Let me pick up on this and ask you a question.  Much of it has  to do, according to Google, with the idea that if you are searching  something they give you what they call accredited sites like big newspapers  that they have a sense of trust in their content as opposed to giving them  simply opinionated sites that are likely tilted.  </p><p> BRUCE:  But that's the problem is that when you're liberal and you see a  liberal side, that is the one that is legitimate to you, and you're going  to view an opposing website in a different way because you don't agree with  it.  So if you're going to rank certain websites, you're going to rank them  based on whether or not it looks like real life to you.  That, look, if  you're a liberal or a conservative, you're not going to look at your own  material as being biased because it's what you also believe.  And this is  why when you've got 80 percent -- 85 percent of American media identifies  effectively as liberal, as not conservative, and then you're going to have  a Google determine which sites are going to be more legitimate, they're  going to rate more legitimate the sites that they agree with that looks  like their worldview.  And automatically.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  What about -- and it seems to me like saying there's no truth,  there's no fact, there's no accurate news coverage in the country, so you  just give me liberal opinion or give me conservative opinions.  Is that  we're saying?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  No, I think they're talking about -- this is the hottest issue  in the country and there's no easy answer.  This is the stem cell research  of our generation, of this decade, because everyone thinks social media is  the problem for their own reasons.  I don't necessarily have the reason but  Amazon, Google, Facebook, and twitter, they have to -- we have to come up  with something that will work.  I think, fundamentally, they actually want  to get it to work.  I think there's legitimate criticisms of those sites.   My frustration is when -- for example, CEO Jack Dorsey comes to Capitol  Hill to go in front of the energy committee on September 5th, next week, is  there going to be anyone who's an expert to be able to ask him the types of  questions.  They're going to move the conversation forward or we going to  see a bunch.  </p><p> PERINO:  So you think those hearings are unsatisfying?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Well, I know you're being sarcastic.  But we need somebody in  the middle that is unbiased to say here's an idea of what to do because  lawmakers who belong to a party are not capable of coming up with an  answer.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  By the way, Brian, Larry Kudlow said today, well, he's looking  at the possibility of regulating them.  And I think. </p><p> KILMEADE:  I don't know where you start?  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  But that is so shocking to me that he would  suggest that the government now. </p><p> PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow, I mean, he's a free-market guy and  conservatives typically are not for more regulation.  I would add that --  1:40 PM today, before the Daily Briefings, I checked Google News --</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Your show.</p><p> PERINO:  -- to see what was there.  And the No. 1 story was a CNN story  about debunking a Trump myth of some sort.  A CNN Money story was about how  Google is rigged against conservatives, based on the president's tweet.   And the third story was the FOX News story about Tiger Woods.  And I think  we're going to talk about that later.  </p><p> So I think that there's -- there's a lot of room for this algorithm to be  manipulated.  And all of these sites are privately-held companies.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  And they're powerful.</p><p> PERINO:  But they also would say to you, \"It doesn't make sense for us to  alienate half of the country\" when they're trying to make money.  Remember,  it was Michael Jordan said Republicans buy shoes, too.  So they're going to  try to make a free-market argument next week.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, Greg, so I was surprised to see that the president's going  after Google.  He had a bad week, and I guess he does his rage Googling --</p><p> KILMEADE:  That was last week.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  -- and says, \"Oh, my God.  Look at -- they've got negative  stories here from New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.\" </p><p> GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  \"I don't like these stories.  Give me some conservative thing.\"  But here's Trump back in July.  He says the European Union is fining  Google, and they're one of America's greatest companies.  </p><p> PERINO:  Oh, right.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  But today, it's a different story.  </p><p> PERINO:  That's right.</p><p> GUTFELD:  I mean, it surprises you Trump changes his opinion?  I mean, it's  been going on for two years.  I think what Google is guilty of, everyone  else in the media.  They're chasing words and not deeds.  </p><p> The deeds are good news.  We have an 18-year high in optimism right now.   That's not being reported.  If you want onto Google and Googled Mexican  trade, you would've gotten the top stories about the awkward phone call.   You wouldn't have gotten the Mexican trade story.  </p><p> And he's just like us.  He Googles his name, and he gets mad when there's  bad news.  If you Google \"Kilmeade,\" the first thing --</p><p> KILMEADE:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p> GUTFELD:  -- you're going to get is \"hairpiece.\"  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Right, right.</p><p> GUTFELD:  But don't Google Kilmeade and hairpiece, because then you'll see  what happens.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  No, but 99 percent of the stuff on us is negative.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes, yes, yes.  And I'm used to it.</p><p> And if you look at Google Doodles, which I love.  You know, instead of  Easter, they'll have an activist.  Instead of Christmas, they'll do some  kind of festival.  Instead of Burning Man -- I mean, they'll do Burning Man  instead of Lou Dobbs's birthday.  They're the king of virtue signaling.  </p><p> You ask, like, why would you alienate half the conversation?  It's to keep  activists at bay.  They would rather alienate half a population than have  somebody come after them and say, \"You're bigoted.  You're sexist.  You're  racists.\"</p><p> They need to do a Google search on wisdom.  Because right now, what they're  doing is they're helping China in their A.I.   Correct?  But they are  leaving -- they want to leave helping the military and making more precise  drones that actually save lives.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  OK, I've got a question for you about Alex Jones.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Because we know that some of these sites pushed Alex Jones and  his conspiracy theories off on the idea that it's hate speech.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Why wouldn't you want to support that, Greg? </p><p> GUTFELD:  I think Alex Jones is hate speech.  It's the same way I feel  about Louis Farrakhan.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  OK.  ESPN melting down --</p><p> GUTFELD:  Where is he?  On Twitter wearing a bowtie.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  -- over Tiger Woods's refusal to criticize President Trump.  The  growing controversy -- you heard Dana reference it -- when we return.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you say to people who might find it interesting  that you have, I guess, a friendly relationship with him?  </p><p> TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER:  Well, he's our -- he's the president of  the United States.  And you have to respect the office, and no matter who's  in the office.  You may like, dislike personality or the politics.  But we  all must respect the office.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KILMEADE:  But he's done that.  What was wrong with that answer?  ESPN  host, though, hears that answer and thinks Tiger Woods bailed out.  They  are teeing off on Tiger Woods, refusing to take the reporters bait and  criticized President Trump or complement President Trump.  So they start  lashing out against Tiger Woods because he wouldn't lash out against the  president.  For example.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX KELLERMAN, ESPN CO-HOST, \"FIRST TAKE\":  Tiger Woods is being -- you  said, being slick.  Here, he is being slick.  He says we must respect the  office.  Therefore, that confers respect to the occupant.  Tiger, is that  what you're saying?  If that's what you're saying, that is a stupid  comment.  I don't -- but I don't even know if he believes that that's when  he said.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, first of all, we don't know what Tiger Woods  believes.  He's camblination (ph); he's not black.  When he was arrested,  he was black.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KILMEADE:  Stephen Hayes Smith is one of the brighter people on television.   I would love to hear him long form.  But Max Kellerman thinks it's just  unthinkable, Dana, that Tiger Woods would--</p><p> PERINO:  Respect the office of the president?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  -- respect the office.  And he probably likes President Trump in  golf has his holes together (ph).</p><p> PERINO:  I thought -- well, all people sports, who play sports, athletes,  thank you.  Looking for the word.  They are going to -- thank you for the  word -- are going to be asked questions about President Trump, because  reporters can't help themselves.  And they're always trying to figure out a  way, how can can they make headlines?  How can they make news?</p><p> The only way to make news, apparently, is the world today is if you ask  somebody how they feel about President Trump, even if that has nothing to  do about their golf game.  </p><p> What I thought is that Tiger Woods knew that a question like that was  probably coming.  And I took it as a sincere genuine answer of how he feels  about the presidency of the United States.  And I think that ESPN, they can  do whatever they want on their show.  But Tiger Woods was prepared for that  question.  But it wasn't like he was reading somebody else's talking  points.  I think he believed it.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Yes.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Max Kellerman is a virtue-signaling jackass, and here's evidence.   Would he have said that to Jim Brown last week?  Would he have said it to  Jim Brown, you know?  Because Jim Brown would have wiped the floor with  him.  He would have gone to the studio, so he did it because he thought he  could get away with it.  </p><p> This is the problem with injecting politics into bodies that do not have an  immune system for it.  So when you inject politics into sports, sports gets  sick.  When you inject politics into the entertainment world, the  entertainment gets world -- the entertainment world gets sick.  When you  inject politics into academia, what do you get?  You get a poison, toxic  campus.  Whenever you put politics, it gets sick, except on \"The Five.\"   Because we are real.  </p><p> PERINO:  When you put sports -- inject sports into me, I get sick, because  I can't even come up with the word \"athlete.\"  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Put it this way.  If people know President Trump, they have a  different opinion of President Trump.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Tell us about it, Brian.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Mike Tyson knows him.  Dennis Rodman knows him.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p> KILMEADE:  Herschel Walker knows him.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p> KILMEADE:  Just be jotting this down.  Tim Scott got a chance to spend a  lot of time with him.  And guess what?  So did Tiger Woods?</p><p> So Jim Brown joined us this morning on \"FOX &amp; Friends.\"  He is getting  blowback in the black community --</p><p> PERINO:  Yes.</p><p> KILMEADE:  -- for saying \"I like President Trump.  I think he's doing a  decent job.\"  Listen. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JIM BROWN, NFL HALL OF FAME:  The greatest thing about America is that we  all have our opinions and our thoughts.  Nobody is totally correct in  everything that they do.  I have access to the president; and any time I  have access to the president and he will listen to my thoughts, that's all  I can ask of him.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  And that's all that he said: \"I have access to the president.\"   That's just like Kanye West: \"I have access, and therefore, I want to be\" - - what'd he say, Yeezy?</p><p> KILMEADE:  You didn't hear the whole thing, but he does say he liked what  he's doing.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  More than Obama gave them.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  But you know, what's interesting about the Tiger Woods thing is  Tiger Woods was asked, \"So what about the politics, then?  If you say you  respect the office.\"  </p><p> And by the way, Max Kellerman, he was right when he said this was a slick  move that allowed him to say, \"I respect the office\" without saying, \"Well,  what do you think about this president?\" </p><p> KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p> WILLIAMS:  I'm sorry?</p><p> KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p> WILLIAMS:  What's the right answer?</p><p> KILMEADE:  He respects the office of the president.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  That's not -- that's not an answer.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Why isn't it?</p><p> PERINO:  Why not?  That's a great answer.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  It's perfect</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Let me tell you why.  It's like saying you respect X, Y, Z.  And  you saying, \"I respect X, Y, G but not -- let's not talk about X, Y, Z.\"   Here's what he said.  He said, \"I just finished 72 holes, and I'm really  hungry.\"</p><p> KILMEADE:  At the end.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Does that sound like a kid who's trying to get away from  --</p><p> KILMEADE:  He's 43, and it's the fifth follow-up.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  He's a big boy, and in this era, President Trump, not the  athletes, have made the issue.  President Trump has gone after NFL players,  who are protesting.  He's gone after Stephen Curry, LeBron James.  Shut up  and dribble?  Because why?  </p><p> KILMEADE:  He didn't say that.  He never said that.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  He's always saying that these -- </p><p> KILMEADE:  He never said that.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  -- people --</p><p> KILMEADE:  He said they're not going to the Oval Office.  Don't bother.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  -- they don't want anything to do with him for a very real  reason.</p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, CO-HOST:  There is one reason why this is happening.  The  latest poll, 36 percent of African-Americans support the president --</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Oh, please.</p><p> BRUCE:  -- because their economy is better.  Lowest unemployment rate in  history for African-Americans.  The future is brighter again.  They're  realizing that the conservative ideal is worthwhile and should be  considered.  They're hearing other African-Americans they like, like Kanye  West, say, \"Wait a minute.  Maybe we should be thinking about things.\"  </p><p> Tiger Woods and others are not conforming, and that's what they expect of  the gay community, African-Americans, women.  Even if your lives are  better, you will be punished if you say that's OK, because that's all they  have left.  That's Tiger Woods's crime, apparently.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  That's not.  Tiger Woods plays a game.  </p><p> BRUCE:  He likes the presidency and the president, and African-American  lives are better under this president.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  This is such a cheap argument about  unemployment rates.  Let me just say, Tiger Woods plays the game.</p><p> BRUCE:  The lowest unemployment rate in history is a cheap argument? </p><p> WILLIAMS:  That is a cheap argument.  That's ridiculous.  </p><p> BRUCE:  Juan.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  If you were saying to me, \"Oh, you know what?\"</p><p> BRUCE:  Juan.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  \"President Trump is now about lowering black unemployment so  that it matches white unemployment.  Or President Obama [SIC] -- President  Trump is doing something\" --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BRUCE:  Going after MS-13.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  \" -- to encourage job training.\"  No, he's not doing any of  that.  </p><p> Here's what Tiger Woods is about.  Tiger Woods realizes that his sponsors  and the people who play golf, generally white, maybe Republican.  And he is  not taking the risk of speaking truth to power.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  You're -- you're just projecting what you think Tiger Woods is  thinking.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  No, I don't know what he thinks.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Mind reading.</p><p> KILMEADE:  I project this.  He's known him for 15, 20 years, and likes him.   I'll project that.  </p><p> BRUCE:  And we all seem to recall --</p><p> KILMEADE:  That's probably a better idea.  </p><p> PERINO:  He also -- I didn't have a chance to talk.  He also has to -- a  responsibility to himself and to his business and to --</p><p> WILLIAMS:  There we go.</p><p> PERINO:  So look, if I were his P.R. advisor and I anticipated that  question, I'm like, that is a great answer.  You might get dinged on ESPN,  but if you want to focus, you really want to make a comeback in golf,  you've got to focus on this and not allow a distraction with politics.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Like, politics in other arenas, sucks.  Politics kills  everything.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  All right.  So I guess Greg gets the last word.  Meanwhile,  coming up straight ahead, keeping a room cold is apparently now sexist.   That story is next.  Please gradually zoom out.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BRUCE:  All right, everybody.  Cries of sexism in the New York  gubernatorial race, not about politics but about room temperature.  </p><p> Cynthia Nixon's team is accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being sexist for  trying to debate in a chilly room when they face off tomorrow night.  </p><p> Turns out this is a battle many Americans face.  A recent survey says 43  percent of coworkers have clashed --</p><p> KILMEADE:  To battle.</p><p> BRUCE:  -- over being too hot or too cold in the workplace.  </p><p> Obviously, Cynthia Nixon is Goldilocks.  Look, if she can't handle a room  temperature properly, how can she handle being in a variety of different  rooms, dealing with politicians, et cetera?  Greg, I'm sure you might have  something to say about that.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  She -- she wants 76 degrees in a packed auditorium? </p><p> KILMEADE:  It's freezing.</p><p> GUTFELD:  If you take the body heat of the -- you're going to put it into  the 80s, and they are going to despise her.  </p><p> By the way, this is -- it is a fact.  This is a biological difference among  many.  And if you deny it, you're a science denier.  We all have -- we have  different metabolic rates.  So men actually can handle, I guess, the cold  better.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Women are hotter.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  That will -- that will end up somewhere.  Take it out of context  and put it on a blog.  There you go.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  I think it's good news for you, Brian.  </p><p> BRUCE:  Also, Dana, we -- men and women dress differently in the office.   You know?</p><p> PERINO:  I'm freezing every day, so I would give her a little tip.  In my  mug is hot water.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Rum.  Rum.</p><p> PERINO:  No, but that's a good idea.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Rum.</p><p> PERINO:  If I drank rum, that would be a good idea.  It's hot water.  I  hold my cup and it's hot; and then I get -- I don't have to complain too  much about how freezing it is.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  But is it sexist?  That's the problem.  Is it sexist?</p><p> PERINO:  No, it's not.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Is it sexist.</p><p> PERINO:  Remember Charlie Crist in Florida?  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p> PERINO:  And he was going to have a debate.  And one of the big demands is  that he had to have a fan at all times. </p><p> GUTFELD:  And where was the fan?</p><p> PERINO:  Underneath the podium.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  It was right at an odd level.  It was the strangest thing.  </p><p> PERINO:  Yes, it's a very strange thing.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  Like a fan --</p><p> PERINO:  And that is not sexist.  That is just a demand.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Yes, because there's a reality here.  There's a political  reality that if you go back, I think it's the 1960 campaign with  Nixon/Kennedy.  That they had a debate, and Nixon -- Nixon starts to pop  sweat.</p><p> GUTFELD:  So she wants him to sweat.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  And he looks terrible on TV.  He looks like he's fleeing a crime  scene.  </p><p> BRUCE:  They have to adjusts, but these days, everything either --  everything has to be sexist.  But when you're running -- when our argument  is, is that we are the same; women can do what men do.  But now everything  has to be adjusted because we can't handle a room temperature? </p><p> WILLIAMS:  No, no, no.  That's not what they're saying.  They're saying --  she's saying that she wants to eliminate his demand that it be freezing.   And he has said he likes a cold environment.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  In the past, but the thing is, it's like boxing, Juan.</p><p> BRUCE:  And she wants it at 76.</p><p> KILMEADE:  You're a boxing fan.  If you're the champion, you get to pick  the ring, the venue.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  That's what she said.  She said CBS, the local CBS, the  affiliate here in New York, negotiated exclusively with him.  Because she  wanted several debates.  She's only getting one debate on his terms.  </p><p> BRUCE:  Because he's -- he's leading.  And he doesn't even really need to  do it, because he's ahead.  But thank you for man-splaining that for me.  </p><p> Yes, I mean, this is -- this is what you're going to see, and this is what  we want.  I want women to run for office, but we don't want it to all be  about sexism.  </p><p> PERINO:  I do want it to be comfortable in the room.  </p><p> BRUCE:  But 76 isn't even comfortable.  Right?  I mean, she's asking -- </p><p> PERINO:  No, see it depends.  Like, at 75, I'm cold.  At 76, I'm hot.  So  it's, like, 75.5 would be perfect.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Do you want to talk about sexism, though?  Think about all of the  men who built buildings, who built the buildings that people actually use,  who risked their lives on girders in the 1960s and the 1970s, who built the  bridges.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  And then blew the money on the track.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Or if the -- oh, no, they fell.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  They fell.</p><p> GUTFELD:  Brooklyn Bridge, look at the numbers of people who died on the  Brooklyn Bridge.  </p><p> BRUCE:  All the men who made things possible and now women can help make  them possible, too.  </p><p> GUTFELD:  There you go.</p><p> BRUCE:  Coming up, \"One More Thing\" is coming up next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GUTFELD:  \"OMT\" -- Juan.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, Gregory, you know what?  Dreams do come true. </p><p> GUTFELD:  No, they don't.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  And sometimes in doubles.  Yes, because that's what happened for  Sophia Sanchez, an 11-year-old awaiting a heart transplant in Chicago.  She  posted a video of her dancing in the hospital with an I.V. in her arm to  rapper Drake's \"In My Feelings.\"  So then she asked Drake to come visit  her.  Against all odds, guess what happened?  He did.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SOPHIA SANCHEZ, HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT:  Oh, my God! </p><p> DRAKE, RAP ARTIST:  You asked me to come, I'm here.  What's up?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Sophia -- Sophia also asked -- and this is the double, Gregory - - Sophia asked for a new heart, because she was struggling.  And guess  what?  The second dream also came true. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're getting a heart.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations.  </p><p> SANCHEZ:  I'm getting a heart, Mom!</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Oh, my gosh.  So yesterday, Sophia had the heart implanted and,  according to her mom, Natalie, Sophia is doing well.  I want you to know,  Sophia, you've got five people here at FOX rooting and praying for you. </p><p> PERINO:  Like, 500 million.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Really. </p><p> GUTFELD:  You have proven me wrong, Juan.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Wow.  What?</p><p> GUTFELD:  Now I need to find a heart.  All right.</p><p> PERINO:  No one's going to give you a heart.</p><p> GUTFELD:  No one's going to give me a heart.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Especially after this.</p><p> GRAPHIC:  Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News</p><p> GUTFELD:  \"Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News.\"  Got a lot of big news in  the Brian Kilmeade spelling arena.  Let's go live to tape.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  There's a word that  Canada has trouble with.  It's M-I-L-K.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  Now, in terms of Canada, I guess Canada hates milk.  I mean,  hates to talk about milk, M-A-L-K.  </p><p> STEVE DOOCY, CO-HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  They're lactose intolerant.</p><p> KILMEADE:  That's what you've got.</p><p> DOOCY:  By the way, Brian -- Brian, did you say -- it's \"M-I-L-K\". </p><p> KILMEADE:  You're right.  Thank you very much.</p><p> DOOCY:  Not \"M-A-L-K.\"</p><p> KILMEADE:  You're -- thanks for correcting me.  You helped me, saved a  headline.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GUTFELD:  How nice of Larry to correct you on television.  </p><p> KILMEADE:  That would have slipped by the Gutfeld staff, except for Larry  corrected me. </p><p> PERINO:  I thought I heard you say \"I\" in my -- OK, you didn't. </p><p> KILMEADE:  I know how to spell \"milk,\" just not in the morning. </p><p> GUTFELD:  Dana. </p><p> WILLIAMS:  How about \"potato\"? </p><p> PERINO:  I have something to promote.  I'm going to be on Tucker Carlson  tonight at 8 p.m., so you can check that out there.  We have a graphic.   Yes, I have a graphic today.  </p><p> Marie Unanue, she has a new book.

THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, CNN announced a bombshell that Michael Cohen said President  Trump knew about that meeting between his son and a Russian claiming to  have dirt on Hillary.  Something as rare as air.  It was one of a thousand  final nails in the coffin of Trump's presidency.  But then, Lanny Davis,  Hillary's creepy fixer, who's now defending Trump's creepy fixer, figure  that out, says it's creepy client didn't have such info, which is odd since  now it's revealed that creepy Davis was the anonymous creepy source who  supplied creepy CNN with that creepy info that the network then milked to  death while lecturing us on ethics.  So CNN is in a creepy pickle.  There  source for their biggest story of the year is giving us the creeps.  So  you're following this?  Which I wasn't.  I need to run my soul through a  car wash after all this.  </p><p>Unlike the rest of the media who eat this stuff up no matter the sourcing.   They're like a drunk frat boy at 3 AM.  They'll eat a pop tart off the  floor as long as there's ketchup.  So when Avenatti comes knocking, CNN  shrieks like Bieber fans with backstage passes, and why?  Only because it  perpetuates a story that the media can't stop feeding on.  Two years ago,  they were gorging on electing Trump.  Now they gorge on impeaching him.   Avenatti, Cohen, and Davis, three square meals the media devours daily.   But gluttony is a sin, no wonder they all seem so dumb and slow.  And  what's called reporting now is just rumor, spoon-fed from creep seeking  money, power, or fame.  I wish I could ignore them all, but what is it that  that guy keeps saying?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Long week?  Relax with a glass and let's get after it.   Lots to figure out.  What do you say?  Let's get after it.  It's going to  us two hours to do it, so what do you say?  Let's get after it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Let's get after it.  I've got something better.  How about let's  get accurate?  This is an amazing, blockbuster story, Kilmeade.  I want you  to try to get your head around it.  I know it might be tough for you  because you're working all the time.  But this is CNN's source  contradicting what they said to CNN, so somebody is lying.  Do you think  this will be on Michael Stelter's reliable sources?  </p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:  I say they rather have a test pattern to  put this on his reliable sources.  Lanny Davis is also a crisis expert.   That's where he wrote a book on.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>KILMEADE:  So here his crisis.  How do I solve the crisis?  Take  responsibility for it.  I'll take the heat and I can handle it.  He also  said the reporting got mixed up through the cross of the criminal  investigation.  No, that didn't work.  I made a mistake.  I did not mean to  be cute.  Never was.  Says he didn't lie to CNN.  He unintentionally  misspoke.  Said he, his instinct -- his instinct --this is what he said  about what Cohen knows.  His instinct was that his client might have  something to say about Mueller, about hacking, but he shouldn't have said  anything.  That is your lawyer.  This is nothing to do with Cohen.  It's  all about Hillary Clinton and Lanny Davis.  Cohen doesn't come up.  </p><p>So the question is, is he worried that Michael Cohen put his hand on the  bible and swore that he was telling the truth and said he had nothing to do  with this -- that Trump knew nothing about this Trump Tower situation.  And  when he came out and says now he knows, then Cohen suddenly looks as though  he created -- he committed perjury, so then he had to backtrack?  Or did he  just make it up and Michael Cohen said you're doing a really bad job.  I  know I'm not paying you, but you can't make things up.  There's more to  this story.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, you know -- OK, Dana, I want to stick to the CNN thing  because why not?  It's fun.  That was a natulite 26 story.  CNN said Lanny  Davis didn't make any comment on that.  So, this is from Glenn Greenwald.   I'm actually quoting a Glenn Greenwald article.  But, no.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: . but he's right.  CNN says Lanny Davis refused to comment, so  either CNN lied to its audience about Davis, or Davis is lying now.  </p><p>PERINO:  Or they were -- or they're protecting -- they were trying to  protect him at the time.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>PERINO: . to protect their source and say it wasn't that why people do  disagree with using background sources.  But in a case -- a situation like  this, then you're dealing with people's lives, including the president in  terms of their future judicial or legal problems, then people do leak and  they do speak on background.  The other thing that's happening here is you  have both camps trying to advance their story with the media on background  trying to be cute.  Then they go on the record.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>PERINO: . on cable news and they get a little bit crossed wide.  But I  believe CNN says they're sticking with the story.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, they are.</p><p>PERINO:  Because maybe they have another source that told them that the  story is true.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  And who could that source be?  Is there another lawyer that we're  missing out on?  </p><p>PERINO:  Probably</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, some other guy.  Tammy, if this were -- this would be -- if  this were on the other side, this would be yet another smoking gun.</p><p>TAMMY Bruce, FOX NEWS HOST:  Sure.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But the media doesn't see this as anything special.  </p><p>BRUCE:  No, and they're going to make it go away.  But, of course, this is  why when the president says fake news, everybody goes nuts.  This is  exactly what he's talking about, the use of an individual.  And this is  almost -- on the theory like too good to check, right?  That they get what  they need from their source to move several days with a huge story at the  time -- it was another nail in the thousand nails, as you've noted.  And  then they get that mileage and they figure that that's all that they need  and that they gin this up in this way, and then it just goes away.  It  floats away.  But the viewers know it.  CNN is now losing their programs to  things like Ancient Aliens.  So, obviously, Ancient Aliens doing things  that CNN won't do and can't do.  So this is what the president complains  about.  It's what you see the crowds at the rallies, you know, yelling at  CNN about.  It hurts not just Cohen and this entire process legally but how  media is viewed again.  It's another nail in a coffin, but it's not  President Trump.  It's a legacy media and what they're willing to do.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Juan, I'm just severely disappointed in the whole legal world  right now.  Aren't you saddened?  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Of the legal world?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.  These lawyers are just terrible, Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Giuliani, yeah, I would agree.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm way, way, way, in disagreement with all of you on this one  because it seems to me like you're in the weeds and you're just playing out  this tired theme of, oh, the right wing hates the elite mainstream media.   This is not a big story in terms of CNN says they're standing by their  story.  They say they have corroboration for the story.  They've had every  opportunity to say, hey, we made a mistake.  In addition to which,  remember, CNN fired reporters when reporters got an earlier story about  Trump wrong.  So I would think that people on the right would say, huh, CNN  is not firing anybody in this case.  They're not backing off.  And the one  who is saying that he did something wrong is Lanny Davis.  Lanny Davis is a  stand-up guy here and saying, hey. </p><p>KILMEADE:  Stand-up guy?  He made stuff up about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  And then he lied about it.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He said he was speculating, Brian.  And he has acknowledged that  he was wrong.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that, right?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that he was speculating?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what he said.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm just saying if you want to know the important story here,  the important story was when Cohen stood up in court and implicated the  president in an illegal payoff of a porn star.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But when everyone involved is lying at some point.  Look, if you  see a crowd of people who are lying at some point about a variety of  issues, and then you got a guy who's been threatened with life in prison  but pledging that he knows something, no wonder people don't take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He was in court.  He had -- he put his -- I mean, he could be in  jail.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Don't liberals all the time argue that people will say -- and  they'll confess to things they've never done before simply because of the  pressure by law enforcement?  </p><p>PERINO:  Can I just make one point though, several times and I think Maggie  Haberman reporting the New York Times, at least twice, stories broken,  legal camp on the president side had said not true.  Or the president even  -- fake news or spokesmen said not true.  Then five or six months later you  turn -- oh, it actually is true.  So I think that the media is being played  a little bit but both sides on the legal side of things.  It's difficult to  try these cases on the court of public.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But, you know what?  The thing is there's one side that  definitely wants their story to be true, so they're willing to pay -- play  more fast and loose.  Can we talk about Bruce Ohr?  Is that not a story,  the former DOJ guy who's testifying in a closed door hearing over his  relations with Christopher Steele, the spy who tried to bring Trump down  with that dossier.  This -- in my opinion, this is a pretty, damn, big  story.  He's pushing the dossier created by Fusion GPS, where his wife  works, and then he says he feared of being exposed by this when Comey got  fired.  This is -- I mean, we make fun of the phrase deep state, but this  ain't shallow state.  </p><p>PERINO:  Which is why he's testifying behind closed doors.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right.  Which I think both sides want now because they feel as  though not enough gets done when they're out in public, although I think  Peter Strzok exposing his demeanor, his smugness goes a long way  understanding what goes on -- what was really going on behind closed doors.   This is what Catherine Herridge has told us so far.  She did a great job  standing outside.  So, Bruce Ohr, according to Darrell Issa, his memory is  in-perfect, but he does say he's never had a case like this in 20 years.   He goes on to say when they're caught lying, Simpson said, the first time,  Glenn Simpson who owns Fusion GPS, where Bruce Ohr's wife works, said the  first time that I was dealing with Bruce Ohr was at thanksgiving.  The  problem is there's email exchanges that shows they'd been communicating  since August.  Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, and Glenn Simpson all contradict each  other.  And there's no way that that should be allowed if you're trying to  do an investigation.  And if the FBI or Department of Justice was doing  this investigation, they would not be tolerating this.  So they've got to  get all three out there in front of us and tried to contradict each other.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And you know what we're seeing here is the weaponising, as we've  discussed, of the federal law enforcement framework against a presidential  election and a presidential nominee, a candidate, which is what they  wanted, which was an insurance policy to keep something from happening.  So  when you look at that -- and this is another -- it's a blessing for  conservatives everywhere.  Particular communities in this country talk  about law enforcement, framing people, making up evidence, targeting  individuals to get them -- deciding that the ends justifies the means, and  a lot of people who don't go through that experience say, oh, that could  never really happen.  We're now seeing it happen at a federal level.  So  it's an education for all of us.  Not just at that level but at the local  level as well when it comes to what law enforcement is willing to do.  And  the cleanup that has to happen around the country for all of us just when  it comes to who we trust and whether or not we're going to really take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  So, in other words -- so you're just happy defaming the FBI, the  Justice Department, anybody that's questioning President Trump.  This is  the story again.  So here we are.  Oh, this means that there's nothing,  nothing that the president has done wrong.  President Trump is a victim.   This is madness.  I mean, you have to ignore the facts on the ground.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  We're just reporting the story about this guy.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  You have to ignore the fact that Bruce Ohr is an  expert on Russia.  You have to ignore the fact that therefore people like  Christopher Steele would be going to Bruce Ohr and saying, hey, guess what,  Sally Yates just got tossed.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan, you should be upset too, because all these corruptions and  all of these back-and-forth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What corruption?</p><p>BRUCE:  And Bruce Ohr saying we're going to get caught, that obscures any  legitimate investigation that people may be would have wanted.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  All I know is.</p><p>BRUCE:  Because this becomes the story.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me just say, I think we had the president going after Jeff  Sessions, his own Republican attorney general.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Who recused himself.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He's not doing anything.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  So he's going after Rod Rosenstein.  He's going after  the FBI.  Who else -- who isn't he going after?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  All I can say is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just look at this.  Juan, just look at this.  Nobody said Donald  Trump is playing the perfect game so far.  All we're saying is look at the  text messages and the exchanges.  Look at the facts.  You should be as  outraged as anybody.  And then, pick your time when Trump is out of control  and say this is out of control.  But this is not Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  You know what?  Feels like this Ohr is in hot water.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Republicans warning voters about what will happen if Nancy Pelosi  becomes speaker again.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO:  The Trump effect being put to the test again in key primaries  today.  Trump backed Congressman Ron Desantis is trying to secure the  Republican nomination to replace outgoing Florida Governor Rick Scott.  And  Scott is looking to wrap up the GOP senate nodded with a big boost from  Trump.  And in Arizona, it's a senate Republican primary featuring three  candidates who are all strongly behind the president's agenda.  In the  backdrop of tonight races, a major warning sign for Republican midterm  voters.  GOP lawmakers are circulating a list of potential issues Democrats  may investigate if they retake the house.  Will this threat helped turn out  the base?  </p><p>The list is pretty amazing.  It's basically of all the list that the house  Democrats have sent requesting hearings on such issues as President Trump's  tax returns, President Trump's family business, the payment to Stormy  Daniels, James Comey's firing, cabinet secretary travel, the travel ban,  family separation, on and on.  It's basically, pretty much, nothing else  would get done except for investigations, if this were to actually happen.   So the Republicans -- sometimes, Tammy, you have to scare your base into  turning out.  </p><p>BRUCE:  You do.  And yet, this is pretty much what people want to do.   They're still talking about impeachment even though some people are saying,  well, that's not really a good idea.  Even Adam Schiff the other day said,  well, we really can't really talk about that right now.  But if President  Trump is everything they say he is.  I mean, he's Hitler.  He's carrying  babies away from moms.  Why wouldn't you want to?  Why suddenly if he's the  worst guy in the world but then you really don't want to investigate  anything or you don't want to impeach him.  And so that's what we're  looking at.  And these are serious things that the Democrats have been  running on and have been talking to their base about.  And we can expect  them to do it partly because they don't want to govern.  That's been a big  problem with Democrats.  They gin up the bases, they get people all  excited, but they don't want to govern.  And this.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Where did you get that from?  </p><p>BRUCE:  From the last eight years with Barack Obama.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  Oh, please, are you kidding?  I think  Republicans, in fact, thought that he -- it was overreaching, doing too  much, and had to obstruct him.  I could go on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Bill Clinton governed.  And that's why that administration, even  with impeachment, worked because he enjoyed the process.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think -- look, I think, just seriously, Dana has a point here  about who's stirring up the base.  That this is an action being taken by  Republicans right now to say if you allow Democrats to take control of the  house, we are going to lose President Trump because he may be impeached.   And they see this, and I think rightly, as stirring up the GOP base because  it's so strongly pro-Trump.  And that those people then will turn out and  not turn off, given all the bad news that Trump is experiencing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  So stirring up the base though -- let's go back to this because  telling the truth can actually stir up the base.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  And I like how the Democrats are pretending that they  aren't really interested impeachment.  That's like a teenager trying to  sneak a bottle of booze outside the house -- outside the house in front of  their parents.  Oh, no, it's just a water bottle.  We know the Democrats  are waiting to spring this on if they get the house.  They're playing this  down so they can then raise it when they can.  So I do believe telling --  telling the truth can be stirring the base, by the way.  Democrats stir the  base by painting Trump is Hitler.  You know as.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, she said separating children from their parents.  Boy, I  think that's true.  Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Stirring the base.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about this?  Democrats want to do away with ICE, how about  that?  Oh, yeah, they want to do away with ICE. </p><p>PERINO:  The point about family separation policy, there're already was a  hearing about that.  And so.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And then we'll have to deal with Barack Obama's establishment of  it, and the fact that.  </p><p>PERINO:  The other thing is that the Democrats -- you know, they're finding  out that some of their fringe on the left that come up with ideas like  abolishing ICE, and it's not just the fringe, some mainstream Democrats as  well.  It's not going over so well.  There was a poll taken by A.P., 57  percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, but the number that don't  -- there's only 18 percent of Democrats favor dismantling this, Ok?  So  they're having to answer questions for things that their left, far left is  suggesting.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But some of that -- high profile people are saying it.  Bernie  Sanders, Gillibrand, and they're the ones saying it.  And you can just say  OK.  You deal with it because it's not somebody writing this and they're  not putting their name on it, these are major speeches given in front of  major audiences to get a loud round of applause.  The Democrats who have  been successful in the special election, he's the close the gap or walk  away with the win are the ones who are in the middle that still clearly  criticize Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian, you want to get rid of the Ice Capades, which I think is  heartless.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Why do you feel that way about the Ice Capades?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  The Ice Capades, I feel like it never ends.  There's no  beginning and there's no end.  I feel like.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And by the way, there's no scoring either at Ice Capades.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Crickets scares me.</p><p>PERINO:  All right, up next, President Trump with a new warning for Google  after claiming the company is silencing conservatives, up next.</p><p>GUTFELD:  What is a Capades?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  President Trump going after Google this morning on twitter,  accusing the tech giant of being politically biased against conservatives.   The president claims searched results are, quote, rigged, end quote,  against him and other Republicans as well to suppress any good news about  the Trump presidency.  Now, the president doubling down this very  afternoon. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Yeah, I think  Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a  very serious thing and it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and  what others are doing, if you look at what's going-on on twitter, if you  look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you  can't do that to people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Google firing back saying its searches don't promote a political  agenda.  So what do you think?  </p><p>BRUCE:  Look, we have a history with all of the social media, and Facebook  is also mentioned as a very good example.  Remember their trending stories  column that they said was the trending news of the day based on their  algorithms.  And then we realize that there was no real conservative sites,  there's no conservative stories, there was nothing pro-conservative, and  former editors came out and said that they routinely suppressed  conservative news, things that conservatives would make them look good or  would be of interest to conservatives, and then they had to eventually  shutdown that entire framework.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me pick up on this and ask you a question.  Much of it has  to do, according to Google, with the idea that if you are searching  something they give you what they call accredited sites like big newspapers  that they have a sense of trust in their content as opposed to giving them  simply opinionated sites that are likely tilted.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But that's the problem is that when you're liberal and you see a  liberal side, that is the one that is legitimate to you, and you're going  to view an opposing website in a different way because you don't agree with  it.  So if you're going to rank certain websites, you're going to rank them  based on whether or not it looks like real life to you.  That, look, if  you're a liberal or a conservative, you're not going to look at your own  material as being biased because it's what you also believe.  And this is  why when you've got 80 percent -- 85 percent of American media identifies  effectively as liberal, as not conservative, and then you're going to have  a Google determine which sites are going to be more legitimate, they're  going to rate more legitimate the sites that they agree with that looks  like their worldview.  And automatically.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What about -- and it seems to me like saying there's no truth,  there's no fact, there's no accurate news coverage in the country, so you  just give me liberal opinion or give me conservative opinions.  Is that  we're saying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, I think they're talking about -- this is the hottest issue  in the country and there's no easy answer.  This is the stem cell research  of our generation, of this decade, because everyone thinks social media is  the problem for their own reasons.  I don't necessarily have the reason but  Amazon, Google, Facebook, and twitter, they have to -- we have to come up  with something that will work.  I think, fundamentally, they actually want  to get it to work.  I think there's legitimate criticisms of those sites.   My frustration is when -- for example, CEO Jack Dorsey comes to Capitol  Hill to go in front of the energy committee on September 5th, next week, is  there going to be anyone who's an expert to be able to ask him the types of  questions.  They're going to move the conversation forward or we going to  see a bunch.  </p><p>PERINO:  So you think those hearings are unsatisfying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Well, I know you're being sarcastic.  But we need somebody in  the middle that is unbiased to say here's an idea of what to do because  lawmakers who belong to a party are not capable of coming up with an  answer.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  By the way, Brian, Larry Kudlow said today, well, he's looking  at the possibility of regulating them.  And I think. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I don't know where you start?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  But that is so shocking to me that he would  suggest that the government now. </p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow, I mean, he's a free-market guy and  conservatives typically are not for more regulation.  I would add that --  1:40 PM today, before the Daily Briefings, I checked Google News --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Your show.</p><p>PERINO:  -- to see what was there.  And the No. 1 story was a CNN story  about debunking a Trump myth of some sort.  A CNN Money story was about how  Google is rigged against conservatives, based on the president's tweet.   And the third story was the FOX News story about Tiger Woods.  And I think  we're going to talk about that later.  </p><p>So I think that there's -- there's a lot of room for this algorithm to be  manipulated.  And all of these sites are privately-held companies.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And they're powerful.</p><p>PERINO:  But they also would say to you, \"It doesn't make sense for us to  alienate half of the country\" when they're trying to make money.  Remember,  it was Michael Jordan said Republicans buy shoes, too.  So they're going to  try to make a free-market argument next week.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Greg, so I was surprised to see that the president's going  after Google.  He had a bad week, and I guess he does his rage Googling --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That was last week.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- and says, \"Oh, my God.  Look at -- they've got negative  stories here from New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.\" </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"I don't like these stories.  Give me some conservative thing.\"  But here's Trump back in July.  He says the European Union is fining  Google, and they're one of America's greatest companies.  </p><p>PERINO:  Oh, right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But today, it's a different story.  </p><p>PERINO:  That's right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  I mean, it surprises you Trump changes his opinion?  I mean, it's  been going on for two years.  I think what Google is guilty of, everyone  else in the media.  They're chasing words and not deeds.  </p><p>The deeds are good news.  We have an 18-year high in optimism right now.   That's not being reported.  If you want onto Google and Googled Mexican  trade, you would've gotten the top stories about the awkward phone call.   You wouldn't have gotten the Mexican trade story.  </p><p>And he's just like us.  He Googles his name, and he gets mad when there's  bad news.  If you Google \"Kilmeade,\" the first thing --</p><p>KILMEADE:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>GUTFELD:  -- you're going to get is \"hairpiece.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right, right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But don't Google Kilmeade and hairpiece, because then you'll see  what happens.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, but 99 percent of the stuff on us is negative.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, yes, yes.  And I'm used to it.</p><p>And if you look at Google Doodles, which I love.  You know, instead of  Easter, they'll have an activist.  Instead of Christmas, they'll do some  kind of festival.  Instead of Burning Man -- I mean, they'll do Burning Man  instead of Lou Dobbs's birthday.  They're the king of virtue signaling.  </p><p>You ask, like, why would you alienate half the conversation?  It's to keep  activists at bay.  They would rather alienate half a population than have  somebody come after them and say, \"You're bigoted.  You're sexist.  You're  racists.\"</p><p>They need to do a Google search on wisdom.  Because right now, what they're  doing is they're helping China in their A.I.   Correct?  But they are  leaving -- they want to leave helping the military and making more precise  drones that actually save lives.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK, I've got a question for you about Alex Jones.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Because we know that some of these sites pushed Alex Jones and  his conspiracy theories off on the idea that it's hate speech.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Why wouldn't you want to support that, Greg? </p><p>GUTFELD:  I think Alex Jones is hate speech.  It's the same way I feel  about Louis Farrakhan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK.  ESPN melting down --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Where is he?  On Twitter wearing a bowtie.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- over Tiger Woods's refusal to criticize President Trump.  The  growing controversy -- you heard Dana reference it -- when we return.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you say to people who might find it interesting  that you have, I guess, a friendly relationship with him?  </p><p>TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER:  Well, he's our -- he's the president of  the United States.  And you have to respect the office, and no matter who's  in the office.  You may like, dislike personality or the politics.  But we  all must respect the office.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KILMEADE:  But he's done that.  What was wrong with that answer?  ESPN  host, though, hears that answer and thinks Tiger Woods bailed out.  They  are teeing off on Tiger Woods, refusing to take the reporters bait and  criticized President Trump or complement President Trump.  So they start  lashing out against Tiger Woods because he wouldn't lash out against the  president.  For example.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, ESPN CO-HOST, \"FIRST TAKE\":  Tiger Woods is being -- you  said, being slick.  Here, he is being slick.  He says we must respect the  office.  Therefore, that confers respect to the occupant.  Tiger, is that  what you're saying?  If that's what you're saying, that is a stupid  comment.  I don't -- but I don't even know if he believes that that's when  he said.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, first of all, we don't know what Tiger Woods  believes.  He's camblination (ph); he's not black.  When he was arrested,  he was black.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Stephen Hayes Smith is one of the brighter people on television.   I would love to hear him long form.  But Max Kellerman thinks it's just  unthinkable, Dana, that Tiger Woods would--</p><p>PERINO:  Respect the office of the president?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  -- respect the office.  And he probably likes President Trump in  golf has his holes together (ph).</p><p>PERINO:  I thought -- well, all people sports, who play sports, athletes,  thank you.  Looking for the word.  They are going to -- thank you for the  word -- are going to be asked questions about President Trump, because  reporters can't help themselves.  And they're always trying to figure out a  way, how can can they make headlines?  How can they make news?</p><p>The only way to make news, apparently, is the world today is if you ask  somebody how they feel about President Trump, even if that has nothing to  do about their golf game.  </p><p>What I thought is that Tiger Woods knew that a question like that was  probably coming.  And I took it as a sincere genuine answer of how he feels  about the presidency of the United States.  And I think that ESPN, they can  do whatever they want on their show.  But Tiger Woods was prepared for that  question.  But it wasn't like he was reading somebody else's talking  points.  I think he believed it.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Max Kellerman is a virtue-signaling jackass, and here's evidence.   Would he have said that to Jim Brown last week?  Would he have said it to  Jim Brown, you know?  Because Jim Brown would have wiped the floor with  him.  He would have gone to the studio, so he did it because he thought he  could get away with it.  </p><p>This is the problem with injecting politics into bodies that do not have an  immune system for it.  So when you inject politics into sports, sports gets  sick.  When you inject politics into the entertainment world, the  entertainment gets world -- the entertainment world gets sick.  When you  inject politics into academia, what do you get?  You get a poison, toxic  campus.  Whenever you put politics, it gets sick, except on \"The Five.\"   Because we are real.  </p><p>PERINO:  When you put sports -- inject sports into me, I get sick, because  I can't even come up with the word \"athlete.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Put it this way.  If people know President Trump, they have a  different opinion of President Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Tell us about it, Brian.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Mike Tyson knows him.  Dennis Rodman knows him.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Herschel Walker knows him.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just be jotting this down.  Tim Scott got a chance to spend a  lot of time with him.  And guess what?  So did Tiger Woods?</p><p>So Jim Brown joined us this morning on \"FOX &amp; Friends.\"  He is getting  blowback in the black community --</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  -- for saying \"I like President Trump.  I think he's doing a  decent job.\"  Listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JIM BROWN, NFL HALL OF FAME:  The greatest thing about America is that we  all have our opinions and our thoughts.  Nobody is totally correct in  everything that they do.  I have access to the president; and any time I  have access to the president and he will listen to my thoughts, that's all  I can ask of him.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And that's all that he said: \"I have access to the president.\"   That's just like Kanye West: \"I have access, and therefore, I want to be\" - - what'd he say, Yeezy?</p><p>KILMEADE:  You didn't hear the whole thing, but he does say he liked what  he's doing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  More than Obama gave them.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  But you know, what's interesting about the Tiger Woods thing is  Tiger Woods was asked, \"So what about the politics, then?  If you say you  respect the office.\"  </p><p>And by the way, Max Kellerman, he was right when he said this was a slick  move that allowed him to say, \"I respect the office\" without saying, \"Well,  what do you think about this president?\" </p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm sorry?</p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What's the right answer?</p><p>KILMEADE:  He respects the office of the president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not -- that's not an answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Why isn't it?</p><p>PERINO:  Why not?  That's a great answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's perfect</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me tell you why.  It's like saying you respect X, Y, Z.  And  you saying, \"I respect X, Y, G but not -- let's not talk about X, Y, Z.\"   Here's what he said.  He said, \"I just finished 72 holes, and I'm really  hungry.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  At the end.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Does that sound like a kid who's trying to get away from  --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He's 43, and it's the fifth follow-up.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's a big boy, and in this era, President Trump, not the  athletes, have made the issue.  President Trump has gone after NFL players,  who are protesting.  He's gone after Stephen Curry, LeBron James.  Shut up  and dribble?  Because why?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He didn't say that.  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's always saying that these -- </p><p>KILMEADE:  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- people --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He said they're not going to the Oval Office.  Don't bother.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- they don't want anything to do with him for a very real  reason.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CO-HOST:  There is one reason why this is happening.  The  latest poll, 36 percent of African-Americans support the president --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, please.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- because their economy is better.  Lowest unemployment rate in  history for African-Americans.  The future is brighter again.  They're  realizing that the conservative ideal is worthwhile and should be  considered.  They're hearing other African-Americans they like, like Kanye  West, say, \"Wait a minute.  Maybe we should be thinking about things.\"  </p><p>Tiger Woods and others are not conforming, and that's what they expect of  the gay community, African-Americans, women.  Even if your lives are  better, you will be punished if you say that's OK, because that's all they  have left.  That's Tiger Woods's crime, apparently.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not.  Tiger Woods plays a game.  </p><p>BRUCE:  He likes the presidency and the president, and African-American  lives are better under this president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  This is such a cheap argument about  unemployment rates.  Let me just say, Tiger Woods plays the game.</p><p>BRUCE:  The lowest unemployment rate in history is a cheap argument? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That is a cheap argument.  That's ridiculous.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  If you were saying to me, \"Oh, you know what?\"</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"President Trump is now about lowering black unemployment so  that it matches white unemployment.  Or President Obama [SIC] -- President  Trump is doing something\" --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Going after MS-13.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \" -- to encourage job training.\"  No, he's not doing any of  that.  </p><p>Here's what Tiger Woods is about.  Tiger Woods realizes that his sponsors  and the people who play golf, generally white, maybe Republican.  And he is  not taking the risk of speaking truth to power.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- you're just projecting what you think Tiger Woods is  thinking.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, I don't know what he thinks.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Mind reading.</p><p>KILMEADE:  I project this.  He's known him for 15, 20 years, and likes him.   I'll project that.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And we all seem to recall --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's probably a better idea.  </p><p>PERINO:  He also -- I didn't have a chance to talk.  He also has to -- a  responsibility to himself and to his business and to --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There we go.</p><p>PERINO:  So look, if I were his P.R. advisor and I anticipated that  question, I'm like, that is a great answer.  You might get dinged on ESPN,  but if you want to focus, you really want to make a comeback in golf,  you've got to focus on this and not allow a distraction with politics.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like, politics in other arenas, sucks.  Politics kills  everything.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  All right.  So I guess Greg gets the last word.  Meanwhile,  coming up straight ahead, keeping a room cold is apparently now sexist.   That story is next.  Please gradually zoom out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  All right, everybody.  Cries of sexism in the New York  gubernatorial race, not about politics but about room temperature.  </p><p>Cynthia Nixon's team is accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being sexist for  trying to debate in a chilly room when they face off tomorrow night.  </p><p>Turns out this is a battle many Americans face.  A recent survey says 43  percent of coworkers have clashed --</p><p>KILMEADE:  To battle.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- over being too hot or too cold in the workplace.  </p><p>Obviously, Cynthia Nixon is Goldilocks.  Look, if she can't handle a room  temperature properly, how can she handle being in a variety of different  rooms, dealing with politicians, et cetera?  Greg, I'm sure you might have  something to say about that.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  She -- she wants 76 degrees in a packed auditorium? </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's freezing.</p><p>GUTFELD:  If you take the body heat of the -- you're going to put it into  the 80s, and they are going to despise her.  </p><p>By the way, this is -- it is a fact.  This is a biological difference among  many.  And if you deny it, you're a science denier.  We all have -- we have  different metabolic rates.  So men actually can handle, I guess, the cold  better.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Women are hotter.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  That will -- that will end up somewhere.  Take it out of context  and put it on a blog.  There you go.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think it's good news for you, Brian.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Also, Dana, we -- men and women dress differently in the office.   You know?</p><p>PERINO:  I'm freezing every day, so I would give her a little tip.  In my  mug is hot water.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  No, but that's a good idea.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  If I drank rum, that would be a good idea.  It's hot water.  I  hold my cup and it's hot; and then I get -- I don't have to complain too  much about how freezing it is.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But is it sexist?  That's the problem.  Is it sexist?</p><p>PERINO:  No, it's not.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Is it sexist.</p><p>PERINO:  Remember Charlie Crist in Florida?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  And he was going to have a debate.  And one of the big demands is  that he had to have a fan at all times. </p><p>GUTFELD:  And where was the fan?</p><p>PERINO:  Underneath the podium.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  It was right at an odd level.  It was the strangest thing.  </p><p>PERINO:  Yes, it's a very strange thing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like a fan --</p><p>PERINO:  And that is not sexist.  That is just a demand.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, because there's a reality here.  There's a political  reality that if you go back, I think it's the 1960 campaign with  Nixon/Kennedy.  That they had a debate, and Nixon -- Nixon starts to pop  sweat.</p><p>GUTFELD:  So she wants him to sweat.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And he looks terrible on TV.  He looks like he's fleeing a crime  scene.  </p><p>BRUCE:  They have to adjusts, but these days, everything either --  everything has to be sexist.  But when you're running -- when our argument  is, is that we are the same; women can do what men do.  But now everything  has to be adjusted because we can't handle a room temperature? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, no.  That's not what they're saying.  They're saying --  she's saying that she wants to eliminate his demand that it be freezing.   And he has said he likes a cold environment.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  In the past, but the thing is, it's like boxing, Juan.</p><p>BRUCE:  And she wants it at 76.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're a boxing fan.  If you're the champion, you get to pick  the ring, the venue.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what she said.  She said CBS, the local CBS, the  affiliate here in New York, negotiated exclusively with him.  Because she  wanted several debates.  She's only getting one debate on his terms.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Because he's -- he's leading.  And he doesn't even really need to  do it, because he's ahead.  But thank you for man-splaining that for me.  </p><p>Yes, I mean, this is -- this is what you're going to see, and this is what  we want.  I want women to run for office, but we don't want it to all be  about sexism.  </p><p>PERINO:  I do want it to be comfortable in the room.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But 76 isn't even comfortable.  Right?  I mean, she's asking -- </p><p>PERINO:  No, see it depends.  Like, at 75, I'm cold.  At 76, I'm hot.  So  it's, like, 75.5 would be perfect.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Do you want to talk about sexism, though?  Think about all of the  men who built buildings, who built the buildings that people actually use,  who risked their lives on girders in the 1960s and the 1970s, who built the  bridges.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And then blew the money on the track.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Or if the -- oh, no, they fell.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  They fell.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Brooklyn Bridge, look at the numbers of people who died on the  Brooklyn Bridge.  </p><p>BRUCE:  All the men who made things possible and now women can help make  them possible, too.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  There you go.</p><p>BRUCE:  Coming up, \"One More Thing\" is coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"OMT\" -- Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Gregory, you know what?  Dreams do come true. </p><p>GUTFELD:  No, they don't.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And sometimes in doubles.  Yes, because that's what happened for  Sophia Sanchez, an 11-year-old awaiting a heart transplant in Chicago.  She  posted a video of her dancing in the hospital with an I.V. in her arm to  rapper Drake's \"In My Feelings.\"  So then she asked Drake to come visit  her.  Against all odds, guess what happened?  He did.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOPHIA SANCHEZ, HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT:  Oh, my God! </p><p>DRAKE, RAP ARTIST:  You asked me to come, I'm here.  What's up?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Sophia -- Sophia also asked -- and this is the double, Gregory - - Sophia asked for a new heart, because she was struggling.  And guess  what?  The second dream also came true. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're getting a heart.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  I'm getting a heart, Mom!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, my gosh.  So yesterday, Sophia had the heart implanted and,  according to her mom, Natalie, Sophia is doing well.  I want you to know,  Sophia, you've got five people here at FOX rooting and praying for you. </p><p>PERINO:  Like, 500 million.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Really. </p><p>GUTFELD:  You have proven me wrong, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wow.  What?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Now I need to find a heart.  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  No one's going to give you a heart.</p><p>GUTFELD:  No one's going to give me a heart.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Especially after this.</p><p>GRAPHIC:  Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News.\"  Got a lot of big news in  the Brian Kilmeade spelling arena.  Let's go live to tape.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  There's a word that  Canada has trouble with.  It's M-I-L-K.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Now, in terms of Canada, I guess Canada hates milk.  I mean,  hates to talk about milk, M-A-L-K.  </p><p>STEVE DOOCY, CO-HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  They're lactose intolerant.</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's what you've got.</p><p>DOOCY:  By the way, Brian -- Brian, did you say -- it's \"M-I-L-K\". </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're right.  Thank you very much.</p><p>DOOCY:  Not \"M-A-L-K.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- thanks for correcting me.  You helped me, saved a  headline.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  How nice of Larry to correct you on television.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  That would have slipped by the Gutfeld staff, except for Larry  corrected me. </p><p>PERINO:  I thought I heard you say \"I\" in my -- OK, you didn't. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I know how to spell \"milk,\" just not in the morning. </p><p>GUTFELD:  Dana. </p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about \"potato\"? </p><p>PERINO:  I have something to promote.  I'm going to be on Tucker Carlson  tonight at 8 p.m., so you can check that out there.  We have a graphic.   Yes, I have a graphic today.  </p><p>Marie Unanue, she has a new book.  She's a friend of mine.  And it is  called \"The Adventures of Phatty and Payaso: Central Park,\" ad it's a  children's book, a chapter book, actually.  So if you are a little more  advanced, you might like it.  Phatty and Payaso, they go to Central Park.   They want to go take a stand against bullying, but then they get -- all  sorts of adventures.  They have a LetsBeKind.com adventure that goes with  it, if you want to check it out.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Real quick, my paperback of \"Andrew Jackson: Miracle of New  Orleans,\" includes what other presidents thought of Andrew Jackson, because  he's so controversial today.  It's coming out in October.  And I'm going to  couple it with three events.  One in Tampa, one in Norfolk, one in  Nashville.  His BrianKilmeade.com.  </p><p>I want to talk about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli  pirates, as well as \"Andrew Jackson: Miracle of New Orleans.\"  \"America  Great from the Start.\"  Because so many people have problems with our  history, I wanted to have a live event where people can ask questions.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Excellent, brain.  Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  And for everyone's books and events, you can now get a pumpkin  spice latte.  I know fall does not start until the 22, but already the  pumpkin spice latte is out.  It is their biggest selling drink of all time.</p><p>GUTFELD:  I love it.  I love it.</p><p>BRUCE:  I -- I love it as well.</p><p>PERINO:  You do?</p><p>BRUE:  Normally, I like regular coffee but in this case, that's for me -- </p><p>PERINO:  In 95 degree heat? </p><p>BRUCE:  In season, sure.</p><p>KILMEADE:  But they use real pumpkin.</p><p>BRUCE:  They use real pumpkin, and you can get a pumpkin scones.  You can  get, like, a cookie in the shape of an owl that's a pumpkin.  So welcome to  fall, and enjoy the pumpkin spice latte.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  All right.  Set your DVRs.  Never miss an episode of THE FIVE.   \"SPECIAL REPORT\" up next.  Hey, Bret.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Greg, thanks.

THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, CNN announced a bombshell that Michael Cohen said President  Trump knew about that meeting between his son and a Russian claiming to  have dirt on Hillary.  Something as rare as air.  It was one of a thousand  final nails in the coffin of Trump's presidency.  But then, Lanny Davis,  Hillary's creepy fixer, who's now defending Trump's creepy fixer, figure  that out, says it's creepy client didn't have such info, which is odd since  now it's revealed that creepy Davis was the anonymous creepy source who  supplied creepy CNN with that creepy info that the network then milked to  death while lecturing us on ethics.  So CNN is in a creepy pickle.  There  source for their biggest story of the year is giving us the creeps.  So  you're following this?  Which I wasn't.  I need to run my soul through a  car wash after all this.  </p><p>Unlike the rest of the media who eat this stuff up no matter the sourcing.   They're like a drunk frat boy at 3 AM.  They'll eat a pop tart off the  floor as long as there's ketchup.  So when Avenatti comes knocking, CNN  shrieks like Bieber fans with backstage passes, and why?  Only because it  perpetuates a story that the media can't stop feeding on.  Two years ago,  they were gorging on electing Trump.  Now they gorge on impeaching him.   Avenatti, Cohen, and Davis, three square meals the media devours daily.   But gluttony is a sin, no wonder they all seem so dumb and slow.  And  what's called reporting now is just rumor, spoon-fed from creep seeking  money, power, or fame.  I wish I could ignore them all, but what is it that  that guy keeps saying?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Long week?  Relax with a glass and let's get after it.   Lots to figure out.  What do you say?  Let's get after it.  It's going to  us two hours to do it, so what do you say?  Let's get after it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Let's get after it.  I've got something better.  How about let's  get accurate?  This is an amazing, blockbuster story, Kilmeade.  I want you  to try to get your head around it.  I know it might be tough for you  because you're working all the time.  But this is CNN's source  contradicting what they said to CNN, so somebody is lying.  Do you think  this will be on Michael Stelter's reliable sources?  </p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:  I say they rather have a test pattern to  put this on his reliable sources.  Lanny Davis is also a crisis expert.   That's where he wrote a book on.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>KILMEADE:  So here his crisis.  How do I solve the crisis?  Take  responsibility for it.  I'll take the heat and I can handle it.  He also  said the reporting got mixed up through the cross of the criminal  investigation.  No, that didn't work.  I made a mistake.  I did not mean to  be cute.  Never was.  Says he didn't lie to CNN.  He unintentionally  misspoke.  Said he, his instinct -- his instinct --this is what he said  about what Cohen knows.  His instinct was that his client might have  something to say about Mueller, about hacking, but he shouldn't have said  anything.  That is your lawyer.  This is nothing to do with Cohen.  It's  all about Hillary Clinton and Lanny Davis.  Cohen doesn't come up.  </p><p>So the question is, is he worried that Michael Cohen put his hand on the  bible and swore that he was telling the truth and said he had nothing to do  with this -- that Trump knew nothing about this Trump Tower situation.  And  when he came out and says now he knows, then Cohen suddenly looks as though  he created -- he committed perjury, so then he had to backtrack?  Or did he  just make it up and Michael Cohen said you're doing a really bad job.  I  know I'm not paying you, but you can't make things up.  There's more to  this story.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, you know -- OK, Dana, I want to stick to the CNN thing  because why not?  It's fun.  That was a natulite 26 story.  CNN said Lanny  Davis didn't make any comment on that.  So, this is from Glenn Greenwald.   I'm actually quoting a Glenn Greenwald article.  But, no.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: . but he's right.  CNN says Lanny Davis refused to comment, so  either CNN lied to its audience about Davis, or Davis is lying now.  </p><p>PERINO:  Or they were -- or they're protecting -- they were trying to  protect him at the time.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>PERINO: . to protect their source and say it wasn't that why people do  disagree with using background sources.  But in a case -- a situation like  this, then you're dealing with people's lives, including the president in  terms of their future judicial or legal problems, then people do leak and  they do speak on background.  The other thing that's happening here is you  have both camps trying to advance their story with the media on background  trying to be cute.  Then they go on the record.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>PERINO: . on cable news and they get a little bit crossed wide.  But I  believe CNN says they're sticking with the story.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, they are.</p><p>PERINO:  Because maybe they have another source that told them that the  story is true.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  And who could that source be?  Is there another lawyer that we're  missing out on?  </p><p>PERINO:  Probably</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, some other guy.  Tammy, if this were -- this would be -- if  this were on the other side, this would be yet another smoking gun.</p><p>TAMMY Bruce, FOX NEWS HOST:  Sure.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But the media doesn't see this as anything special.  </p><p>BRUCE:  No, and they're going to make it go away.  But, of course, this is  why when the president says fake news, everybody goes nuts.  This is  exactly what he's talking about, the use of an individual.  And this is  almost -- on the theory like too good to check, right?  That they get what  they need from their source to move several days with a huge story at the  time -- it was another nail in the thousand nails, as you've noted.  And  then they get that mileage and they figure that that's all that they need  and that they gin this up in this way, and then it just goes away.  It  floats away.  But the viewers know it.  CNN is now losing their programs to  things like Ancient Aliens.  So, obviously, Ancient Aliens doing things  that CNN won't do and can't do.  So this is what the president complains  about.  It's what you see the crowds at the rallies, you know, yelling at  CNN about.  It hurts not just Cohen and this entire process legally but how  media is viewed again.  It's another nail in a coffin, but it's not  President Trump.  It's a legacy media and what they're willing to do.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Juan, I'm just severely disappointed in the whole legal world  right now.  Aren't you saddened?  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Of the legal world?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.  These lawyers are just terrible, Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Giuliani, yeah, I would agree.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm way, way, way, in disagreement with all of you on this one  because it seems to me like you're in the weeds and you're just playing out  this tired theme of, oh, the right wing hates the elite mainstream media.   This is not a big story in terms of CNN says they're standing by their  story.  They say they have corroboration for the story.  They've had every  opportunity to say, hey, we made a mistake.  In addition to which,  remember, CNN fired reporters when reporters got an earlier story about  Trump wrong.  So I would think that people on the right would say, huh, CNN  is not firing anybody in this case.  They're not backing off.  And the one  who is saying that he did something wrong is Lanny Davis.  Lanny Davis is a  stand-up guy here and saying, hey. </p><p>KILMEADE:  Stand-up guy?  He made stuff up about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  And then he lied about it.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He said he was speculating, Brian.  And he has acknowledged that  he was wrong.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that, right?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that he was speculating?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what he said.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm just saying if you want to know the important story here,  the important story was when Cohen stood up in court and implicated the  president in an illegal payoff of a porn star.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But when everyone involved is lying at some point.  Look, if you  see a crowd of people who are lying at some point about a variety of  issues, and then you got a guy who's been threatened with life in prison  but pledging that he knows something, no wonder people don't take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He was in court.  He had -- he put his -- I mean, he could be in  jail.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Don't liberals all the time argue that people will say -- and  they'll confess to things they've never done before simply because of the  pressure by law enforcement?  </p><p>PERINO:  Can I just make one point though, several times and I think Maggie  Haberman reporting the New York Times, at least twice, stories broken,  legal camp on the president side had said not true.  Or the president even  -- fake news or spokesmen said not true.  Then five or six months later you  turn -- oh, it actually is true.  So I think that the media is being played  a little bit but both sides on the legal side of things.  It's difficult to  try these cases on the court of public.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But, you know what?  The thing is there's one side that  definitely wants their story to be true, so they're willing to pay -- play  more fast and loose.  Can we talk about Bruce Ohr?  Is that not a story,  the former DOJ guy who's testifying in a closed door hearing over his  relations with Christopher Steele, the spy who tried to bring Trump down  with that dossier.  This -- in my opinion, this is a pretty, damn, big  story.  He's pushing the dossier created by Fusion GPS, where his wife  works, and then he says he feared of being exposed by this when Comey got  fired.  This is -- I mean, we make fun of the phrase deep state, but this  ain't shallow state.  </p><p>PERINO:  Which is why he's testifying behind closed doors.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right.  Which I think both sides want now because they feel as  though not enough gets done when they're out in public, although I think  Peter Strzok exposing his demeanor, his smugness goes a long way  understanding what goes on -- what was really going on behind closed doors.   This is what Catherine Herridge has told us so far.  She did a great job  standing outside.  So, Bruce Ohr, according to Darrell Issa, his memory is  in-perfect, but he does say he's never had a case like this in 20 years.   He goes on to say when they're caught lying, Simpson said, the first time,  Glenn Simpson who owns Fusion GPS, where Bruce Ohr's wife works, said the  first time that I was dealing with Bruce Ohr was at thanksgiving.  The  problem is there's email exchanges that shows they'd been communicating  since August.  Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, and Glenn Simpson all contradict each  other.  And there's no way that that should be allowed if you're trying to  do an investigation.  And if the FBI or Department of Justice was doing  this investigation, they would not be tolerating this.  So they've got to  get all three out there in front of us and tried to contradict each other.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And you know what we're seeing here is the weaponising, as we've  discussed, of the federal law enforcement framework against a presidential  election and a presidential nominee, a candidate, which is what they  wanted, which was an insurance policy to keep something from happening.  So  when you look at that -- and this is another -- it's a blessing for  conservatives everywhere.  Particular communities in this country talk  about law enforcement, framing people, making up evidence, targeting  individuals to get them -- deciding that the ends justifies the means, and  a lot of people who don't go through that experience say, oh, that could  never really happen.  We're now seeing it happen at a federal level.  So  it's an education for all of us.  Not just at that level but at the local  level as well when it comes to what law enforcement is willing to do.  And  the cleanup that has to happen around the country for all of us just when  it comes to who we trust and whether or not we're going to really take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  So, in other words -- so you're just happy defaming the FBI, the  Justice Department, anybody that's questioning President Trump.  This is  the story again.  So here we are.  Oh, this means that there's nothing,  nothing that the president has done wrong.  President Trump is a victim.   This is madness.  I mean, you have to ignore the facts on the ground.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  We're just reporting the story about this guy.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  You have to ignore the fact that Bruce Ohr is an  expert on Russia.  You have to ignore the fact that therefore people like  Christopher Steele would be going to Bruce Ohr and saying, hey, guess what,  Sally Yates just got tossed.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan, you should be upset too, because all these corruptions and  all of these back-and-forth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What corruption?</p><p>BRUCE:  And Bruce Ohr saying we're going to get caught, that obscures any  legitimate investigation that people may be would have wanted.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  All I know is.</p><p>BRUCE:  Because this becomes the story.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me just say, I think we had the president going after Jeff  Sessions, his own Republican attorney general.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Who recused himself.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He's not doing anything.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  So he's going after Rod Rosenstein.  He's going after  the FBI.  Who else -- who isn't he going after?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  All I can say is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just look at this.  Juan, just look at this.  Nobody said Donald  Trump is playing the perfect game so far.  All we're saying is look at the  text messages and the exchanges.  Look at the facts.  You should be as  outraged as anybody.  And then, pick your time when Trump is out of control  and say this is out of control.  But this is not Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  You know what?  Feels like this Ohr is in hot water.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Republicans warning voters about what will happen if Nancy Pelosi  becomes speaker again.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO:  The Trump effect being put to the test again in key primaries  today.  Trump backed Congressman Ron Desantis is trying to secure the  Republican nomination to replace outgoing Florida Governor Rick Scott.  And  Scott is looking to wrap up the GOP senate nodded with a big boost from  Trump.  And in Arizona, it's a senate Republican primary featuring three  candidates who are all strongly behind the president's agenda.  In the  backdrop of tonight races, a major warning sign for Republican midterm  voters.  GOP lawmakers are circulating a list of potential issues Democrats  may investigate if they retake the house.  Will this threat helped turn out  the base?  </p><p>The list is pretty amazing.  It's basically of all the list that the house  Democrats have sent requesting hearings on such issues as President Trump's  tax returns, President Trump's family business, the payment to Stormy  Daniels, James Comey's firing, cabinet secretary travel, the travel ban,  family separation, on and on.  It's basically, pretty much, nothing else  would get done except for investigations, if this were to actually happen.   So the Republicans -- sometimes, Tammy, you have to scare your base into  turning out.  </p><p>BRUCE:  You do.  And yet, this is pretty much what people want to do.   They're still talking about impeachment even though some people are saying,  well, that's not really a good idea.  Even Adam Schiff the other day said,  well, we really can't really talk about that right now.  But if President  Trump is everything they say he is.  I mean, he's Hitler.  He's carrying  babies away from moms.  Why wouldn't you want to?  Why suddenly if he's the  worst guy in the world but then you really don't want to investigate  anything or you don't want to impeach him.  And so that's what we're  looking at.  And these are serious things that the Democrats have been  running on and have been talking to their base about.  And we can expect  them to do it partly because they don't want to govern.  That's been a big  problem with Democrats.  They gin up the bases, they get people all  excited, but they don't want to govern.  And this.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Where did you get that from?  </p><p>BRUCE:  From the last eight years with Barack Obama.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  Oh, please, are you kidding?  I think  Republicans, in fact, thought that he -- it was overreaching, doing too  much, and had to obstruct him.  I could go on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Bill Clinton governed.  And that's why that administration, even  with impeachment, worked because he enjoyed the process.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think -- look, I think, just seriously, Dana has a point here  about who's stirring up the base.  That this is an action being taken by  Republicans right now to say if you allow Democrats to take control of the  house, we are going to lose President Trump because he may be impeached.   And they see this, and I think rightly, as stirring up the GOP base because  it's so strongly pro-Trump.  And that those people then will turn out and  not turn off, given all the bad news that Trump is experiencing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  So stirring up the base though -- let's go back to this because  telling the truth can actually stir up the base.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  And I like how the Democrats are pretending that they  aren't really interested impeachment.  That's like a teenager trying to  sneak a bottle of booze outside the house -- outside the house in front of  their parents.  Oh, no, it's just a water bottle.  We know the Democrats  are waiting to spring this on if they get the house.  They're playing this  down so they can then raise it when they can.  So I do believe telling --  telling the truth can be stirring the base, by the way.  Democrats stir the  base by painting Trump is Hitler.  You know as.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, she said separating children from their parents.  Boy, I  think that's true.  Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Stirring the base.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about this?  Democrats want to do away with ICE, how about  that?  Oh, yeah, they want to do away with ICE. </p><p>PERINO:  The point about family separation policy, there're already was a  hearing about that.  And so.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And then we'll have to deal with Barack Obama's establishment of  it, and the fact that.  </p><p>PERINO:  The other thing is that the Democrats -- you know, they're finding  out that some of their fringe on the left that come up with ideas like  abolishing ICE, and it's not just the fringe, some mainstream Democrats as  well.  It's not going over so well.  There was a poll taken by A.P., 57  percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, but the number that don't  -- there's only 18 percent of Democrats favor dismantling this, Ok?  So  they're having to answer questions for things that their left, far left is  suggesting.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But some of that -- high profile people are saying it.  Bernie  Sanders, Gillibrand, and they're the ones saying it.  And you can just say  OK.  You deal with it because it's not somebody writing this and they're  not putting their name on it, these are major speeches given in front of  major audiences to get a loud round of applause.  The Democrats who have  been successful in the special election, he's the close the gap or walk  away with the win are the ones who are in the middle that still clearly  criticize Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian, you want to get rid of the Ice Capades, which I think is  heartless.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Why do you feel that way about the Ice Capades?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  The Ice Capades, I feel like it never ends.  There's no  beginning and there's no end.  I feel like.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And by the way, there's no scoring either at Ice Capades.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Crickets scares me.</p><p>PERINO:  All right, up next, President Trump with a new warning for Google  after claiming the company is silencing conservatives, up next.</p><p>GUTFELD:  What is a Capades?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  President Trump going after Google this morning on twitter,  accusing the tech giant of being politically biased against conservatives.   The president claims searched results are, quote, rigged, end quote,  against him and other Republicans as well to suppress any good news about  the Trump presidency.  Now, the president doubling down this very  afternoon. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Yeah, I think  Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a  very serious thing and it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and  what others are doing, if you look at what's going-on on twitter, if you  look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you  can't do that to people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Google firing back saying its searches don't promote a political  agenda.  So what do you think?  </p><p>BRUCE:  Look, we have a history with all of the social media, and Facebook  is also mentioned as a very good example.  Remember their trending stories  column that they said was the trending news of the day based on their  algorithms.  And then we realize that there was no real conservative sites,  there's no conservative stories, there was nothing pro-conservative, and  former editors came out and said that they routinely suppressed  conservative news, things that conservatives would make them look good or  would be of interest to conservatives, and then they had to eventually  shutdown that entire framework.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me pick up on this and ask you a question.  Much of it has  to do, according to Google, with the idea that if you are searching  something they give you what they call accredited sites like big newspapers  that they have a sense of trust in their content as opposed to giving them  simply opinionated sites that are likely tilted.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But that's the problem is that when you're liberal and you see a  liberal side, that is the one that is legitimate to you, and you're going  to view an opposing website in a different way because you don't agree with  it.  So if you're going to rank certain websites, you're going to rank them  based on whether or not it looks like real life to you.  That, look, if  you're a liberal or a conservative, you're not going to look at your own  material as being biased because it's what you also believe.  And this is  why when you've got 80 percent -- 85 percent of American media identifies  effectively as liberal, as not conservative, and then you're going to have  a Google determine which sites are going to be more legitimate, they're  going to rate more legitimate the sites that they agree with that looks  like their worldview.  And automatically.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What about -- and it seems to me like saying there's no truth,  there's no fact, there's no accurate news coverage in the country, so you  just give me liberal opinion or give me conservative opinions.  Is that  we're saying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, I think they're talking about -- this is the hottest issue  in the country and there's no easy answer.  This is the stem cell research  of our generation, of this decade, because everyone thinks social media is  the problem for their own reasons.  I don't necessarily have the reason but  Amazon, Google, Facebook, and twitter, they have to -- we have to come up  with something that will work.  I think, fundamentally, they actually want  to get it to work.  I think there's legitimate criticisms of those sites.   My frustration is when -- for example, CEO Jack Dorsey comes to Capitol  Hill to go in front of the energy committee on September 5th, next week, is  there going to be anyone who's an expert to be able to ask him the types of  questions.  They're going to move the conversation forward or we going to  see a bunch.  </p><p>PERINO:  So you think those hearings are unsatisfying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Well, I know you're being sarcastic.  But we need somebody in  the middle that is unbiased to say here's an idea of what to do because  lawmakers who belong to a party are not capable of coming up with an  answer.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  By the way, Brian, Larry Kudlow said today, well, he's looking  at the possibility of regulating them.  And I think. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I don't know where you start?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  But that is so shocking to me that he would  suggest that the government now. </p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow, I mean, he's a free-market guy and  conservatives typically are not for more regulation.  I would add that --  1:40 PM today, before the Daily Briefings, I checked Google News --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Your show.</p><p>PERINO:  -- to see what was there.  And the No. 1 story was a CNN story  about debunking a Trump myth of some sort.  A CNN Money story was about how  Google is rigged against conservatives, based on the president's tweet.   And the third story was the FOX News story about Tiger Woods.  And I think  we're going to talk about that later.  </p><p>So I think that there's -- there's a lot of room for this algorithm to be  manipulated.  And all of these sites are privately-held companies.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And they're powerful.</p><p>PERINO:  But they also would say to you, \"It doesn't make sense for us to  alienate half of the country\" when they're trying to make money.  Remember,  it was Michael Jordan said Republicans buy shoes, too.  So they're going to  try to make a free-market argument next week.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Greg, so I was surprised to see that the president's going  after Google.  He had a bad week, and I guess he does his rage Googling --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That was last week.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- and says, \"Oh, my God.  Look at -- they've got negative  stories here from New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.\" </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"I don't like these stories.  Give me some conservative thing.\"  But here's Trump back in July.  He says the European Union is fining  Google, and they're one of America's greatest companies.  </p><p>PERINO:  Oh, right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But today, it's a different story.  </p><p>PERINO:  That's right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  I mean, it surprises you Trump changes his opinion?  I mean, it's  been going on for two years.  I think what Google is guilty of, everyone  else in the media.  They're chasing words and not deeds.  </p><p>The deeds are good news.  We have an 18-year high in optimism right now.   That's not being reported.  If you want onto Google and Googled Mexican  trade, you would've gotten the top stories about the awkward phone call.   You wouldn't have gotten the Mexican trade story.  </p><p>And he's just like us.  He Googles his name, and he gets mad when there's  bad news.  If you Google \"Kilmeade,\" the first thing --</p><p>KILMEADE:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>GUTFELD:  -- you're going to get is \"hairpiece.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right, right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But don't Google Kilmeade and hairpiece, because then you'll see  what happens.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, but 99 percent of the stuff on us is negative.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, yes, yes.  And I'm used to it.</p><p>And if you look at Google Doodles, which I love.  You know, instead of  Easter, they'll have an activist.  Instead of Christmas, they'll do some  kind of festival.  Instead of Burning Man -- I mean, they'll do Burning Man  instead of Lou Dobbs's birthday.  They're the king of virtue signaling.  </p><p>You ask, like, why would you alienate half the conversation?  It's to keep  activists at bay.  They would rather alienate half a population than have  somebody come after them and say, \"You're bigoted.  You're sexist.  You're  racists.\"</p><p>They need to do a Google search on wisdom.  Because right now, what they're  doing is they're helping China in their A.I.   Correct?  But they are  leaving -- they want to leave helping the military and making more precise  drones that actually save lives.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK, I've got a question for you about Alex Jones.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Because we know that some of these sites pushed Alex Jones and  his conspiracy theories off on the idea that it's hate speech.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Why wouldn't you want to support that, Greg? </p><p>GUTFELD:  I think Alex Jones is hate speech.  It's the same way I feel  about Louis Farrakhan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK.  ESPN melting down --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Where is he?  On Twitter wearing a bowtie.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- over Tiger Woods's refusal to criticize President Trump.  The  growing controversy -- you heard Dana reference it -- when we return.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you say to people who might find it interesting  that you have, I guess, a friendly relationship with him?  </p><p>TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER:  Well, he's our -- he's the president of  the United States.  And you have to respect the office, and no matter who's  in the office.  You may like, dislike personality or the politics.  But we  all must respect the office.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KILMEADE:  But he's done that.  What was wrong with that answer?  ESPN  host, though, hears that answer and thinks Tiger Woods bailed out.  They  are teeing off on Tiger Woods, refusing to take the reporters bait and  criticized President Trump or complement President Trump.  So they start  lashing out against Tiger Woods because he wouldn't lash out against the  president.  For example.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, ESPN CO-HOST, \"FIRST TAKE\":  Tiger Woods is being -- you  said, being slick.  Here, he is being slick.  He says we must respect the  office.  Therefore, that confers respect to the occupant.  Tiger, is that  what you're saying?  If that's what you're saying, that is a stupid  comment.  I don't -- but I don't even know if he believes that that's when  he said.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, first of all, we don't know what Tiger Woods  believes.  He's camblination (ph); he's not black.  When he was arrested,  he was black.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Stephen Hayes Smith is one of the brighter people on television.   I would love to hear him long form.  But Max Kellerman thinks it's just  unthinkable, Dana, that Tiger Woods would--</p><p>PERINO:  Respect the office of the president?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  -- respect the office.  And he probably likes President Trump in  golf has his holes together (ph).</p><p>PERINO:  I thought -- well, all people sports, who play sports, athletes,  thank you.  Looking for the word.  They are going to -- thank you for the  word -- are going to be asked questions about President Trump, because  reporters can't help themselves.  And they're always trying to figure out a  way, how can can they make headlines?  How can they make news?</p><p>The only way to make news, apparently, is the world today is if you ask  somebody how they feel about President Trump, even if that has nothing to  do about their golf game.  </p><p>What I thought is that Tiger Woods knew that a question like that was  probably coming.  And I took it as a sincere genuine answer of how he feels  about the presidency of the United States.  And I think that ESPN, they can  do whatever they want on their show.  But Tiger Woods was prepared for that  question.  But it wasn't like he was reading somebody else's talking  points.  I think he believed it.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Max Kellerman is a virtue-signaling jackass, and here's evidence.   Would he have said that to Jim Brown last week?  Would he have said it to  Jim Brown, you know?  Because Jim Brown would have wiped the floor with  him.  He would have gone to the studio, so he did it because he thought he  could get away with it.  </p><p>This is the problem with injecting politics into bodies that do not have an  immune system for it.  So when you inject politics into sports, sports gets  sick.  When you inject politics into the entertainment world, the  entertainment gets world -- the entertainment world gets sick.  When you  inject politics into academia, what do you get?  You get a poison, toxic  campus.  Whenever you put politics, it gets sick, except on \"The Five.\"   Because we are real.  </p><p>PERINO:  When you put sports -- inject sports into me, I get sick, because  I can't even come up with the word \"athlete.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Put it this way.  If people know President Trump, they have a  different opinion of President Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Tell us about it, Brian.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Mike Tyson knows him.  Dennis Rodman knows him.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Herschel Walker knows him.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just be jotting this down.  Tim Scott got a chance to spend a  lot of time with him.  And guess what?  So did Tiger Woods?</p><p>So Jim Brown joined us this morning on \"FOX &amp; Friends.\"  He is getting  blowback in the black community --</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  -- for saying \"I like President Trump.  I think he's doing a  decent job.\"  Listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JIM BROWN, NFL HALL OF FAME:  The greatest thing about America is that we  all have our opinions and our thoughts.  Nobody is totally correct in  everything that they do.  I have access to the president; and any time I  have access to the president and he will listen to my thoughts, that's all  I can ask of him.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And that's all that he said: \"I have access to the president.\"   That's just like Kanye West: \"I have access, and therefore, I want to be\" - - what'd he say, Yeezy?</p><p>KILMEADE:  You didn't hear the whole thing, but he does say he liked what  he's doing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  More than Obama gave them.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  But you know, what's interesting about the Tiger Woods thing is  Tiger Woods was asked, \"So what about the politics, then?  If you say you  respect the office.\"  </p><p>And by the way, Max Kellerman, he was right when he said this was a slick  move that allowed him to say, \"I respect the office\" without saying, \"Well,  what do you think about this president?\" </p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm sorry?</p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What's the right answer?</p><p>KILMEADE:  He respects the office of the president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not -- that's not an answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Why isn't it?</p><p>PERINO:  Why not?  That's a great answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's perfect</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me tell you why.  It's like saying you respect X, Y, Z.  And  you saying, \"I respect X, Y, G but not -- let's not talk about X, Y, Z.\"   Here's what he said.  He said, \"I just finished 72 holes, and I'm really  hungry.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  At the end.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Does that sound like a kid who's trying to get away from  --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He's 43, and it's the fifth follow-up.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's a big boy, and in this era, President Trump, not the  athletes, have made the issue.  President Trump has gone after NFL players,  who are protesting.  He's gone after Stephen Curry, LeBron James.  Shut up  and dribble?  Because why?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He didn't say that.  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's always saying that these -- </p><p>KILMEADE:  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- people --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He said they're not going to the Oval Office.  Don't bother.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- they don't want anything to do with him for a very real  reason.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CO-HOST:  There is one reason why this is happening.  The  latest poll, 36 percent of African-Americans support the president --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, please.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- because their economy is better.  Lowest unemployment rate in  history for African-Americans.  The future is brighter again.  They're  realizing that the conservative ideal is worthwhile and should be  considered.  They're hearing other African-Americans they like, like Kanye  West, say, \"Wait a minute.  Maybe we should be thinking about things.\"  </p><p>Tiger Woods and others are not conforming, and that's what they expect of  the gay community, African-Americans, women.  Even if your lives are  better, you will be punished if you say that's OK, because that's all they  have left.  That's Tiger Woods's crime, apparently.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not.  Tiger Woods plays a game.  </p><p>BRUCE:  He likes the presidency and the president, and African-American  lives are better under this president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  This is such a cheap argument about  unemployment rates.  Let me just say, Tiger Woods plays the game.</p><p>BRUCE:  The lowest unemployment rate in history is a cheap argument? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That is a cheap argument.  That's ridiculous.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  If you were saying to me, \"Oh, you know what?\"</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"President Trump is now about lowering black unemployment so  that it matches white unemployment.  Or President Obama [SIC] -- President  Trump is doing something\" --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Going after MS-13.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \" -- to encourage job training.\"  No, he's not doing any of  that.  </p><p>Here's what Tiger Woods is about.  Tiger Woods realizes that his sponsors  and the people who play golf, generally white, maybe Republican.  And he is  not taking the risk of speaking truth to power.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- you're just projecting what you think Tiger Woods is  thinking.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, I don't know what he thinks.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Mind reading.</p><p>KILMEADE:  I project this.  He's known him for 15, 20 years, and likes him.   I'll project that.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And we all seem to recall --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's probably a better idea.  </p><p>PERINO:  He also -- I didn't have a chance to talk.  He also has to -- a  responsibility to himself and to his business and to --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There we go.</p><p>PERINO:  So look, if I were his P.R. advisor and I anticipated that  question, I'm like, that is a great answer.  You might get dinged on ESPN,  but if you want to focus, you really want to make a comeback in golf,  you've got to focus on this and not allow a distraction with politics.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like, politics in other arenas, sucks.  Politics kills  everything.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  All right.  So I guess Greg gets the last word.  Meanwhile,  coming up straight ahead, keeping a room cold is apparently now sexist.   That story is next.  Please gradually zoom out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  All right, everybody.  Cries of sexism in the New York  gubernatorial race, not about politics but about room temperature.  </p><p>Cynthia Nixon's team is accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being sexist for  trying to debate in a chilly room when they face off tomorrow night.  </p><p>Turns out this is a battle many Americans face.  A recent survey says 43  percent of coworkers have clashed --</p><p>KILMEADE:  To battle.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- over being too hot or too cold in the workplace.  </p><p>Obviously, Cynthia Nixon is Goldilocks.  Look, if she can't handle a room  temperature properly, how can she handle being in a variety of different  rooms, dealing with politicians, et cetera?  Greg, I'm sure you might have  something to say about that.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  She -- she wants 76 degrees in a packed auditorium? </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's freezing.</p><p>GUTFELD:  If you take the body heat of the -- you're going to put it into  the 80s, and they are going to despise her.  </p><p>By the way, this is -- it is a fact.  This is a biological difference among  many.  And if you deny it, you're a science denier.  We all have -- we have  different metabolic rates.  So men actually can handle, I guess, the cold  better.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Women are hotter.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  That will -- that will end up somewhere.  Take it out of context  and put it on a blog.  There you go.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think it's good news for you, Brian.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Also, Dana, we -- men and women dress differently in the office.   You know?</p><p>PERINO:  I'm freezing every day, so I would give her a little tip.  In my  mug is hot water.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  No, but that's a good idea.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  If I drank rum, that would be a good idea.  It's hot water.  I  hold my cup and it's hot; and then I get -- I don't have to complain too  much about how freezing it is.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But is it sexist?  That's the problem.  Is it sexist?</p><p>PERINO:  No, it's not.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Is it sexist.</p><p>PERINO:  Remember Charlie Crist in Florida?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  And he was going to have a debate.  And one of the big demands is  that he had to have a fan at all times. </p><p>GUTFELD:  And where was the fan?</p><p>PERINO:  Underneath the podium.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  It was right at an odd level.  It was the strangest thing.  </p><p>PERINO:  Yes, it's a very strange thing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like a fan --</p><p>PERINO:  And that is not sexist.  That is just a demand.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, because there's a reality here.  There's a political  reality that if you go back, I think it's the 1960 campaign with  Nixon/Kennedy.  That they had a debate, and Nixon -- Nixon starts to pop  sweat.</p><p>GUTFELD:  So she wants him to sweat.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And he looks terrible on TV.  He looks like he's fleeing a crime  scene.  </p><p>BRUCE:  They have to adjusts, but these days, everything either --  everything has to be sexist.  But when you're running -- when our argument  is, is that we are the same; women can do what men do.  But now everything  has to be adjusted because we can't handle a room temperature? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, no.  That's not what they're saying.  They're saying --  she's saying that she wants to eliminate his demand that it be freezing.   And he has said he likes a cold environment.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  In the past, but the thing is, it's like boxing, Juan.</p><p>BRUCE:  And she wants it at 76.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're a boxing fan.  If you're the champion, you get to pick  the ring, the venue.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what she said.  She said CBS, the local CBS, the  affiliate here in New York, negotiated exclusively with him.  Because she  wanted several debates.  She's only getting one debate on his terms.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Because he's -- he's leading.  And he doesn't even really need to  do it, because he's ahead.  But thank you for man-splaining that for me.  </p><p>Yes, I mean, this is -- this is what you're going to see, and this is what  we want.  I want women to run for office, but we don't want it to all be  about sexism.  </p><p>PERINO:  I do want it to be comfortable in the room.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But 76 isn't even comfortable.  Right?  I mean, she's asking -- </p><p>PERINO:  No, see it depends.  Like, at 75, I'm cold.  At 76, I'm hot.  So  it's, like, 75.5 would be perfect.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Do you want to talk about sexism, though?  Think about all of the  men who built buildings, who built the buildings that people actually use,  who risked their lives on girders in the 1960s and the 1970s, who built the  bridges.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And then blew the money on the track.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Or if the -- oh, no, they fell.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  They fell.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Brooklyn Bridge, look at the numbers of people who died on the  Brooklyn Bridge.  </p><p>BRUCE:  All the men who made things possible and now women can help make  them possible, too.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  There you go.</p><p>BRUCE:  Coming up, \"One More Thing\" is coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"OMT\" -- Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Gregory, you know what?  Dreams do come true. </p><p>GUTFELD:  No, they don't.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And sometimes in doubles.  Yes, because that's what happened for  Sophia Sanchez, an 11-year-old awaiting a heart transplant in Chicago.  She  posted a video of her dancing in the hospital with an I.V. in her arm to  rapper Drake's \"In My Feelings.\"  So then she asked Drake to come visit  her.  Against all odds, guess what happened?  He did.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOPHIA SANCHEZ, HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT:  Oh, my God! </p><p>DRAKE, RAP ARTIST:  You asked me to come, I'm here.  What's up?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Sophia -- Sophia also asked -- and this is the double, Gregory - - Sophia asked for a new heart, because she was struggling.  And guess  what?  The second dream also came true. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're getting a heart.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  I'm getting a heart, Mom!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, my gosh.  So yesterday, Sophia had the heart implanted and,  according to her mom, Natalie, Sophia is doing well.  I want you to know,  Sophia, you've got five people here at FOX rooting and praying for you. </p><p>PERINO:  Like, 500 million.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Really. </p><p>GUTFELD:  You have proven me wrong, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wow.  What?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Now I need to find a heart.  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  No one's going to give you a heart.</p><p>GUTFELD:  No one's going to give me a heart.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Especially after this.</p><p>GRAPHIC:  Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News.\"  Got a lot of big news in  the Brian Kilmeade spelling arena.  Let's go live to tape.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  There's a word that  Canada has trouble with.  It's M-I-L-K.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Now, in terms of Canada, I guess Canada hates milk.  I mean,  hates to talk about milk, M-A-L-K.  </p><p>STEVE DOOCY, CO-HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  They're lactose intolerant.</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's what you've got.</p><p>DOOCY:  By the way, Brian -- Brian, did you say -- it's \"M-I-L-K\". </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're right.  Thank you very much.</p><p>DOOCY:  Not \"M-A-L-K.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- thanks for correcting me.  You helped me, saved a  headline.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  How nice of Larry to correct you on television.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  That would have slipped by the Gutfeld staff, except for Larry  corrected me. </p><p>PERINO:  I thought I heard you say \"I\" in my -- OK, you didn't. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I know how to spell \"milk,\" just not in the morning. </p><p>GUTFELD:  Dana. </p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about \"potato\"? </p><p>PERINO:  I have something to promote.  I'm going to be on Tucker Carlson  tonight at 8 p.m., so you can check that out there.  We have a graphic.   Yes, I have a graphic today.  </p><p>Marie Unanue, she has a new book.  She's a friend of mine.  And it is  called \"The Adventures of Phatty and Payaso: Central Park,\" ad it's a  children's book, a chapter book, actually.  So if you are a little more  advanced, you might like it.  Phatty and Payaso, they go to Central Park.   They want to go take a stand against bullying, but then they get -- all  sorts of adventures.  They have a LetsBeKind.com adventure that goes with  it, if you want to check it out.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Real quick, my paperback of \"Andrew Jackson: Miracle of New  Orleans,\" includes what other presidents thought of Andrew Jackson, because  he's so controversial today.

His BrianKilmeade.com.  </p><p>I want to talk about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli  pirates, as well as \"Andrew Jackson: Miracle of New Orleans.\"  \"America  Great from the Start.\"  Because so many people have problems with our  history, I wanted to have a live event where people can ask questions.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Excellent, brain.

THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, CNN announced a bombshell that Michael Cohen said President  Trump knew about that meeting between his son and a Russian claiming to  have dirt on Hillary.  Something as rare as air.  It was one of a thousand  final nails in the coffin of Trump's presidency.  But then, Lanny Davis,  Hillary's creepy fixer, who's now defending Trump's creepy fixer, figure  that out, says it's creepy client didn't have such info, which is odd since  now it's revealed that creepy Davis was the anonymous creepy source who  supplied creepy CNN with that creepy info that the network then milked to  death while lecturing us on ethics.  So CNN is in a creepy pickle.  There  source for their biggest story of the year is giving us the creeps.  So  you're following this?  Which I wasn't.  I need to run my soul through a  car wash after all this.  </p><p>Unlike the rest of the media who eat this stuff up no matter the sourcing.   They're like a drunk frat boy at 3 AM.  They'll eat a pop tart off the  floor as long as there's ketchup.  So when Avenatti comes knocking, CNN  shrieks like Bieber fans with backstage passes, and why?  Only because it  perpetuates a story that the media can't stop feeding on.  Two years ago,  they were gorging on electing Trump.  Now they gorge on impeaching him.   Avenatti, Cohen, and Davis, three square meals the media devours daily.   But gluttony is a sin, no wonder they all seem so dumb and slow.  And  what's called reporting now is just rumor, spoon-fed from creep seeking  money, power, or fame.  I wish I could ignore them all, but what is it that  that guy keeps saying?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Long week?  Relax with a glass and let's get after it.   Lots to figure out.  What do you say?  Let's get after it.  It's going to  us two hours to do it, so what do you say?  Let's get after it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Let's get after it.  I've got something better.  How about let's  get accurate?  This is an amazing, blockbuster story, Kilmeade.  I want you  to try to get your head around it.  I know it might be tough for you  because you're working all the time.  But this is CNN's source  contradicting what they said to CNN, so somebody is lying.  Do you think  this will be on Michael Stelter's reliable sources?  </p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:  I say they rather have a test pattern to  put this on his reliable sources.  Lanny Davis is also a crisis expert.   That's where he wrote a book on.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>KILMEADE:  So here his crisis.  How do I solve the crisis?  Take  responsibility for it.  I'll take the heat and I can handle it.  He also  said the reporting got mixed up through the cross of the criminal  investigation.  No, that didn't work.  I made a mistake.  I did not mean to  be cute.  Never was.  Says he didn't lie to CNN.  He unintentionally  misspoke.  Said he, his instinct -- his instinct --this is what he said  about what Cohen knows.  His instinct was that his client might have  something to say about Mueller, about hacking, but he shouldn't have said  anything.  That is your lawyer.  This is nothing to do with Cohen.  It's  all about Hillary Clinton and Lanny Davis.  Cohen doesn't come up.  </p><p>So the question is, is he worried that Michael Cohen put his hand on the  bible and swore that he was telling the truth and said he had nothing to do  with this -- that Trump knew nothing about this Trump Tower situation.  And  when he came out and says now he knows, then Cohen suddenly looks as though  he created -- he committed perjury, so then he had to backtrack?  Or did he  just make it up and Michael Cohen said you're doing a really bad job.  I  know I'm not paying you, but you can't make things up.  There's more to  this story.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, you know -- OK, Dana, I want to stick to the CNN thing  because why not?  It's fun.  That was a natulite 26 story.  CNN said Lanny  Davis didn't make any comment on that.  So, this is from Glenn Greenwald.   I'm actually quoting a Glenn Greenwald article.  But, no.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: . but he's right.  CNN says Lanny Davis refused to comment, so  either CNN lied to its audience about Davis, or Davis is lying now.  </p><p>PERINO:  Or they were -- or they're protecting -- they were trying to  protect him at the time.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>PERINO: . to protect their source and say it wasn't that why people do  disagree with using background sources.  But in a case -- a situation like  this, then you're dealing with people's lives, including the president in  terms of their future judicial or legal problems, then people do leak and  they do speak on background.  The other thing that's happening here is you  have both camps trying to advance their story with the media on background  trying to be cute.  Then they go on the record.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.</p><p>PERINO: . on cable news and they get a little bit crossed wide.  But I  believe CNN says they're sticking with the story.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, they are.</p><p>PERINO:  Because maybe they have another source that told them that the  story is true.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  And who could that source be?  Is there another lawyer that we're  missing out on?  </p><p>PERINO:  Probably</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, some other guy.  Tammy, if this were -- this would be -- if  this were on the other side, this would be yet another smoking gun.</p><p>TAMMY Bruce, FOX NEWS HOST:  Sure.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But the media doesn't see this as anything special.  </p><p>BRUCE:  No, and they're going to make it go away.  But, of course, this is  why when the president says fake news, everybody goes nuts.  This is  exactly what he's talking about, the use of an individual.  And this is  almost -- on the theory like too good to check, right?  That they get what  they need from their source to move several days with a huge story at the  time -- it was another nail in the thousand nails, as you've noted.  And  then they get that mileage and they figure that that's all that they need  and that they gin this up in this way, and then it just goes away.  It  floats away.  But the viewers know it.  CNN is now losing their programs to  things like Ancient Aliens.  So, obviously, Ancient Aliens doing things  that CNN won't do and can't do.  So this is what the president complains  about.  It's what you see the crowds at the rallies, you know, yelling at  CNN about.  It hurts not just Cohen and this entire process legally but how  media is viewed again.  It's another nail in a coffin, but it's not  President Trump.  It's a legacy media and what they're willing to do.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Juan, I'm just severely disappointed in the whole legal world  right now.  Aren't you saddened?  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Of the legal world?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.  These lawyers are just terrible, Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Giuliani, yeah, I would agree.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm way, way, way, in disagreement with all of you on this one  because it seems to me like you're in the weeds and you're just playing out  this tired theme of, oh, the right wing hates the elite mainstream media.   This is not a big story in terms of CNN says they're standing by their  story.  They say they have corroboration for the story.  They've had every  opportunity to say, hey, we made a mistake.  In addition to which,  remember, CNN fired reporters when reporters got an earlier story about  Trump wrong.  So I would think that people on the right would say, huh, CNN  is not firing anybody in this case.  They're not backing off.  And the one  who is saying that he did something wrong is Lanny Davis.  Lanny Davis is a  stand-up guy here and saying, hey. </p><p>KILMEADE:  Stand-up guy?  He made stuff up about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  And then he lied about it.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He said he was speculating, Brian.  And he has acknowledged that  he was wrong.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that, right?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You don't buy that he was speculating?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what he said.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm just saying if you want to know the important story here,  the important story was when Cohen stood up in court and implicated the  president in an illegal payoff of a porn star.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But when everyone involved is lying at some point.  Look, if you  see a crowd of people who are lying at some point about a variety of  issues, and then you got a guy who's been threatened with life in prison  but pledging that he knows something, no wonder people don't take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He was in court.  He had -- he put his -- I mean, he could be in  jail.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Don't liberals all the time argue that people will say -- and  they'll confess to things they've never done before simply because of the  pressure by law enforcement?  </p><p>PERINO:  Can I just make one point though, several times and I think Maggie  Haberman reporting the New York Times, at least twice, stories broken,  legal camp on the president side had said not true.  Or the president even  -- fake news or spokesmen said not true.  Then five or six months later you  turn -- oh, it actually is true.  So I think that the media is being played  a little bit but both sides on the legal side of things.  It's difficult to  try these cases on the court of public.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But, you know what?  The thing is there's one side that  definitely wants their story to be true, so they're willing to pay -- play  more fast and loose.  Can we talk about Bruce Ohr?  Is that not a story,  the former DOJ guy who's testifying in a closed door hearing over his  relations with Christopher Steele, the spy who tried to bring Trump down  with that dossier.  This -- in my opinion, this is a pretty, damn, big  story.  He's pushing the dossier created by Fusion GPS, where his wife  works, and then he says he feared of being exposed by this when Comey got  fired.  This is -- I mean, we make fun of the phrase deep state, but this  ain't shallow state.  </p><p>PERINO:  Which is why he's testifying behind closed doors.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right.  Which I think both sides want now because they feel as  though not enough gets done when they're out in public, although I think  Peter Strzok exposing his demeanor, his smugness goes a long way  understanding what goes on -- what was really going on behind closed doors.   This is what Catherine Herridge has told us so far.  She did a great job  standing outside.  So, Bruce Ohr, according to Darrell Issa, his memory is  in-perfect, but he does say he's never had a case like this in 20 years.   He goes on to say when they're caught lying, Simpson said, the first time,  Glenn Simpson who owns Fusion GPS, where Bruce Ohr's wife works, said the  first time that I was dealing with Bruce Ohr was at thanksgiving.  The  problem is there's email exchanges that shows they'd been communicating  since August.  Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, and Glenn Simpson all contradict each  other.  And there's no way that that should be allowed if you're trying to  do an investigation.  And if the FBI or Department of Justice was doing  this investigation, they would not be tolerating this.  So they've got to  get all three out there in front of us and tried to contradict each other.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And you know what we're seeing here is the weaponising, as we've  discussed, of the federal law enforcement framework against a presidential  election and a presidential nominee, a candidate, which is what they  wanted, which was an insurance policy to keep something from happening.  So  when you look at that -- and this is another -- it's a blessing for  conservatives everywhere.  Particular communities in this country talk  about law enforcement, framing people, making up evidence, targeting  individuals to get them -- deciding that the ends justifies the means, and  a lot of people who don't go through that experience say, oh, that could  never really happen.  We're now seeing it happen at a federal level.  So  it's an education for all of us.  Not just at that level but at the local  level as well when it comes to what law enforcement is willing to do.  And  the cleanup that has to happen around the country for all of us just when  it comes to who we trust and whether or not we're going to really take it  seriously.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  So, in other words -- so you're just happy defaming the FBI, the  Justice Department, anybody that's questioning President Trump.  This is  the story again.  So here we are.  Oh, this means that there's nothing,  nothing that the president has done wrong.  President Trump is a victim.   This is madness.  I mean, you have to ignore the facts on the ground.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  We're just reporting the story about this guy.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  You have to ignore the fact that Bruce Ohr is an  expert on Russia.  You have to ignore the fact that therefore people like  Christopher Steele would be going to Bruce Ohr and saying, hey, guess what,  Sally Yates just got tossed.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan, you should be upset too, because all these corruptions and  all of these back-and-forth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What corruption?</p><p>BRUCE:  And Bruce Ohr saying we're going to get caught, that obscures any  legitimate investigation that people may be would have wanted.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  All I know is.</p><p>BRUCE:  Because this becomes the story.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me just say, I think we had the president going after Jeff  Sessions, his own Republican attorney general.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Who recused himself.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He's not doing anything.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  So he's going after Rod Rosenstein.  He's going after  the FBI.  Who else -- who isn't he going after?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  All I can say is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just look at this.  Juan, just look at this.  Nobody said Donald  Trump is playing the perfect game so far.  All we're saying is look at the  text messages and the exchanges.  Look at the facts.  You should be as  outraged as anybody.  And then, pick your time when Trump is out of control  and say this is out of control.  But this is not Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  You know what?  Feels like this Ohr is in hot water.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Republicans warning voters about what will happen if Nancy Pelosi  becomes speaker again.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO:  The Trump effect being put to the test again in key primaries  today.  Trump backed Congressman Ron Desantis is trying to secure the  Republican nomination to replace outgoing Florida Governor Rick Scott.  And  Scott is looking to wrap up the GOP senate nodded with a big boost from  Trump.  And in Arizona, it's a senate Republican primary featuring three  candidates who are all strongly behind the president's agenda.  In the  backdrop of tonight races, a major warning sign for Republican midterm  voters.  GOP lawmakers are circulating a list of potential issues Democrats  may investigate if they retake the house.  Will this threat helped turn out  the base?  </p><p>The list is pretty amazing.  It's basically of all the list that the house  Democrats have sent requesting hearings on such issues as President Trump's  tax returns, President Trump's family business, the payment to Stormy  Daniels, James Comey's firing, cabinet secretary travel, the travel ban,  family separation, on and on.  It's basically, pretty much, nothing else  would get done except for investigations, if this were to actually happen.   So the Republicans -- sometimes, Tammy, you have to scare your base into  turning out.  </p><p>BRUCE:  You do.  And yet, this is pretty much what people want to do.   They're still talking about impeachment even though some people are saying,  well, that's not really a good idea.  Even Adam Schiff the other day said,  well, we really can't really talk about that right now.  But if President  Trump is everything they say he is.  I mean, he's Hitler.  He's carrying  babies away from moms.  Why wouldn't you want to?  Why suddenly if he's the  worst guy in the world but then you really don't want to investigate  anything or you don't want to impeach him.  And so that's what we're  looking at.  And these are serious things that the Democrats have been  running on and have been talking to their base about.  And we can expect  them to do it partly because they don't want to govern.  That's been a big  problem with Democrats.  They gin up the bases, they get people all  excited, but they don't want to govern.  And this.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Where did you get that from?  </p><p>BRUCE:  From the last eight years with Barack Obama.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  Oh, please, are you kidding?  I think  Republicans, in fact, thought that he -- it was overreaching, doing too  much, and had to obstruct him.  I could go on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Bill Clinton governed.  And that's why that administration, even  with impeachment, worked because he enjoyed the process.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think -- look, I think, just seriously, Dana has a point here  about who's stirring up the base.  That this is an action being taken by  Republicans right now to say if you allow Democrats to take control of the  house, we are going to lose President Trump because he may be impeached.   And they see this, and I think rightly, as stirring up the GOP base because  it's so strongly pro-Trump.  And that those people then will turn out and  not turn off, given all the bad news that Trump is experiencing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  So stirring up the base though -- let's go back to this because  telling the truth can actually stir up the base.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yeah.  And I like how the Democrats are pretending that they  aren't really interested impeachment.  That's like a teenager trying to  sneak a bottle of booze outside the house -- outside the house in front of  their parents.  Oh, no, it's just a water bottle.  We know the Democrats  are waiting to spring this on if they get the house.  They're playing this  down so they can then raise it when they can.  So I do believe telling --  telling the truth can be stirring the base, by the way.  Democrats stir the  base by painting Trump is Hitler.  You know as.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, she said separating children from their parents.  Boy, I  think that's true.  Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Stirring the base.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about this?  Democrats want to do away with ICE, how about  that?  Oh, yeah, they want to do away with ICE. </p><p>PERINO:  The point about family separation policy, there're already was a  hearing about that.  And so.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And then we'll have to deal with Barack Obama's establishment of  it, and the fact that.  </p><p>PERINO:  The other thing is that the Democrats -- you know, they're finding  out that some of their fringe on the left that come up with ideas like  abolishing ICE, and it's not just the fringe, some mainstream Democrats as  well.  It's not going over so well.  There was a poll taken by A.P., 57  percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, but the number that don't  -- there's only 18 percent of Democrats favor dismantling this, Ok?  So  they're having to answer questions for things that their left, far left is  suggesting.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But some of that -- high profile people are saying it.  Bernie  Sanders, Gillibrand, and they're the ones saying it.  And you can just say  OK.  You deal with it because it's not somebody writing this and they're  not putting their name on it, these are major speeches given in front of  major audiences to get a loud round of applause.  The Democrats who have  been successful in the special election, he's the close the gap or walk  away with the win are the ones who are in the middle that still clearly  criticize Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian, you want to get rid of the Ice Capades, which I think is  heartless.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Why do you feel that way about the Ice Capades?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  The Ice Capades, I feel like it never ends.  There's no  beginning and there's no end.  I feel like.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And by the way, there's no scoring either at Ice Capades.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Crickets scares me.</p><p>PERINO:  All right, up next, President Trump with a new warning for Google  after claiming the company is silencing conservatives, up next.</p><p>GUTFELD:  What is a Capades?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  President Trump going after Google this morning on twitter,  accusing the tech giant of being politically biased against conservatives.   The president claims searched results are, quote, rigged, end quote,  against him and other Republicans as well to suppress any good news about  the Trump presidency.  Now, the president doubling down this very  afternoon. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Yeah, I think  Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a  very serious thing and it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and  what others are doing, if you look at what's going-on on twitter, if you  look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you  can't do that to people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Google firing back saying its searches don't promote a political  agenda.  So what do you think?  </p><p>BRUCE:  Look, we have a history with all of the social media, and Facebook  is also mentioned as a very good example.  Remember their trending stories  column that they said was the trending news of the day based on their  algorithms.  And then we realize that there was no real conservative sites,  there's no conservative stories, there was nothing pro-conservative, and  former editors came out and said that they routinely suppressed  conservative news, things that conservatives would make them look good or  would be of interest to conservatives, and then they had to eventually  shutdown that entire framework.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me pick up on this and ask you a question.  Much of it has  to do, according to Google, with the idea that if you are searching  something they give you what they call accredited sites like big newspapers  that they have a sense of trust in their content as opposed to giving them  simply opinionated sites that are likely tilted.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But that's the problem is that when you're liberal and you see a  liberal side, that is the one that is legitimate to you, and you're going  to view an opposing website in a different way because you don't agree with  it.  So if you're going to rank certain websites, you're going to rank them  based on whether or not it looks like real life to you.  That, look, if  you're a liberal or a conservative, you're not going to look at your own  material as being biased because it's what you also believe.  And this is  why when you've got 80 percent -- 85 percent of American media identifies  effectively as liberal, as not conservative, and then you're going to have  a Google determine which sites are going to be more legitimate, they're  going to rate more legitimate the sites that they agree with that looks  like their worldview.  And automatically.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What about -- and it seems to me like saying there's no truth,  there's no fact, there's no accurate news coverage in the country, so you  just give me liberal opinion or give me conservative opinions.  Is that  we're saying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, I think they're talking about -- this is the hottest issue  in the country and there's no easy answer.  This is the stem cell research  of our generation, of this decade, because everyone thinks social media is  the problem for their own reasons.  I don't necessarily have the reason but  Amazon, Google, Facebook, and twitter, they have to -- we have to come up  with something that will work.  I think, fundamentally, they actually want  to get it to work.  I think there's legitimate criticisms of those sites.   My frustration is when -- for example, CEO Jack Dorsey comes to Capitol  Hill to go in front of the energy committee on September 5th, next week, is  there going to be anyone who's an expert to be able to ask him the types of  questions.  They're going to move the conversation forward or we going to  see a bunch.  </p><p>PERINO:  So you think those hearings are unsatisfying?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Well, I know you're being sarcastic.  But we need somebody in  the middle that is unbiased to say here's an idea of what to do because  lawmakers who belong to a party are not capable of coming up with an  answer.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  By the way, Brian, Larry Kudlow said today, well, he's looking  at the possibility of regulating them.  And I think. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I don't know where you start?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't know.  But that is so shocking to me that he would  suggest that the government now. </p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Especially Larry Kudlow, I mean, he's a free-market guy and  conservatives typically are not for more regulation.  I would add that --  1:40 PM today, before the Daily Briefings, I checked Google News --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Your show.</p><p>PERINO:  -- to see what was there.  And the No. 1 story was a CNN story  about debunking a Trump myth of some sort.  A CNN Money story was about how  Google is rigged against conservatives, based on the president's tweet.   And the third story was the FOX News story about Tiger Woods.  And I think  we're going to talk about that later.  </p><p>So I think that there's -- there's a lot of room for this algorithm to be  manipulated.  And all of these sites are privately-held companies.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And they're powerful.</p><p>PERINO:  But they also would say to you, \"It doesn't make sense for us to  alienate half of the country\" when they're trying to make money.  Remember,  it was Michael Jordan said Republicans buy shoes, too.  So they're going to  try to make a free-market argument next week.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Greg, so I was surprised to see that the president's going  after Google.  He had a bad week, and I guess he does his rage Googling --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That was last week.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- and says, \"Oh, my God.  Look at -- they've got negative  stories here from New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.\" </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"I don't like these stories.  Give me some conservative thing.\"  But here's Trump back in July.  He says the European Union is fining  Google, and they're one of America's greatest companies.  </p><p>PERINO:  Oh, right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But today, it's a different story.  </p><p>PERINO:  That's right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  I mean, it surprises you Trump changes his opinion?  I mean, it's  been going on for two years.  I think what Google is guilty of, everyone  else in the media.  They're chasing words and not deeds.  </p><p>The deeds are good news.  We have an 18-year high in optimism right now.   That's not being reported.  If you want onto Google and Googled Mexican  trade, you would've gotten the top stories about the awkward phone call.   You wouldn't have gotten the Mexican trade story.  </p><p>And he's just like us.  He Googles his name, and he gets mad when there's  bad news.  If you Google \"Kilmeade,\" the first thing --</p><p>KILMEADE:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>GUTFELD:  -- you're going to get is \"hairpiece.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Right, right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But don't Google Kilmeade and hairpiece, because then you'll see  what happens.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  No, but 99 percent of the stuff on us is negative.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes, yes, yes.  And I'm used to it.</p><p>And if you look at Google Doodles, which I love.  You know, instead of  Easter, they'll have an activist.  Instead of Christmas, they'll do some  kind of festival.  Instead of Burning Man -- I mean, they'll do Burning Man  instead of Lou Dobbs's birthday.  They're the king of virtue signaling.  </p><p>You ask, like, why would you alienate half the conversation?  It's to keep  activists at bay.  They would rather alienate half a population than have  somebody come after them and say, \"You're bigoted.  You're sexist.  You're  racists.\"</p><p>They need to do a Google search on wisdom.  Because right now, what they're  doing is they're helping China in their A.I.   Correct?  But they are  leaving -- they want to leave helping the military and making more precise  drones that actually save lives.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK, I've got a question for you about Alex Jones.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Because we know that some of these sites pushed Alex Jones and  his conspiracy theories off on the idea that it's hate speech.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Why wouldn't you want to support that, Greg? </p><p>GUTFELD:  I think Alex Jones is hate speech.  It's the same way I feel  about Louis Farrakhan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK.  ESPN melting down --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Where is he?  On Twitter wearing a bowtie.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- over Tiger Woods's refusal to criticize President Trump.  The  growing controversy -- you heard Dana reference it -- when we return.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you say to people who might find it interesting  that you have, I guess, a friendly relationship with him?  </p><p>TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER:  Well, he's our -- he's the president of  the United States.  And you have to respect the office, and no matter who's  in the office.  You may like, dislike personality or the politics.  But we  all must respect the office.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KILMEADE:  But he's done that.  What was wrong with that answer?  ESPN  host, though, hears that answer and thinks Tiger Woods bailed out.  They  are teeing off on Tiger Woods, refusing to take the reporters bait and  criticized President Trump or complement President Trump.  So they start  lashing out against Tiger Woods because he wouldn't lash out against the  president.  For example.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, ESPN CO-HOST, \"FIRST TAKE\":  Tiger Woods is being -- you  said, being slick.  Here, he is being slick.  He says we must respect the  office.  Therefore, that confers respect to the occupant.  Tiger, is that  what you're saying?  If that's what you're saying, that is a stupid  comment.  I don't -- but I don't even know if he believes that that's when  he said.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, first of all, we don't know what Tiger Woods  believes.  He's camblination (ph); he's not black.  When he was arrested,  he was black.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KILMEADE:  Stephen Hayes Smith is one of the brighter people on television.   I would love to hear him long form.  But Max Kellerman thinks it's just  unthinkable, Dana, that Tiger Woods would--</p><p>PERINO:  Respect the office of the president?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  -- respect the office.  And he probably likes President Trump in  golf has his holes together (ph).</p><p>PERINO:  I thought -- well, all people sports, who play sports, athletes,  thank you.  Looking for the word.  They are going to -- thank you for the  word -- are going to be asked questions about President Trump, because  reporters can't help themselves.  And they're always trying to figure out a  way, how can can they make headlines?  How can they make news?</p><p>The only way to make news, apparently, is the world today is if you ask  somebody how they feel about President Trump, even if that has nothing to  do about their golf game.  </p><p>What I thought is that Tiger Woods knew that a question like that was  probably coming.  And I took it as a sincere genuine answer of how he feels  about the presidency of the United States.  And I think that ESPN, they can  do whatever they want on their show.  But Tiger Woods was prepared for that  question.  But it wasn't like he was reading somebody else's talking  points.  I think he believed it.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Max Kellerman is a virtue-signaling jackass, and here's evidence.   Would he have said that to Jim Brown last week?  Would he have said it to  Jim Brown, you know?  Because Jim Brown would have wiped the floor with  him.  He would have gone to the studio, so he did it because he thought he  could get away with it.  </p><p>This is the problem with injecting politics into bodies that do not have an  immune system for it.  So when you inject politics into sports, sports gets  sick.  When you inject politics into the entertainment world, the  entertainment gets world -- the entertainment world gets sick.  When you  inject politics into academia, what do you get?  You get a poison, toxic  campus.  Whenever you put politics, it gets sick, except on \"The Five.\"   Because we are real.  </p><p>PERINO:  When you put sports -- inject sports into me, I get sick, because  I can't even come up with the word \"athlete.\"  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Put it this way.  If people know President Trump, they have a  different opinion of President Trump.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Tell us about it, Brian.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Mike Tyson knows him.  Dennis Rodman knows him.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Herschel Walker knows him.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Just be jotting this down.  Tim Scott got a chance to spend a  lot of time with him.  And guess what?  So did Tiger Woods?</p><p>So Jim Brown joined us this morning on \"FOX &amp; Friends.\"  He is getting  blowback in the black community --</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  -- for saying \"I like President Trump.  I think he's doing a  decent job.\"  Listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JIM BROWN, NFL HALL OF FAME:  The greatest thing about America is that we  all have our opinions and our thoughts.  Nobody is totally correct in  everything that they do.  I have access to the president; and any time I  have access to the president and he will listen to my thoughts, that's all  I can ask of him.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And that's all that he said: \"I have access to the president.\"   That's just like Kanye West: \"I have access, and therefore, I want to be\" - - what'd he say, Yeezy?</p><p>KILMEADE:  You didn't hear the whole thing, but he does say he liked what  he's doing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  More than Obama gave them.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  But you know, what's interesting about the Tiger Woods thing is  Tiger Woods was asked, \"So what about the politics, then?  If you say you  respect the office.\"  </p><p>And by the way, Max Kellerman, he was right when he said this was a slick  move that allowed him to say, \"I respect the office\" without saying, \"Well,  what do you think about this president?\" </p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm sorry?</p><p>KILMEADE:  What's wrong with the right answer? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  What's the right answer?</p><p>KILMEADE:  He respects the office of the president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not -- that's not an answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Why isn't it?</p><p>PERINO:  Why not?  That's a great answer.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's perfect</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let me tell you why.  It's like saying you respect X, Y, Z.  And  you saying, \"I respect X, Y, G but not -- let's not talk about X, Y, Z.\"   Here's what he said.  He said, \"I just finished 72 holes, and I'm really  hungry.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  At the end.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Does that sound like a kid who's trying to get away from  --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He's 43, and it's the fifth follow-up.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's a big boy, and in this era, President Trump, not the  athletes, have made the issue.  President Trump has gone after NFL players,  who are protesting.  He's gone after Stephen Curry, LeBron James.  Shut up  and dribble?  Because why?  </p><p>KILMEADE:  He didn't say that.  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  He's always saying that these -- </p><p>KILMEADE:  He never said that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- people --</p><p>KILMEADE:  He said they're not going to the Oval Office.  Don't bother.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- they don't want anything to do with him for a very real  reason.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CO-HOST:  There is one reason why this is happening.  The  latest poll, 36 percent of African-Americans support the president --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, please.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- because their economy is better.  Lowest unemployment rate in  history for African-Americans.  The future is brighter again.  They're  realizing that the conservative ideal is worthwhile and should be  considered.  They're hearing other African-Americans they like, like Kanye  West, say, \"Wait a minute.  Maybe we should be thinking about things.\"  </p><p>Tiger Woods and others are not conforming, and that's what they expect of  the gay community, African-Americans, women.  Even if your lives are  better, you will be punished if you say that's OK, because that's all they  have left.  That's Tiger Woods's crime, apparently.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's not.  Tiger Woods plays a game.  </p><p>BRUCE:  He likes the presidency and the president, and African-American  lives are better under this president.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is ridiculous.  This is such a cheap argument about  unemployment rates.  Let me just say, Tiger Woods plays the game.</p><p>BRUCE:  The lowest unemployment rate in history is a cheap argument? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  That is a cheap argument.  That's ridiculous.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  If you were saying to me, \"Oh, you know what?\"</p><p>BRUCE:  Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \"President Trump is now about lowering black unemployment so  that it matches white unemployment.  Or President Obama [SIC] -- President  Trump is doing something\" --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Going after MS-13.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  \" -- to encourage job training.\"  No, he's not doing any of  that.  </p><p>Here's what Tiger Woods is about.  Tiger Woods realizes that his sponsors  and the people who play golf, generally white, maybe Republican.  And he is  not taking the risk of speaking truth to power.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- you're just projecting what you think Tiger Woods is  thinking.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, I don't know what he thinks.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Mind reading.</p><p>KILMEADE:  I project this.  He's known him for 15, 20 years, and likes him.   I'll project that.  </p><p>BRUCE:  And we all seem to recall --</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's probably a better idea.  </p><p>PERINO:  He also -- I didn't have a chance to talk.  He also has to -- a  responsibility to himself and to his business and to --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There we go.</p><p>PERINO:  So look, if I were his P.R. advisor and I anticipated that  question, I'm like, that is a great answer.  You might get dinged on ESPN,  but if you want to focus, you really want to make a comeback in golf,  you've got to focus on this and not allow a distraction with politics.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like, politics in other arenas, sucks.  Politics kills  everything.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  All right.  So I guess Greg gets the last word.  Meanwhile,  coming up straight ahead, keeping a room cold is apparently now sexist.   That story is next.  Please gradually zoom out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  All right, everybody.  Cries of sexism in the New York  gubernatorial race, not about politics but about room temperature.  </p><p>Cynthia Nixon's team is accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being sexist for  trying to debate in a chilly room when they face off tomorrow night.  </p><p>Turns out this is a battle many Americans face.  A recent survey says 43  percent of coworkers have clashed --</p><p>KILMEADE:  To battle.</p><p>BRUCE:  -- over being too hot or too cold in the workplace.  </p><p>Obviously, Cynthia Nixon is Goldilocks.  Look, if she can't handle a room  temperature properly, how can she handle being in a variety of different  rooms, dealing with politicians, et cetera?  Greg, I'm sure you might have  something to say about that.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  She -- she wants 76 degrees in a packed auditorium? </p><p>KILMEADE:  It's freezing.</p><p>GUTFELD:  If you take the body heat of the -- you're going to put it into  the 80s, and they are going to despise her.  </p><p>By the way, this is -- it is a fact.  This is a biological difference among  many.  And if you deny it, you're a science denier.  We all have -- we have  different metabolic rates.  So men actually can handle, I guess, the cold  better.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Women are hotter.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  That will -- that will end up somewhere.  Take it out of context  and put it on a blog.  There you go.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think it's good news for you, Brian.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Also, Dana, we -- men and women dress differently in the office.   You know?</p><p>PERINO:  I'm freezing every day, so I would give her a little tip.  In my  mug is hot water.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  No, but that's a good idea.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Rum.</p><p>PERINO:  If I drank rum, that would be a good idea.  It's hot water.  I  hold my cup and it's hot; and then I get -- I don't have to complain too  much about how freezing it is.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  But is it sexist?  That's the problem.  Is it sexist?</p><p>PERINO:  No, it's not.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Is it sexist.</p><p>PERINO:  Remember Charlie Crist in Florida?  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  And he was going to have a debate.  And one of the big demands is  that he had to have a fan at all times. </p><p>GUTFELD:  And where was the fan?</p><p>PERINO:  Underneath the podium.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  It was right at an odd level.  It was the strangest thing.  </p><p>PERINO:  Yes, it's a very strange thing.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Like a fan --</p><p>PERINO:  And that is not sexist.  That is just a demand.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, because there's a reality here.  There's a political  reality that if you go back, I think it's the 1960 campaign with  Nixon/Kennedy.  That they had a debate, and Nixon -- Nixon starts to pop  sweat.</p><p>GUTFELD:  So she wants him to sweat.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And he looks terrible on TV.  He looks like he's fleeing a crime  scene.  </p><p>BRUCE:  They have to adjusts, but these days, everything either --  everything has to be sexist.  But when you're running -- when our argument  is, is that we are the same; women can do what men do.  But now everything  has to be adjusted because we can't handle a room temperature? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, no.  That's not what they're saying.  They're saying --  she's saying that she wants to eliminate his demand that it be freezing.   And he has said he likes a cold environment.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  In the past, but the thing is, it's like boxing, Juan.</p><p>BRUCE:  And she wants it at 76.</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're a boxing fan.  If you're the champion, you get to pick  the ring, the venue.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's what she said.  She said CBS, the local CBS, the  affiliate here in New York, negotiated exclusively with him.  Because she  wanted several debates.  She's only getting one debate on his terms.  </p><p>BRUCE:  Because he's -- he's leading.  And he doesn't even really need to  do it, because he's ahead.  But thank you for man-splaining that for me.  </p><p>Yes, I mean, this is -- this is what you're going to see, and this is what  we want.  I want women to run for office, but we don't want it to all be  about sexism.  </p><p>PERINO:  I do want it to be comfortable in the room.  </p><p>BRUCE:  But 76 isn't even comfortable.  Right?  I mean, she's asking -- </p><p>PERINO:  No, see it depends.  Like, at 75, I'm cold.  At 76, I'm hot.  So  it's, like, 75.5 would be perfect.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Do you want to talk about sexism, though?  Think about all of the  men who built buildings, who built the buildings that people actually use,  who risked their lives on girders in the 1960s and the 1970s, who built the  bridges.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  And then blew the money on the track.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Or if the -- oh, no, they fell.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  They fell.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Brooklyn Bridge, look at the numbers of people who died on the  Brooklyn Bridge.  </p><p>BRUCE:  All the men who made things possible and now women can help make  them possible, too.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  There you go.</p><p>BRUCE:  Coming up, \"One More Thing\" is coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"OMT\" -- Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Gregory, you know what?  Dreams do come true. </p><p>GUTFELD:  No, they don't.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And sometimes in doubles.  Yes, because that's what happened for  Sophia Sanchez, an 11-year-old awaiting a heart transplant in Chicago.  She  posted a video of her dancing in the hospital with an I.V. in her arm to  rapper Drake's \"In My Feelings.\"  So then she asked Drake to come visit  her.  Against all odds, guess what happened?  He did.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOPHIA SANCHEZ, HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT:  Oh, my God! </p><p>DRAKE, RAP ARTIST:  You asked me to come, I'm here.  What's up?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Sophia -- Sophia also asked -- and this is the double, Gregory - - Sophia asked for a new heart, because she was struggling.  And guess  what?  The second dream also came true. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're getting a heart.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  I'm getting a heart, Mom!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, my gosh.  So yesterday, Sophia had the heart implanted and,  according to her mom, Natalie, Sophia is doing well.  I want you to know,  Sophia, you've got five people here at FOX rooting and praying for you. </p><p>PERINO:  Like, 500 million.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Really. </p><p>GUTFELD:  You have proven me wrong, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wow.  What?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Now I need to find a heart.  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  No one's going to give you a heart.</p><p>GUTFELD:  No one's going to give me a heart.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Especially after this.</p><p>GRAPHIC:  Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News</p><p>GUTFELD:  \"Greg's Brian Kilmeade Spelling News.\"  Got a lot of big news in  the Brian Kilmeade spelling arena.  Let's go live to tape.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  There's a word that  Canada has trouble with.  It's M-I-L-K.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  Now, in terms of Canada, I guess Canada hates milk.  I mean,  hates to talk about milk, M-A-L-K.  </p><p>STEVE DOOCY, CO-HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  They're lactose intolerant.</p><p>KILMEADE:  That's what you've got.</p><p>DOOCY:  By the way, Brian -- Brian, did you say -- it's \"M-I-L-K\". </p><p>KILMEADE:  You're right.  Thank you very much.</p><p>DOOCY:  Not \"M-A-L-K.\"</p><p>KILMEADE:  You're -- thanks for correcting me.  You helped me, saved a  headline.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD:  How nice of Larry to correct you on television.  </p><p>KILMEADE:  That would have slipped by the Gutfeld staff, except for Larry  corrected me. </p><p>PERINO:  I thought I heard you say \"I\" in my -- OK, you didn't. </p><p>KILMEADE:  I know how to spell \"milk,\" just not in the morning. </p><p>GUTFELD:  Dana. </p><p>WILLIAMS:  How about \"potato\"? </p><p>PERINO:  I have something to promote.  I'm going to be on Tucker Carlson  tonight at 8 p.m., so you can check that out there.  We have a graphic.   Yes, I have a graphic today.  </p><p>Marie Unanue, she has a new book.  She's a friend of mine.  And it is  called \"The Adventures of Phatty and Payaso: Central Park,\" ad it's a  children's book, a chapter book, actually.  So if you are a little more  advanced, you might like it.  Phatty and Payaso, they go to Central Park.   They want to go take a stand against bullying, but then they get -- all  sorts of adventures.  They have a LetsBeKind.com adventure that goes with  it, if you want to check it out.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Brian.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Real quick, my paperback of \"Andrew Jackson: Miracle of New  Orleans,\" includes what other presidents thought of Andrew Jackson, because  he's so controversial today.  It's coming out in October.  And I'm going to  couple it with three events.  One in Tampa, one in Norfolk, one in  Nashville.  His BrianKilmeade.com.  </p><p>I want to talk about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli  pirates, as well as \"Andrew Jackson: Miracle of New Orleans.\"  \"America  Great from the Start.\"  Because so many people have problems with our  history, I wanted to have a live event where people can ask questions.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  Excellent, brain.  Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  And for everyone's books and events, you can now get a pumpkin  spice latte.  I know fall does not start until the 22, but already the  pumpkin spice latte is out.

The Coinbase UK CEO noted that entities like central banks and Facebook are more than needed for overall support of the entire crypto ecosystem. </p><p>In an interview that Feroz had with CNBC published on October 24[2], he said that there are two ways for cryptocurrency to go mainstream. One of them is the central bank digital currency (CBDC) issuance and the other is Facebook's Libra stablecoin which is expected to launch in 2020. As distinct from cryptocurrencies as possible, a CBDC is a digital currency that is issued by a central bank. The point of the Coinbase UK CEO with a currency like this is to exploit its legal tender status that depends on government regulation or law. CBDCs such as the digital US dollar or British pound, according to Feroz, could 'catalyze adoption in a way that us geeks in Silicon Valley might not be able to.' Aside from this, Feroz did not mention the only CBDC that has been announced by a major global economy to date: the People's Bank of China and its digital renminbi. As he continued, another route to mass adoption would be through Facebook and 'with the billions of users that they have.' The Coinbase UK CEO was in the Libra coin news[3] for stating the following: 'Libra as a currency has the potential to be a form of payment that is really universal in its nature. It's not going to be easy, you're really challenging the status quo. We're at step one of a thousand step journey.' Coinbase is one of the 21 remaining companies that are part of the Libra Association, which is an organization known for being under scrutiny by lawmakers across the world and consequently losing seven high-profile participants such as Visa, eBay and Mastercard.[4] The Coinbase UK CEO also argued that at the end of the long journey with Libra, we could be poised to establish 'a financial system that is more open, where people can send funds globally as easily as you send an email.' When talking about central entities, Feroz pointed out to a place for centralized businesses where they would support the cryptosystem. 'To transition from the world we're in today to that utopia, perhaps you need centralized entities, you need an on and off-ramp. You can't buy crypto if you don't have a centralized business that can maintain those relationships with banks,' the Coinbase UK CEO concluded.

Gould's Bill C-76, passed in December and intended to apply to the upcoming federal election, created new regulations for third-party political advertisers on electronic platforms. This had an immediate comic effect, as anybody knows if they watched Google representatives being harangued at the Commons Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics Committee on May 9.</p><p>Google was hauled before the committee because it couldn't figure out a way to comply with C-76's requirements in time for the election. As Colin McKay and Jason Kee tried to explain to the vexed legislators, Google is in the business of serving unfathomable mass quantities of advertising to other people's websites and phone applications and keeping some of the cash. They don't make either the ads or the sites to which they're served: they are, for this purpose, a pipeline company that imposes a lucrative toll. Like other platforms they are busily trying to stamp out the most socially obnoxious and unethical content in the pipeline, with varying amounts of success: a screening algorithm that gets invented on January 1st is bound to be gamed before sunrise January 2nd.</p><p>In other words, it's a technological arms race. But some of the specifics of C-76's rules on political advertising presented immediate and difficult problems for Google, and it did its best to explain them to the committee. The law, as passed, imposes \"registry\" requirements on the sites and apps connected to the pipeline, who may not even know what ads they are showing. And the registry, if it could be created by Google for its customers, would have to be updated daily. \"This effectively means,\" observed Google lawyer Jason Kee, \"that the registry must be updated in real time, as a regulated political ad that was displayed at 11:59 p.m. would need to be included in the registry before midnight.\"</p><p>Not feasible, said Kee, at least on such short notice. Finally, the broad definition of \"election advertising\" written into the law was a problem: it includes any ad \"taking a position on an issue with which a registered party or candidate is associated,\" which might literally change from minute to minute during a campaign. What's the technological solution to that? (Even if Google could hire a billion human editors to do that work, could the company be sure of complying with C-76?)</p><p>So Google, the accused social poisoner and wrecker of democracy, decided to obey the law by cancelling all political ad sales in Canada during the upcoming regulated period. You might suppose that they would be thanked for withdrawing the poison at their own undoubtedly significant expense. Instead, the Liberals, like the restaurant patron who complains that the food is lousy and the portions are so small, flew into a genuine rage. Nathaniel Erskine-Smith whined that \"We are too small for you ... You are too important, and we are just not important enough for Google to take us seriously.\"</p><p>Colby Cosh: 'Double intense' casualties - a glance beyond the beaches of D-Day( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-double-intense-casualties-a-glance-beyond-the-beaches-of-d-day\">https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-double-intense-casualties-a-glance-beyond-the-beaches-of-d-day</url> )</p><p>Colby Cosh: You may not have noticed, but reproductive freedom is growing( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-you-may-not-have-noticed-but-reproductive-freedom-is-growing\">https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-you-may-not-have-noticed-but-reproductive-freedom-is-growing</url> )</p><p>Colby Cosh: Japan hates when we flip its PM's name around, but Japan doesn't get to decide( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-yes-japan-fine-but-what-about-the-hungarians\">https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-yes-japan-fine-but-what-about-the-hungarians</url> )</p><p>Erskine-Smith and other committee members demanded to know exactly how soon Google would be bringing political ads back to Canada, furiously trying to pin down a 2023 date. In the video of the meeting they seem quite desperate about this - as one might expect from representatives of a technologically aware major political party, one with well-developed demographic targets that can really only be attacked with Google's help. If you read the transcript( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/ETHI/meeting-148/evidence\">https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/ETHI/meeting-148/evidence</url> ) of the meeting, or better yet view Erskine-Smith's cranky demeanour in the archived video, you will understand that the Liberal dialogue with big tech really has the goal of being seen to do something about social media and online advertising without flustering the golden goose.</p><p>Which makes Karina Gould's tantrum in the foyer even funnier. Having treated Google peevishly for taking the Atlas Shrugged approach to C-76, the government was suddenly upholding it as the ultimate good citizen for the purpose of castigating Twitter, a platform \"(We) know ... has been used and manipulated by foreign and malicious actors.\" Increasingly, when politicians discuss social media, they seem to be advancing the premise that we can only preserve an open, free and internationalist society as long as someone will agree to keep all those devious and unclean outsiders off our internet. (Our own privilege as Canadians of hopping on Twitter and hurling memes and insults at the Saudis or the Israelis or the Russians or the Americans, of course, is never to be questioned.)</p><p>National Post</p><p>Twitter.com/ColbyCosh( <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ColbyCosh\">https://twitter.com/ColbyCosh</url> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Gould's Bill C-76, passed in December and intended to apply to the upcoming federal election, created new regulations for third-party political advertisers on electronic platforms. This had an immediate comic effect, as anybody knows if they watched Google representatives being harangued at the Commons Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics Committee on May 9.</p><p>Google was hauled before the committee because it couldn't figure out a way to comply with C-76's requirements in time for the election. As Colin McKay and Jason Kee tried to explain to the vexed legislators, Google is in the business of serving unfathomable mass quantities of advertising to other people's websites and phone applications and keeping some of the cash. They don't make either the ads or the sites to which they're served: they are, for this purpose, a pipeline company that imposes a lucrative toll. Like other platforms they are busily trying to stamp out the most socially obnoxious and unethical content in the pipeline, with varying amounts of success: a screening algorithm that gets invented on January 1st is bound to be gamed before sunrise January 2nd.</p><p>In other words, it's a technological arms race. But some of the specifics of C-76's rules on political advertising presented immediate and difficult problems for Google, and it did its best to explain them to the committee. The law, as passed, imposes \"registry\" requirements on the sites and apps connected to the pipeline, who may not even know what ads they are showing. And the registry, if it could be created by Google for its customers, would have to be updated daily. \"This effectively means,\" observed Google lawyer Jason Kee, \"that the registry must be updated in real time, as a regulated political ad that was displayed at 11:59 p.m. would need to be included in the registry before midnight.\"</p><p>Not feasible, said Kee, at least on such short notice. Finally, the broad definition of \"election advertising\" written into the law was a problem: it includes any ad \"taking a position on an issue with which a registered party or candidate is associated,\" which might literally change from minute to minute during a campaign. What's the technological solution to that? (Even if Google could hire a billion human editors to do that work, could the company be sure of complying with C-76?)</p><p>So Google, the accused social poisoner and wrecker of democracy, decided to obey the law by cancelling all political ad sales in Canada during the upcoming regulated period. You might suppose that they would be thanked for withdrawing the poison at their own undoubtedly significant expense. Instead, the Liberals, like the restaurant patron who complains that the food is lousy and the portions are so small, flew into a genuine rage. Nathaniel Erskine-Smith whined that \"We are too small for you ... You are too important, and we are just not important enough for Google to take us seriously.\"</p><p>Colby Cosh: 'Double intense' casualties - a glance beyond the beaches of D-Day( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-double-intense-casualties-a-glance-beyond-the-beaches-of-d-day\">https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-double-intense-casualties-a-glance-beyond-the-beaches-of-d-day</url> )</p><p>Colby Cosh: You may not have noticed, but reproductive freedom is growing( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-you-may-not-have-noticed-but-reproductive-freedom-is-growing\">https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-you-may-not-have-noticed-but-reproductive-freedom-is-growing</url> )</p><p>Colby Cosh: Japan hates when we flip its PM's name around, but Japan doesn't get to decide( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-yes-japan-fine-but-what-about-the-hungarians\">https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-yes-japan-fine-but-what-about-the-hungarians</url> )</p><p>Erskine-Smith and other committee members demanded to know exactly how soon Google would be bringing political ads back to Canada, furiously trying to pin down a 2023 date. In the video of the meeting they seem quite desperate about this - as one might expect from representatives of a technologically aware major political party, one with well-developed demographic targets that can really only be attacked with Google's help. If you read the transcript( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/ETHI/meeting-148/evidence\">https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/ETHI/meeting-148/evidence</url> ) of the meeting, or better yet view Erskine-Smith's cranky demeanour in the archived video, you will understand that the Liberal dialogue with big tech really has the goal of being seen to do something about social media and online advertising without flustering the golden goose.</p><p>Which makes Karina Gould's tantrum in the foyer even funnier. Having treated Google peevishly for taking the Atlas Shrugged approach to C-76, the government was suddenly upholding it as the ultimate good citizen for the purpose of castigating Twitter, a platform \"(We) know ... has been used and manipulated by foreign and malicious actors.\" Increasingly, when politicians discuss social media, they seem to be advancing the premise that we can only preserve an open, free and internationalist society as long as someone will agree to keep all those devious and unclean outsiders off our internet. (Our own privilege as Canadians of hopping on Twitter and hurling memes and insults at the Saudis or the Israelis or the Russians or the Americans, of course, is never to be questioned.)</p><p>National Post</p><p>Twitter.com/ColbyCosh( <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ColbyCosh\">https://twitter.com/ColbyCosh</url> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

The policy in question, a 2 per cent tax on UK revenues for big tech companies, is due to become law in this autumn's budget.</p><p>There are also persistent murmurs about the UK's preparedness to launch into full scale negotiations on Nov 1. Much of the hold-up is unavoidable, as Britain's trade relationship with the US depends on its trade relationship with the EU post-Brexit.</p><p>In other areas there is more culpability. America has published its trade deal priorities, some 5,000 words of \"summary\" targets, and held public hearings about them. Britain has done neither.</p><p>One figure in a US business body being kept abreast with talks doubted the quality of the UK's negotiators. \"They have not done trade deal negotiations for 46 years,\" the source said, referring to the date Britain joined the European Economic Community. \"I don't really know if they can do it. This is a new game for them.\"</p><p>Some Republicans are lobbying for a deal to be done in 2020, seeing it as triple-whammy: strengthen relations with Britain, help American firms and hand Mr Trump a win he can sell before the Nov 2020 election.</p><p>It is not impossible. America struck a trade deal with South Korea after around a year of negotiations.</p><p>Other potential pitfalls include the Brexit date being pushed back and the Democrats, who hold a majority in the House of Representatives, refusing to vote any deal through.</p><p>Furthermore, Mr Trump has only 15 months left in his first term - and even in trade, the UK deal is at best third on his priority list, behind passing his renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement and resolving the confrontation with China.</p><p>Then there are the talks themselves. Britain has already been hit with tariffs once by the Trump administration, affecting steel exports to the US.</p><p>One ex-cabinet member dismissed in Mr Johnson's \"Night of the Blond Knives'\" believes a face-saving agreement could be struck next year, perhaps around regulations - but the chances of completing a meaningful trade deal by the end of 2020 were close to zero.

He's in town, joins us here in London.  Cole, great to see you this morning. We just ran through a whole host of opinions from the Fed and lots to watch on the Fed story at the moment.  The truth is though, that we don't really know very much about what President-elect Trump will do in terms of fiscal policy.  We know a bit about what he intends, what he actually manages to get support for on Capitol Hill is another question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMEAD</emphasis>:  Correct.  He has moved the bond market a major way from a sentiment standpoint.  The -- the oddity is, the things that are likely to move inflation the most which would be the borrowing of money by U.S. households has not been going on.  So if people are worried about fiscal policy, in the first couple days post reaction to election, there has not been a major move in housing stocks which would be the primary way that households borrow money, create a lot more money in the money supply, and it goes to work in the economy. So you know, there were certain industries, financials, obviously, health care that were -- have strong political fears, at the same time, what could go on the next five years regardless of Hillary or Donald, it -- it looks very good.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GAMAL EL-DIN</emphasis>:  Speaking of inflation, we're looking ahead to a tips auction in the U.S.  Again, no-brainer to -- to buy into that, but that's also going to be a verdict as to whether the reflation train is on, right?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMEAD</emphasis>:  Sure.  Well, people are talking about inflation, this idea of real growth is missing, OK?  It -- a potent cocktail would not only be inflation that's actually present which is now a conversation, but real growth that kicks in as well.  That cocktail could kill the bond market which just this initial move has been very tumultuous. (inaudible) as you point out, the spread between the German yield and the U.S. yield, it's wide.  It's very unlikely the largest economy in the world will pay higher rates and others won't have to follow suit just like the regulations on banks, et cetera.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  So you think this -- you think this -- you think that the -- the -- I mean, that's why see the BOJ active in the markets today because -- because of the way that Donald Trump' election victory has moved bond markets not just in the U.S., but globally.  So you don't think then that the infrastructure spending that we're hearing Donald Trump talk about in -- with scant details so far, but certainly, that's one theme.  You don't think that's going to be enough to materially move U.S. growth?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMEAD</emphasis>:  No.  In terms of expectations, it's moved some expectations, but actually moving the needle, our economy's way bigger tied to consumers.  One other thing I'll mention.  Think about -- you know, we got 35  percent corporate tax rates in the United States of America.  Well, other places have 15.  Did that stop U.S. companies from fining 15 percent tax rates?  Not at all.  So this arbitrage at what goes on in the U.S. versus outside the borders is always going to be the free market deciding what they want to do with their money in time.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GAMAL EL-DIN</emphasis>:  We're waiting for more details on policy from Donald Trump and his incoming administration.  How do investors position themselves to make sure that they come out on the right side of this trade.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMEAD</emphasis>:  Sure.  Sure.  Great question.  Well, the two things that I've been excited about this year and were considered probably politically palatable in --in the -- prior to the election were tech, momentum growth, and secondly, the safety trade.  In other words, if yields are going to stay down forever, why not lengthen your duration in bond surrogates and long-duration tech plays?  Well, those things have woken up to a change in sentiment.  Just in the last, you know, call it week, it's been a market change.  So, you know, the big tech companies are down pretty nicely since the election, and secondly, the bond surrogates are getting pounded with the bond market at the same time.  What's going to produce earnings growth and free cash flow growth is what investors might wake up to the next five years, and in the U.S. stock market, that could be a tumultuous thing because half the revenues come from abroad.  So what goes on in our border might not be helpful to the index per se.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  So -- so from what you're saying then, and I know you're a big stock picking and it's been a tough time to be a stock picker because of some of these big global themes, but you think stock picking now is warranted because of the threats to the tech sectors, the -- the threats to some of those bond proxy trade.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMEAD</emphasis>:  Sure.  It's just not a broad opportunity in U.S. equities.  Let me give you an example.  They call it 17 times earnings multiple on the on the S&amp;P 500.  It's no outlandish, nowhere near 99 just to give , you know, European investors sense, but it -- it's more expensive than history.  Small caps are more expensive and they have snapped a 10 plus percent in the week following the election, so I highlight that because, OK, do you want to pay 200 times earnings for the market cap in the S&amp;P 500 index, you can out all the home builders that we just talked about inside, all the publicly traded ones inside the market cap of Accenture, OK?  So what if things go on in the U.S. economy that benefit certain industries because their economics are good not because of political reasons, and what if the index doesn't own enough?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  So which sectors are you buying then, with that in mind?  </p><p>      We --we own a lot of discretionary -- we continue to buy new names, it would be like Scripps Network Interactive, Home -- Home and Garden Television, Food Channel, Travel Channel, they're very millennial as subjects, but a lot of these millennials haven't bought houses yet, so very directly tied to advertisers.  The financials look good, home mortgage originations.  It's not about rates.  Rates will help all financial institutions here, you know, in -- in the U.K. as well, but at the same time, it really comes out of who's going to be underwriting mortgages that unlocks the inflation, the growth, the incomes, et cetera.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GAMAL EL-DIN</emphasis>:  You mentioned financials.  There was a theme as well among investors the last week that Trumps going to tear up regulation, he's going to make it a lot easier for banks to make more money.  Is that -- is that something that you -- you've penciled in as well?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMEAD</emphasis>:  Overnight, no.  At the same time, you know, this is not a change in -- in U.S. politics in a way that's going to be catastrophic, it will just marginally go to businesses and say, \"Hey, what do you need to do to grow your business,\" because the economics was the most important equation in the U.S. election.  That's what people want, so they're going to look for ways to allow business to go do -- do what they do.  I'll give you a quick example.  Fox Broadcasting two days after the election filed a suit with the SEC to be able to go above a 40 percent restriction in owning their affiliates across the United States, why?  Because if Google can have 65 percent market share, why can't a broadcasting station own more than 40 percent of the national market?  It's just -- it's but it's a difference in what was the political regime prior versus what's the political regime after.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Cole, thank you very much for coming on (inaudible) this morning.

Is your company looking for new avenues to create value, grow revenue, build resilience and optimize processes? If so, you should pay attention to why leading companies now invest in blockchain technology to build powerful, secure networks that enable collaborative value creation among multiple businesses and even among industries.      As I explained in my prior blog, blockchain technology eliminates the constraints of current software systems such as ERP applications that rely on database technologies with walled access to data, such as the following:    Unacceptable friction and cost in trying to gain access to entities\u2019 data and maintain transparency  Lack of trust  Lack of a single source of truth    These constraints inhibit building networks for collaborative ecosystems. However, the market now has huge interest in companies assisting organizations to eliminate these constraints by using blockchain. Its distributed-ledger technology supports building specialized networks that allow collaboration across ecosystems.     At Everest Group, we refer to these networks built on a blockchain foundation as Network Resource Planner (NRP) solutions. The primary benefit of these solutions is that they build trust among all the ecosystem participants; therefore, they enable and support transparency and data sharing.      A lot of processes and transactions go back and forth in an ecosystem, but if the supporting technology uses ERP-based architecture, all participants keep their accounts and data separate and private. Consequently, they lack a shared world view, a shared understanding of customers, so they cannot collaborate to create new shared value.    This closed, inflexible structure does not work in today\u2019s reality of needing to collaborate across internal or external boundaries that prevent data access. Your company \u2013 along with other businesses and industries \u2013 can gain true value by using software that reimagines the boundaries of each workflow in a shared network used by varied trusted stakeholders.    Major players investing in technology that enables NRP solutions    Blockchain, the fundamental platform for building Network Resource Planner solutions, successfully went through rigorous testing worldwide over the past few years. It proved to be a highly secure and scalable architecture with a solid foundation.    In the market today, major players such as big tech firms, large global financial institutions and governments worldwide invest in the foundational architecture to extend its capabilities.    NRP examples    The benefits of a Network Resource Planner solution are twofold \u2013 process optimization and new revenue-stream creation.    Consider, for instance, an NPR solution for manufacturing companies to use in tracking inventory. Businesses can use a supply chain track-and-trace network to validate the quality and authenticity of an inventory component. Manufacturers and providers of equipment maintenance services can use such a network to maintain supplier performance, regulatory compliance and customer satisfaction. With customer satisfaction comes the potential for increased loyalty and cross-sales opportunities.    Another application of an NRP solution is a gig platform for acquiring talent in large organizations. Current structures of how businesses find contingent labor are horribly imagined. There is no one source of truth regarding potential talent, and businesses do not really know the quality of a talent resource.     However, a gig platform built on blockchain\u2019s use of relational databases and distributed-ledger technology, would allow participants to track the performance and quality of individuals, show their availability or lack of availability and provide other huge benefits to both the individual and the companies that need their services.    A third example is a payments and settlements network. This NRP solution would improve processes at banking and financial services companies and consequently also simplify the transaction experience for B2C and B2B customers. The enterprises could eliminate intermediaries (thus lowering cost) and create a real-time experience for customers. The trust among participants in the network also would assist in optimizing reconciliation, auditing and compliance.    An overview of common benefits and goals attainable through from NRP solutions includes:    Reduce process and turnaround time  Reduce requirement for data entry time  Reduce redundancies and inefficiencies in a process  Reduce time to market  Create new revenue streams through innovative solutions  Create new market opportunities    Because the network enables transparency and trust among participants or stakeholders, it also would support sharing real-time status updates (or audit processes).      What could your company achieve as a participant in an interconnected super network that enables collaboration to create new avenues for revenue realization?    I believe we will see exciting new opportunities as well as industry disruption from NRP solutions. The blockchain technology at the foundational base of an NRP solution will enable small players to participate in value creation where large players typically dominate a market.    Furthermore, I believe we will see participants in collaborative network ecosystems create fundamentally different kinds of businesses \u2013 perhaps even a completely new industry.    In my next few blog posts, I will share information on how to structure NRP solutions and how to govern such a \u201cpartnership of ecosystems.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43026594874</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SV-9HG1-JCSC-J1VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1002\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN32</classCode><className>BLOCKCHAIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000155</classCode><className>BACK OFFICE OPERATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000956</classCode><className>FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DNBV</classCode><className>DISTRIBUTED LEDGERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008X6G</classCode><className>PROCESS CONTROL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001654</classCode><className>SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD.</p><p>Phil Keating is in Jupiter, Florida, with more on the president's message to voters -- Phil.</p><p>PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Charles.</p><p>President Trump's motorcade should be pulling into the West Palm Beach International Airport just about right now. He spoke at the historic Jupiter Lighthouse for about 25 minutes today, claiming the torch of environmentalism.</p><p>Air Force One, sometime this hour, we expect, will then fly to North Carolina for a campaign event in Winston-Salem. The White House is touting its budget proposal on environmental protection and conservation, specifically a $250 million infrastructure construction plan to fund on an annual basis the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force.</p><p>Over the past several years, there have been debilitating and marine-life killing algae blooms on the St. Johns River, as well as in Fort Myers on the Caloosahatchee River, each one triggered directly from massive water releases from Lake Okeechobee and all of the agricultural fertilizers that end up being flushed out to both sides of the state.</p><p>And the president today actually made some news here regarding offshore drilling.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In a few moments, I will sign a presidential order extending the moratorium on offshore drilling on Florida's Gulf Coast and expanding it to Florida's Atlantic Coast, as well as the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEATING: Also today, the Department of Interior is touting its record on eliminating species from the Endangered Species Act, saying, since 2017, 11 species, including the Hawaiian goose and the manatee, have been removed from that list.</p><p>However, of course, Democratic lawmakers on the state and local level here in Florida today welcomed the president with a scathing press release, saying, his environmental record is disastrous, and he's being disingenuous for claiming it isn't -- back to you, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Phil, thank you very much.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Biden campaign, well, they have been hitting the president hard as well over his coronavirus response. Joe Biden and the president will both be campaigning in Michigan this week.</p><p>Jacqui Heinrich is in Wilmington, Delaware, with more -- Jacqui.</p><p>JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Afternoon, Charles.</p><p>Well, today, there are no in-person events, but the Biden campaign is still responding to President Trump out in Florida today, telling Floridians ahead of the president's event not to expect a plan from President Trump on how to overcome the virus or put Floridians back to work.</p><p>Biden wrote: \"With more than 11,000 deaths, 600,000 cases, and 3.6 million workers across the state who have filed for unemployment benefits since March, it is clear that Floridians have been hurt by President Trump's inability to contain the spread of COVID-19.\"</p><p>Upcoming travel signals a pretty major shift in campaign strategy post- Labor Day. Yesterday, Biden and Harris split up to tackle two swing states, and they're back in the air tomorrow. Biden will be heading to battleground Michigan. Thursday, Harris is heading to Florida.</p><p>Former President Barack Obama is also getting more involved, tweeting this conversation with Senator Harris today:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I work out every morning, regardless of how much sleep I have had. It's just the best way to start the day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEINRICH: The Biden campaign also put out two new ads today as part of this week's $47 million ad blitz across nine battleground states.</p><p>Biden's big spending comes amid reports that the Trump campaign is hitting a cash crunch, President Trump today saying that he will spend his own money if he has to -- Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Jacqui, thank you very much.</p><p>With just 56 days ago to the election, the battle for these battleground states is now in high gear. So, how are things shaking out in states like Florida, where the race is now a tossup?</p><p>With me now, RealClearPolitics' Susan Crabtree.</p><p>Susan, 48-48. The polls, I'm not always interested in the numbers, but the direction, I think, is something that informs us. And it does feel like right now President Trump has that momentum going for him.</p><p>SUSAN CRABTREE, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Well, yes, Joe Biden still has a sizable lead in the RealClearPolitics average nationally.</p><p>But in the battlegrounds, that's where it really matters, and the race is significantly tightening in all eight battleground states. We see it within the margin of error, all under five points, in all eight states.</p><p>And if you -- it's interesting, if you look at what the Biden campaign is saying, that they want to -- where they're targeting Georgia and Arizona and Texas. That's what they're saying, but what are they doing? They're going to -- they're traveling to Minnesota, Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.</p><p>These are the key battlegrounds. And, as you saw today, with the NBC/Marist poll, like you mentioned, Charles, 48 to 48 percent, a dead heat in Florida. And that's why we see both President Trump there today and then Kamala Harris traveling there this week as well.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>CRABTREE: I think the most significant thing about that NBC poll is the Hispanic vote.</p><p>And that is really key, obviously, in Florida. And you have Trump besting Biden with the Hispanic, Latino voters 46 to 50 percent. And he has 50 percent. And it's pretty significant.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. Here's the thing, though. It is significant, but I read an article in The Miami Herald where they're worried because the Hispanic vote -- listen, Hillary Clinton got the majority of it, but we know the Cuban voters typically lean Republican. Many of them like President Trump.</p><p>And it's hard to turn out. I think it's the ability to get these voters to actually come out and vote is where the sticky part is. And President Trump today, with this environmental move, he's kind of keeping the Biden campaign off their focus, I think, and sort of off-kilter a little bit.</p><p>And the door-to-door effort, I think, could be one of the deciding factors that's not getting a lot of publicity.</p><p>CRABTREE: Yes, I think the -- with this COVID time, I think it's completely unprecedented.</p><p>And the mail-in voting is going to be key across the country. You have more mail-in voting than we have ever seen before, and a lot of distrust in The Postal Service as well, so, both of those factors, really unprecedented situation.</p><p>But you still see -- I mean, that is so significant with the Latino voters in Florida, whereas Hillary Clinton, back in 2016, she led with Latino voters 62-35 percent for Trump, and Trump still managed to pull off a win there with 120,000 votes, very, very slim one in Florida.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. Right.</p><p>CRABTREE: And Florida is extremely key for him. He has to win Florida with its 29 electoral votes.</p><p>PAYNE: Absolutely.</p><p>Susan, thank you very much. It's 56 days, but it feels like we're going to be talking about this every day. You can feel the anxiety out there.</p><p>Meanwhile, D.C. stimulus talks are stalling, Wall Street obviously selling, with the Nasdaq now in correction territory. That means it's down 10 percent from the recent high. So, is Main Street worrying?</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>PAYNE: The Senate is back in action today.</p><p>And Senate Republicans are trying to get a new relief bill going, this as the Nasdaq has collapsed in just three sessions into correction territory.</p><p>I want to go to FOX's Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill with the very latest -- Chad.</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Charles.</p><p>Well, the Senate Republicans, they have struggled all summer long to try to get 51 Republican senators to coalesce around a coronavirus bill. We don't know that they have it just yet.</p><p>But there's going to be a procedural vote on this bill that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, released today. That's going to be on Thursday. And, basically, what McConnell is doing here, he is daring Senate Democrats to vote against this bill.</p><p>Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Maybe they will bring back their Goldilocks act and say, our multi-hundred-billion-dollar proposal is too small or too skinny, even though Democrats just passed a piecemeal bill for The Postal Service.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: Now, this bill cost $300 billion. That's cheap, considering they were discussing more than $1 trillion a few days ago.</p><p>It includes liability reform tied to coronavirus and an extra $300 in cash each week for those off the job.</p><p>Now, Democrats don't like this bill at all. In fact, Patrick Leahy, Democratic senator from Vermont, was just on the Senate floor a few moments ago. And he described this bill as -- quote -- \"anemic.\"</p><p>Keep in mind that this bill is really designed by the Senate Republican leadership to give Republicans who are facing competitive reelection bids in swing states air cover to show, Charles, that they can vote for something on coronavirus this fall.</p><p>Somebody else who is in cycle this fall who has to show that he's fighting to deal with coronavirus is Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader -- back to you.</p><p>PAYNE: Chad, thank you very much.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wall Street, it keeps reeling, as Washington keeps getting nowhere with COVID relief, the Nasdaq, as I mentioned, now in correction territory.</p><p>I want to bring in market watcher Kathryn Rooney Vera on whether or not investors are going to get any relief from this sell-off.</p><p>You know, Kathryn Rooney Vera, it is intriguing that the Congress and Washington, D.C., they do seem to pay attention when the market starts to collapse, don't they?</p><p>KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS HOLDINGS: Yes, that's a real problem for them. And that gets some -- that gets them going. Let's just say it that way.</p><p>Certainly, there is going to be some form of stimulus in the pipeline. It's very unlikely that consumption levels can maintain themselves at the current pace, Charles, with slightly under 10 percent unemployment.</p><p>Heretofore, consumption has been largely based on government stimuli, for better or for worse. And I suspect that more is in the very near-term pipeline.</p><p>PAYNE: So, then, what do you make of it, though? Because they started off $2 trillion apart.</p><p>And now we have got this so-called skinny bill, which I know may appease certain folks who are in elections right now and other conservatives who are worried about debt and deficits. But, by the same token, can you realistically say to the country, hey, we want to have enough money for more small businesses, to help schools reopen, to take care of liabilities?</p><p>I don't know if they're going in the right direction, and the clock is ticking.</p><p>ROONEY VERA: Well, Charles, we're still trying to digest $2.7 trillion of stimulus as a reaction to COVID.</p><p>And we're in de facto a V-shaped recovery. So, if we're to debate whether or not a stimulus is actually required, I think that's a very, very credible debate.</p><p>But we're not, unfortunately. Both Republicans and Democrats are -- instead of debating the irresponsibility of our fiscal status, we're talking about not if we should, but the magnitude of the next stimulus bill. We haven't even digested the first one.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, to your point earlier, though, we would not have had consumption if it wasn't for the stimulus bill.</p><p>I mean, I think that's pretty obvious...</p><p>ROONEY VERA: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: ... that people wouldn't have spent money if they didn't know checks were coming, if they didn't know relief was coming.</p><p>Now that people know it's not coming, they're going to be probably sitting on -- our savings rate is the third highest level it's ever been. So, if people start to sit on the meager amounts of money they already have, and everyone starts to pull back as we go into the winter, I'm not sure how that's a positive recipe for the economy.</p><p>ROONEY VERA: But what at cost -- at what cost, Charles?</p><p>And I think this gets into a bit of an ideological debate, but there is a phenomenon called crowding out of the private sector by the government sector. And you have another thing called creative destruction.</p><p>So I do believe we need to let the free markets work. And there's one statistic that I always turn to, Charles. And that's that 30 percent of personal income now comes from government benefits. Is that a place that we want to be in the United States?</p><p>Is that the direction that we want to continue to turn? And right now, consumption has been primarily, as you mentioned, driven by stimuli, when, more likely than not, it should be run by the private sector and the government reducing itself in size, rather than augmenting its size.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. No, no, it's a tough one.</p><p>If it wasn't for this one -- once-in-every-hundred-year plague and this forced government lockdown, I might be in lockstep with you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE: But, on this one, I think Congress is making a mistake. And I think people with jobs are underestimating how painful it is for people whose job went out of business.</p><p>Like, your business you worked at does not exist anymore, and an economist is telling you to toughen up, don't worry about it, the free market is there.</p><p>It's not. My business is gone. It's not. They won't let me open the restaurant. There is no real free enterprise or free markets when you have so much more and so many of these outside exogenous factors. And that's what worries me, is that Congress is going to let this thing get a lot worse, and then they're going to pass something that's really going to make the fiscal conservatives upset.</p><p>ROONEY VERA: But don't you think then, Charles, that we shouldn't be subsidizing the major conglomerates?</p><p>The Federal Reserve is buying in the secondary market bonds from Apple and from GE -- from GM. These are subsidized national champions. We see this in the emerging markets.</p><p>So, my contention is, corporate socialism isn't something that we want to dabble with. So, I agree that we need to have some improvement with regard to enhancing refinancing to small and medium businesses. But that hasn't been the case. It's been to the benefit of the major conglomerates.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. Yes. That's been a side issue that -- it's sincere. And I think a lot of it had to do with the urgency factor of getting this stuff out there. But the clock is ticking.</p><p>Kathryn Rooney Vera, always a pleasure.</p><p>ROONEY VERA: Thank you, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Meanwhile, folks, eight weeks out, President Trump says he will step in with his own campaign cash, if he has to.</p><p>The fallout from that is next.</p><p>PAYNE: Talk about indigestion.</p><p>Forget about making reservations at your favorite New York restaurant. A new survey showing more than half of restaurants across the state could be gone for good. That means never coming back.</p><p>We will be back in 60 seconds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have much more money than we had last time going into the last two months, I think double and triple. But if we needed any more, I would put it up personally, like I did in the primaries last time.</p><p>In the 2016 primaries, I put up a lot of money. If I have to, I will do it here. But we don't have to, because we have double and maybe even triple what we had a number of years ago, four years ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: President Trump considering putting some of his own money into the 2020 race. How big of a deal is that?</p><p>Let's ask Democratic strategist Jenna Arnold, Axios reporter Stef Kight, and GOP strategist Joseph Pinion.</p><p>Joe, Joseph, what do you think? Is that a sign of desperation or a sign of his commitment to winning?</p><p>JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, look, I think it's a sign of his commitment to say that he's in this to the end.</p><p>But I also think it's a psychic nod and a wink to that donor class. I think, when you take someone out to dinner, no one ever really wants to reach into their pocket and spend their own money. And even billionaires running for president don't want to spend their own money when they're running for president.</p><p>But I think it's a message to those other billionaires and to also those grassroots supporters that say that, hey, give until it hurts. We're in for the fight of our lives right now.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, Jenna, it's interesting.</p><p>For years, Democrats used to complain about the money Republicans had. And now the Democrats seem to be the ones who are awash in cash. What difference will it make with the outcome?</p><p>JENNA ARNOLD, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I mean, I assume that it will ultimately have a significant impact in terms of on-air and online buys targeting swing voters.</p><p>So, heading into the final months, it's a bit -- it's a significant flag that the Democrats are doing so well, and Trump is signaling to his community that he needs help.</p><p>PAYNE: And, Stef, of course, if you go back to the prior election, Hillary Clinton significantly spent more money than then candidate Trump. And we saw what the results were.</p><p>Is it more about organization these days, commitment from volunteers than it is about absolute cash?</p><p>STEF KIGHT, AXIOS: I mean, cash is always going to be important.</p><p>And you're right that, in 2016, Hillary Clinton raised far more -- far more funds than Donald Trump did. And it's interesting, because, going into 2020, it was looking like Donald Trump really would have had the edge when it comes to cash flow, when it comes to having the money and resources available to really go hard this election cycle.</p><p>So, it is significant that he's now saying that he would consider putting his own money into it. And the fact that, while he is committed to winning, it also does show that Democrats have had -- made quite some progress over the past few months in raising funds, that Biden had a significant haul in August, record-setting numbers of funds coming in.</p><p>So, while money isn't the only thing that matters these days, and being able to use social media and other tactics that maybe aren't as expensive...</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>KIGHT: ... money is still going to be a significant factor here.</p><p>PAYNE: And, to be clear, Biden just recently -- the Biden/Harris ticket just recently started to push hard, whereas President Trump has been raising a lot of money.</p><p>Both sides -- we're going to shatter all records. We know that.</p><p>I want to kind of switch gears here because of what's happening in these major cities across the United States, President Trump and Joe Biden both addressing these protests over the past week.</p><p>Now, in Rochester, New York just saw -- Rochester, New York, just recently, just a few moments ago, the police chief there resigned, this in the wake of these uprisings over the death of Daniel Prude.</p><p>And, Joe, he took the entire command team. They're all gone. The mayor says she has no idea who's in charge. I mean, we're seeing just pure anarchy.</p><p>And so how does this impact the election, Joe?</p><p>PINION: I mean, look, we're clearly a nation in pain.</p><p>But we have to remind ourselves that retribution is not justice. Vengeance is not atonement. And when people like John Lewis are talking about getting into good trouble, good trouble is not mirroring the type of intimidation tactics that black people took to the streets and took to lunch counters to try to drive out of society.</p><p>So, you cannot in any way think that you're going to mirror the ugliness you seek to cure the world of and think that you're going to build the future that we all deserve.</p><p>So, I think, right now, President Trump is leaning into the fact that you can expect more of this if you were to elect a Biden and Harris ticket. And I think the reality is, as I have said many times, that every time a business burns, a new Trump supporter is born.</p><p>But now I think every time a family has to flee a restaurant in terror, you're dealing with the fact that those never-Trumpers might find themselves running back into the warm embrace of Donald Trump.</p><p>PAYNE: Jenna, it feels like Joe Biden's having a difficult time, because he's walking his thin line.</p><p>He wants to say he's for law and order. He also has been really reluctant to critique some of the violence that we're seeing, and many Democrats saying, hey, there was some survey taken of some sort of evidence that only 7 percent of these things were violent.</p><p>I mean, that's a big number, right? We're talking about dozens and dozens of instances where either Molotov cocktails are thrown or even issues where -- that Joe just referenced -- where people are having a dinner and they're chased out of the restaurant and humiliated.</p><p>I mean, aren't you concerned about that?</p><p>ARNOLD: I think the outstanding question that we all need to stay very disciplined in asking is, why are all of these protests happening to begin with?</p><p>Martin Luther King did -- gracefully explained that peace is not the absence of tension, but it's the presence of justice. Folks that are taking to the streets are infuriated, not just about the amount of people who consistently have their lives taken away from them at the hands of law enforcement and systematic violence, but whose voice just continue to be neglected by those who have been put in power.</p><p>So I think the real outstanding question is, are these people being heard? Are they being responded to? And, yes, I don't condone, as a Quaker, any sort of violence, be it at a glass window or any sort of aggravated verbal violence, but I think it's a reflection of all of the cracks in the system, be it in Rochester or Portland.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>ARNOLD: I think anything that falls under the law and order umbrella needs to be examined with a very, very big magnifying glass.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, do I have time for Stef?</p><p>I'm sorry. Sorry. We got to leave it there.</p><p>Listen, real quick, Stef, listen, that answer is what infuriates me. I know 57 years personally of the frustrations that black people are dealing with. I just don't know that chasing people out of restaurants or violence is -- I think that muffles the message, which, by the way, is resonating, if you let it resonate.</p><p>KIGHT: Absolutely.</p><p>I think there are a lot of American voters who agree with you and who see the violence in some of these cities and see the destruction. And that is going to influence their vote in November. They are watching that. And we're seeing in the polls that more and more Americans are saying that law and order and the unrest that we're seeing in these cities is going to be a significant factor for them in November.</p><p>And we have seen both sides take advantage of this. We have seen Donald Trump continue to tout law and order. And we have also seen Joe Biden come out and say that he does not support...</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. All right, well, it's really an amazing time in this country.</p><p>And thank you all very much for this panel.</p><p>In the meantime, we're going to talk about partying in a pandemic. Another major university suspends in classes -- in-person classes, this as it would like to keep its students and kids safer on campus and send them home. But is that the right answer?</p><p>We have got a top doctor who does have the answers next.</p><p>PAYNE: Class dismissed.</p><p>West Virginia University putting a temporary hold on in-person classes, after a slew of outbreaks and fears that partying over the weekend will cause even more.</p><p>So, is this the right move, to keep students on campus, instead of sending them home?</p><p>Joining me now, Johns Hopkins University Physician Dr. Marty Makary.</p><p>Dr. Makary, all these universities seem to be grappling with this. Some people believe that, while the cases are high, there have been zero hospitalizations and that sending students home may be an overreaction.</p><p>What do you think is the right course here?</p><p>DR. MARTY MAKARY, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY: Well, I agree, Charles, we don't want infected students in our airports, sharing bathrooms with limited ventilation in ride-share services, going through the TSA and traveling. It's just not a good idea. It's not good for public health.</p><p>It creates more vectors of transmission. So, dispersing 500 kids back into the United States through modes of -- multiple modes of transportation is bad for public health. And at the University of West Virginia, there's now 500 students after just a week of classes that are positive, and the positivity rate has gone from 1 to 14 percent.</p><p>So, we need to address it, but they need to stay put. They need to find a place where they can quarantine. And they need to not travel, until their symptoms resolve. And, of course, in the interim, if they get very sick, that's when they go straight to a doctor or an emergency room.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, I mean, we see sort of like the NBA thing with the bubble, if you will.</p><p>I mean, I guess these campuses are going to become de facto bubbles, and maybe also experiments in herd immunity of sorts.</p><p>MAKARY: It's amazing.</p><p>The schools are doing a tremendous job, not just grade schools and high schools, but colleges, in putting all the precautionary measures in place. But all of that falls apart, Charles, with the off-campus parties.</p><p>And we're seeing the spread primarily in the older age group. It's not from the classroom itself. And if you look at the age distribution of the transmission, it's not grade schools. It's not even the early part of junior high schools. It's the off-campus congregate settings.</p><p>So I think schools need to recognize people that have COVID-19, they're not -- it's not leprosy in biblical times. You don't just shoo them away. You have got a responsibility to the community.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. And I guess, if we're going to be realistic, they're just not going to stop partying. Perhaps there's a way to keep them on campus.</p><p>But they're just -- I just don't know how you stop them, if they're allowed to leave campus, from partying.</p><p>MAKARY: Well, schools have traditionally had one heavy lever, and that is to kick somebody out of school.</p><p>It's time maybe for them to not just scatter parties, but to create some accountability and say, look, we're serious. For the time being, we don't want people gathering in these congregate settings.</p><p>Most students are doing the right thing. They're making tremendous personal sacrifices.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>MAKARY: But it's a small group that ruins it for the larger student body.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, sir, always appreciate your invaluable insight. Thank you very much.</p><p>In the meantime, while the school situation remains fluid here, across the pond and in the United Kingdom, students are returning to class for the first time in months.</p><p>FOX's Benjamin Hall has the latest from London.</p><p>BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, hi, Charles.</p><p>There's an overwhelming consensus here that there's more risk to keep children out of school than it is to send them back. And so we have seen 99.7 percent of schools here in the U.K. return to class.</p><p>There are precautions in place. There are the bubbles set up to make sure that year groups don't overlap. There are start times staggered. And in those COVID hot spots in the U.K., high school kids will have to wear masks in communal areas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: But not in the classroom, because that's clearly nonsensical. You can't teach with face coverings.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HALL: It is widely accepted that coronavirus poses a very small risk to children.</p><p>But most experts agree, overwhelmingly, that if children don't return to school, there will be widespread long-term negative to learning and psychological health.</p><p>Nine out of 10 parents say they feel safe sending their children back. But, as you know, Charles, this is not only about education. It's about the economy. If you get the children back, you can get their parents back into the work force.</p><p>And that, at least here in the U.K., has been a major issue -- Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Benjamin Hall, thank you very much.</p><p>And with politics getting injected into the race for the COVID-19 vaccine, several major drug companies doing something to make sure that the public feels safe.</p><p>We will explain next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Biden and his very liberal running mate should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric.</p><p>JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's said so many things that aren't true, I'm worried, if we do have a really good vaccine, people are going to be reluctant to take it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: As the coronavirus becomes a 2020 election issue, a group of drug company CEOs are pledging that their COVID-19 vaccines will follow the full regulatory path.</p><p>With me now is former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan.</p><p>Mark, the need -- I think it's really intriguing that four competing companies all in the race for the COVID-19 vaccine thought they had to join together to reassure the public that this is going to be a safe and effective manner that's always been part of the FDA process.</p><p>I mean, are you surprised that they -- that it's come to this?</p><p>DR. MARK MCCLELLAN, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER: Well, Charles, this is a very important time for the country. And the vaccines are critical to effectively emerging from the pandemic.</p><p>So, here we are, just a couple of months before the election, a lot of rhetoric. And I think what you're seeing from the companies, you're also going to see from other people. Former FDA commissioners, like me, have all been saying the same thing.</p><p>The FDA has a very good process in place that they intend to apply here to make sure the vaccines that are approved for use are safe and effective for the people who are getting them. And that's really important, so that Americans can have confidence to use the vaccines and get us out of the pandemic.</p><p>PAYNE: The FDA process, in and of itself, has been criticized by many for a long time.</p><p>It's the toughest in the world. It takes a long time. You can spend billions of dollars. You got phase one, phase two, phase three, new drug application. And then you only get to sell the drug before -- a few years before they rip you off with the generic version.</p><p>So, with this Operation Warp Speed,rMD-BO_ has it truncated the process without taking away the integrity of the process?</p><p>MCCLELLAN: Well, I wouldn't say it's truncated the process.</p><p>And I know, when you -- when people hear words like Operation Warp Speed, they think of something going fast, maybe too fast for safety.</p><p>But, Charles, what's really happened with the vaccine process is that several things that usually happen one after the other are happening at the same time, thanks in part because FDA has laid out some very clear expectations that they want to see a vaccine that is shown to significantly reduce COVID and its severity in a large number of patients before it can be used.</p><p>So, they put out that guidance. The National Institutes of Health, working with the companies, have set up some very large clinical trials, 30,000 people or more. They're enrolling very fast. A number those are under way. More are starting the next month for at least six vaccines over the next few months. That's unprecedented.</p><p>And also unprecedented is, at the same time, the government is going in jointly with the manufacturers on these vaccines to commit to a large-scale supply, tens, hundreds of millions of doses that will be ready to go when or soon after the vaccines are actually approved, when they meet those FDA safety standards.</p><p>Normally, all those things happen one after the other, with a lot of uncertainty. Because this is COVID, they're all happening at the same time. So, it's not cutting corners, as much as it's doing things that used to be done sequentially all at the same time.</p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>I'm thrilled you cleared that up, because I was not -- I wasn't sure until now. Ironically, it makes me feel better about this. But we do have a large swathe of the population, at least a third of Americans, who say they won't take it.</p><p>Whose job is it, whose responsibility is it, the government, drug companies, to sort of reassure the public that this is something worth doing? Because there are a lot of skeptics out there.</p><p>MCCLELLAN: Well, there are a lot of skeptics out there.</p><p>Even before COVID, there are a lot of people who are skeptical of vaccines, even though FDA's track record on vaccines is one of a very high level of safety and one that should deserve a lot of confidence.</p><p>So, this is another challenge for all of us, Charles, who are involved in this, people like you who are talking to the American public every day, the FDA getting out a very clear understanding to the public of all of these steps that they're going through to make sure vaccines are safe and effective before they're used, as well as other experts, medical professionals.</p><p>I understand that people have a lot of questions because of the political environment we're in now. But it's very important to look at the facts and look at what FDA is actually doing to make sure that the COVID vaccines are safe and effective.</p><p>And I think, if we support the FDA in doing what they are expert and very well prepared to do, people should have confidence in the vaccine. It's still going to be a big effort to communicate to the American public about what's gone into vaccine development and how and why they should make decisions to use the vaccines.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, sir.</p><p>Well, you're right. It's going to be a big uphill battle, but we appreciate you coming on. And you certainly helped me out a lot today. I appreciate it.</p><p>In the meantime, folks, you are looking live at New York City. Your table? Still not ready.</p><p>And, according to a new survey, your favorite restaurant could actually be making its last call for good.</p><p>PAYNE: Point, click, clean.</p><p>The next big tech trend during COVID-19 could be a big game-changer for businesses across the country.</p><p>To Jeff Flock in Vernon Hills, Illinois, with the very latest -- Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Disinfecting, Charles, people as they enter various venues in this disinfection booth.</p><p>Right now, I'm getting about as disinfected as I can be. This is atomized disinfectant here. I'm also getting ozone now coming down from the ceiling of this, as well as what they call far-UVC, ultraviolet light, doesn't hurt you, but does kill the virus.</p><p>Got the people here who have developed it, the president and CEO of the company developing this.</p><p>Can you run me through this, Jason, if you would? I'm going to give you the microphone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.</p><p>FLOCK: I will stand here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>So, obviously, you put your face in front of the silhouette. It read your temperature, and now it's giving you an approval to enter into the device.</p><p>FLOCK: I can go in here. Now, I go in. What do I do?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, raise your arms. And you want to take about a six- to-eight-second turn.</p><p>So, this way, you're avoiding any shadowing, so the light can disinfect you. And you have -- as you mentioned, you have got that ozone above you at three parts per million. You have got far-UVC, which is 99.97 percent effective, and atomized disinfectant.</p><p>FLOCK: Now, just to be clear, this isn't curing coronavirus.</p><p>What this is doing is keeping any of the virus that's on my hands and on my person in any way from coming into an already sanitized location.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we make front-line-of-defense products.</p><p>Companies are going to spend a lot of money disinfecting their -- their companies, and that costs a lot of money. But, as soon as you open up the door, the real threat is the people. They're dragging in that RNA.</p><p>FLOCK: Gotcha.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And there needs to be technology and devices to prevent...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FLOCK: This is already in use extensively in the UAE, Charles.</p><p>Overseas countries have been early adopters on this.</p><p>Dina (ph), tell me.

And then we're also installing them at SeatGeek Stadium here in Bridgeview.</p><p>FLOCK: And you have got now universities also, right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, quite a few of the different districts have been talking to us readily.</p><p>I think, with this, it'll help close quite a few of those deals.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FLOCK: Sorry.</p><p>And, again, Charles, this is disinfectant, I can get this on me. This is not -- this is ingestible, FDA-approved, as well as the light, as well as the ozone.</p><p>Anything you can do to try and make the environment safer, I think, is going to be a positive out there -- Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Oh, yes, safety is the word. That's for sure.</p><p>Jeff Flock, thank you very much.</p><p>And from cleaning up to getting cleaned out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): You also know that, when we opened indoor dining in Upstate New York, we had issues. When we opened indoor dining, we had clusters in Upstate New York.</p><p>This is not without risk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo talking about the dangers of reopening indoor dining, this with a new survey showing that nearly two- thirds of New York state restaurants could close for good if they don't get another round of COVID-19 economic relief.</p><p>Let's get the read on this from Nassau County Executive Laura Curran.</p><p>Laura, I got to say, I'm reading where your county in Long Island has been really aggressive, where New York state, particularly New York City, has not. And you have put out some ads. You have talked about taste Nassau today, dine where it's fine in Long Island. All seem to be deliberate shots at New York City, Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio saying, hey, you know, we're letting at least 50 percent -- our restaurants open, at least 50 percent of them.</p><p>Why do you feel it's so much safer? And what do you think the economic consequences are going to be?</p><p>LAURA CURRAN, NASSAU COUNTY, NEW YORK, EXECUTIVE: Hi, Charles. It's wonderful to be with you again.</p><p>And I'm very happy to talk about our fabulous restaurants in Nassau County. So, we're the first county on Long Island just to the side of New York City. And we want to encourage people to come for much more than pizza and bagels.</p><p>We have got fabulous restaurants. We do have indoor dining, 50 percent capacity. And this is really important. It's important to give people a chance to go out, share a meal with family, with friends, with loved ones.</p><p>And it's also important because it keeps a lot of people working. We need to get this economy going again. I have been an advocate for businesses to reopen and to reopen safely.</p><p>And I think our numbers have shown (INAUDIBLE) hospitalization (INAUDIBLE). We have been opening now (INAUDIBLE) reopened more than 100 days. And in that 100 days, our rates have only gone down.</p><p>So, I think we're going to do what we can (INAUDIBLE) and do it safely.</p><p>PAYNE: No, it's a beacon, actually, for a lot of folks in New York City, particularly these restaurant owners.</p><p>I had a restaurant owner on my show last week. And she's desperate. All of them are saying, we're OK. We have got the sidewalk thing working for us, the pickup stuff, the takeout stuff, but without the ability to go indoors, particularly as it gets cooler, we're going to go out of business.</p><p>I mean, you must speak with the governor. I'm sure you have conversations with Bill de Blasio. Do they ask you about the success that you're experiencing? And, obviously, from the first moment that this occurred, you took a more pro-business approach toward all of this.</p><p>CURRAN: You know, I visited a lot, I visited malls, I visited gyms, I visited bowling alleys and advocated for their safe reopening.</p><p>I just did a big tour of movie theaters and saw all of the protocols, independent small movie theaters, big chains, looking at the protocols that they have in place.</p><p>And I'm confident that, when they can reopen, they can do it safely. That's the key. We're proving that we can do it. We need the economy to come back strong. We need to get that revenue going, getting people working, keeping them working.</p><p>It's very important for all of us. People say, we're all in this together. Our businesses are a very important part of that.</p><p>PAYNE: Have you had a chance, though, to speak with the governor about this at all? Has he asked about your success and maybe using it as something of a template for the rest of the state?</p><p>CURRAN: Sure. We speak with our partners at the state all of the time, advocating for businesses to be able to open in a commonsense way. We always get a good reception.</p><p>And this is an ongoing process. I think everyone, whatever their municipality or their responsibilities are, want to keep people safe. That's my goal too. My goal is also to show that we can reopen and reopen in a way that is safe.</p><p>We all know those commonsense protocols, the mask, the social distancing. We know they work. We know they're simple. And we know that we can be nimble and readjust things.</p><p>PAYNE: I feel like this is a matter of trust, that you trust businesses to do the right thing, that you trust all of these other folks to do the right thing.</p><p>And it's proven out. You have given them the green light. They're doing it. Your cases have gone down. People have kept their jobs.

Although Guo Ping of Huawei opened the conference on Monday with a speech on next generation 5G telecom networks, the Chinese contingent at Web Summit has been less visible than in previous years - a sign of the widening rift between the western and Chinese tech scenes.</p><p>Tony Blair spoke of how it was vital for Europe and the US to collaborate to set common values for the development of new technologies including AI to serve as a bulwark against China, which was exploiting them to strengthen its authoritarianism.</p><p>He claimed the answer to rising populism in western democracies lay in weaving emerging technology into a \"narrative of optimism about the future\".</p><p>Regulating Big Tech</p><p>In the early days, the Summit was a \u00a0focus for tech entrepreneurs and industry geeks - but not for the hordes of politicians and others who now show up to participate.</p><p>This year, the presence of heavy hitters including Michel Barnier, Blair and Margrethe Vestager, the EC's newly empowered tech commissioner, have lent the event a new atmosphere.</p><p>\"Tech has become hyper-political,\" said Paddy Cosgrave, the Irish founder and boss of the Web Summit, who founded the event in Dublin a decade ago and shifted it to Portugal in 2016.</p><p>Perhaps that comes as no surprise given the myriad problems to have engulfed the sector over tax, data privacy, the use of social media platforms to spread misinformation and extremist material.\u00a0 Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, said it was vital to protect privacy, something he views as a \"fundamental human right\" and one of the coming decade's most defining issues.</p><p>The Summit also offers a perfect opportunity for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/05/brexit-data-abuse-growing-rift-china-dominate-web-summit/\">Vestager</url> -\u00a0the world's most powerful tech regulator -\u00a0to offer up solutions to some of the industry's problems.

More than 160 companies across the EU are now valued at over $1bn including Swedish and German fintech companies Klarna, N26 and Britain's BenevolentAI.</p><p>Europe's tech workforce is now growing at 4pc - compared to employment in the EU as a whole which is growing at about 1pc.

Think for a moment about the personal information you share online\u2014your photos, your voice, your online search history, even your financial information. How much control do you have over that private data once it has been shared online? The short answer: basically none.</p><p>The recent data-sharing scandals at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have revealed just how easy it is for big tech companies to exploit and profit from the personal information you share online. What\u2019s more, there are no federal regulations that require these companies to disclose what types of data they are collecting, how they\u2019re using it and who they\u2019re sharing with. Your personal data may be collected and shared with dozens, if not hundreds of companies without your permission.</p><p> There are two significant reasons why this is important: First, when these companies fail to protect private data, they put people at increased risk of becoming victims of identity theft and fraud. One example of this is the recent Equifax breach, which exposed the addresses, dates of birth and Social Security numbers of more than 148 million people\u2014almost half the population of the United States. Second, people have the right to be free from uninvited surveillance. Privacy forms the basis of our democratic freedoms. When companies collect our private information and fail to give us a say in how it is used or shared, this is a violation of our right to privacy.</p><p> Europe has already recognized the importance of protecting personal data. The European Union recently passed the General Data Protection Regulation, commonly known as the GDPR, which gives consumers certain rights over their data and places security obligations on companies holding their data. Similarly, the State of California has passed a Consumer Privacy Act, which gives consumers a right to control how companies collect and use their personal data. The law takes effect this January.</p><p> In this rapidly-evolving, technology-driven age, we can\u2019t afford to wait around while the federal government drags its feet on this important issue. New York must be a leader in protecting the privacy of its residents and their personal data. That is why I introduced the New York Privacy Act, a groundbreaking piece of privacy legislation that aims to give New Yorkers full control over their private data. If passed, the New York Privacy Act would allow people to find out what data companies are collecting on them, see who they\u2019re sharing that data with, request that it be corrected or deleted and avoid having their data shared with or sold to third parties. Additionally, the law penalizes companies that make their profits at the expense of their customers\u2019 privacy.</p><p> With technology ever-evolving, this issue grows more pressing each day. As much as I hate to think about it, my daughter will eventually be old enough to start using social media. When she does, I want her to be as protected as possible. That\u2019s why the New York Privacy Act is a top priority for me as I prepare for the upcoming legislative session in Albany this January.</p><p> State Senator Kevin Thomas represents New York\u2019s 6th Senatorial District in Nassau County. He presently serves as Chair of the Committee on Consumer Protection.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>KEVIN THOMAS State Senator</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-1779B6C1A85A7AE4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289BB7BA32BF61 NWBKNY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XN8-7NN1-JBCN-402F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Anton Community Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Such a trend is pressure for clampdown on American freedoms (asserted with a \"for your own good\" rationale) during this coronavirus season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And 1952 film \"The Twonky\" was such instructive fantasy. The film starred Hans Conried as a professor bedeviled by a manipulative force that operated from a new television. It regulated Conried's life for what it thought his best interests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As another character theorized, the futuristic Twonky had fallen backward through a time hole into the movie's present. In its future time, Twonkies run every household and regulate behaviors and thoughts per disposition of a Super State.</p><p> When Conried begins writing a lecture \u2013 \"Individualism is the basis of all great art\" \u2014 the Twonky manipulates him into crossing out the line. It zaps the professor's forehead and clears his mind of unapproved thoughts.</p><p> The alien future force similarly frustrates a partial follow-up attempt \"Freedom of self-expression is the pri \u2014.\" And it zaps out of his hand selected volumes John Stuart Mill's Liberty and a Lincoln biography, lest the professor consult their reasoning.</p><p> But it does allow him to read a book titled \"Pleasure Through the Ages.\" Bread and circuses.</p><p> Conried realizes the Twonky prevents his exercising personal choices of which it disapproves. In its future time, citizens are mere passive onlookers to life's parade, not independent agents able to chart courses that befit their particular ambitions.</p><p> When the professor seeks temporary respite in drunkenness, the Twonky zaps him back into sobriety.</p><p> \"I'm sober,\" Conried's professor declares. \"Cold sober. So that's forbidden too, huh? A man can't even escape into that in your time, can he? What is it in your time \u2014 'Yes sir, no sir. Thank you for my chains, sir? Well, go back to your time! I don't want you, and I don't need you! What good are you, anyway? Security? Sure, I want security. But not at your price! I may be wrong, but it's my kind of wrong. It's my God-given right to be wrong!\"</p><p> Our Constitution guarantees rights and liberties. But in this coronavirus moment, numerous governmental 'for public interest' anti-liberty examples present themselves: Authorities fined Mississippians who stayed in cars at parking-lot church services; numerous state governors imposed draconian stay-at-home orders that violated Constitutional rights to free speech and association; elected Democrat officials like Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart and Black Hawk County supervisors pursued economic harms to local businesses and working men and women's paychecks; Reps. Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne have endorsed statewide stay-at-home regulation. Big tech barons have proposed computerized surveillance of citizens; and some commentators advanced the notion that Americans be required to carry papers for official street inspection.</p><p> In various municipalities, citizens were encouraged to act as totalitarian-state snitches and report others who'd flouted purported safety guidelines.</p><p> It's an old truth, but one of evergreen relevance: Individuals should choose protections voluntarily, not have bondage imposed on them at the point of governmental gun. Who runs your life is the whole point.</p><p> Only vigilance and determination can prevent Twonky-type Nanny-State restriction of men's freedoms from becoming accepted norm.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIA-612d9dc911ef8337c8703b165e51904f5eb957e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898A9ED958483 NWBKIA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YR6-7TK1-DXVP-V0NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"562\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 wcfcourier.com, 501 Commercial St. Waterloo, IA<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Silicon Valley companies are feasting on an exploding client base of quarantined students held hostage to \"online learning.\" Big Google is leading the way - and that is not OK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unsuspecting parents cheering all the software and hardware donations during the pandemic shutdown have no idea the privacy price their children are paying. This isn't charity. It's big tech recruitment of vulnerable generations of future Google addicts. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Google inked a deal to provide 4,000 \"free\" Chromebooks to students, along with \"free\" Wi-Fi to 100,000 families. In Kentucky, the Jefferson County public schools gave away 25,000 Chromebooks. In Philadelphia, public officials earmarked $11 million to purchase 40,000 Chromebooks for homebound kids.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai crowed a few weeks ago that the company now has 100 million students and educators hooked on Google Classroom. Bent on conquering the virtual meeting market, the online giant announced that its premium Google Meet video conferencing features are now free to all 80 million customers of its G Suite for Education apps through the fall. Google Meet is racking up 2 million new users a day as school districts abandon Zoom, the dominant virtual meeting app that recently admitted \"mistakenly\" routing non-Chinese calls through its Beijing-based data centers.</p><p>But if educators think Google will provide more protections for American students than the ChiCom government, they're blind, dumb or bought off. As I've chronicled regularly in this column over the past decade, the Silicon Valley giant has repeatedly breached federal privacy laws to extend its tentacles into children's emails, browsing habits, search engine activity, voice memos and more without parental consent. Google's information predators have previously admitted to unauthorized scanning and indexing of student email accounts and targeted online advertising based on search engine activity, as well as autosyncing of passwords, browsing history and other private data across devices and accounts belonging to students and families unaware of default tracking.</p><p>A new lawsuit seeking class-action status against Google filed in Illinois serves as a warning to all the millions of families enthralled by their pandemic-gifted Chromebooks. Father-of-two Clinton Farwell alleges that Google illegally collected personally identifying biometric information from his children through their public school-issued Chromebooks (loaded with G Suite for Education apps) dating back to 2015. His suit lays out how Google has \"infiltrated\" K-12 education with hardware and software primarily targeting students under the age of 13, whose face templates and voiceprints are illicitly collected, along with their: physical locations; websites they visit; every search term they use in Google's search engine (and the results they click on); the videos they watch on YouTube; personal contact lists; voice recordings; saved passwords; and other behavioral information.</p><p>Despite signing a \"Student Privacy Pledge\" promising not to collect, share and retain private personal data, Google Chromebooks scan students' faces and unique acoustic details of students' voices to identify them by name, age, gender and location while using Google platforms. Farwell realized his kids' biometric data was being stored in a vast database when he discovered they were required to speak and look into the laptops' microphones and cameras in order to use the school products and apps.</p><p>A similar lawsuit by the New Mexico Attorney General's office filed in federal court in February exposed how Chromebooks and G Suite for Education apps mined students' Gmail accounts for advertising purposes. The New Mexico AG's brief also bolstered my previous exclusive reports, based on whistleblowing by Missouri teachers Brooke Henderson and Brette Hay, on Google's access to student profiles and family computer passwords through the default Chrome Sync function - which can only be blocked by creating a passphrase buried in settings that school officials never inform students about (let alone their parents left in the dark from the moment schools require kids to create Google logins as early as kindergarten).</p><p>And now governments are entrusting Google to help develop contact-tracing technology on the promise that they won't collect location data, won't exploit data for commercial purposes, and won't grant access to unauthorized parties? Fox, meet henhouse.</p><p>Regulatory slaps on the wrist by toothless federal agencies have done nothing to deter the deceitful data usurpers. Why hasn't every other state attorney general filed a similar suit? Where is Congress, which passed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to prevent exactly the kind of routine marauding of students' digital lives perpetrated by Google and other EdTech vultures? Instead of pushing back, Congress passed the \"Every Student Succeeds Act\" and the \"Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act\" - deceptively titled bills expanding third-party access to sensitive personal data.</p><p>The Invisible Enemy is right under our noses, in our homes and on our kids' laptops. Instead of removing children en masse from their classrooms in the name of public health, responsible adults should be de-platforming Google's privacy pillagers from every school in America in the name of public safety.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"AIS5c77329521c0cimage\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTCUR-bc453b504bfe5b63928539db3575718f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTCUR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWW-SS71-DYTB-K40T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146816</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"931\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Post and Courier All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Post &amp;

Big Tech is about to learn this lesson, if it hasn't already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elizabeth Warren is out with a headline-grabbing proposal to break up Big Tech companies, the sort of overly ambitious government plan that once would have engendered knee-jerk Republican opposition. Not anymore. Who says we all can't get along?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When the senator tweeted her (understandable) objection that Facebook had taken down her ads attacking Facebook and other tech companies, Ted Cruz agreed that the companies have too much power.</p><p> Tech is caught in a right-left pincer. Conservatives don't like these companies because they are owned and operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals subject to the worst sort of groupthink. Progressives don't like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.</p><p> That's why there is some chance Washington might get together and, along the lines Warren proposes, effectively outlaw the business models of some of the most successful and iconic American companies.</p><p> Warren's idea to cleave off the platforms of the tech companies and have them run as \"platform utilities\" separate from the rest of their business is unworkable and is justified by a series of errors and misjudgments.</p><p> It's not true, as Warren asserts, that the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s opened up the space for Google and Facebook to thrive. Microsoft never got the internet and left the space open for Google and Facebook all by itself, as often happens with a large incumbent wedded to its business model.</p><p> She charges that the tech companies use mergers to limit competition and cites Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp. It's hard to discern the harm here. When the social network bought it, WhatsApp was available for a fee. Now it's free, and more people use it than ever. What's the problem?</p><p> She calls out Google for allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It's not obvious that Google actually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to improve Google's searches, or is qualified to even try.</p><p> Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of consumers, who are the ones who made the tech companies so large.</p><p> Why does Google provide for free a tool without which it's impossible to imagine contemporary life? Because it can monetize it with advertising. Without the advertising, which Warren insists should be a separate business, Google has no incentive to devote engineers to improving its search engine.</p><p> By the same token, no one will welcome iPhones that no longer come with or sell Apple apps. And would people really appreciate having to go to two different Amazons, one just a platform, one selling Amazon products?</p><p> This is all silly, as are the mergers that Warren pledges to reverse, including Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon doesn't have anything close to a monopoly in food retail. Rather than taking over the sector, it's spurring investment and innovation. The nation's largest supermarket chain, Kroger, was slated to increase its spending on investment 200 percent in 2018.</p><p> The tech giants aren't stand-pat companies. Amazon alone spent more than $22 billion on investment in 2017. The development of autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and voice recognition wouldn't be nearly as advanced if it weren't for the research of the tech companies. The behemoth of yesteryear, General Electric, isn't making these investments.</p><p> None of this is to deny genuine concerns about tech companies. They need rules for content that honor the spirit of the First Amendment, and perhaps there should be tighter regulations around privacy. But any real offenses should be addressed with fixes directed at specific conduct, rather than with a massive politically imposed reorganization.</p><p> That's a very bad idea, and if you had any doubt, watch it get a respectful hearing from both sides in Washington.</p><p> Rich Lowry can be reached via e-mail: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:comments.lowry@nationalreview.com\">comments.lowry@nationalreview.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKFL-92a4c9ced5f25b315de6816946e6efe6ceaa30</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28972C2FD9E2A9 NWBKFL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN8-TY11-DXVP-V1T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 North Port Sun<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Big Tech is about to learn this lesson, if it hasn't already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elizabeth Warren is out with a headline-grabbing proposal to break up Big Tech companies, the sort of overly ambitious government plan that once would have engendered knee-jerk Republican opposition. Not anymore. Who says we all can't get along?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When the senator tweeted her (understandable) objection that Facebook had taken down her ads attacking Facebook and other tech companies, Ted Cruz agreed that the companies have too much power.</p><p> Tech is caught in a right-left pincer. Conservatives don't like these companies because they are owned and operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals subject to the worst sort of groupthink. Progressives don't like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.</p><p> That's why there is some chance Washington might get together and, along the lines Warren proposes, effectively outlaw the business models of some of the most successful and iconic American companies.</p><p> Warren's idea to cleave off the platforms of the tech companies and have them run as \"platform utilities\" separate from the rest of their business is unworkable and is justified by a series of errors and misjudgments.</p><p> It's not true, as Warren asserts, that the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s opened up the space for Google and Facebook to thrive. Microsoft never got the internet and left the space open for Google and Facebook all by itself, as often happens with a large incumbent wedded to its business model.</p><p> She charges that the tech companies use mergers to limit competition and cites Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp. It's hard to discern the harm here. When the social network bought it, WhatsApp was available for a fee. Now it's free, and more people use it than ever. What's the problem?</p><p> She calls out Google for allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It's not obvious that Google actually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to improve Google's searches, or is qualified to even try.</p><p> Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of consumers, who are the ones who made the tech companies so large.</p><p> Why does Google provide for free a tool without which it's impossible to imagine contemporary life? Because it can monetize it with advertising. Without the advertising, which Warren insists should be a separate business, Google has no incentive to devote engineers to improving its search engine.</p><p> By the same token, no one will welcome iPhones that no longer come with or sell Apple apps. And would people really appreciate having to go to two different Amazons, one just a platform, one selling Amazon products?</p><p> This is all silly, as are the mergers that Warren pledges to reverse, including Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon doesn't have anything close to a monopoly in food retail. Rather than taking over the sector, it's spurring investment and innovation. The nation's largest supermarket chain, Kroger, was slated to increase its spending on investment 200 percent in 2018.</p><p> The tech giants aren't stand-pat companies. Amazon alone spent more than $22 billion on investment in 2017. The development of autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and voice recognition wouldn't be nearly as advanced if it weren't for the research of the tech companies. The behemoth of yesteryear, General Electric, isn't making these investments.</p><p> None of this is to deny genuine concerns about tech companies. They need rules for content that honor the spirit of the First Amendment, and perhaps there should be tighter regulations around privacy. But any real offenses should be addressed with fixes directed at specific conduct, rather than with a massive politically imposed reorganization.</p><p> That's a very bad idea, and if you had any doubt, watch it get a respectful hearing from both sides in Washington.</p><p> Rich Lowry can be reached via e-mail: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:comments.lowry@nationalreview.com\">comments.lowry@nationalreview.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKFL-77933c5736a16f75fbbaac58ab79e965851e9f6b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28972B6691A2C3 NWBKFL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN8-TY01-DXVP-V52T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Charlotte Sun<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Who says we all can't get along?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When the senator tweeted her (understandable) objection that Facebook had taken down her ads attacking Facebook and other tech companies, Ted Cruz agreed that the companies have too much power.</p><p> Tech is caught in a right-left pincer. Conservatives don't like these companies because they are owned and operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals subject to the worst sort of groupthink. Progressives don't like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.</p><p> That's why there is some chance Washington might get together and, along the lines Warren proposes, effectively outlaw the business models of some of the most successful and iconic American companies.</p><p> Warren's idea to cleave off the platforms of the tech companies and have them run as \"platform utilities\" separate from the rest of their business is unworkable and is justified by a series of errors and misjudgments.</p><p> It's not true, as Warren asserts, that the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s opened up the space for Google and Facebook to thrive. Microsoft never got the internet and left the space open for Google and Facebook all by itself, as often happens with a large incumbent wedded to its business model.</p><p> She charges that the tech companies use mergers to limit competition and cites Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp. It's hard to discern the harm here. When the social network bought it, WhatsApp was available for a fee. Now it's free, and more people use it than ever. What's the problem?</p><p> She calls out Google for allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It's not obvious that Google actually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to improve Google's searches, or is qualified to even try.</p><p> Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of consumers, who are the ones who made the tech companies so large.</p><p> Why does Google provide for free a tool without which it's impossible to imagine contemporary life? Because it can monetize it with advertising. Without the advertising, which Warren insists should be a separate business, Google has no incentive to devote engineers to improving its search engine.</p><p> By the same token, no one will welcome iPhones that no longer come with or sell Apple apps. And would people really appreciate having to go to two different Amazons, one just a platform, one selling Amazon products?</p><p> This is all silly, as are the mergers that Warren pledges to reverse, including Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon doesn't have anything close to a monopoly in food retail. Rather than taking over the sector, it's spurring investment and innovation. The nation's largest supermarket chain, Kroger, was slated to increase its spending on investment 200 percent in 2018.</p><p> The tech giants aren't stand-pat companies. Amazon alone spent more than $22 billion on investment in 2017. The development of autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and voice recognition wouldn't be nearly as advanced if it weren't for the research of the tech companies. The behemoth of yesteryear, General Electric, isn't making these investments.</p><p> None of this is to deny genuine concerns about tech companies. They need rules for content that honor the spirit of the First Amendment, and perhaps there should be tighter regulations around privacy. But any real offenses should be addressed with fixes directed at specific conduct, rather than with a massive politically imposed reorganization.</p><p> That's a very bad idea, and if you had any doubt, watch it get a respectful hearing from both sides in Washington.</p><p> Rich Lowry can be reached via e-mail: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:comments.lowry@nationalreview.com\">comments.lowry@nationalreview.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKFL-e5c98d5a6d15ac4a9ba971ad5814872b6e1a617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28972BECBF6EA6 NWBKFL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN8-TY11-DXVP-V08N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Englewood Sun<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Luckily for small businesses in Ohio and across the country, the Ohio Senate Judiciary Committee took an important step in avoiding that pitfall by inviting me to testify on behalf of small business at last week's antitrust hearing. I hope this is the first of many discussions that take the views and concerns of small businesses into effect when it comes to investigating and regulating the digital economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital technology, digital platforms and digital tools are helping small businesses start, grow and succeed in previously unimaginable ways  not only locally but way beyond traditional geographic limitations. Digital advertising and online marketing help small Ohio companies find new customers globally and cost-efficiently. Data helps small Ohio businesses serve more customers at a lower cost. The digital cloud helps small Ohio businesses reduce paperwork, reduce their environmental footprint and go on vacation while still being available to colleagues and customers.</p><p> Digital marketplaces help Ohio small businesses sell more products locally and globally.</p><p> There are many more digital platforms beyond the \"Big Four\"  Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. QuickBooks supports home-based entrepreneurs and small businesses. John Deere's Precision Agriculture solutions work wonders for small farmers. Pinterest and Houzz support and promote home decoration and renovation products, designers and contractors. These companies collect, aggregate and analyze vast quantities of data safely, securely and affordably and deliver the power of data science to small businesses that could not do this or afford this in virtually any other way.</p><p> It is indisputable that large digital platforms, services and marketplaces provide small businesses with affordable, scalable and secure business solutions. What is not equally understood is that these solutions are affordable, scalable and secure because of the platforms' relative size. It is because of their size and scale that platforms have the capital to invest and the flexibility to price so that small businesses have a pathway to viability, growth and success.</p><p> Without the large platforms, these services would not exist or would not be affordable.</p><p> We are living in an extraordinary era for entrepreneurs and small businesses. But if the large digital platforms are broken up and each business unit would need to be individually profitable or pay the other business units for data or data solutions, there would be significantly fewer free or low-cost tools and services available to small businesses. Prices would increase and effectiveness would diminish. That would reduce small business formation, undermine small business innovation and hurt families in Ohio and nationwide.</p><p> Also, the large digital companies compete aggressively against each other. Some small businesses prefer to advertise with Facebook and Instagram, others think Google is a better ad partner, and still others focus on Amazon or Pinterest. Moreover, new competitors are entering the market every day and driving innovation. Each of the platforms is investing in new and better small business offerings and small businesses and their hometowns benefit.</p><p> The reality of the digital economy is that nearly 30 million small businesses stand on the shoulders of large companies to reach otherwise unattainable heights. The challenge of every small business is unique but their stories are universal. Unleashing the potential of American small business now requires access to affordable, secure and scalable broadband and digital tools.</p><p> It also requires policymakers to understand that the digital economy is interconnected and interdependent, where the investment of global platforms have direct, tangible local benefits and the value of access to digital tools is measured in new employees and increased financial security.</p><p> The Ohio Judiciary Committee and attorney general, federal policymakers and competition regulators simply cannot overlook this.</p><p> Jake Ward is president of the Connected Commerce Council (3C), a small business membership organization that promotes access to essential digital technologies and tools.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOH-86da8db36f8a85a81ab7223e76958a3388a8b435</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28DA62CA23D187 NWBKOH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFY-KC11-DXVP-V4GX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GateHouse Media LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It has become a central focus of Warren's campaign, which has caused business leaders like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to voice concern, and the fight over big tech within the Democratic Party presidential primaries has bled into the courts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In all of this, Andrew Yang has emerged as a reasoned voice against breaking up these companies. In a recent op-ed, he noted that \"Breaking up Facebook or Apple sounds good, but it wouldn't address this issue.\" His alternative, however, is not a practical solution either. Instead of breaking tech companies up, Yang proposes a Department of the Attention Economy that will implement regulations that curb what he sees as \"the negative effects of smartphones and social media.\"</p><p> Both the history and current reality of the Internet suggest that Yang's proposal has little chance of alleviating the addictive qualities or mental health effects that he says social media and big tech are having on Americans, young people in particular. It might only serve to make things worse.</p><p> We don't have to guess what a regulated internet will look like. For most of its history, in fact, the Internet was a tightly controlled platform called the ARPAnet, which served as the academic research network that preceded today's Internet. It was a platform in which norms and behavior were dictated to users by the federal government. Here is an excerpt of MIT's 1982 guide for new users of ARPAnet explained how it should be used:</p><p> \"It is considered illegal to use the ARPAnet for anything which is not in direct support of Government business. At the Al lab, we use the network to talk to other researchers about all kinds of things. For example, personal messages to other ARPAnet subscribers (for example, to arrange a get-together or check and say a friendly hello) are generally not considered harmful. This is one of the ways in which we adapt the network environment to our community. It is very clear that without that sort of freedom, the network could not have evolved to its current point of technical and social sophistication.</p><p> \"Sending electronic mail over the ARPAnet for commercial profit or political purposes is both antisocial and illegal. By sending such messages, you can offend many people, and it is possible to get MIT in serious trouble with the Government agencies which manage the ARPAnet.\"</p><p> You see, as a platform tightly controlled by the federal government, ARPAnet was regulated in an effort to stave off the perceived negative or \"antisocial\" effects of the commercial or political use of the platform. And while some are now arguing today that perhaps those same standards should be reinstated (just look at Twitter's ban of political advertising), it is hard to argue that the ARPAnet as conceived in 1982 would have changed the world in the way that the successive version of the commercial internet has.</p><p> But many, including Yang and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), argue in favor of heavily and specifically regulating social media in the name of curbing \"social media addiction.\" And while we still have much to learn about whether or not this \"addiction\" is a serious problem, it ignores why people use the Internet, to begin with. Yang's effort to create a federal agency focused on \"curbing design features that maximize screen time\" and discourage \"Design features that encourage social validation\" assumes that people are merely tricked and manipulated into using today's most popular Internet platforms. The data, however, suggests that it is not true at all.</p><p> Why do people seem so \"addicted\" to the Internet? It may be passion, not addiction, driving users. A recent survey of Internet users found that approximately 80 million - 38.15% - of U.S. adults use the Internet to pursue hobbies and passion projects. And out of those 80 million, nearly 35% of them say that the internet is essential to that pursuit. This means that there are just short of 30 million Americans that can only pursue their passion projects with the Internet. Looking back at the limited acceptable applications of the Internet of the early 80s, it is hard to explain why taking us back in time will make millions of Americans better off.</p><p> Putting a federal agency in a position to determine acceptable and unacceptable behavior on the internet should not be a thought experiment played out by presidential hopefuls. Instead, we should look at the history of the internet in order to understand more clearly what that world would really be like. And while \"big tech\" has become the target of frustration and focus of the Democratic primaries, taking us back 30 years will only serve to undermine the greatest platform we have today, to connect millions of Americans with their passions and help them find more meaning in their lives.</p><p> Christopher Koopman is the executive director of the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University.</p><p> ---</p><p> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p> -----</p><p> PHOTO (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194):</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKHI-9376084</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899058A9546F3 NWBKHI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPB-W791-JBCN-429X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409134</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 West Hawaii Today.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren, a presidential hopeful, announced Friday she wants to bust up giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America's first Gilded Age began in the late 19th century with a raft of innovations \u2014 railroads, steel production, oil extraction \u2014 but culminated in mammoth trusts run by \"robber barons\" such as J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller and William H. (\"The public be damned!\") Vanderbilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The answer then was to bust up the railroad, oil and steel monopolies.</p><p> We're now in a second Gilded Age \u2014 ushered in by semiconductors, software and the internet \u2014 that has spawned a handful of high-tech behemoths and a new set of barons such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page.</p><p> The answer now is the same: Bust up the monopolies.</p><p> The current effort is bipartisan. At a Senate hearing I testified at last week, arch-conservative Missouri Republican Josh Hawley asked me, rhetorically, \"Is there really any wonder that there is increased pressure for antitrust enforcement activity, for privacy activity when these companies behave in the way that they do?\"</p><p> Hawley added, \"Every day brings some creepy new revelation about these companies' behaviors. Of course the public is going to want there to be action to defend their rights. It's only natural.\"</p><p> Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches now go through Google. Facebook and Google together account for 58 percent of all digital ads (where most ad money goes these days).</p><p> They're also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 percent of Americans receive news online). Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything.</p><p> With such size comes the power to stifle innovation. Amazon won't let any business that sells through it sell any item at a lower price anywhere else. It's even using its control over book sales to give books published by Amazon priority over rival publishers.</p><p>Google uses the world's most widely used search engine to promote its own services and content over those of competitors. Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram killed off two potential rivals.</p><p> Contrary to the conventional view of America as a hotbed of entrepreneurship, the rate at which new job-creating businesses have formed in the United States has been halved since 2004, according to the Census Bureau.</p><p> Such size also confers political power to get whatever these companies and their top executives want.</p><p>Amazon, the richest corporation in America, paid nothing in federal taxes last year. Meanwhile, it's holding an auction to extort billions from states and cities eager to have its second headquarters.</p><p> It also forced Seattle, its home headquarters, to back down on a plan to tax big corporations like itself to pay for homeless shelters for a growing population that can't afford the sky-high rents caused in part by Amazon.</p><p>Facebook withheld evidence of Russian activity on its platform far longer than previously disclosed. When the news came to light, the company employed a political opposition research firm to discredit critics.</p><p> Zuckerberg, who holds the world speed record for falling from one of the most admired figures on the planet to one of the most reviled, just unveiled a plan to \"encrypt\" personal information from all his platforms. The new plan is likely to give Facebook even more comprehensive data about everyone. If you believe it will better guard privacy, you don't remember Zuckerberg's last seven promises to protect privacy.</p><p> The New America Foundation, an influential think tank Google helped fund, fired researchers who were urging antitrust officials to take on the company. And Google has been quietly financing hundreds of professors to write research papers justifying Google's market dominance.</p><p> What to do? Some argue that the tech mammoths should be regulated like utilities or common carriers, but this would put government in the impossible position of policing content and overseeing new products and services.</p><p> A better alternative is to break them up. That way, information would be distributed through a large number of independent channels without a centralized platform giving all content apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach. And more startups could flourish.</p><p> Like the robber barons of the first Gilded Age, those of the second have amassed fortunes that gave them unparalleled influence over politicians and the economy.</p><p> The combined wealth of Zuckerberg ($62.3 billion), Bezos ($131 billion), Brin ($49.8 billion) and Page ($50.8 billion) is larger than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the American population.</p><p> A wealth tax (also proposed by Warren) would help.</p><p> Some of the robber barons of the first Gilded Age were generous philanthropists, as are today's. That didn't excuse the damage they did to America.</p><p> Monopolies aren't good for anyone except for the monopolists.

Elizabeth Warren, a presidential hopeful, announced Friday she wants to bust up giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America's first Gilded Age began in the late 19th century with a raft of innovations \u2014 railroads, steel production, oil extraction \u2014 but culminated in mammoth trusts run by \"robber barons\" such as J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller and William H. (\"The public be damned!\") Vanderbilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The answer then was to bust up the railroad, oil and steel monopolies.</p><p> We're now in a second Gilded Age \u2014 ushered in by semiconductors, software and the internet \u2014 that has spawned a handful of high-tech behemoths and a new set of barons such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page.</p><p> The answer now is the same: Bust up the monopolies.</p><p> The current effort is bipartisan. At a Senate hearing I testified at last week, arch-conservative Missouri Republican Josh Hawley asked me, rhetorically, \"Is there really any wonder that there is increased pressure for antitrust enforcement activity, for privacy activity when these companies behave in the way that they do?\"</p><p> Hawley added, \"Every day brings some creepy new revelation about these companies' behaviors. Of course the public is going to want there to be action to defend their rights. It's only natural.\"</p><p> Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches now go through Google. Facebook and Google together account for 58 percent of all digital ads (where most ad money goes these days).</p><p> They're also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 percent of Americans receive news online). Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything.</p><p> With such size comes the power to stifle innovation. Amazon won't let any business that sells through it sell any item at a lower price anywhere else. It's even using its control over book sales to give books published by Amazon priority over rival publishers.</p><p>Google uses the world's most widely used search engine to promote its own services and content over those of competitors. Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram killed off two potential rivals.</p><p> Contrary to the conventional view of America as a hotbed of entrepreneurship, the rate at which new job-creating businesses have formed in the United States has been halved since 2004, according to the Census Bureau.</p><p> Such size also confers political power to get whatever these companies and their top executives want.</p><p>Amazon, the richest corporation in America, paid nothing in federal taxes last year. Meanwhile, it's holding an auction to extort billions from states and cities eager to have its second headquarters.</p><p> It also forced Seattle, its home headquarters, to back down on a plan to tax big corporations like itself to pay for homeless shelters for a growing population that can't afford the sky-high rents caused in part by Amazon.</p><p>Facebook withheld evidence of Russian activity on its platform far longer than previously disclosed. When the news came to light, the company employed a political opposition research firm to discredit critics.</p><p> Zuckerberg, who holds the world speed record for falling from one of the most admired figures on the planet to one of the most reviled, just unveiled a plan to \"encrypt\" personal information from all his platforms. The new plan is likely to give Facebook even more comprehensive data about everyone. If you believe it will better guard privacy, you don't remember Zuckerberg's last seven promises to protect privacy.</p><p> The New America Foundation, an influential think tank Google helped fund, fired researchers who were urging antitrust officials to take on the company. And Google has been quietly financing hundreds of professors to write research papers justifying Google's market dominance.</p><p> What to do? Some argue that the tech mammoths should be regulated like utilities or common carriers, but this would put government in the impossible position of policing content and overseeing new products and services.</p><p> A better alternative is to break them up. That way, information would be distributed through a large number of independent channels without a centralized platform giving all content apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach. And more startups could flourish.</p><p> Like the robber barons of the first Gilded Age, those of the second have amassed fortunes that gave them unparalleled influence over politicians and the economy.</p><p> The combined wealth of Zuckerberg ($62.3 billion), Bezos ($131 billion), Brin ($49.8 billion) and Page ($50.8 billion) is larger than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the American population.</p><p> A wealth tax (also proposed by Warren) would help.</p><p> Some of the robber barons of the first Gilded Age were generous philanthropists, as are today's. That didn't excuse the damage they did to America.</p><p> Monopolies aren't good for anyone except for the monopolists. In this new Gilded Age, we need to respond to them as forcefully as we did the first time around. Warren's ideas are a good start.</p><p> Robert Reich's latest book is \"The Common Good,\" and his newest documentary is \"Saving Capitalism.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKFL-bb3eb2552b254dfbac3761b3568ad6eeaa8a36aa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28972BECBF6EA6 NWBKFL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMV-XDP1-DXVP-V3VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"856\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Englewood Sun<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren, a presidential hopeful, announced Friday she wants to bust up giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America's first Gilded Age began in the late 19th century with a raft of innovations \u2014 railroads, steel production, oil extraction \u2014 but culminated in mammoth trusts run by \"robber barons\" such as J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller and William H. (\"The public be damned!\") Vanderbilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The answer then was to bust up the railroad, oil and steel monopolies.</p><p> We're now in a second Gilded Age \u2014 ushered in by semiconductors, software and the internet \u2014 that has spawned a handful of high-tech behemoths and a new set of barons such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page.</p><p> The answer now is the same: Bust up the monopolies.</p><p> The current effort is bipartisan. At a Senate hearing I testified at last week, arch-conservative Missouri Republican Josh Hawley asked me, rhetorically, \"Is there really any wonder that there is increased pressure for antitrust enforcement activity, for privacy activity when these companies behave in the way that they do?\"</p><p> Hawley added, \"Every day brings some creepy new revelation about these companies' behaviors. Of course the public is going to want there to be action to defend their rights. It's only natural.\"</p><p> Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches now go through Google. Facebook and Google together account for 58 percent of all digital ads (where most ad money goes these days).</p><p> They're also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 percent of Americans receive news online). Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything.</p><p> With such size comes the power to stifle innovation. Amazon won't let any business that sells through it sell any item at a lower price anywhere else. It's even using its control over book sales to give books published by Amazon priority over rival publishers.</p><p>Google uses the world's most widely used search engine to promote its own services and content over those of competitors. Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram killed off two potential rivals.</p><p> Contrary to the conventional view of America as a hotbed of entrepreneurship, the rate at which new job-creating businesses have formed in the United States has been halved since 2004, according to the Census Bureau.</p><p> Such size also confers political power to get whatever these companies and their top executives want.</p><p>Amazon, the richest corporation in America, paid nothing in federal taxes last year. Meanwhile, it's holding an auction to extort billions from states and cities eager to have its second headquarters.</p><p> It also forced Seattle, its home headquarters, to back down on a plan to tax big corporations like itself to pay for homeless shelters for a growing population that can't afford the sky-high rents caused in part by Amazon.</p><p>Facebook withheld evidence of Russian activity on its platform far longer than previously disclosed. When the news came to light, the company employed a political opposition research firm to discredit critics.</p><p> Zuckerberg, who holds the world speed record for falling from one of the most admired figures on the planet to one of the most reviled, just unveiled a plan to \"encrypt\" personal information from all his platforms. The new plan is likely to give Facebook even more comprehensive data about everyone. If you believe it will better guard privacy, you don't remember Zuckerberg's last seven promises to protect privacy.</p><p> The New America Foundation, an influential think tank Google helped fund, fired researchers who were urging antitrust officials to take on the company. And Google has been quietly financing hundreds of professors to write research papers justifying Google's market dominance.</p><p> What to do? Some argue that the tech mammoths should be regulated like utilities or common carriers, but this would put government in the impossible position of policing content and overseeing new products and services.</p><p> A better alternative is to break them up. That way, information would be distributed through a large number of independent channels without a centralized platform giving all content apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach. And more startups could flourish.</p><p> Like the robber barons of the first Gilded Age, those of the second have amassed fortunes that gave them unparalleled influence over politicians and the economy.</p><p> The combined wealth of Zuckerberg ($62.3 billion), Bezos ($131 billion), Brin ($49.8 billion) and Page ($50.8 billion) is larger than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the American population.</p><p> A wealth tax (also proposed by Warren) would help.</p><p> Some of the robber barons of the first Gilded Age were generous philanthropists, as are today's. That didn't excuse the damage they did to America.</p><p> Monopolies aren't good for anyone except for the monopolists. In this new Gilded Age, we need to respond to them as forcefully as we did the first time around. Warren's ideas are a good start.</p><p> Robert Reich's latest book is \"The Common Good,\" and his newest documentary is \"Saving Capitalism.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKFL-233aebfcb3c3a4d430f1e19787502aeafcca5277</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28972C2FD9E2A9 NWBKFL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMV-XDR1-DXVP-V1R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"856\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 North Port Sun<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

After another 10% surge in t...</p><p>LONDON (Reuters) - Having already brushed aside the pandemic to recapture record highs, the expansion of the high-flying technology sector as a share of overall investment indices is prompting some concerns about over-exposure.   After another 10% surge in the six weeks through mid-July, broader tech stock indices are ending the month in a more down-to-earth mood as angst about an overshoot emerges ahead of a big earnings week for the sector.   Wall Street\u2019s tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has added more than 4% this month. But that\u2019s less in dollar terms than global stock aggregates - Germany\u2019s DAX, Shanghai and even broad emerging markets indices.   To be sure, the accelerating dollar slide tilted that ranking. And New York\u2019s FANG+TM index - including the vanguard FAANGs of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet alongside Tesla, Twitter, Nvidia, Baidu and Alibaba - still beat the lot with an 11% July jump amid Tesla\u2019s latest outsize 40% boom.   But a combination of the dramatic bounce since March - which has seen the Nasdaq climb more than 50% and FANG+TM gain more than 70%, and discomfort about valuation multiples of some firms to 20-30% above 3-year averages, has seen some investor angst about bubbles resurface.   Comparisons with the dotcom boom and bust around the turn of the millennium are back up for discussion.   JPMorgan\u2019s head of cross-asset strategy John Normand flagged what he called \u201cconcentration risk\u201d due to the sheer size the sector would now occupy in mainstream portfolios.   The worry, he explained, is any sector-specific shock gets amplified far beyond tech, not least because investor positioning is so skewed to the losses even in the event of stock market rotations from one area to another.   JPMorgan\u2019s conclusion is that the picture is not yet clear-cut to warrant systemic fears just yet.   Although the S&amp;P 500\u2019s tech sector accounts for a whopping 25% of the overall index value - as high as any other sector has ever commanded - Normand pointed out it was still 10 points below the 35% peak hit at the height of the dotcom era.   Different slices throw up different metrics, however.   What he called \u201cBig Tech\u201d - grouping tech and communications services alongside Amazon from the \u201cconsumer discretionary\u201d sector - would account for about 40% of the S&amp;P 500 and exceed the pre-bust period of the late 1990s.   On the other hand, concentration in credit markets is more modest. The tech and telecom sectors comprise less than 10% each in investment grade and high-yield indices, according to JPM.   Normand doubts the economic, political or incoming earnings pictures contains a trigger for a major tech reversal yet. Even if Democrat Joe Biden wins the U.S. presidency in November, the sorts of regulatory or tax hits on the sector advocated by more left-wing Democrats seem unlikely.   And the long-term growth story and digital transformation theme sees beyond most other temporary pullbacks.   \u201cThe risks from extreme positioning in Tech/Quality stocks have always been present ... but an intra-month technical adjustment rarely builds on itself absent a succession of fundamental and policy catalysts,\u201d he told clients, characterising any correction as \u201cmore tactical than strategic\u201d.   Dubbed in 2016 by World Economic Forum chair Klaus Schwab as the \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution\u201d - new technologies fusing physical, digital and biological worlds that impact all industries and economies - investment in related stocks has been largely driven by this kind of long-term vision rather than cyclical ebbs and flows.   Since the start or the last bull market in 2009, the combined market cap of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon alone has risen 17 times, from $326 billion to $5.77 trillion.   And yet periodic overshoots do happen, and some see parts of the overall tech complex ripe for a cooling.   One of the most bullish U.S. equities houses, Morgan Stanley, this week cut its recommendation on software stocks.   Morgan Stanley strategists reckoned enterprise value-to-sales in excess of 10 times \u201cevokes memories of the tech (dotcom) bubble and limits the upside case, especially as rate of change on relative tailwinds may be turning\u201d.   The move was hardly a major warning, preferring to temper historically high valuations with obvious difficulties in keeping pandemic-related IT spending surges going for the full year in such a shocking overall global economy.   Morgan Stanley didn\u2019t see a repeat of 2000\u2019s dotcom bust.   But it displayed rare caution about a sector that has seemed to throw it to the wind this year.   The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

By LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - Having already brushed aside the pandemic to recapture record highs, the expansion of the high-flying technology sector as a share of overall investment indices is prompting some concerns about over-exposure.   After another 10% surge in the six weeks through mid-July, broader tech stock indices are ending the month in a more down-to-earth mood as angst about an overshoot emerges ahead of a big earnings week for the sector.   Wall Street\u2019s tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has added more than 4% this month. But that\u2019s less in dollar terms than global stock aggregates - Germany\u2019s DAX, Shanghai and even broad emerging markets indices.   To be sure, the accelerating dollar slide tilted that ranking. And New York\u2019s FANG+TM index - including the vanguard FAANGs of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet alongside Tesla, Twitter, Nvidia, Baidu and Alibaba - still beat the lot with an 11% July jump amid Tesla\u2019s latest outsize 40% boom.   But a combination of the dramatic bounce since March - which has seen the Nasdaq climb more than 50% and FANG+TM gain more than 70%, and discomfort about valuation multiples of some firms to 20-30% above 3-year averages, has seen some investor angst about bubbles resurface.   Comparisons with the dotcom boom and bust around the turn of the millennium are back up for discussion.   JPMorgan\u2019s head of cross-asset strategy John Normand flagged what he called \u201cconcentration risk\u201d due to the sheer size the sector would now occupy in mainstream portfolios.   The worry, he explained, is any sector-specific shock gets amplified far beyond tech, not least because investor positioning is so skewed to the losses even in the event of stock market rotations from one area to another.   JPMorgan\u2019s conclusion is that the picture is not yet clear-cut to warrant systemic fears just yet.   Although the S&amp;P 500\u2019s tech sector accounts for a whopping 25% of the overall index value - as high as any other sector has ever commanded - Normand pointed out it was still 10 points below the 35% peak hit at the height of the dotcom era.   Different slices throw up different metrics, however.   What he called \u201cBig Tech\u201d - grouping tech and communications services alongside Amazon from the \u201cconsumer discretionary\u201d sector - would account for about 40% of the S&amp;P 500 and exceed the pre-bust period of the late 1990s.   On the other hand, concentration in credit markets is more modest. The tech and telecom sectors comprise less than 10% each in investment grade and high-yield indices, according to JPM.   Normand doubts the economic, political or incoming earnings pictures contains a trigger for a major tech reversal yet. Even if Democrat Joe Biden wins the U.S. presidency in November, the sorts of regulatory or tax hits on the sector advocated by more left-wing Democrats seem unlikely.   And the long-term growth story and digital transformation theme sees beyond most other temporary pullbacks.   \u201cThe risks from extreme positioning in Tech/Quality stocks have always been present ... but an intra-month technical adjustment rarely builds on itself absent a succession of fundamental and policy catalysts,\u201d he told clients, characterising any correction as \u201cmore tactical than strategic\u201d.   Dubbed in 2016 by World Economic Forum chair Klaus Schwab as the \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution\u201d - new technologies fusing physical, digital and biological worlds that impact all industries and economies - investment in related stocks has been largely driven by this kind of long-term vision rather than cyclical ebbs and flows.   Since the start or the last bull market in 2009, the combined market cap of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon alone has risen 17 times, from $326 billion to $5.77 trillion.   And yet periodic overshoots do happen, and some see parts of the overall tech complex ripe for a cooling.   One of the most bullish U.S. equities houses, Morgan Stanley, this week cut its recommendation on software stocks.   Morgan Stanley strategists reckoned enterprise value-to-sales in excess of 10 times \u201cevokes memories of the tech (dotcom) bubble and limits the upside case, especially as rate of change on relative tailwinds may be turning\u201d.   The move was hardly a major warning, preferring to temper historically high valuations with obvious difficulties in keeping pandemic-related IT spending surges going for the full year in such a shocking overall global economy.   Morgan Stanley didn\u2019t see a repeat of 2000\u2019s dotcom bust.   But it displayed rare caution about a sector that has seemed to throw it to the wind this year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Some laws exempt small businesses, but most laws apply to businesses of all sizes. When things happen to big businesses, the media cover it, but often ignore how these same laws affect smaller businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's look at some 2019 trends that happened to big businesses that have implications for all businesses.</p><p>Rise of the gig economy</p><p>Businesses of all sizes and industries have been outsourcing more work to independent contractors and hiring fewer employees. The primary drivers behind this trend are that businesses pay lower payroll taxes and have fewer regulations for independent contractors.</p><p>Liability risks are also lower, because businesses have fewer duties to closely supervise independent contractors. Indeed, one of the primary distinctions between contractors and employees has been the greater freedom contractors have to perform their services.</p><p>Companies such as Uber have led the way in relying almost totally on contractors. Chances are that even daily Uber users have never met actual Uber employees. Companies such as Uber designed themselves to supply technology to contractors and customers rather than being in the transportation business. The old employee definitions did not cover technology suppliers.</p><p>Government doesn't like lower taxes, fewer regulations and liabilities. California and New Jersey are leading the way is changing the definition of who is an employee and who is a contractor. Other states are following.</p><p>What happens if states apply these rules to all technology suppliers?\u00a0</p><p>Interstate migration</p><p>President Donald Trump moved his official residence from New York to Florida. Anything related to Trump draws headlines, but interstate migration is a major trend for businesses and their owners.</p><p>More businesses and their owners are asking: Can I afford to stay in my state? At the same time, technology is enabling businesses to operate from almost any location. So it's much easier to change location than in the past.</p><p>America has always been a land where people were on the move. In the past, however, migrating was primarily something poor people did. Several factors are making migration an upper-class activity.</p><p>States are dividing into two groups: high tax and high regulation vs. lower tax and lower regulation. The differences between the states have rarely been greater than they are now.</p><p>Plus, federal tax laws now limit how much state tax people can deduct from their federal income taxes.</p><p>Lower levels of federal regulation are making state regulation a bigger factor when businesses decide on a location.</p><p>Privacy and big data</p><p>California and other states are beginning to regulate how businesses collect and use the data of their customers.</p><p>The initial focus of privacy laws is on big tech, such as Facebook, but history teaches us that big companies simply hire staff to comply, while smaller companies are caught in compliance traps that stifle their growth.</p><p>Effects of trends</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Investors and buyers are making employment and privacy compliance major parts of their due diligence process.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Business owners are changing their residence before they sell their businesses.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Take these factors into account before you plan to raise capital or buy or sell a business.</p><p>Jim Verdonik is a founder of Innovate Capital Law (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.innovatecapitallaw.com\">www.innovatecapitallaw.com</url>), which provides advice on capital raising transactions using a tool box of new legal strategies.

'Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!'He said those things on Twitter, where he has more than 80 million readers. Advertisement House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who's rarely in league with Trump, agreed with him that the internet giants are a problem.'Facebook, all of them, they're all about making money,' she complained on Thursday. </p><p>'Their business model is to make money at the expense of the truth.'If there's a bipartisan consensus on anything in Washington, it's that someone ought to take big tech down a notch. Advertisement  The result may be the biggest political crisis the internet companies have faced since their creation   and it's mostly their own fault.The most likely outcome, no matter how the November election turns out, is that Congress will repeal the 1996 law that protects the platforms from liability for almost anything their users post.Removing that law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, could throw their business model into chaos and make it difficult for Twitter and Facebook to survive.Trump and the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, have both said the provision should be repealed   although for different reasons. Advertisement  Republicans claim Twitter and the other platforms are deliberately targeting conservatives and unfairly applying rules against hate speech, incitement and harassment.Democrats have the opposite complaint: They charge that the platforms don't enforce the rules often enough. They complain that Trump and others have been allowed to get away with flagrant falsehoods and calumnies   which is true.Last week's crisis focused on Twitter, which enforced its internal rules on Trump for the first time.First the company attached warnings[1], labeled 'get the facts,' to two presidential tweets that had called mail-in ballots 'fraudulent' and predicted a 'rigged election' in November. Advertisement  Then Twitter added an anti-violence[2] warning to a Trump tweet about riot-torn Minneapolis. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' he wrote. Trump and his allies said those disclaimers amounted to censorship. They didn't. Twitter still published all the president's words; now his readers will see the warnings as well.Until recently, Facebook was also a target of conservative complaints because it sometimes enforced standards against right-wing extremists. But last week, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said he no longer thinks the company should try to be 'arbiters of truth.'Politicians' resentment against the increasingly powerful platforms has been building for a long time. Advertisement  When Section 230 passed in 1996, it was intended to shield fragile startup companies when the internet was young. In the ensuing 24 years, the social media firms have become big and wealthy; it's no longer clear that they need protection.The law not only shielded the companies from liability; it empowered them to restrict access to material that is 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.'That clause granted the platforms almost unlimited control over content. They developed rules and procedures for applying them in-house, with little or no visibility to anyone outside.Twitter's standards[3], for example, list multiple categories of prohibited content, including child exploitation, targeted harassment, hateful conduct, encouraging suicide, nonconsensual nudity, posting other people's private information, manipulated media, promoting terrorism, threats or glorification of violence, and 'manipulating or interfering in elections.'  Advertisement  The company ruled that Trump's tweets last week violated the last two rules.The problem is it's not clear how the rules are applied, who applies them and how to get redress if you think you've been treated unfairly.'It's easier to get information out of the [National Security Agency] than one of these big tech companies,' said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor and author of 'The Twenty-Six Words that Created the Internet,' a book about Section 230.In Trump's case, the company bungled the process. Its actions against the president seemed to come out of nowhere, with little warning or explanation. Advertisement  Did Trump's claim, five months in advance, of a 'rigged election' really constitute manipulation or interference?And it seemed odd that while the president was tagged for falsely claiming that mail-in ballots produce fraud, he was not for repeatedly suggesting that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough had murdered a staff aide in 2001. (Authorities say there is no basis for Trump's allegation; Scarborough was 800 miles away when the woman died.)Trump's response to Twitter's actions was a colorfully worded executive order[4] that threatened to sic two regulatory agencies on the tech company. It asked the Federal Communications Commission to draft new rules to make social media companies liable for more content, and asked the Federal Trade Commission to examine whether the companies are enforcing their standards fairly.The president's order appeared mostly symbolic, tailored for an election year. The FCC routinely takes months or years to draft new regulations, even on simple issues, and the president's order was almost certain to be challenged in court. Advertisement  In the longer run, though, Section 230 remains vulnerable in Congress   if only because both Trump and Biden say they want to see it repealed.What happens then?Theoretically, eliminating the law could prompt social media platforms to crack down on more content to eliminate anything that could lead to a lawsuit. That could make Trump vulnerable to even more pesky warning labels.But repeal could also perversely lead to the elimination of almost all standards   because if there are no rules, the platforms can argue that they aren't responsible for enforcing any. Advertisement  And that could produce an internet where pornography and extremist political content, both protected by the 1st Amendment, flood into platforms that were intended to be family friendly.There was a more sensible solution available. The companies could have reformed their standards and practices, made them far more transparent and allowed the public to see how they were implemented.But it may be too late for that kind of self-improvement. The companies moved too slowly. They resisted letting anyone see inside.As a result, a law that was a foundation of their business is now in danger of repeal. That's not all Trump's fault. It's their fault too.

They point to evidence that Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube are staffed disproportionately by liberals, a fact that nobody seriously denies. In a fascinating essay for the New Atlantis, Adam White argues that there is a deep alignment between their corporate culture and the assumptions of modern liberalism.</p><p>A nearly inevitable result, conservatives say, is that the companies are more likely to try to suppress conservative content as offensive: taking down tweets and posts from righties and directing traffic elsewhere. The companies deny they have displayed bias, even as admit they have made occasional mistakes in content moderation.</p><p> One school of conservatives argues that while the tech titans' decisions may be wrong and worthy of condemnation, it is not government's business to regulate their decisions because they are private companies.</p><p> According to this reasoning, people who are unhappy with Facebook's policies should condemn or boycott it. They should cajole Twitter into adopting better policies. (One suggestion has been that Twitter act toward its users the same way the First Amendment makes the government act toward citizens.)</p><p> Or they should try to start a rival site.</p><p> What these conservatives don't want is for government to force the companies to behave differently, beyond holding them to their own terms of service.</p><p> Another group on the right thinks that the hands-off approach is dogma unsuited to the world we actually inhabit. The social-media companies are too large a part of our society, and host too much of our political debate, for the government to leave them alone.</p><p> A leading voice for this second group is Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. His criticisms of social-media companies are wide-ranging. He has gone so far as to question whether the talent they employ would be doing more good in other parts of the economy.</p><p> Political bias is among his main concerns. \"Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves,\" he has said. \"They should not be able to discriminate against conservatives. They should not be able to tell conservatives to sit down and shut up.\"</p><p> Soon after his election in 2018, Hawley argued that the big tech companies are benefiting from a government-granted privilege. He observed -- on Twitter, naturally -- that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives these companies immunity from liability for content that appears on their sites.</p><p> They get this immunity, he suggested, on the condition that they serve as forums for \"a true diversity of political discourse.\" He called for congressional investigations to see if they were meeting that condition. Congress has subsequently held hearings on it.</p><p> Republican Senator Ted Cruz, questioning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, made the same point as Hawley: \"The predicate for Section 230 immunity under the CDA is that you're a neutral public forum.\"</p><p> What they're saying: Facebook can be a message board with no responsibility for the messages tacked onto it. Or it can take an active role in shaping content, in which case it assumes legal responsibility for that content.</p><p> Those who fear government regulation in this area (and not just conservatives) have pushed back against Hawley and Cruz. They point out that the law also gives the companies immunity for actions they take against obscene, harassing or otherwise objectionable material, even if that material falls under the First Amendment.</p><p> We can split the difference on the question of what the law assumes. The CDA does not require companies to be neutral about the political content of messages they host in order to have immunity. It was, in fact, written to encourage them to police obscenity, which is why it's called the Communications Decency Act.</p><p> The law was enacted in 1996, after a web service provider, Prodigy, had been found to incur liability for postings because it had tried to make itself family-friendly and deleted some material it found to be offensive. Legislators thought it was unfair and undesirable to punish a company for trying to do the right thing. But it's fair to say that back then there was a background assumption that the companies would not be tilting left or right.</p><p> So what options does the government have to deal with the perceived problem?</p><p> Perhaps we should split the difference on the policy question, too. The companies are too important to ignore, but government regulation is full of dangers.</p><p> It does not seem like too much for Congress to ask that the immunity it has provided be conditioned on some more transparency from the companies about how they decide what content to promote, hide or suppress. One possibility would be to require the companies to disclose summary information about how they make these decisions; another, perhaps easier to administer, would be to require them to publish a database of content they have deleted.</p><p> Before we decide either to regulate the tech companies or leave them alone, let's find out if the anecdotes of bias are just anecdotes, or something more.</p><p> Ramesh Ponnuru is a Bloomberg columnist.

The challenge is that existing jobs will likely erode before the new jobs emerge.</p><p>It's already the case that, in many parts of the world, the gig economy and part-time work are growing faster than full-time work. A 2018 World Economic Forum survey found that 50 per cent of major companies surveyed are expected to cut their permanent workforce, while 48 per cent are expected to hire specialist contractors instead of employees.</p><p>Key to employment will be cognitive skills - and Canada has a challenge.</p><p>While we have some of the most qualified workforces in the world, we also have 42 per cent of working Canadians with poor literacy skills - below those needed for the work that's now available, never mind the emerging work that requires much higher levels of literacy. This impairs our ability to respond to emerging technologies, and limits the adaptive capacity of firms and organizations.</p><p>The RSA framed its thinking about the future of work with these kinds of issues in mind. It suggests four possible scenarios. Each is based on the idea that the march of technology is inevitable, but that the way in which the proceeds of the new technology are distributed is a matter of choice. We can either let the technology giants continue to reap huge rewards and pay no taxes, or we can choose to do something about it.</p><p>Here are the RSA's four scenarios:</p><p>The Big Tech Economy describes a world where most technologies develop at a rapid pace, from self-driving cars to additive manufacturing. A new machine age delivers significant improvements in the quality of products and public services, while the cost of everyday goods - including transport and energy - plummets.</p><p>However, unemployment and economic insecurity creep upwards, and the spoils of growth are off-shored and concentrated in a handful of U.S. and Chinese tech behemoths.</p><p>The dizzying pace of change takes workers and unions by surprise, leaving them largely incapable of responding. Part-time and gig work grows, with most who can find workable to find little more than 20 hours a week paid, for which they are paid well.</p><p>The Precision Economy presents and develops a future of hyper surveillance. Technological progress is slow to moderate, but a proliferation of sensors allows firms to create value by capturing and analyzing more information on objects, people and the environment.</p><p>The gig economy is the norm, with social and economic behaviour carrying \"social credit points\" that lead to rewards (houses, cars, holidays) - something that's already happening in China. There are improvements in health care (based on analytics), policing and environmental management.</p><p>The Exodus Economy suggests there will be a major economic slowdown. A world recession keeps many out of work and poverty rises. Governments opt for austerity and tight social control.</p><p>Many workers lose faith in the ability of capitalism to improve their lives and start to rebel against inequality and the organization of work and wealth.</p><p>Alternative economic models become of significant interest. Co-operatives and mutual societies re-emerge in large numbers to serve people's core economic needs in food, energy and financial services. The circular economy and local living off the land become more common.</p><p>The Empathy Economy focuses on responsible stewardship of land, community and family.</p><p>Technology advances quickly, but so too does public awareness of the risks and dangers. Tech companies self-regulate to stem concerns and work hand in hand with external stakeholders to create new products that work on the basis of collective social interest. Automation takes place at a modest scale but is carefully managed in partnership with workers and unions.</p><p>Disposable income, kept aloft by high employment, flows into 'empathy sectors' like education, health and elder care, social support cultural industries and entertainment. This trend is broadly welcomed. It requires a shift in focus from meritocracy and self-focus to thinking in terms of the needs of others - of a world based on empathy and sharing, not selfishness and the accumulation of wealth.</p><p>This links to other work, such as that by Peter Frase on the four futures for society, given that both capitalism as we know it is changing quickly and that our responses to climate change will impact the way we live, work and play.</p><p>What these studies share is a simple idea: the future is not a straight line from the past. Maybe we should start to think about a different preferred future.</p><p>- Stephen Murgatroyd, PhD, is CEO of Collaborative Media Group Inc.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUDSTA-397450935SUWO</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUDSTA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y30-D1R1-DYM8-80YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438177</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sudbury Star All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sudbury Star</publicationName><edition>Web Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 11, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF ARTS MANUFACTURES &amp;

David Cicilline (D-RI). 'We need to hit the pause button.'</p><p>Zuckerberg said in March in a note shared on Facebook that changes have been implemented to provide a better, more private user experience.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of major technology companies on July 23, looking into the issue of whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.</p><p>The far-reaching review will take into account 'widespread concerns' about social media, search engines and online retail services.</p><p>'Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,' Makan Delrahim, the department's chief antitrust officer, said in a statement. </p><p>'The Department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.' </p><p>Stan Chudnovsky, Facebook's vice president who oversees messaging, has rejected that Facebook's internal moves have anything to do with squashing competing and ignoring the needs of consumers.</p><p>'Building more ways for people to communicate through our messaging apps has always been about creating benefits for people, plain and simple,'Chudnovsky said.</p><p>'People want to be able to reach as many people as they can with the messaging app they choose.'</p><p>While Facebook moves to become more fully integrated with the apps it already owns, it let at least one high profile opportunity go in December. </p><p>The company was in talks to purchase Houseparty, an app founded in 2016 by Ben Rubin which enables group video chatting on mobile phones.</p><p>Facebook called the deal off, however, because the company wanted to avoid scrutiny that might come from acquiring another dominant player in the social networking space, two people with knowledge of the confidential discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Times.</p><p>Houseparty, which was popular with users under the age of 24, went on to get bought up by Epic Games - the same company which created the wildly successful video game Fortnite. </p><p>Even with pulling out of what would have been a very lucrative deal and an effort to capture a younger audience, Facebook's moves are being looked at very closely.</p><p>In terms of more closely tying operations between Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp together, there's debate over whether it is in fact just a smart business decision, or a shrewd move to head off potential trouble from the FTC. </p><p>One former antitrust official from the Obama administration has said it could legitimately be an appropriate business decision.</p><p>Gene Kimmelman, who now serves as senior adviser to the nonprofit Washingont-based think tank Public Knowledge, said: 'For a social network with enormous growth in photos and messaging, there's probably significant business justification for combining the units.'</p><p>From Zuckerberg's perspective, Facebook faces competition at every corner so created a more streamlined way to run the properties it controls is necessary to bring the company's users a product that works well.</p><p>He has said the goal is to create a more 'private' experience where users are able to 'communicate across networks easily and securely.'</p><p>In his note shared in March, Zuckerberg wrote about the need to protect our communications from government oversight, specifically.</p><p>'On balance, I believe working towards implementing end-to-end encryption for all private communications is the right thing to do. Messages and calls are some of the most sensitive private conversations people have, and in a world of increasing cyber security threats and heavy-handed government intervention in many countries, people want us to take the extra step to secure their most private data. That seems right to me, as long as we take the time to build the appropriate safety systems that stop bad actors as much as we possibly can within the limits of an encrypted service.</p><p>'We've started working on these safety systems building on the work we've done in WhatsApp, and we'll discuss them with experts through 2019 and beyond before fully implementing end-to-end encryption. As we learn more from those experts, we'll finalize how to roll out these systems.' </p><p>The integrations Facebook has been working on for over a year now are apparently highly complex and will take years of elaborate engineering work to complete, which would imply they would be difficult to undo. </p><p>This latest call to reign in Facebook's social networking dominance comes as the company quietly started branding Instagram and WhatsApp as its property for the first time since acquiring them.</p><p>With the help of an agency called Prophet Brand Strategy, Facebook, Inc. rolled out a subtle nod to ownership that has showed up in the App stores where users can download and update the applications.</p><p>In the Apple App Store, a message from Instagram that the platform is meant for 'bringing you closer to the people and things you love' is signed off as 'Instagram from Facebook.'</p><p>Similarly, a statement on the Apple App Store from WhatsApp tells its users the app is 'Simple. Reliable. Secure.' and is attributed to 'WhatsApp from Facebook.'</p><p>The directive to turn Facebook into a 'branded house' came from Facebook's Chief Marketing Officer Antonio Lucio and Zuckerberg, himself. </p><p>Facebook told The Information, which first reported the updated branding on August 2, that the move was about transparency.</p><p>'We want to be clearer about the products and services that are part of Facebook,' the statement read.</p><p>It also doesn't hurt the numbers, when it comes to reporting Facebook's total user base.</p><p>In June of 2018 the company started tallying the total number of users across all of its platforms, including WhatsApp and Instagram, and referring to the collection as 'Facebooks' Family of apps.' </p><p>According to Facebook's most updated statistics released in 2019, more than 2.7 billion people use at least one of the company's family of services each month.' </p><p>To compare, Facebook itself averaged 1.59 billion daily active users in June.</p><p>                     Justice Department puts Big Tech under the antitrust microscope                    </p><p> By: The Associated Press</p><p>Like Europe before it, the U.S. government looks ready to try reining in its technology giants. But doing so may be more difficult than it seems.</p><p>On July 23, the U.S. Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of major technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.</p><p>It said the probe will take into account \"widespread concerns\" about social media, search engines and online retail services.</p><p>\"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\" Makan Delrahim, the department's chief antitrust officer, said in a statement. \"The Department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.\"</p><p>The terse but momentous announcement follows months of concern in Congress and elsewhere over the sway of firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon. Lawmakers and Democratic presidential candidates have called for stricter regulation or even breakups of the big tech companies , which have drawn intense scrutiny following scandals involving compromised user privacy, security lapses and misinformation and extremism that flourished on their platforms.</p><p>Facebook received a significant judgment July 24 from the Federal Trade Commission over its data privacy practices, including a $5 billion fine and new oversight and restrictions on the social network giant's business. But in their settlement with Facebook, the regulators are only holding CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally responsible in a limited fashion.</p><p>The FTC also reportedly plans to hand Google a multimillion dollar fine over its handling of children's information on YouTube. Europe has investigated and fined a number of major U.S. tech companies over the past several years.</p><p>\"It seems like the nation's law enforcement agencies are finally waking up to the threat posed by big tech,\" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which has criticized Amazon for stifling independent businesses. Mitchell testified at a House hearing last week.</p><p>President Donald Trump also has repeatedly criticized the big tech companies by name in recent months. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that they are biased against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>But Big Tech could also present a difficult target, as current interpretations of U.S. antitrust law don't obviously apply to companies offering inexpensive goods or free online services. The Justice Department did not name specific companies in its announcement.</p><p>The Justice investigation mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Its chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has sharply criticized the conduct of Silicon Valley giants and said legislative or regulatory changes may be needed. He has called breaking up the companies a last resort.</p><p>Major tech companies already facing that congressional scrutiny declined to comment on the Justice Department probe. Amazon and Facebook had no comment. Apple and Google referred inquiries to public statements by their executives.</p><p>Traditional antitrust law focuses on dominant businesses that harm consumers, typically defined as price-gouging and similar behaviors. But many tech companies offer free products that are paid for by a largely invisible trade in the personal data gleaned from those services. Others like Amazon offer consistently low prices on a wide array of merchandise.</p><p>\"That is going to be a tough one for (regulators) to prove,\" said University of Pennsylvania law professor Herbert Hovenkamp.</p><p>Beyond that, the companies could face scrutiny for buying up smaller rivals that might be a threat to their business. Last week, Cicilline accused industry giants of creating a \"startup kill zone\" to insulate them from competition.</p><p>For instance, Google bought YouTube in 2006 when it was still a fledging video site struggling to survive an onslaught of copyright infringement lawsuits, and acquired the technology for its now-dominant Android software for smartphones in an even smaller deal. Facebook snapped up Instagram - now the fastest-growing part of its business - in its infancy, and Apple bought the technology powering its ubiquitous Siri assistant.</p><p>The Trump-era Justice Department has already tried to push the bounds of antitrust law, albeit unsuccessfully. The government employed a novel antitrust theory when it sued to block AT&amp;T's acquisition of Time Warner, arguing that the combined company could hike prices for programming to consumers' detriment. It lost the case both in lower court and on appeal.</p><p>In his January confirmation hearings, Attorney General William Barr acknowledged curiosity about how Silicon Valley giants grew so huge \"under the nose\" of antitrust enforcers. \"I don't' think big is necessarily bad,\" he said. \"But I want to find out more about that dynamic.\"</p><p>Trump has been a fierce critic of AT&amp;T, which owns CNN, in addition to many large tech companies. At various times, he has publicly criticized Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon for allegedly shady, biased or unpatriotic behavior.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-55199464</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT1-W6H1-F021-64T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2230\"/><timeReceived>2:39 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Why? As giants like AT...nd Comcast increasingly push into the online advertising arena, they're keen on having competitors saddled with regulation, while they successfully eliminate oversight of their own problematic monopolies. Given the FCC (now headed by a former Verizon lawyer) just effectively neutered itself at telecom lobbyist behest while the DOJ (now headed by a former Verizon lawyer) goes the extra mile to vilify Facebook[2], you'd have to consider the gambit fairly successful so far. To be clear, there are plenty of problems with Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other Silicon Valley giants that require attention and intelligent solutions by objective experts. </p><p>And while a huge chunk of the animosity toward Silicon Valley giants is entirely genuine and well deserved, a lot of the \"big tech\" hyperventilation among lawmakers like (longtime AT...lly) Marsha Blackburn is largely theatrical in nature and being driven by the telecom sector. Ferreting out which is which isn't easy, but looking at campaign contributions can certainly help. The mainstream press, for its part, has been oddly unaware of how much of the animosity against \"big tech\" has been co-opted and amplified by telecom for what should be obviously selfish reasons. For example, telecom (hand in hand with Rupert Murdoch) has been making the rounds trying to suggest that Google's support of encrypted DNS somehow runs afoul of antitrust guidelines[3] (it doesn't). And Reuters, for example, ran a story this week suggesting that Comcast had suddenly emerged as a \"new antitrust foe\" for Google[4], levying criticism at the company's ad business for the \"first time\":\"Comcast, one of America's largest media and communications companies, is wading into the epic regulatory pile-on against big tech companies such as Google, according to people familiar with the matter...Comcast may be drawing a line in the sand and wants to avoid letting Google do to the video ad business what it has done to the online ad market. It is the first time one of the most powerful companies in the United States, with its own muscular lobbying apparatus in Washington, is taking sides in the antitrust battle looming over the world's largest seller of online ads.So for one thing, Comcast's efforts to push for a regulatory and antitrust crackdown of Google isn't \"new.\" The cable industry's top lobbying organization, the NCTA (whose primary backer is Comcast) has been pushing for a crackdown on Silicon Valley for several years now. Former FCC boss Mike Powell, now the cable industry's top lobbyist, had this to say[5] at an industry show in March of last year. Take special time to note how every criticism levied at Silicon Valley giants applies equally to telecom providers:\"Our governmental authorities need to get a handle on what kind of market power and harm flow from companies that have an unassailable hold on large pools of big data, which serve as barriers to entry, allowing them to dominate industries throughout the economy. For years, big tech companies have been extinguishing competitive threats by buying or crushing promising new technologies just as they were emerging. They dominate their core business, and rarely have to foreclose competition by buying their peers. Competition policy must scrutinize more rigorously deals that allow dominant platforms to kill competitive technologies in the cradle.\"While there's plenty of individuals, groups, and companies that can provide helpful insight on the problems in \"big tech,\" Comcast isn't among them. In large part because it's guilty of nearly all of the criticisms it levies at Google. After convincing the FCC to effectively neuter itself recently, Comcast has been enjoying a growing broadband monopoly across huge swaths of the country as the nation's telcos give up on upgrading aging DSL networks[6]. Comcast then uses that monopoly to jack up prices, erect arbitrary barriers for competitors[7], and stifle emerging technologies (like better cable boxes[8]). And while Comcast tries to get DC lawmakers to impose all manner of new restrictions on Google, with its other hand it has successfully convinced DC (and a lot of policy folks who should know better) to ignore the problems with telecom entirely[9]. Comcast has largely been criticizing Google via its advertising subsidiary Freewheel, and via its policy and lobbying extension organizations, while leaning on politicians like Marsha Blackburn whose sudden, breathless concern about tech monopolies mysteriously omits some of tech's worst offenders: telecom providers. Yes, countless experts have noted for a decade than US antitrust enforcement has grown toothless and frail[10], and our definitions of monopoly power need updating in the Amazon era[11]. Facebook's repeated face plants on privacy (and basic transparency and integrity) have only added fuel to the fire amidst calls to regulate \"big tech.\" That said, if we're looking for expert insight into the genuine problems posed by \"big tech,\" maybe skip taking advice from natural telecom monopolies whose only real motivation here is to elbow in on Silicon Valley advertising revenues while saddling competitors with layers of new regulation.Permalink[12] | Comments[13] | Email This Story[14] [ 1]: <url

The rules simply required that ISPs be more transparent about what data they collect and who they sell it to, requiring that consumers opt in to the sale of more sensitive location data (financial, location). From there, the telecom lobby proceeded to convince the FCC to effectively neuter its consumer protection authority almost entirely[2]. Not only that, it successfully lobbied the FCC to try and ban states from stepping in and protecting consumers[3] -- though the courts (so far) didn't look too kindly upon that. In short the telecom sector lobbied to kill federal oversight, resulting in a lot of states now rushing in to try and fill the void. It then proceeded to cry like a toddler about a \"discordant and fractured framework of state protections,\" hoping you'd ignore this was a problem the sector created. </p><p>Case in point: the telecom sector has now stepped in to sue Maine for attempting to pass a new privacy law[4] that closely mirrors the FCC's discarded 2017 rules. According to a coalition of telecom lobbying organizations, Maine's law violates AT...Verizon, Comcast, and Spectrum's First Amendment rights:\"Maine cannot discriminate against a subset of companies that collect and use consumer data by attempting to regulate just that subset and not others, especially given the absence of any legislative findings or other evidentiary support that would justify targeting ISPs alone. Maine's decision to impose unique burdens on ISPs' speech\u2014while ignoring the online and offline businesses that have and use the very same information and for the same and similar purposes as ISPs\u2014represents discrimination between similarly situated speakers that is impermissible under the First Amendment.\"Maine's law[5] was signed by Governor Janet Mills last June, and is scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2020. The law not only requires that consumers opt in before sensitive data is collected and sold, but it also attempted to ban ISPs from charging broadband subscribers even more money to opt out of snoopvertising, something AT...ngaged in for years[6]. Again, Maine's law, like the laws popping up in other states, wouldn't exist if the telecom sector hadn't lobbied to effectively obliterate modest federal FCC rules. And again, this is a problem the sector created by trying to have its cake and eat it too. One of the key arguments underpinning most of the telecom sector's lobbying shenanigans of late involves one central claim: that state or federal efforts to hold giant ISPs accountable somehow violates Comcast and other ISPs' First Amendment rights[7]. You'll recall ISPs tried to claim that net neutrality also somehow violated ISPs' free speech rights[8], despite the fact that as simple conduits they don't engage in \"editorial\" decisions, making the argument rather silly. Effectively, the industry has spent a decade trying to claim that any federal or state consumer protections violate ISPs' free speech rights and therefore shouldn't exist. All the while, the industry falsely claims[9] it really wants meaningful privacy guidelines. In reality, what the industry wants is either no privacy guidelines at all (pretty much what we've \"enjoyed[10]\" for 20 some odd years now), or weak federal guidelines their lawyers get to write -- so flimsy and loophole filled that they don't do much of anything. Well, anything except pre-empting other better state or federal privacy laws written with something vaguely resembling a consensus. While everybody fixates on \"big tech,\" \"big telecom\" is effectively gutting all meaningful oversight of a quickly consolidating[11] sector that was already an anti-consumer, anti-innovation, and anticompetitive mess. Gosh, wonder how that's going to turn out?Permalink[12] | Comments[13] | Email This Story[14] [ 1]: <url

I'm really excited to welcome for our afternoon keynote, to my left, Steve Burke, the CEO of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast. Comcast, in case you aren't aware, is one of the largest pay TV providers in the U.S., is the sole owner of NBCU, which just wrapped up a successful Olympics and also broadcast Super Bowl LII, where Comcast, I guess it's not Comcast, Philadelphia Eagles, but the Philadelphia Eagles win -- defeated the New England Patriots. So Steve, thanks for being here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEPHEN B. BURKE, SENIOR EVP &amp; CEO, NBCUNIVERSAL, COMCAST CORPORATION: Nice to be here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Why don't we start out with the announcement the company made yesterday? Can you help us better understand why you and the Comcast team thinks Sky is an attractive asset for Comcast shareholders?</p><p>STEPHEN B. BURKE: Okay. So let me start off by apologizing and reiterating, I'm -- the slide says <person><nameText>Brian Roberts. </nameText></person>I am not <person><nameText>Brian Roberts. </nameText></person>He is in London right now, for obvious reasons. But I've worked for Brian and with Brian for 20 years. I spent 13 years as the Head of Comcast Cable, Chief Operating Officer of the whole company, but as President of Comcast Cable. And then when we bought NBCUniversal about 7 years ago, I became Chief Executive at NBCUniversal. So I think I understand both -- I have enough history in both sides of the slate, distribution and content, to comment on why we think Sky is a very -- potentially a very interesting asset, and why we did the proposed offer that we did Tuesday morning. So we think Sky is a great business in its own right. It's a got a very, very large market share in the U.K. and a good business in Italy and Germany. We also think that the combination of Sky and Comcast NBCUniversal is very interesting. In some ways we look at Sky the same way we look at Comcast NBCUniversal. We, I think, over the last seven years have proven that content and distribution can work very well together. And by the way, 7 or 8 years ago, when we announced the NBCUniversal deal, there was a lot of skepticism. A lot of people said, \"Why don't you just stay in distribution? Why don't you just buy back stock? Where are you getting into content?\" And I think we're proven at least to ourselves and hopefully, a lot of people who know our company well, that content and distribution can work well together. And very importantly, when we look at Sky, we see a very unique intersection of content and distribution, and a lot of people say well, you've been in the Cable business for years and years and years, fighting satellite and then you appear to be winning in the United States. Why would you go buy a satellite company in Europe? And we don't consider Sky to be a satellite company. We think it's a platform, and it's a platform that has something like 55% of all the pay subscribers in the U.K. I'll just talk about the U.K. for a second. And that platform has a lot of content. They obviously have the Premier League and Bundisliga and other things, but they have movies. They do 50 original television shows a year. And I think, something like 39% of all the viewership on Sky in the U.K., and a comparable number in Italy and Germany, is content that is produced for Sky. It is essentially exclusive content or semi exclusive content. And that's a very unique, different thing. If you look at DISH, I would venture to say 99% of the content that's viewed on DISH can be viewed on Comcast Cable or Charter or other different companies. So we look at -- when we think of Sky, we think obviously, they have 23 million subscribers. They have 23 million people who subscribe to the service, but we see it as a combination of distribution, content and then importantly, technology. And we've looked at all of the different set-top boxes and in effect it looks like an operating system for a cable or satellite company. And the 2 best in the world, and they've been the best for a long time, we think are X1, which is a Comcast set-top box and cloud technology guidance system, and Sky. And so we look at that, and we look at all of those characteristics and we say it's a very, very unique asset that would sit well with our company. We think we know how to manage these businesses, and it's always frustrating when you propose something and your stock goes down, but the same thing happened when we bought AT&amp;T Broadband, which was the first big deal at Comcast I was associated with, at the time we bought it the margins were at 20%, and we said we'll get the margins to 40% in 3 years and we did it in about 18 months, something like that, 18 months or 2 years. And that really made us much bigger in distribution, and then when we bought NBCUniversal, we had a lot of naysayers and the stock took a hit as well. When we bought NBCUniversal, the EBITDA of the assets we bought was in the range of, call it, $3.5 billion. And this year, we brought that number all the way up to $8.2 billion after 7 years. And I think -- I know that NBCUniversal, if you just look at us versus the other major media companies like Disney and Time Warner and Fox, we're the fastest-growing of the major media companies over the last 7-year period. And I think anybody who looks at the numbers and looks at our valuation would say, we've been a very, very good thing for Comcast's stock price. But it wasn't as evident on the first day. And one of the things I'm proud of, and we can talk about this in more detail, is that the improvement in terms of profitability at NBCUniversal, that's happened in every single business, and a lot of the improvement has to do with the way that we run the company, and the way that we use the various assets to help each other and the way that we interact between distribution and content. And when we look at Sky, we see something that is very similar, that we think that if we could ever be fortunate enough to have the transaction occur, could be a great thing for our shareholders and our company because in effect, we've kind of done it before.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: That's helpful, Steve. One of the things that I'm sure you've gotten questions about this week, and I know I have, is around some of the press reports that Comcast interested in, 21st Century Fox or more of 21st Century Fox than just Sky. Are there assets there that attracted Comcast? And what does your interest or potential interest in these businesses tell about your M&amp;A strategy in general, or the kind of asset that Comcast NBC might pursue in the future?</p><p>STEPHEN B. BURKE: Well, we start from the position that we don't need to do anything, that if you look at the companies in the United States, and let me talk about our domestic business for a second. We're the only company in the United States until AT&amp;T does the Time Warner deal, if that deal's approved -- we're the only company that has distribution and content. We're one of the few companies that have Broadcast and Cable. We're 1 of 2 companies that has Theme Parks. We have a big movie division, so big consumer products, lots of opportunity. And I would say we feel like, if you said, here's a hand to play of any of the big major media companies, NBCUniversal and Comcast, we have a good hand as anybody, and don't get up every morning saying, \"We've got to do something or forgot to fix something.\" I do think, if you said what are you potentially -- what could make your company an even better hand, we have a lower percentage of our revenue from international than I wish we did. And some of that, as we've been so busy growing the company, 20 years ago, we had 4 million cable subscribers and virtually no content. We're a much smaller company and we've been growing the company and integrating AT&amp;T and NBCUniversal, and we haven't committed as much in terms of investment dollars and time and attention to international, and the company that we bought when we bought about NBCUniversal had not had the kind of investment that a Disney or a Fox or Time Warner or Viacom might have had during the time when people, media businesses, were building their big international presences with cable channels, et cetera. So I think if I had one area in our company that we could add to, that would make us an even better company, it would be international. One of the reasons why we were interested in Fox is that 70% of FOX's profitability or businesses came from outside the United States. Rupert Murdoch spent decades assembling these wonderful businesses outside of the United States, and that was very attractive to us. At the end of the day, they chose to go a different direction and we said, \"Well, you win some, you lose some,\" and we moved on and then the more that we thought about Sky the more we realized that it was so similar to everything that we built with Comcast NBCUniversal, and such a unique asset, and an asset where you know that 100% of the shares are likely to trade. If the Disney/Fox deal happens, either it's all going to Disney, or if the Disney/Fox deal doesn't happen, at some point, Fox might buy the whole thing. So we look at the business and say it's clearly going to trade. It's a very unique asset in businesses that we're very comfortable with. And so we've decided to go for it, and it's interesting that press, Brian, I guess was talking to somebody, and said that he was in a cab, which is now the famous cab drive, where he asked the cab driver about Sky, and the reality is, we have 1,500 employees in London. And we study Sky. We study a lot of multichannel operators around the world in detail. I've been to Sky headquarters a couple of times in Osterley, I'm very intimately familiar with their guide. And we know a lot about the company. And we've been following the company for a long, long time and this just became the time when it looked like there was an opportunity and we'll see if it works out.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Well we appreciate you giving us that context and color. Thank you, Steve. Maybe turning now to the current business, at NBCU. You had I think about a 14% EBITDA growth last year. What are you guys focused on for 2018? Guys, you just wrapped up the Olympics. What are the big things you're trying to do this year to drive the business?</p><p>STEPHEN B. BURKE: Well, We've had 5 years of double-digit cash flow growth in a row. And as I said, one nice thing is, it's not -- you have 20 different businesses inside NBCUniversal, everything from NBC Entertainment, Sports and News to English-language, obviously, to Telemundo and the Spanish-language. We owned USA, Syfy, Bravo, E! entertainment, Golf Channel, NBC SportsNet, CNBC, MSNBC. We have a lot of different cable channels we own, 4 theme parks, Orlando, Hollywood, Japan and soon to be, Beijing. We own a big movie studio, 1 of the 6 big movie studios. So being a complicated company, and the good news is, all of the different parts of our company had record years, there may be 1 or 2 of the 20 businesses that didn't have a record year, but the big groups of businesses all had record years. NBC, when we arrived, had been in fourth place for 7 years, took us a couple of years to get out of fourth place, but we've been in the first place for 4 years in a row. And the broadcast season starts in September. So we're now sort of a little under half of the way through the broadcast season, and we're in first place by 50%. So it's highly likely, it's hard for me to imagine we don't win for our fifth year in a row. And the profitability has followed. Universal Studios has been around for 102 years, and this past year was a record year. We made a $1.3 billion in the movie business, and it's not quite fair, because some of that $1.3 billion came from Dreamworks, which we bought a couple of years ago. But the vast majority came from legacy Universal Pictures. And that was a business that wasn't making money when we bought the company 7 years ago. So we've had a lot of success, and it's been very broad. Our Theme Parks business was making about $400 million 8 years ago, and this year made about $2.4 billion, and has a lot of growth, very, very long runway. Our Theme Parks business is going to have a lot of years of good growth. So I think we have hit a sort of momentum across the board as we come in. I haven't talked about news. News, we're #1 if you do the demos that advertisers buy, 25 to 54, we're #1 in the morning with the Today Show, we're #1 at night with Lester Holt. We're #1 on weekends with Chuck Todd, #1 across the board, Jimmy Fallon's #1, Saturday Night Live had a record year. So a lot of strength across the company. If I had to pick some things that I'm particularly excited about for 2018, I'm very excited about MSNBC, which had a record year by a lot. MSNBC is beating CNN almost every night, has beaten CNN month after month after month in prime time. Beats Fox News every once in a while, which is something that I thought would be impossible to imagine, and has real momentum. And is one of the, I think it's safe to say, MSNBC is the fastest-growing cable channel of all the 200 cable channels. There might be little one that's growing faster, but of the major cable channels, fastest-growing. And we make far less money than we should. CNN makes well north of $1 billion a year, and we make 40% of that, and we should make more and lots of opportunity there. I mentioned Theme Parks. We're opening lots of hotel rooms. We've gone from 2,600 hotel rooms, and when we came to 5,400 or something like that, and we should have 10,000. We should have more hotel rooms. The hotel business is a good business for us, but one of the nicest things about the hotel business, when someone stays on site, they spend an extra day in our Theme Parks. So we're building hotels. We're coming out with new attractions. We have a Fast and Furious attraction coming to Orlando, a Kung Fu Panda attraction coming to Hollywood. So I'm very excited about the Theme Parks business, and Beijing is a very unique opportunity. Disney's in Shanghai, and we're going to be the big theme park in Beijing, and that park will open in a few years, and that's a big opportunity for us. And then, just organic growth in the other parts of the business. I think it's -- we have great people, great culture and real momentum. You mentioned sports. It's little unfair to count things that have already happened, but let me just talk a little bit about the 22 days between the Super Bowl and the end of the Olympics. We had never had, the way the Super Bowl works, a different broadcaster gets it every year and there's 3 rights holders that alternate, and then obviously, the Winter Olympics is every 4 years. So those 2 planets have to come in alignment, to get the kind of big bang that we got during the 22 days between the Super Bowl in Minneapolis and the end of the Olympics. Super Bowl was very profitable for us. We made over $100 million. We think it might have been the most profitable night in the history of television for any channel, of all time. And a big part of that, the majority of that was the Super Bowl itself, which was profitable. But then we had This Is Us, which is our sort of hit drama after the Super Bowl, and it had record ratings, made a lot of money. We sold spots for a very high price. And then we had Jimmy Fallon after that. And if you add it all up, it's in excess of $100 million in one night, and that's hard work. I mean, we sold spots for close to $5 million a spot, which was up significantly from where they were last year. We sold out. And then we had a great game, and I think did a good job. Four days after the Olympics, on the Thursday-- or 4 days after Super Bowl, on the Thursday after we started the Olympics, the 18 days of Olympics, from Pyeongchang in Korea, and our goal for the 18 days was to do things differently than we have traditionally. And this is an interesting insight into the way television is evolving. 20 years ago, the strategy -- even 10 years ago, the strategy was, that you take the best clips from the Olympics, and you put them in prime time Monday to Friday, between 8 and 11, and you would curate. You'd watch everything if it was in a different time zone. You'd have something live if they were in that time zone, but basically, you would put it all on NBC, and then you would pretend, if Michael Phelps swan at 4:00 in the afternoon, and you were going to have coverage of his heat or his finals at 9:00 at night, you would almost pretend that he didn't swim. You would pretend that everybody in the world who wanted to know could figure out whether he won or not. Brian Williams would come on the air at 6:30 and say, watch Michael Phelps tonight. We would try to restrict. In the beginning, we would try to restrict content on the Internet. That became an impossibility, obviously over time. And we certainly wouldn't program a cable channel like NBC Sports Network, against the actual broadcast on NBC. And the idea was, to drive the biggest rating you could on NBC, and then go to advertisers and say, look how big this rating is. Over time, obviously, we've been streaming more and more on the Internet. There was a time, I think 2 or 3 Winter Olympics ago, there were 124 hours, 128 hours of programming. This time, we had 2,400 hours. There were times when we had dozens of simultaneous streams of programming streaming on the Internet. We put Olympics programming all on, many of our cable channels, and in prime time, we went to advertisers 6 months ago and we said, we're going to actually program against ourselves. So you might have figure skating on NBC, which hopefully gets a 15 household rating; and you might have hockey or women's hockey on NBC SportsNet, which might get a 3. And you add those 2 together, and it's an 18 household rating. And we're going to sell you the 18 household rating. And you're going to pay the same price, whether it's part of the cable rating or of the broadcast rating. We call it total audience delivery, and advertisers said yes. And so for the first time, we competed with ourselves, but feel like we grew the pie. If you add up the total consumption, we believe the total consumption of the Winter Games, despite all the fragmentation in the world that we're all living with, was the highest on record. And no surprise, our ad sales were over $920 million, and whereas the company lost a couple of hundred million dollars in the Vancouver Olympics, we've made money each in the last 3 Olympics, and we made about $100 million this time around in Korea. So exhausting to think of those 22 days. We had worries whether the advertising market could digest that much spending, and those many eyeballs. On an average night during the Olympics, we had about 20 million people watching. And on those nights, if you add up ABC, CBS and Fox, and multiply the sum by 2, we would beat the sum. So it's just really dominant, big event programming. And I think marketers, if anything, are valuing those big nights more than they ever have before, and we have more big nights than anyone else. So even though your question was really forward-looking, what are you looking forward to in 2018? Those Super Bowl and Olympics certainly count in 2018, and we're happy, very happy with the way they turned out.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Yes. I think if we brought in an outside Olympics discussion to this, the overall business and the pace of change in media and technology, we've been talking all week with folks on the stage about over the top and direct to consumer, and also the consolidation activity happening in the space, so beyond on the operational side and the 2018 focus, how are you positioning NBCUniversal to navigate all these changes? And operationally, and strategically, and are there implications in some of these big merger moves in the space, pending and otherwise, on Comcast?</p><p>STEPHEN B. BURKE: Well, I think if you have a job like mine, you have a dual role. Your -- one role is to try to have the best possible performance in the businesses that exist today. I'll call them legacy businesses. NBC, USA, Syfy, Bravo, et cetera. Do the best you possibly can in these businesses and start to lay the foundation or plant the seeds or whatever the right analogy is, for all of the businesses that are going to become increasingly important in the future, and have a mentality inside your company that is very honest and candid about the challenges and the opportunity space by all of these technologies. I now am old enough that I can say I've been in the entertainment business for 35 years, and have never seen anything like what's happened to us over the last 5 or 10 years. Interestingly, if you add up the 4, and I know Les Moonves was here earlier -- if you add up the 4 broadcasters, and how much money they make from the broadcast business today, I think the answer is the 4 broadcasters make more money than they did 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago. I was in a conference room at ABC 20 years ago, where the strategic planning people said they thought the broadcast business would go away in the next 10 or 15 years. And here we are, we're making more money than we ever were before, but we're making money differently. And to me, the Olympics example is a good example of the need to look at all the different revenue streams and the way -- we're almost windowing television the way movies have always been windowed, and I think if you're intelligent, you can take the -- and have a great team and the right strategy and the willingness to invest. You can take those legacy businesses, and not only keep them from declining, but you can grow them. Our television, OCF is significantly higher than it was 7 years ago, 5 years ago, 3 years ago or even last year. And is the television business going to grow 10% or 20%? No, I don't think so, but it can still grow. And at the same time, I think you need to start making investments. We have an investment in BuzzFeed and Vox. We have bunch of very good Internet businesses that we don't talk about much. We own Fandango. We own a business called GolfNow, which is a terrific business. And then throughout the company, we're doing things different with digital partners. During the Olympics, those of you who have kids or who are millennials yourself, we did a lot with SnapChat and we did have a daily live look in. So when Lindsey Vonn skied if you get an alert that said Lindsey Vonn's about to ski, and inside SnapChat, you can actually see her live ski and we had a lot of different stories and we had a whole team in concert with BuzzFeed that went over to Korea and wrote stories and posted things. We had 40 million unique users of Olympics programming on SnapChat. And I think something like 80% of those people were under the age of 25. So think of how much the world has changed since the good old days, and we'd say, don't give anything to everyone else. Keep it all on NBC, curated in prime time, to a point where we're working with SnapChat to try to get as many millennials as possible to see the Olympics on Snap. And the reason for that's simple. The fear when you have these big events, is that people who were not necessarily watching a lot of linear television, could actually have the 18 days of the Olympics come and go, before they even register that they're on. And so our feeling was, we at least want them to know and consume where they are, in this case on Snap, and some of those people will watch on other places. So I think as a company, we have a very honest and candid approach to the challenges, but also an excitement that we can do things differently and if we move quickly and do things differently, we can grow the company.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: And how might distribution and/or direct-to-consumer fit into that strategy, if at all? What are your views into those opportunities?</p><p>STEPHEN B. BURKE: Well, it depends on how you define OTT. If what you're saying is virtual MVPDs, we sell, we NBCUniversal, sell to all of the virtual MVPDs. And we essentially sell the same group of services that we would sell to a cable company or a satellite company. And if you're just looking at it as NBCUniversal, those virtual MVPDs, that's a positive for us. They're growing subscribers and that's a net positive for us. It's a negative for the cable side of the business. It's more competitors, and those competitors on the margin. I think you could make an argument for the company that it's neutral or maybe even slightly positive to the combined Comcast NBCUniversal, and we don't think that those virtual MVPDs are going to get to huge, huge scale, but they're -- it is a profitable business for us, good business for us. If you then define OTT as streaming, we have very significant and profitable relationships with Netflix and Hulu and Amazon, and those are interesting relationships, because they're competitive. And part of the reason why ratings are what they are, is people are consuming in other places, although I think if you add up all the ratings of those 3 services, they would be far less than a typical night during the Olympics. But we get paid a lot of money from those services, and we're sort of learning how and when to place product there. In terms of developing our own OTT services, it's something that we look at all the time. It is a very tough business model. I'm sure you -- there are a lot of people in this room that follow Netflix, but Netflix has like I think close to 100 million subscribers, and makes $1 billion dollars in OCF and maybe loses money in terms of free cash flow, and might have more than $20 billion worth of debt, having never made acquisition, so a lot of losses. So I think over-the-top is not for the faint of heart, if it's defined as a streaming service, but it'd be crazy not to consider it and experiment. We do have a product called hayu, which is a direct-to-consumer product in Europe that has a lot of reality programming on. We experimented with something called Seeso, which is a comedy-based product in the United States. So we look at it all the time, but at the end of the day, we want to have services that can make money and be additive to the cash flow of the company.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: And so how are you guys thinking about navigating the sports world over time, talking about being less involved with the NFL for example, the ratings have been under pressure. You guys won't have Thursday Night Football this fall. Maybe if you just talk about how you think about the cost, the rising cost of sports rights, the fragmentation we're seeing against the obvious benefits around live audience, and sort of the pricing power it gives you? How do you think about that? And also how big tech may or may not impact rights' use over time?</p><p>STEPHEN B. BURKE: Well, as evidenced by the Olympics and the Super Bowl, sports are very, very important. If you're in the broadcast business, which we are, and you want to assemble the biggest audiences possible, we have something like 60% of the really big nights on television. And 60% of the share of the really big nights on television, Olympics, football, Golden Globes, so on and so forth. And sports are a huge, huge part of that. Sports, obviously, you have to be very careful which you pay for sports. And our company, 8, 9, 10 years ago was moving $300 million, $400 million a year between the NFL and the Olympics, and we structured those deals, rightsized those deals and changed some of the way that we do things. Sunday Night Football's been the #1 show on television now for 5, 6 years, something like that, and it is a highly likely in my opinion to be the #1 show on television this year, next year and into the future. We love the Sunday night package. The Thursday night package was a little bit different. We've always made money on this round of Sunday Night Football. And we had Thursday Night Football for 2 years and did not make money. It was a split package between us and CBS, and for a whole variety of reasons, Sunday is football night in America, and Thursday has yet to build into that, and maybe Fox will build into that. We looked at that Thursday night package and actually did a hybrid package of broadcast and cable, and did not want to lose. We were losing significant money on Thursday night. We had 6 games on Thursday night, and we lost a lot of money, well over $100 million on that package. We were paying $45 million a game, some number like that, and so we didn't want to continue that and the NFL found somebody who was willing to pay more.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Yes. Just sticking with the television worlds. We talked about some of the challenges in the ecosystem. Your TV businesses are clearly performing well, but you've also been making sure your brands continue to resonate with consumers, and you've even been trimming, I think, some of the portfolio. How do you guys make sure that your networks matter to consumers, and have enough content to sort of stick out from the level of clutter, which is only going up?</p><p>STEPHEN B. BURKE: Well, it's -- the business is not getting easier. It's getting harder and harder to launch a show. We launched a show last night called Unsolved, which is the story of Tupac and Biggie's unsolved murder 2 decades ago, and it did very well. It's -- the ratings were terrific, but we put so much time and energy in it, such a unique concept. And I think the answer to your question is, it's gotten harder, so you have to be better. And by the way, the same thing is true in the movie business. It's much harder to launch a movie than it was. The home video business is not what it was. You have to think about movies playing internationally and in China. You have to spend a huge amount of money launching a movie. And the same thing is true in the television business. Our approach has been to try to be bold and make big investments when necessary, but also at the end of day, realized we're there to make money. And you can have your cake and eat it, too. You can balance it. The one thing about these businesses, you cannot cut your way to success. Anytime anyone said, we're not going to invest, that we're going to do less pilots, or we're going to have less original programming or we're going to take $100 million out of the cost structure of this channel. That normally doesn't end well. I think the companies that do well are companies that get excited about great IP, get excited about a great idea, make sure that you're picking as judiciously as you can. But every once in a while, you have to take a shot. And if you're taking those shots, you're going to fail, and when you fail, you got to dust yourself off, and try to learn from whatever your failures are and keep moving. And that, I think, that's what we've done at Universal Pictures and NBC and USA and throughout the portfolio, and it's working.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: And maybe just to conclude, Steve, I wanted to ask you on the Film and Theme Parks side. This will tie back to sort of the M&amp;A discussion we had. You've made some pretty big, for those, the list of acquisitions with Universal Studios Japan and also DreamWorks, what have those businesses done to the Film and Theme Parks? How have they worked out? And so what's been the impact strategically and financially of those assets?</p><p>STEPHEN B. BURKE: So we made 2 acquisitions, and 1 was stair stepped. We bought -- the theme park in Osaka, Universal Studios Japan, we did not own. We got royalties and there was a time when we owned and GE sold a piece. We bought control, 51%, and then we bought the entire park. And it is really a fantastic business. It's doing extremely well. In some ways, it's our most successful park in the world. It is ahead of all of our estimates when he bought the company, and we did a deal with Nintendo, which we're very, very excited about, to bring a Nintendo Land. And eventually, we're going to have Nintendo in Osaka, Orlando and California, but the first place we're bringing Nintendo is going to be Osaka. Osaka happens to be about an hour from Kyoto, which is the headquarters for Nintendo. So we think that's going to be a gigantic step forward. And as you heard, we love the Theme Parks business and so we're very happy with Japan. And then the second deal we did is we bought Dreamworks Animation a couple of years ago. We've had a wonderful experience with the animated film business, with a company called Illumination, which is run by a real genius. The guy who I think is really the Walt Disney of our generation, a guy named Chris Meledandri, who created Despicable Me and Pets and Sing, and he is fantastic and we've had a great run with those animated films. I think if you're in the film business, if you're lucky enough to have an animated film studio, you want to do everything you can to make sure that, that's a priority in your company. And Chris has gotten Illumination to the point where, some years, we can make 2 films, we have 2 animated films. We made 2 last year. Actually, this year, we're only making one, and it comes right at the end of the year, Grinch. But next year, he's got a couple. And if you look at the history of animation studios, for whatever reason, no animated studio has consistently made more than 2 films in a year, not Dreamworks, not Pixar, not Illumination, not Disney. And so Disney has Disney Animation and Pixar, and so we looked at DreamWorks and we said, wouldn't it be great if we could have 2 illumination films and 2 DreamWorks films in a year, and the way to do that is to buy DreamWorks, buy the library, buy the TV animation business and also have this animation capability. And we're going to have our first new DreamWorks under the new era DreamWorks, if that's the right word, film is How to Train Your Dragon, comes out your next year. And next year, if you include Grinch, because it really happens at the end this year, we're going to have our dream of 4 animated films in a 12-month period. And that is, I think, going to give us the chance to beat the record in the film business that we established in 2017.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Great. Well, I know you guys have a lot going on. Steve, thanks for coming to the conference.</p><p>STEPHEN B. BURKE: Thank you.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Thank you, everybody.</p><p>STEPHEN B.

Google's competitors are warning lawmakers that emerging privacy regulations could help Google extend its dominance.<br/>\"FreeWheel would embrace a solution that allowed it to continue to meaningfully serve its clients when they publish their content on YouTube, as it had for over a decade on that platform,\" Comcast said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the actions to remove or degrade FreeWheel's capabilities on YouTube fall well short of that.\"<br/>Comcast's concerns have not prompted a full-on attack on Google, though Comcast has contacted other technology companies to discuss the threat posed by Google, two other sources said.<br/>The issues raised by Comcast and its subsidiary have been echoed widely in the cable and ad technology industries. Most companies that contend Google has unfairly squeezed them out have been reticent to speak out because they rely on Google services and fear retaliation.<br/>But Comcast, which owns media company NBC, Universal Pictures and the Xfinity internet service, is a large spender on state and federal lobbying and election campaigns and a veteran of political organizing.<br/>The House Judiciary Committee, U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 50 state-level attorneys general have each asked Google for information about its ads business in recent weeks as they begin investigating potential violations of antitrust law.<br/>Google declined to comment on Comcast's recent actions but has said it is cooperating with the investigations and that it faces robust competition in advertising, including from Comcast.<br/>Privacy PushFreeWheel's tensions with Google stem from a one-of-a-kind agreement struck in 2009 as YouTube sought to burnish its image with clips from well-known TV channels.<br/>The deal enables media companies such as NBC, Turner, now owned by AT&amp;T Inc, and Viacom Inc to sell ads alongside their content on YouTube using FreeWheel's technology rather than Google's competing tool, ensuring access to their single, preferred system across various streaming websites and apps.<br/>FreeWheel is the go-to video ad server because of its experience, said a FreeWheel client, speaking on the condition of anonymity.<br/>But last year, Google closed FreeWheel's pipe into YouTube in Europe, citing the EU's General Data Protection Regulation that imposed new requirements on companies seeking to share consumer data.<br/>In the United States, Google has allowed FreeWheel's continued use on the condition that starting with tests this month, the tens of media companies reliant on it will be cut off from accessing some user data for privacy reasons, one of the sources said. The data reduction could make FreeWheel's system less attractive to media companies and their advertisers, potentially prompting a shift to Google, the source said.<br/>Google said a small percentage of YouTube revenue is affected and that it has been working with FreeWheel to restore access in Europe and preserve it in the United States.<br/>A FreeWheel representative brought up the issue at a private hearing in September of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Tech Task Force, led by Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, the sources briefed on the discussion said.<br/>Blackburn, who is holding hearings to inform potential privacy laws, said on C-SPAN last week that a Congressional privacy bill being weighed must preserve competition better than EU regulations have. Her spokeswoman declined to comment on FreeWheel's task force comments.<br/>Internet TrackingThe conflict is playing out on another front. Google said last month it is experimenting with encrypting the internet traffic of Chrome users, and Android has similar capability in its newest version.<br/>The move, technically known as DNS-over-HTTPS, increases users' privacy and security by limiting some companies, including internet service providers, from tracking users' browsing.<br/>Internet experts say Google adopting the new technology widely and stringently would cripple tools for parental controls and stifling child pornography online. Trade associations for cable and wireless companies including Comcast told Congress last month that the move could \"possibly foreclose competition in advertising and other industries.\"<br/>Comcast told Reuters that it was open to working with Google on the issue in way that ensures various security and parental controls are not broken, but that \"any unilateral action that limits customer choice will not work.\"<br/>Google spokesman Scott Westover said its proposal maintains \"all existing filters and controls\" and that \"any claim that we are trying to become the centralized encrypted DNS provider is inaccurate.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-271198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFT-5FH1-DYDW-71SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"915\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0001VM7</classCode><className>VIACOM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the partnership raises big questions about the future of Internet video.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>and Comcast announced an agreement Sunday under which <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>will pay for direct access to Comcast's broadband network. That's instead of delivering its traffic through third parties like Cogent Communications, as <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>has done previously. Comcast and <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>declined to disclose the terms of their agreement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Comcast deal is novel in that it's the first time <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>has had to pay an Internet service provider for direct access to its network. <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>already connects directly for free with some smaller ISPs like Cablevision, as well as a number of international providers.</p><p>Other big tech companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook, already have paid-connection deals with big ISPs.</p><p>With terms of the agreement confidential, it's difficult to assess how significant an expense the deal is for <person><nameText>Netflix. </nameText></person>The company didn't update its earnings projections following the announcement, suggesting it doesn't foresee a meaningful change in its costs in the near term.</p><p>Dan Rayburn, an analyst with Frost Sullivan, says the agreement will save money for <person><nameText>Netflix, </nameText></person>since it can now cut out the middlemen and deliver to Comcast directly.</p><p/><p>Other analysts are skeptical of that claim, but are still confident there won't be a big impact on consumers.</p><p>\"Near term, <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>is going to eat it,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. He expects <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>to raise subscription costs by $1 or $2 per month next year, though he said that price hike will be driven by a variety of factors, including costs to acquire content and expand internationally.</p><p><person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>streaming speeds for customers of Comcast, AT&amp;T and Verizonhave declined in recent months amid a debate about who bears the responsibility to upgrade the connections that allow content to reach subscribers.</p><p><person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>is a huge contributor to the congestion on these networks, accounting for around a third of traffic during peak hours. That's why Comcast and others have pushed it to help bear the cost of upgrades.</p><p>In a conference call with analysts Monday, VerizonCEO Lowell McAdam said he was \"pleased\" to see <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>and Comcast strike their agreement, and that Verizonis in similar negotiations. AT&amp;T said the same on Tuesday.</p><p/><p>While the \"House of Cards\" fan in you may be relieved, the <person><nameText>Netflix</nameText></person>-Comcast deal concerns some consumer advocates. They worry that Comcast and other big ISPs are on the verge of creating a \"two-speed\" Internet. <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>and other deep-pocketed content companies can pay top dollar to get their streams sped up for customers, but smaller companies don't have that luxury.</p><p>Large tech companies \"have a shared interest in cooperating, so it's good for all of them, but it's not good for the new innovator that wants to get access to subscribers,\" said Susan Crawford, a professor at Cardozo Law School and author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.</p><p>But given the massive amount of data <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>requires, some argue it makes sense for a company driving that much traffic to help foot the bill.</p><p>\"Comcast is greedy here, but <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>are hogs -- they're the ones clogging up the pipeline,\" said Wedbush's Pachter.</p><p>Rayburn of Frost Sullivan agreed, dismissing concerns about reduced competition among content providers.</p><p>\"It's economies of scale,\" Rayburn said. \"If you don't have the size and scale of <person><nameText>Netflix, </nameText></person>you use a third-party [content delivery network] that's already connected.\"</p><p>The debate will rage on in the months to come, with regulators pledging to keep an eye on the issue.</p><p>\"It's an issue that is something the commission has to stay on top of,\" said Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communication Commission, at a conference last month. \"Our job is to make sure whatever happens is not anti-competitive.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

But the partnership raises big questions about the future of Internet video.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>and Comcast announced an agreement Sunday under which <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>will pay for direct access to Comcast's broadband network. That's instead of delivering its traffic through third parties like Cogent Communications, as <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>has done previously. Comcast and <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>declined to disclose the terms of their agreement.</p><p>The Comcast deal is novel in that it's the first time <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>has had to pay an Internet service provider for direct access to its network. <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>already connects directly for free with some smaller ISPs like Cablevision, as well as a number of international providers.</p><p>Other big tech companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook, already have paid-connection deals with big ISPs. </p><p>With terms of the agreement confidential, it's difficult to assess how significant an expense the deal is for <person><nameText>Netflix. </nameText></person>The company didn't update its earnings projections following the announcement, suggesting it doesn't foresee a meaningful change in its costs in the near term.</p><p>Dan Rayburn, an analyst with Frost Sullivan, says the agreement will save money for <person><nameText>Netflix, </nameText></person>since it can now cut out the middlemen and deliver to Comcast directly. </p><p>Other analysts are skeptical of that claim, but are still confident there won't be a big impact on consumers.</p><p>\"Near term, <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>is going to eat it,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. He expects <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>to raise subscription costs by $1 or $2 per month next year, though he said that price hike will be driven by a variety of factors, including costs to acquire content and expand internationally.</p><p><person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>streaming speeds for customers of Comcast, AT&amp;T and Verizonhave declined in recent months amid a debate about who bears the responsibility to upgrade the connections that allow content to reach subscribers. </p><p><person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>is a huge contributor to the congestion on these networks, accounting for around a third of traffic during peak hours. That's why Comcast and others have pushed it to help bear the cost of upgrades. </p><p>In a conference call with analysts Monday, VerizonCEO Lowell McAdam said he was \"pleased\" to see <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>and Comcast strike their agreement, and that Verizonis in similar negotiations. AT&amp;T said the same on Tuesday.</p><p>While the \"House of Cards\" fan in you may be relieved, the <person><nameText>Netflix</nameText></person>-Comcast deal concerns some consumer advocates. They worry that Comcast and other big ISPs are on the verge of creating a \"two-speed\" Internet. <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>and other deep-pocketed content companies can pay top dollar to get their streams sped up for customers, but smaller companies don't have that luxury.</p><p>Large tech companies \"have a shared interest in cooperating, so it's good for all of them, but it's not good for the new innovator that wants to get access to subscribers,\" said Susan Crawford, a professor at Cardozo Law School and author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.</p><p>But given the massive amount of data <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>requires, some argue it makes sense for a company driving that much traffic to help foot the bill.</p><p>\"Comcast is greedy here, but <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>are hogs -- they're the ones clogging up the pipeline,\" said Wedbush's Pachter.</p><p>Rayburn of Frost Sullivan agreed, dismissing concerns about reduced competition among content providers.</p><p>\"It's economies of scale,\" Rayburn said. \"If you don't have the size and scale of <person><nameText>Netflix, </nameText></person>you use a third-party [content delivery network] that's already connected.\"</p><p>The debate will rage on in the months to come, with regulators pledging to keep an eye on the issue.</p><p>\"It's an issue that is something the commission has to stay on top of,\" said Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communication Commission, at a conference last month. \"Our job is to make sure whatever happens is not anti-competitive.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2014 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Behind the closed doors of a congressional task force last month, Comcast's video ads division FreeWheel accused Alphabet Inc's Google of using privacy concerns as a pretext to limit FreeWheel's ability to sell ads on behalf of its clients' YouTube channels, four people briefed on the discussion said. Comcast may be drawing a line in the sand and wants to avoid letting Google do to the video ad business what it has done to the online ad market. It is the first time one of the most powerful companies in the United States, with its own muscular lobbying apparatus in Washington, is taking sides in the antitrust battle looming over the world's largest seller of online ads. </p><p>Google's competitors are warning lawmakers that emerging privacy regulations could help Google extend its dominance. \"FreeWheel would embrace a solution that allowed it to continue to meaningfully serve its clients when they publish their content on YouTube, as it had for over a decade on that platform,\" Comcast said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the actions to remove or degrade FreeWheel's capabilities on YouTube fall well short of that.\" Comcast's concerns have not prompted a full-on attack on Google, though Comcast has contacted other technology companies to discuss the threat posed by Google, two other sources said. The issues raised by Comcast and its subsidiary have been echoed widely in the cable and ad technology industries. Most companies that contend Google has unfairly squeezed them out have been reticent to speak out because they rely on Google services and fear retaliation. But Comcast, which owns media company NBC, Universal Pictures and the Xfinity internet service, is a large spender on state and federal lobbying and election campaigns and a veteran of political organizing. The House Judiciary Committee, U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 50 state-level attorneys general have each asked Google for information about its ads business in recent weeks as they begin investigating potential violations of antitrust law. Google declined to comment on Comcast's recent actions but has said it is cooperating with the investigations and that it faces robust competition in advertising, including from Comcast. PRIVACY PUSH FreeWheel's tensions with Google stem from a one-of-a-kind agreement struck in 2009 as YouTube sought to burnish its image with clips from well-known TV channels. The deal enables media companies such as NBC, Turner, now owned by AT&amp;T Inc, and Viacom Inc to sell ads alongside their content on YouTube using FreeWheel's technology rather than Google's competing tool, ensuring access to their single, preferred system across various streaming websites and apps. FreeWheel is the go-to video ad server because of its experience, said a FreeWheel client, speaking on the condition of anonymity. But last year, Google closed FreeWheel's pipe into YouTube in Europe, citing the EU's General Data Protection Regulation that imposed new requirements on companies seeking to share consumer data. In the United States, Google has allowed FreeWheel's continued use on the condition that starting with tests this month, the tens of media companies reliant on it will be cut off from accessing some user data for privacy reasons, one of the sources said. The data reduction could make FreeWheel's system less attractive to media companies and their advertisers, potentially prompting a shift to Google, the source said. Google said a small percentage of YouTube revenue is affected and that it has been working with FreeWheel to restore access in Europe and preserve it in the United States. A FreeWheel representative brought up the issue at a private hearing in September of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Tech Task Force, led by Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, the sources briefed on the discussion said. Blackburn, who is holding hearings to inform potential privacy laws, said on C-SPAN last week that a Congressional privacy bill being weighed must preserve competition better than EU regulations have. Her spokeswoman declined to comment on FreeWheel's task force comments. INTERNET TRACKING The conflict is playing out on another front. Google said last month it is experimenting with encrypting the internet traffic of Chrome users, and Android has similar capability in its newest version. The move, technically known as DNS-over-HTTPS, increases users' privacy and security by limiting some companies, including internet service providers, from tracking users' browsing. Internet experts say Google adopting the new technology widely and stringently would cripple tools for parental controls and stifling child pornography online. Trade associations for cable and wireless companies including Comcast told Congress last month that the move could \"possibly foreclose competition in advertising and other industries.\" Comcast told Reuters that it was open to working with Google on the issue in way that ensures various security and parental controls are not broken, but that \"any unilateral action that limits customer choice will not work.\" Google spokesman Scott Westover said its proposal maintains \"all existing filters and controls\" and that \"any claim that we are trying to become the centralized encrypted DNS provider is inaccurate.\" (Reporting by Paresh Dave in San Francisco and Sheila Dang in New York; Additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Kenneth Li and Lisa Shumaker) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11960326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5P-MWD1-DYWP-R0RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"949\"/><timeReceived>12:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Behind the closed doors of a congressional task force last month, Comcast's video ads division FreeWheel accused Alphabet Inc's Google of using privacy concerns as a pretext to limit FreeWheel's ability to sell ads on behalf of its clients' YouTube channels, four people briefed on the discussion said. Comcast may be drawing a line in the sand and wants to avoid letting Google do to the video ad business what it has done to the online ad market. It is the first time one of the most powerful companies in the United States, with its own muscular lobbying apparatus in Washington, is taking sides in the antitrust battle looming over the world's largest seller of online ads. </p><p>Google's competitors are warning lawmakers that emerging privacy regulations could help Google extend its dominance. \"FreeWheel would embrace a solution that allowed it to continue to meaningfully serve its clients when they publish their content on YouTube, as it had for over a decade on that platform,\" Comcast said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the actions to remove or degrade FreeWheel's capabilities on YouTube fall well short of that.\" Comcast's concerns have not prompted a full-on attack on Google, though Comcast has contacted other technology companies to discuss the threat posed by Google, two other sources said. The issues raised by Comcast and its subsidiary have been echoed widely in the cable and ad technology industries. Most companies that contend Google has unfairly squeezed them out have been reticent to speak out because they rely on Google services and fear retaliation. But Comcast, which owns media company NBC, Universal Pictures and the Xfinity internet service, is a large spender on state and federal lobbying and election campaigns and a veteran of political organising. The House Judiciary Committee, US Department of Justice and a coalition of 50 state-level attorneys general have each asked Google for information about its ads business in recent weeks as they begin investigating potential violations of antitrust law. Google declined to comment on Comcast's recent actions but has said it is cooperating with the investigations and that it faces robust competition in advertising, including from Comcast. PRIVACY PUSH FreeWheel's tensions with Google stem from a one-of-a-kind agreement struck in 2009 as YouTube sought to burnish its image with clips from well-known TV channels. The deal enables media companies such as NBC, Turner, now owned by AT&amp;T Inc, and Viacom Inc to sell ads alongside their content on YouTube using FreeWheel's technology rather than Google's competing tool, ensuring access to their single, preferred system across various streaming websites and apps. FreeWheel is the go-to video ad server because of its experience, said a FreeWheel client, speaking on the condition of anonymity. But last year, Google closed FreeWheel's pipe into YouTube in Europe, citing the EU's General Data Protection Regulation that imposed new requirements on companies seeking to share consumer data. In the United States, Google has allowed FreeWheel's continued use on the condition that starting with tests this month, the tens of media companies reliant on it will be cut off from accessing some user data for privacy reasons, one of the sources said. The data reduction could make FreeWheel's system less attractive to media companies and their advertisers, potentially prompting a shift to Google, the source said. Google said a small percentage of YouTube revenue is affected and that it has been working with FreeWheel to restore access in Europe and preserve it in the United States. A FreeWheel representative brought up the issue at a private hearing in September of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Tech Task Force, led by Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, the sources briefed on the discussion said. Blackburn, who is holding hearings to inform potential privacy laws, said on C-SPAN last week that a Congressional privacy bill being weighed must preserve competition better than EU regulations have. Her spokeswoman declined to comment on FreeWheel's task force comments. INTERNET TRACKING The conflict is playing out on another front. Google said last month it is experimenting with encrypting the internet traffic of Chrome users, and Android has similar capability in its newest version. The move, technically known as DNS-over-HTTPS, increases users' privacy and security by limiting some companies, including internet service providers, from tracking users' browsing. Internet experts say Google adopting the new technology widely and stringently would cripple tools for parental controls and stifling child pornography online. Trade associations for cable and wireless companies including Comcast told Congress last month that the move could \"possibly foreclose competition in advertising and other industries.\" Comcast told Reuters that it was open to working with Google on the issue in way that ensures various security and parental controls are not broken, but that \"any unilateral action that limits customer choice will not work.\" Google spokesman Scott Westover said its proposal maintains \"all existing filters and controls\" and that \"any claim that we are trying to become the centralized encrypted DNS provider is inaccurate.\" - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11959730</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5P-MWD1-DYWP-R0S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><timeReceived>10:10 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

With the release of a three-and-a-half minutepromotional video[2], the former vice president officially threw his name in the ever-expanding ring of Democratic primary contenders seeking to win the opportunity to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency in 2020. Biden has already seen his share of coverage, and was thesecond-most-mentioned[3]Democratic candidate on cable news during the first three months of 2019. Biden haspledged[4]that his 2020 campaign won't take in any direct donations from lobbyists. But on the first night of his official candidacy, Biden hit the suburbs of Philadelphia to attend a$2,800[5]per personfundraiser[6]at the home of David L. Cohen, the executive vice president and chief of lobbying forComcast. Comcast, one of the biggest lobbyingspenders[7]in Washington, also ownsMSNBC,which has showered Biden with favorable coverage both before and since his announcement. </p><p>In March, Nevada lieutenant gubernatorial candidate Lucy Flores published an article inNew York Magazine(3/29/19[8]) that described how Biden inappropriately kissed her at a campaign event. Biden hasquite[9]along[10]history[11]ofawkward[12]andinappropriate[13]touching[14],kissing[15]orgroping[16]of women and girls. Mika Brzezinski, co-host ofMSNBC'sMorning Joe, was one of the first to defend Biden (4/1/19[17]). Brzezinski suggested that Flores' allegation was politically motivated, citing Flores as a 'huge Bernie person,' and asking, 'Are we just supposed to take all the words and the fact she said she was violated at face value?' Her guests later that day (4/1/19[18]), former DCCC chief of staff Adrienne Elrod and former CIA and DoD chief of staff Jeremy Bash, seemed to agree that such #MeToo accusations against Biden were 'meaningless moments,' and merely baseless finger-pointing from Biden's political opponents. Brzezinski continued her defense of Biden the following day and later in the week onMorning Joe, after another woman came forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior (4/2/19[19],4/5/19[20]). Brzezinski said that the allegations were 'sad,' and that Biden is a 'nice guy' and 'not a predator.' She continued:This is ridiculous. The conversation has gotten out of control, and Democrats and those on the left who want to tweet me today and go nuts and get all woke, you're eating your young. You're eating those who can beat Trump. You're killing the very people who have been pushing women ahead, who've been fighting for equal pay, who have been doing everything they can to respect women in their lives. We're going to after Joe Biden for being affectionate to women of all ages, and to men as well? It's ridiculous.While he is indeed afrontrunner[21],defense[22]of Biden as supposedly theonly[23]candidate[24]with the ability to beat Trump isfrequently[25]parroted[26]by many corporate Democrats (and by totally, definitely well-meaningRepublican[27]Party[28]figuresas well[29]).MSNBCcontributor Mike Barnicle recently re-upped this trope (4/24/19[30]) on the day of Biden's announcement, though to his credit,Axios' Jim Vandehei did push back on this narrative. On anotherMorning Joepanel (4/26/19[31]),MSNBCcorrespondent Rev. Al Sharpton criticized Biden's role indrafting[32]andsponsoring[33]the 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1994 crime bills, and histreatment[34]of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. Biden recently issued a half-apology phone call 28 years after the fact to Hill, who told theNew York Times(4/25/19[35]) that the call 'left her feeling deeply unsatisfied.' (Biden continued to dance around giving a full-throated apology to Hill in an appearance onThe View\u20144/26/19[36].) But despite Sharpton's misgivings about Biden's history, he maintained that Biden somehow had the 'equipment despite the hurdles' to appeal to both 'blue collar white workers' and 'black and brown communities.' On the same program, Joe Scarborough castigated Biden detractors, maintaining that they failed to understand the context of Biden's past support for harsh drug laws,opposition[37]to school integration andsupport[38]for the Iraq War. He later added that 'it's easy for you to sit there behind your laptop, drinking your soy lattes in 2019 judging [him] for trying to make the country better.' Sharpton chimed in with further attacks on so-called 'latte liberators' and 'limousine liberals.' But despite his folksiness (Extra!,4/13[39]), if there is anyone who serves the interests of financial giants who spend most of their time in limousines, it's Joe Biden. Since thelate 1970s[40], Biden has been the chief defender of the Delaware-based credit card industry in Congress, and played a crucial role in the passage of the 2005 bankruptcy law, which made it harder for Americans to wipe out and restructure unreasonable debts through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Indeed, credit card company MBNA (formerly owned by Bank of America) was Biden'ssecond-largest donor[41]throughout his Senate career. When Biden drafted the original version of the bankruptcy bill in 2000, he was stronglyopposed[42]by then-Harvard Law professor Elizabeth Warren, who was integral in getting the Clinton administration to block its passage. Biden has also been a consistent supporter of further financial deregulation, such as the Gramm-Bliley-Leach Act, which has beenpointed to[43]as apartial cause[44]of the 2008 financial collapse. Yet Biden's extremely checkered political history, where he was consistently on the wrong sides of issues like women's rights, racial equality, financial regulation, drugs and criminal justice,surveillance[45]and war, still doesn't seem to be enough for the media to deem him damaged goods. In fact, outlets likeMSNBCstill play up Biden as the most viable candidate, despite the fact that there are others with similarly long tenures in politics whodidn't make[46]Biden's same mistakes.Earlier in the year, Alex Altman came onMSNBCtopraise Biden's 'electability' (2/21/19[47]), while this week Steve Kornacki devoted a whole segment to prove just how 'electable' Joe Biden is for the Democrats in a 2020 matchup against Trump (4/25/19[48]). No other candidate, not even the other front runners, received such a segment from the network. Indeed, calling Biden the most 'electable[49]' candidate is really just code for the most 'moderate' or white candidate. Such a designation for Biden discounts the appeal of candidates who are left-wing, female or people of color. In particular, left-wing candidates like Bernie Sanders (the other frontrunner) and Elizabeth Warren areeach[50]frequently[51]dogged[52]incorporate[53]media[54]byaccusations[55]that they are somehow not 'electable' enough. There is perhaps an underlying logic to these attacks.Warren[56]andSanders[57]have each called forheightened[58]antitrust regulation[59]. (Amy Klobuchar[60]andCorey Booker[61]have also called for increased antitrust enforcement, but are bit more tepid on the issue than Sanders and Warren.) Big tech companies, agricultural conglomerates, food and beverage companies, banks and telecom companies likeComcastwould surely come under the antitrust microscope and be targeted forbreakups[62]if one of these candidates were to win the Democratic nomination.Comcastin particular stands out as a major target, considering they have interests in both media content production as well as distribution. Comcast, along with other internet service providers (ISPs) likeVerizonandAT...hold what are essentially regionalmonopolies[63], where they very rarely directly compete with one another in a given area. As of 2017, almost80 percent[64]of US households have access to just a single ISP that offers broadband speeds of over 100 mbps. This has a striking impact on US internet users: The nation has just the20th fastest[65]average internet speed in the world, and, according to the FCC, US consumerspay more[66]for broadband than most other comparable countries. Of course, ISPs are also famous for their unmatched customer service record-Comcastranks as one of America'smost[67]hated[68]companies[69]year in and year out, along with many other ISPs. Much of the power ofComcastand other telecom companies to maintain their monopolies can be attributed to the revolving door that shuffles telecom lobbyists in and out of government positions. The current FCC chair, Ajit Pai, is the former general counsel forVerizon, while its past chair, Tom Wheeler, was a longtime telecom industry lobbyist fortrade[70]groups[71]with connections toComcast. Meredeth Attwell Baker, a former FCC commissioner under Obama,joined[72]Comcastjust four months after giving the greenlight forComcast's merger withNBC Universal. The acquisition marked the beginning of other vertical mergers between content distributors and content producers, includingAT...acquisition[73]ofTime Warner, which ownsCNN. During his Senate career, Biden was far from a hawk on antitrust, supporting antitrustexemptions[74]for the soda industry after receiving donations from Coca-Cola. Judging by the Obama administration'sextremely lax[75]antitrust approach, a hypothetical Biden administration would follow the same friendly approach towards corporate interests. Biden hasn't stayed away from discussing the issue of antitrust so far in his campaign, but he hasremarked[76]that big corporations shouldn't be 'singled out.' At a speech last year to the Brookings Institution, heremarked[77], 'I don't think 500 billionaires are the reason we're in trouble. The folks at the top aren't bad guys.' Such deference to massive and unpopular corporate monopolies is anathema to both a healthy economy and contrary to the views of most Americans. But potential antitrust targets likeComcastandAT...ave the ability to manufacture positive press for pro-corporate water carriers like Biden through their news properties. Powerful executives likeComcast's David Cohen might not be shooting out daily emails toMSNBCstaff ordering them to promote Biden's candidacy, but employees will often gravitate towards what their employers want. After all, they are well aware who signs the checks. Likewise, topMSNBCnews personalities exist within the same elite circle of Washington insiders that Biden has inhabited for the past 40 years-in just about every one of the aforementioned segments, one host or guest remarked on their personal relationship with Joe Biden. The insider DC cocktail party circuit doesn't contain very many people who want to attack their corporate benefactors. It's notable that even before its acquisition byComcast,MSNBChad a history oftacking to the right[78]and adistinct reluctance[79]to challenge entrenched corporate interests. What's more, the network devotes little interest to economic policy, let alone antitrust, preferring to spendmost of its time[80]covering Russiagate. However, this could change. Since entering the race, Biden has been subject to criticism from his left flank, and will likely remain a target. Sanders recentlyfired shots[81]at Biden in a fundraising email, calling out his fundraiser with Cohen. Warren added to herlong history[82]of criticizing Biden byattacking[83]him for his support of banks and credit card companies during the financial crisis. However,MSNBChas failed to even mention Biden's fundraiser with Cohen. I can't imagine why.

The remainder of 21st Century Fox, which will concentrate on news and sports, will be spun off into another company dubbed New Fox.</p><p>The trigger for <person><nameText>Comcast's </nameText></person>bid was AT&amp;T's resounding court victory over the Department of Justice on Tuesday night, when a federal judge ruled that the telecoms company's blockbuster merger with Time Warner, the television and film company, could go ahead. <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>believes that AT&amp;T's win will make it easier to get its deal with 21st Century Fox past the department's competition enforcers.</p><p>Traditional media companies are turning to mergers as they try to make up ground on the fast-growing video streaming services, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, and digital advertisers, such as Google and Facebook. AT&amp;T's victory is likely to be a precursor to a spate of deals in the industry.</p><p>21st Century Fox, which is valued at nearly $80 billion, is an American media company. Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, owner of The Times, is co-chairman of 21st Century Fox with his son Lachlan Murdoch. James Murdoch is chief executive of 21st Century Fox and chairman of Sky.</p><p>In a letter to the three executives, Brian Roberts, chief executive of <person><nameText>Comcast, </nameText></person>said that his company had \"long admired what the Murdoch family has built\" at 21st Century Fox and was \"convinced\" that the businesses it was selling to Disney would find the \"right strategic home\" at <person><nameText>Comcast.</nameText></person></p><p>Mr Roberts said that the company was \"disappointed\" when 21st Century Fox decided to sell to Disney last year when <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>had offered more. 21st Century Fox pointed to concerns that regulators could scupper such a deal.</p><p><person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>has offered to pay a $2.5 billion termination fee to 21st Century Fox if the deal is blocked, the same offered by Disney. <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>also said that it would pay the $1.5 billion fee that 21st Century Fox would owe to Disney if it walks away from their deal.</p><p>21st Century Fox said last night that it would \"carefully review and consider the <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>proposal\".</p><p>Shares in 21st Century Fox closed up 7.7 per cent at a record high of $43.66 in New York last night, with Disney shares rising by 1.9 per cent to $106.31 and those of <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>shares closing down by 0.2 per cent at $32.32.</p><p>                     Ruling paves way for flurry of mega deals                     Wall Street's dealmakers had waited with bated breath for Tuesday's night's judgment in the court battle between AT&amp;T and the Department of Justice, so when Judge Richard Leon ruled decisively against the government, after a six-week trial, the champagne corks began popping (James Dean writes).</p><p>The ruling has paved the way for a flurry of monster deals to proceed in the media, telecoms and healthcare industries, and for new ones to be brokered. Nearly all have the same thing in common: they are do-or-die attempts to counter the power of Big Tech.</p><p>AT&amp;T's core business is content distribution and Time Warner's is content creation. The companies argue that a merger is necessary to help them to challenge Netflix, the $161 billion video streaming company that recently surpassed Walt Disney to become the world's most valuable entertainment business.</p><p>The same argument is proffered by Disney and <person><nameText>Comcast </nameText></person>as they vie for 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets. Traditional media companies are also being squeezed for advertising revenue by Google and Facebook, which dominate the digital world.</p><p>The AT&amp;T and Time Warner tie-up is a \"vertical\" merger, in that two distinct companies combine without removing a competitor from the market. A proposed marriage of CVS, the $70 billion pharmacy chain, and Aetna, the $62 billion health insurer, also fits this category and is now less likely to be challenged by the DoJ's competition division. Their companies' shares were up by 2.4 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively, yesterday morning.</p><p>Cigna, another health insurer, is seeking to buy Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager, for $67 billion. Their shares were respectively down by 1.3 per cent and up by 3.8 per cent.</p><p>Amazon, the $825 billion ecommerce giant, hinted last year that it could start delivering pharmaceuticals by post, which is big business in the United States. In February Amazon said it was setting up a healthcare company to cut employee medical costs. Many believe that this is a precursor to a broader push into healthcare.</p><p>T-Mobile US's proposed $26 billion acquisition of Sprint is more likely to face scrutiny as it is a \"horizontal\" merger of competitors. T-Mobile US, valued at $48 billion, is the No 3 network and Sprint the No 4. It is the third time in four years that they have tried to merge. Their shares were up by 1.4 per cent yesterday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-44727278</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJJ-71J1-F021-60BY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"882\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 14, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002IHB</classCode><className>TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX FILM CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.
