So no trading on Wall Street.  No hour before the closing bell, instead a moment to really look and see what's been happening elsewhere.  Two up and two down in the European markets with some good gains seen there.  But the best gains of the day without the U.S. was in China where the shanghai composite was up some 2.5%.  A strong rise on the back of prospects for trade talks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Look at the markets that were open, and this is what was moving them.  Honda is reportedly pulling the plug on a British factory and it says it has got nothing to do with Brexit.  U.K. spies say they are ready to take the risk on Huawei's technology.  And flights grounded and travelers stranded, another European airline goes bankrupt.  What is going wrong?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Live from the world's financial capital.  What a spectacular view.  There is the Statue of liberty over there on Presidents' Day, on Monday, it is the 18th of February.  I'm Richard Quest.  I mean business.</p><p>Good evening.  Once viewed as an engine of the British economy, it is now in deep trouble -- automobiles.  Honda is reportedly preparing to close its only U.K. factory and relocate the production back to Japan.  It's a factory in Swindon and it employs about 3,500 people.  The reports come only weeks before Britain is set to leave the E.U.  A local MP claims that Brexit was not or is not the driving force behind Honda's decision.</p><p>Despite those claims, a trend is becoming clear.  Japanese car giants seem to be getting very much cold feet, serious worries over their British plants.  The red light, for example, Honda's factory has been in Swindon since 1989.  Some 160,000 Honda Civics were made there last year.  Now, it looks set to be showing that plant the red light, closure with the loss of those jobs as production is consolidated back into Japan.</p><p>And in terms of other carmakers, Nissan is proceeding with caution.  Now, Nissan's case, it's Sunderland.  And that was the first in Britain that really was the resurgence of car production in 1986.  Just last month, Nissan scrapped plans to build its new X-TRAIL SUV there.  And Honda -- I am sorry, Toyota has been sending out its own warning signals about its Derbyshire plant.  It says production will temporarily be halted in the event of a no-Brexit deal.</p><p>Whichever way you look at it, all the carmakers seem to be suggesting, at best warnings, at worst slow and stop.  Anna Stewart is with me from London.  The announcement of Honda coming on the back of worries from the other, the Japanese carmakers were the first to warn that they would move out in the event of Brexit.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, REPORTER, CNN:  They warned again and again and again, and this of course comes at a time when the U.K. is trying to negotiate an agreement with Japan to try and replicate what they've managed to get between the E.U. and Japan, which is now a free trade agreement, and it is one reason why Japanese factories are going to be able to export straight from Japan.  They don't as much need a European base.</p><p>But the U.K. is falling back here, and Honda have not actually confirmed this yet, Richard, but the MP for the area essentially said that this news came out before they were able to speak to their workers.  Three and a half thousand of them who tonight will be very worried about the future.</p><p>QUEST:  Toyota, if you'll remember, and the Japanese Ambassador in London were amongst the first to warn of the problems.  The Japanese government from Tokyo even put out a warning early on to the British government.  And only last month, we heard that the Japanese Prime Minister with Theresa May.</p><p>So Japan is leading the way, if you would like, in negotiating what comes next.</p><p>STEWART:  Quite, and if you read the \"Financial Times\" today, Richard, you will see from uncited sort of sources in Japan that apparently they feel that U.K. has been very high-handed in these talks.  And that the U.K. is not giving them an easy ride here.  The U.K. wants to have a deal.  It wants it now.  It wants it several months ago.</p><p>[15:05:05]</p><p>STEWART:  And frankly, it needs it because anything shipping today to Tokyo will only just make it in time for the Brexit deadline, but the negotiations appear to have hit a bit of a stumbling block.  And they are meant to be going on this week.  I spoke to the Trade Department today, they said, you know, there's nothing to report yet.  We can't discuss it.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, now, Anna, you've been watching Brexit as closely since the whole thing -- since the referendum.  The U.K. has done numerous side deals.  It announced the latest one with Israel in the last few days.  These deals only take place what?  After the two-year transitional period or I imagine in the event of no-deal Brexit almost immediately?</p><p>STEWART:  Yes, crucially in the event of a no-deal Brexit, most of them will take place the very next day.  Some of them are just mutual agreements, we had an important one with the United States over the weekend.  That replicates the situation at the moment for certain sectors.  Some will replicate actual trade agreements, for instance, Israel, Switzerland, Faroe Islands, but still, we're missing our big, big trading partners like Japan, like Australia.  We need more here is what I'm hearing from business leaders.</p><p>QUEST:  Anna Stewart, keep watching.  There are many developments in the days ahead.  We'll need you to be fully on top of them.  Thank you.  China is accusing the United States and its allies of bullying Huawei.  That's in response to the U.S. Vice President, Mike Pence, who over the weekend said the U.S. has been very clear with its security partners on the threat by the Chinese telecoms companies, such as Huawei.</p><p>Now, Mike Pence was talking collectively about what is known as the \"Five Eyes.\"  This is New Zealand -- well, the Five Eyes are the five countries who share intelligence information and data seamlessly.  It is the highest level of intelligence cooperation.  And obviously, it is Canada, U.S., New Zealand, Australia and the U.K.</p><p>New Zealand and Australia have already banned Huawei's equipment from their 5G networks.  Canada is considering the same.  The U.S. is leading the way.  And now the U.K. is saying it might a manageable risk.  As for China, officials there say it's all a ploy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GENG SHUANG, SPOKESMAN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY (Through a translator):  The U.S. and some of its allies have double standards on this to mislead the public.  The real purpose behind this is to make excuses to hammer the legitimate rights of Chinese companies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Going back to the Five Eyes, as I was suggesting, the U.K. in its latest threat assessment from the National Cybersecurity Center on Huawei says there are ways to limit the risks involved in using Huawei's equipment.  Now, that may undermine the American campaign and you can start to see it is going to get rather nasty.</p><p>Samuel Burke is in London.  Exactly what is the U.K. saying about Huawei and which already has its equipment in BT's infrastructure.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Richard, what the U.K. is saying here is basically even if there are problems, we know how to find them and we know how to patch them.  And that is much more in line with what I've been hearing from cybersecurity experts for years.  They've said even if these problems exist, a country like the U.K., U.S., New Zealand, which ever one of these countries can go in and repair this problem.</p><p>So, yes, it may upset the United States, but as you're talking about the Five Eyes there, do you really think that the U.S. is going to treat the U.K. the way Mike Pompeo is suggesting, the Secretary of State of the United States in Hungary last week?  These are countries with deep roots, deep ties, and one can't imagine all of a sudden the Five Eyes stop sharing information with each other the way the U.S. was threatening to do in a way with Hungary just last week.</p><p>QUEST:  Well, you say that, you say that, but this might be the linchpin of any such deal.  And what about our next guest, who we are going to hear from, who says that whilst it is a Five Eyes problem, he says that the real issue is not so much listening and spying and all of that sort of stuff, but if Huawei is suddenly instructed by the Chinese government not to fix a patch, not to repair, not to maintain.</p><p>BURKE:  It was fascinating what Huawei responded to that today saying maybe the United States is just upset because they don't have an American leader in 5G so that they can listen in on the world.  It's classic China to flip the script like that.  But that is the reality and why we've been reporting on this program for years that if a government requests a back door, whether it's the United States and the San Bernardino terrorist attack or the Chinese requesting it from a company like Huawei, a back door means an open door for so many groups, not just the country at hand.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, but what about if Huawei just decides not to service it?  If there's a problem or a fix or a patch and Huawei just says, \"We're not going to deal with it.\"  You know, \"Over to you now, U.K. government.\"</p><p>[15:10:09]</p><p>QUEST:  \"It's on your own head.\"</p><p>BURKE:  That's a huge problem if Huawei doesn't fix it, but what the U.K. is saying here, Richard is that we can fix it.  They can take the Huawei equipment, which I have seen on top of the buildings in the city, for instance.  They're saying right now in a very clear message, we understand how the equipment works.  We can go in and repair the equipment.  We can change the equipment.  And that is a very different tune from what the United States has been saying for really years now.</p><p>QUEST:  Samuel, thank you for the overview on that.  One of the important points is that the U.K. has actually had this committee running for some four years.  It's a major committee that looks at Huawei working with the company investigating all its technology.</p><p>Nigel Inkster served as Director of Intelligence and Operations at the U.K.'s MI6.  Now, a senior adviser for the International Institute for Strategic Studies.  He is the author of a book on China's cyber power.  On the line from London earlier, he said there's another risk to consider when you look at the whole spying question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIGEL INSKTER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND OPERATIONS, MI6:  The first thing we have to say is the report that's come out from the NCSC is a technical report.  It doesn't represent the final U.K. position on this.  It is simply looking at this from the technical aspect.</p><p>And I think what the NCSC says is probably true for all normal operating situations.  In other words, in relation to normal and everything is going fine.  But I can't help wondering whether it's given sufficient thought to the prospect of a serious downturn in relations, difficulties with China to the point where the Chinese state tells Huawei, \"Okay, now you need to stop sending all the code patches that will be necessary to keep this situation working.  Basically, we want you to take the British offline.\"</p><p>And I'm not sure to what extent that's been looked at.  This is not about --</p><p>QUEST:  The fear here is not so much of them eavesdropping or data being sent back to Beijing, you're saying the fear here is essentially that -- the old one of, \"Well, we're no longer going to support it.  You're on your own, mate.\"</p><p>INKSTER:  Well, that is it, indeed, and done for political reasons.  I mean, I think it's fairly clear that China has been stealing a lot of British secrets using cyberattacks, which have not been dependent upon Huawei core technology, and I expect they will continue doing that any way.</p><p>QUEST:  If the U.K. does go ahead because it believes there's a manageable risk and uses Huawei equipment and technology whilst the U.S. continues to exhort its allies not to touch anything with Huawei in it, does this put the Five Eyes security pact at risk?</p><p>INKSTER:  Yes, it does, which is why I suspect that this report, which as I said before is a technical report, is really only part of the process.  And it seems to me in an ideal world, it would have been better to keep it back until the government as a whole, through the National Security Council and the Cabinet who have had an opportunity to look at all the factors, in particular this very important strategic factor, because for the United Kingdom, the relationship -- the Five Eyes relationship has for the last seven years been a very important component of the U.K. National Security, and I don't think that they can easily afford to play fast and loose with that.</p><p>My feeling is that when the crunch comes, they're probably going to have to make the decision to follow the U.S. lead.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>INKSTER:  But obviously, that's not a decision that's yet been taken.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  As we continue, the world's second richest man, Bill Gates, says he doesn't fear a debate about socialism in the United States, Capitalism can wait.  Digital gangsters -- U.K. lawmakers are giving Facebook a big thumbs down.  We'll explain.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  U.K. lawmakers are sending a message to Facebook that it is not your friend.  They liken the social media giant in their words, digital gangsters and consider themselves beyond the law.  A Parliamentary committee found the company intentionally and knowingly violated data privacy and competition.</p><p>It also accused the CEO, Mark Zuckerberg of contempt for refusing to come and answer its questions.  The Committee's Chair spoke to CNN and elaborated on the gangster analogy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, CHAIR, U.K. DIGITAL, CULTURE, MEDIA AND SPORT SELECT COMMITTEE:  We've referred to Facebook as sort of digital gangsters because we believe that it's not a question just of mistakes being made on the platform, but they're fully aware of these as a company, aware of issues around the way in which they gather user data and share that with other developers.  I think, often without the users really understanding that's what's going on.</p><p>The aggressive position they take against other developers that work with the platform, including making decisions that can lead to those businesses closing, and I think their persistent failure to deal effectively with harmful content.  They have got the technical know-how to sell us products based or to help advertisers to sell their products based on a deep understanding of everything we do on Facebook, so why can't they do more to use the same technology to address harmful and illegal content that shouldn't be there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Donnie O'Sullivan is with me.  The one thing about the select committee, they would have looked at this in great detail.  This is not the U.S. Senators reading prepared questions and getting and showing incompetence.  The Select Committee will be highly informed on this, so how should we address their criticisms?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, REPORTER, CNN:  This was a hugely detailed investigation.  It went for more than 18 months.  Hundreds of interviews and they spoke to experts all around the world.  They even took a trip to Washington, D.C. in an attempt to try and get Mark Zuckerberg to appear.  He repeatedly refused to come in front of the committee.</p><p>QUEST:  Why, do you think?  Why?</p><p>O'SULIVAN:  I mean, Facebook's argument would say, \"Well, we can't send our CEO to every Parliament in the world.\"  And I think the U.K. lawmakers said, \"Well, you know, we have 60 million people here.  We are one of your biggest markets and we have been investing a lot of time into this investigation.\"  So Damian Collins, the MP who leads the committee that you saw there, he actually said that Zuckerberg showed contempt towards Parliament.</p><p>QUEST:  I can see arguments on both sides on that, but as to this fundamental accusation, allegation that they are digital gangsters that they are knowingly behaving in a way that they know is against the law or against practice.</p><p>O'SULIVAN:  So, the Committee's main findings are based on a trove of internal Facebook e-mails that the Committee was able to get their hands on through a very long story, but through a court case that was brought in California against Facebook.</p><p>[15:20:10]</p><p>O'SULIVAN:  And in those e-mails, including Zuckerberg, Collins, the head MP characterized those e-mails as showing the company saying, \"Wow, if people knew -- if our users knew how much data we were actually taking from them, they might be concerned,\" and also and designing tools which made it deliberately misleading or difficult to make yourself fully private on Facebook.</p><p>So what Collins is saying and what the Committee are saying is the era of self-regulation in tech should be over.  Now, I mean, these are only the Committee's recommendations.  The U.K. government has I think about eight weeks to respond.  And they're not obligated to act, but this is a scathing report, and I think one that will be taken notice.</p><p>We know that the Culture Secretary, Jeremy Wright is meeting Zuckerberg in Silicon Valley this week.  So it's likely that this report will come up in conversation.</p><p>QUEST:  I mean, Facebook gets it from all sides.  From your reading of this, how much justification is there for this?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN:  Well, I mean, it's not just an issue with Facebook.  It's an issue with all of tech.  You know, we don't talk about Google a lot.  Twitter is a much smaller player, but they also have a huge part to play in this.  So you're right, this whole report was about Facebook essentially.  And our colleague, Hadas Gold asked them today, they said, why have you focused so much on Facebook if this was supposed to be about disinformation?  And they said, \"Well, they're the biggest player in the game.\"</p><p>QUEST:  I was just about to say, they're the biggest player.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Bill Gates says it's good to debate whether big tech companies pay their fair share in society.  The founder of Microsoft spoke about the recent anti-billionaire backlash, he was talking to CNN's Fareed Zakaria who asked him if leaders like Howard Schultz, former CEO of Starbucks can be taken seriously as a political candidate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>BILL GATES, CO-CHAIR, BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION:  The success you have in your life before you run for office, absolutely gives us a sense of your leadership skills, your understanding of very complex problems.  You know, the voters decide in general who helped win the war, World War II, is that a good qualification or not?</p><p>Howard Schultz did a great job with his business, so there's some things that he gets some deep understandings from.  Likewise, somebody who has been a mayor or a governor, they have been in an executive role as well.</p><p>So I do think it is fine.  You probably will find rich people disproportionately in your political representation, but you wouldn't expect it to be more than like 5% of the representatives as a whole.</p><p>FAREED ZAKARIA, ANCHOR, CNN:  Do you understand, though, the kind of -- all this backlash against capitalism and capitalists?  So you have this with Amazon in New York, where there was a backlash of saying why should New York provide $3 billion of tax subsidies to one of the richest companies in the world?  I mean, you, Microsoft has had to deal with these issues in Seattle, I imagine.  Do you feel like we're in a new mood?  Do you either worry or how do you feel when you see this kind of thing happening?</p><p>GATES:  Well, it's not the 1930s, where the system has really failed to provide adequate services, and therefore a lot of people are flirting with dramatic changes, what used to be called socialism in the narrow sense.  These are good debates.</p><p>Should companies be able to compete states against each other to get these subsidies?  I sort of think not.  But, hey, that is a separate issue.  That is not an attack on capitalism.  Capitalism has hundreds of parameters that you can change like the estate tax, the capital gains tax, and it is still capitalism.  As long as you have market-based pricing, and you let people create new companies very easily, and you know, if you think there is a lack of competition in some places, and you come in and intervene on that.</p><p>Part of the reason I think people should say, \"Okay, some things are going well overall,\" is that flirting with radical change, and dramatic change, and how we run these systems, and I personally, my vote would be not to make a radical change.</p><p>Now, you could say I am biased, because this system has worked very well for me, and I plead guilty to that, but as I look overall at the capitalist economies, there's a lot of good things and I think you can tune the tax parameters and get way more equity and get some additional government services and still be in the same basic framework.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  We'll talk about this because Amazon seems to have been one of the beneficiaries of the legal, but unpopular tax parameters that Bill Gates is speaking about.</p><p>[15:25:08]</p><p>QUEST:  The retail giant hasn't paid any taxes to the U.S. government in the past two years, despite earning a record $10 billion last year.</p><p>And New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio is blasting Amazon for pulling the plans to build a second headquarters in the city.  He called it an abusive corporate power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY:  They said they wanted a partnership, but the minute there were criticisms, they walked away.  What does that say to working people?  That a company would leave them high and dry simply because some people raised criticism?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Greg LeRoy is the Executive Director of the campaign group, Good Jobs First who joins us from Washington.  It is useful to begin a discussion like this just to understand the parameters.  You are not against corporate subsidies or tax benefits to corporations in the right circumstances, is that right?</p><p>GREG LEROY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GOOD JOBS FIRST:  Yes, Richard, that's right and thanks for having me.  Look, there is a place for incentives.  If you're going to bring a grocery store to a food desert, the private market is not doing that.  If a citizen returning from incarceration needs new skills to get a better second chance in life, that's a completely appropriate use of government funding.</p><p>But too many of these programs have become sort of automatic \"gimmes.\"  Developers and big companies like Amazon expect them.  That's the problem.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, so you have got Foxconn, I think it was in Wisconsin.  You have got Amazon.  Were you surprised that Amazon folded its tent quite so quickly?</p><p>LEROY:  I was because I thought that Amazon had a strong business case for being in New York.  I thought there was a strong business logic for their choice, but I also wasn't surprised because we know this company is thin-skinned.</p><p>We know from the way they handled the issue of the very small head tax in Seattle to help create homeless shelters and some more affordable housing, the very heavy handed way they helped defeat that law that they don't want people questioning their behavior, and that's why they backed off from the table even though the Mayor and Governor were trying to broker things for them in New York.</p><p>QUEST:  The debate over New York, I mean, relative to the amount of tax revenue or economic benefit that Amazon would have brought to Long Island, we can argue about whether or not it needs it, we can argue about, is it a thriving place to start, but there would have been an economic benefit.  That benefit is relatively small -- sorry -- the mount of subsidy is relatively small to the overarching economic benefit.</p><p>LEROY:  I actually don't know that that's true.  The cost of a $122,000.00 per job that we knew about.  There was one incentive that was not yet disclosed.  That means that the average worker at Amazon would have to generate $122,000.00 more in state and local taxes over time than public services they and their families would consume.  That's a big number to overcome.</p><p>I think it's in the gray area.  I would like to see the math on that and because we also know that Amazon is so good at tax dodging, as you pointed out, they have not paid Federal income tax for two years. They get about 20 different incentive packages around the country for their warehouses and datacenters and white collar employment centers.  This is a very aggressive company that are not paying taxes.</p><p>QUEST:  You can't blame them.  I mean, at the end of the day though, tax avoidance is good for shareholders, good for stakeholders.  Arguably, good for wage increases when you look at Amazon, of course, as it did raise the minimum wage that it pays.</p><p>LEROY:  When they announced the $15.00 an hour for its warehouse workers, in part because of pressure from people like Senator Bernie Sanders, it was actually a pay cut for some people because they eliminated some bonuses and some stock options.  And I think the reality was, in some labor markets they were paying above that to begin with.</p><p>So this is a company again that was very sensitive to market realities, but it has resisted unionization.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  Would you say you can sum up the Amazon issue with good riddance?</p><p>LEROY:  Well, you know, I was so heartened to see Bill Gates oppose the war among the states.  This is a problem that we've had for many decades and look, Amazon already has thousands of employees in New York City, and they will continue to grow there as do Google and Facebook and many other dozens of tech companies because it's a great labor market for tech companies.  They just won't be getting billions of dollars from taxpayers that they don't need.</p><p>QUEST:  Greg, good to see you, sir.  Thank you.</p><p>LEROY:  Likewise.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll talk more about this in the future.  Thank you.  As we continue, after days of violent protests, eight people have been arrested in Haiti, five of them are American.  We're live in Port-au-Prince in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00]  RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment.  When Uber is racing against its rivals to get to Wall Street.  You're going to hear from the president of the major competitor, principal competitor in the U.S. Lyft.</p><p>And one of the most famous names in aviation is celebrating its 100th birthday with a makeover.  And you makeover in the future by going back to the past.  Before that, this is CNN, and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>The U.S. and North Korea could be about to take a step towards formal diplomatic ties.  We're hearing sources in Washington and Pyongyang are considering exchanging liaison officers.  The U.S. State Department didn't have a comment, but it comes ahead of a summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un later in the month.</p><p>California says it's joining forces with about a dozen U.S. states to sue President Trump over his declaration of a national emergency.  California officials accuse him of violating the constitution, and in their words, stealing money from his -- for his border wall from funds allocated by Congress for other purposes.</p><p>The top U.S. general leading the fight against ISIS spent several hours in northern Syria on Monday.  The General Joseph Votel rebuffed local allies request for American troops to stay on the ground.  Two U.S. military officials said at the beginning of the troop withdrawal from Syria is imminent.</p><p>In the U.K., seven MPs from the opposition Labor Party have abruptly resigned from the party, saying they're embarrassed and ashamed of their party's handling of Brexit.  The defectors represented growing call for a second referendum, they also expressed their lack of confidence in the handling of the Labor Party's scandal over anti-Semitism.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman is headed to India.  He spent two days in Pakistan where he signed investment deals worth $20 billion, kicking off a tour of Asia.  Pakistan's foreign minister also said Saudi Arabia has agreed to release more than 2,000 Pakistani prisoners.</p><p>[15:35:00]  In Haiti, authorities have arrested eight people, and that includes five Americans on charges of possessing illegal weapons.  This video shows them in Port-au-Prince police station.  The arrest follows days of protests over corruption, specifically over what happened to money made from subsidized Venezuelan oil.</p><p>Miguel Marquez joins me live from Port-au-Prince.  How did this all get so bad so quickly?</p><p>MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I mean, it depends on what you're talking about.  With regard to the arrests, it is -- we just spoke to the police chief for the national police who says they were picked up because they were in suspicious cars.</p><p>They had taken the license plates off of their cars, they were picked up, they had tons of weapons in the car including automatic weapons.  They had satellite phones, they had drones and lots of other handguns as well.  All of that was very suspicious.</p><p>They had first said they didn't cooperate, then they said they worked for the central bank, that didn't check out, they said they worked for others, nothing has checked out so far, they're being held on an illegal possession of weapons charge right now.</p><p>But an investigation is under way into who these guys are and what exactly they are doing here.  I can tell you that it is certainly throwing the entire country into a bit of a flip because no one can seem to answer who they are, what they were doing here and what their aim was.</p><p>QUEST:  So what's the fear?</p><p>MARQUEZ:  Well, the fear is -- so this all happens against the backdrop of these protests that have been going on for nine days.  Very serious protests that  rocked this country to its core.  Many in the government say that there are opposition leaders, there are -- there are foreign influences that are starting to fund the efforts to destabilize the government here.</p><p>That is the big concern, that's what a lot of people are jumping to, that's what people sort of think might be going on here, but it is not clear.  Do they work for the president? Do they work for the Prime Minister? Is there something else going on?</p><p>There are lots and lots of rumors floating throughout Haiti right now.  But right now, they know they're under arrest and an investigation is under way.</p><p>QUEST:  So last week when Haiti's president put out that statement, and made that address to the people, basically saying, let's all come together in the interest of Haiti.  Do I gather from what you're saying that nobody is listening?</p><p>MARQUEZ:  They are listening, but they also want him particularly to resign.  He came out and said let's all get together and blamed a lot of the concerns that they're experiencing right now on gangs and bad actors in society.  Are these individuals the sort of individuals he was referring to or is there something else?</p><p>The Prime Minister now says that there's a plan to cut government spending, to end the perks of government workers and to increase the minimum wage here.  Are people -- people are perhaps somewhat hopeful that, that may produce --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>MARQUEZ:  Something, but they want to see results.  People across the spectrum here, middle class to very poor Haitians are tired of it.  They say, they want to see results.  Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Miguel, back to those arrested with their cache of guns and  armaments, is there a worry that foreign national -- foreign governments, the U.S, anybody else is starting to interfere in what would be called the internal affairs of  Haiti? And if there are, which governments might it be?</p><p>MARQUEZ:  Well, that is certainly grist for the rumor mill out there, and that's what people are talking about.</p><p>However, what the president and what those in power, what officials are saying is that there are groups out there, perhaps not  government groups, but either powerful business interests, drug interests, other illegal or criminal interests out there that are funding these activities on the streets, getting people out there that these are not just an expression of democratic desire, that this is being engineered by somebody other than the people on the street and the Haitian people.</p><p>That is the concern --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>MARQUEZ:  And that's what has the arrest of these individuals just so tantalizing to so many Haitians right now.</p><p>QUEST:  Miguel Marquez, thank you, we'll talk to you about more of this during the week as we progress, thank you.</p><p>MARQUEZ:  You got it.</p><p>QUEST:  If you believe Uber's new CEO, the company has turned a corner when it comes to culture.  Lyft's president has harsh words for his rival.  Both Uber and Lyft racing to the IPO after the break.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Well, welcome back.  The president of Lyft tells CNN it's important for his company to go public.  You'll hear from John Zimmer in just a moment.  We need to understand why though Lyft competes with Uber on the street, and now it's competing in the race to Wall Street.</p><p>Both companies Lyft and Uber have filed confidential plans.  Now, who will file first? Who will get there first? Well, the arrival time for Uber looks like it's going to be sometime around about mid of year.  And the arrival time for Lyft roughly the same.</p><p>The buzz is both want to be first, but obviously you can only have one first.  And then, of course, if you're first, well, the other one risks being compared, and you don't want to be compared to the second one.  Actually, the two are not  comparable at all in terms of it.</p><p>Uber is a platform, you can ride, you can hail, you have Uber eats, and most  crucially, Uber has global reach.  Lyft on the other hand is focused just on North America.  So if your IPO at the same time, you're really comparing apples and oranges between the two.</p><p>As for what happens, well, Lyft is banking on a better corporate image.  Uber's last driver drove off sometime before investors really got angry and fired him.  That covers the what? When and how of this particular launch.  Poppy Harlow asked Lyft's president exactly why it's important to take the company public.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN ZIMMER, FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT, LYFT:  It's important for our drivers and passengers and, you know, main street USA to have access to wealth creation.  And I think that's important.  It's important -- and they're important for our team members, our employees to have liquidity and get value from the hard work they're putting in.</p><p>It's important to create a currency and get the right to valuation for the work that's happening.  And I think going public brings a certain amount of proper  accountability to businesses.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN:  The word on the street is that going to happen this Spring or Summer.  Can you give me an update on the timeline?</p><p>ZIMMER:  I cannot.</p><p>HARLOW:  Reporting has been that Lyft's valuation is around $15 billion.  Is that accurate?</p><p>ZIMMER:  I can't comment on that.</p><p>HARLOW:  How intent are you on Lyft having a public offering before Uber?</p><p>[15:45:00]  ZIMMER:  Also something I can't comment on.  In -- at a high-level -- how the company finances itself, again is less important than the mission and the execution.</p><p>HARLOW:  Are you concerned about a conflicting IPO with Uber? Meaning, do you have any concern if Uber were to beat you to the public market and beat you on an offering day?</p><p>ZIMMER:  Of all the things that we faced over the last six years, this is not something I'm concerned about.</p><p>HARLOW:  Is Uber a more formidable competitor, John, now with Dara leading than with Travis Kalanick and the controversy that surrounded him?</p><p>ZIMMER:  No.</p><p>HARLOW:  It's not?</p><p>ZIMMER:  No.</p><p>HARLOW:  Do you think Dara has changed the culture?</p><p>ZIMMER:  I don't know, I don't -- I don't -- obviously don't work there.</p><p>HARLOW:  Is there anything you admire about Uber?</p><p>ZIMMER:  I think I'm going to say no.</p><p>HARLOW:  Nothing.</p><p>ZIMMER:  That's a really -- there's a lot of levels to that experience over the last few years, so it would be hard for me to say anything, but that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Brutal.  When we return, a U.K. airline is grounded for good.  The plane's Brexit's turbulence for its untimely end.  In a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  So, we started this morning talking about Honda and jobs from the swindle-in factory.  Well, on the road or in the skies, Britain is beginning to feel the deepening effects of Brexit.  Honda seems to announce a closing of an English factory.</p><p>And now the British airline BMI or FlyBMI claims it's being  grounded by the U.K.'s uncertain economic future.  Four hundred staff and thousands of travelers are stranded, it's tough of course without a job.  FlyBMI's story at the moment is not far from unique.</p><p>Faced with rising fuel costs, environmental taxes and fierce competition, more low-cost carriers have been driven out of business.  So Monarch went, that was a British, been around for years, Primera Air, European, Fly VLM, gone, Global gone, Germania, that was a shocked one, that went, FlyBMI gone.</p><p>You get the idea.  Get out your phones, go to cnn.com-slash-join.  Tonight, we're asking you, in this environment, when you're flying, what's the most important thing choosing the airline to fly on?</p><p>[15:50:00]  Is it the price? Is it the service? Is it the loyalty program or is it the schedule? When you are paying -- and well, let's make it your own money.  When you're paying out your own money, which is more important? The price, the service, the loyalty program or the schedule? Go to cnn.com-slash-join and you will see the results on your screen.</p><p>Simon Calder is a senior travel editor at \"The Independent\", he joins me live from London.  Simon, FlyBMI is blaming partly on Europe or Brexit because it said, it couldn't give contractual certainty for European contracts.  Are you going -- are buying that?</p><p>SIMON CALDER, SENIOR TRAVEL EDITOR, THE INDEPENDENT:  Yes, while every single corporation on this side of the Atlantic which has problems blames Brexit for it, actually FlyBMI has pretty good grounds for doing so.  All the way from the collapse of the pound sterling against the U.S. dollar immediately after the referendum to leave the European Union through to the  fact that here we are about 38 days out from when the U.K. leaves the EU, and no U.K. airline knows what its rights will be to fly in Europe.</p><p>And if 40 percent of your flying as was the case with FlyBMI is within Europe, as it were domestically within the 27 remaining states of the European Union, and you don't know if you're going to be able to do that this Summer, and you can't sign any other contracts with big corporations in order to get some work from them.</p><p>Then you're rather stuck.  Add to that, of course, the softness of the U.K. economy  because of all the uncertainty around, and it's a dreadful time to be a regional airline of this scale that FlyBMI a bit was, which was tiny.  Ryanair; the biggest European budget giant flies as many people in a day --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>CALDER:  And a half as FlyBMI did for the whole of last year.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, but FlyBMI, separate company, separate airline, but similar problems.  Fly B, of course, which is just --</p><p>CALDER:  Yes --</p><p>QUEST:  Sold itself off, tried again regional flights in Britain.  I'm wondering, do these regional carriers ever stand much chance of success?</p><p>CALDER:  Well, it all depends where they are, Richard, so in the United States, you've got a whole range of feeder airlines working for these big network carriers, and they have been going for years and they're doing a pretty good job, I think, people would say both in terms of you know, actually making some money and delivering decent service.</p><p>The big problem here in Europe is that the low-cost giants, Ryanair and EasyJet are so dominant that they will just sit there and watch while an airline like Fly B builds up a route, and when it reaches a certain market size, they will just --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>CALDER:  March in because they've got bigger aircraft and economies of scale, more efficient --</p><p>QUEST:  Simon --</p><p>CALDER:  Operations, they'll just take out all the passengers.</p><p>QUEST:  Simon, stay with me, don't go away because while some carriers are grounded after a few years in business, one British aviation institution has made it to a whole century.  British Airways is celebrating a 100 years since its maiden  flight with a plane repainted in the old B-O-A-C design 7400.</p><p>And all go fly from London to Paris with a single passenger, and the flight which I think is flatly worth coming across to New York tomorrow.  Simon, a 100 years of BA.  The -- what do you make of the strength and weakness?</p><p>CALDER:  Well, British Airways has actually turned itself around.  It was like so many big European airlines, effectively a branch of government up until the mid  '80s when it was about the first big carrier to be privatized.</p><p>Now in private hands, part of the IAG consortium, along with Iberia of Spain, Aer Lingus of Ireland and so on.  And it of course got the strangle-held the most routes at the world's most in-demand airport which is London Heathrow where  that 747 landed this morning at about 10:20 local time.</p><p>So they got lots of advantages, they do play to their strengths, but of course, they are in the most competitive aviation market --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>CALDER:  In Europe, possibly the world.</p><p>QUEST:  Simon, what was the -- I think it was either Imperial Airways or Empire Airways or something like it when it originally started.  And Simon, finally for you, the man who pays his own way, what's the most important to you when choosing an airline? Price, schedule, loyalty or service?</p><p>[15:55:00]  CALDER:  The -- so fares that I pay you certainly, you're not going to get any loyalty bonuses these days, I'm afraid, price is the top, but schedule, and then service, I guess is in third place, thank goodness, Richard, we can pretty much in all the flights that you and I and your lovely viewers are likely to take be absolutely assured of safety.</p><p>QUEST:  All right, which is why it doesn't appear in the list.  Good to see you, Simon, thank you very much, indeed.  Simon joining me.  Now, according to those votes, let's have a look.  Price is the most important factor when you are picking your own airline.</p><p>As to what investors on Wall Street will be looking at, well, investors of course today was a day off in the U.S., Presidents' Day, but trading did continue over in London.  So we will finish this part with a look at that.  Two down and two up.  The shares though remaining at a near four-month high, not surprisingly auto shares  slumped over concern over the new U.S. tariffs.</p><p>French stocks, CAC Quarante extended its rally and they rose almost 4 percent last week and good gains as it continued over there.  New York will open up tomorrow morning, 9:30 as usual.  We will have a profitable moment after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, somewhat unfortunate on the day that FlyBMI goes bust, British Airways announces their repainted B-O-A-C 747 as part of a lovely re-celebration of a 100 years of flying.  It takes a certain amount of skill, it certainly takes a lot of systemic advantages, a strong hold on your hub, strong routes, proper labor relations, and eventually you can stay in business for some  time.</p><p>BA for example, B-O-A-C was before it, before that in 1939, it was Imperial Airways.  Now, of course, it's much more difficult to have the alliances with IAG, but fundamentally as our survey tonight shows, people look for the price.  People want the cheapest price for the best flight for the furthest that they can travel.</p><p>Which is a problem for those smaller airlines like FlyBMI, Fly B, and all the others.  Even Norwegian that simply can't compete.  It takes real skill to have been around for a 100 years and celebrate B-O-A-C and all that came before.</p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2183262641</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWM-6151-DY0W-434B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7323\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

Ahead this hour --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers from Europe to the United States are considering tighter oversight of social media after revelations that personal data of 50 million Facebook users was breached.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is stepping up his attack against the man leading the Russia investigation but Republican lawmakers are warning him, back off.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And (INAUDIBLE) close in but still no suspects -- police in Texas say they're hunting a serial bomber.</p><p>Hello everybody. Great to have you with us. I'm John Vause. The first of three hours, you're watching NEWSROOM L.A.</p><p>Well, Facebook and the data company Cambridge Analytica are at the center of a growing scandal which has enormous political and economic ramifications. Personal information is Facebook's currency and there are accusations that it's not protecting user data from misuse specifically during the 2016 presidential campaign. And that's raising deep concerns here in the United States as well as in Britain.</p><p>Isa Soares begins our coverage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I first met the CEO of Cambridge Analytica Alexander Nix nine days before the U.S. presidential election in 2016. A man confident he could get inside the mind of American voters by predicting and then attempting to alter their behavior.</p><p>ALEXANDER NIX, CEO, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: I think it's actually extremely robust and proven to be so time and again.</p><p>SOARES: His data helped this man win -- U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>who paid multi-million dollars for them to work their magic. But behind their winning method is more than just data crunching, it's a massive data grab, so says their former contractor now turned whistleblower Chris Wylie. CHRISTOPHER WYLIE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WHISTLEBLOWER: We spent almost a million dollars doing this. It wasn't some tiny, pilot project. It was the core of what Cambridge Analytica became. It allowed us to move into the hearts and minds of American voters in a way that had never been done before.</p><p>SOARES: And this is what Wylie says they did. Cambridge Analytica received data from a third party. A Professor Alexander Kogan based at the University of Cambridge, who was able to gather data on tens of millions of Americans through Facebook.</p><p>And then using a survey placed on Facebook, they asked users to take a personality test. The answers grouped people on their personality types. They combined it with voter history, what they buy, where they shop and what they watch on TV. And that enabled them to predict the personality of every adult in the United States and then target them with specific political ads.</p><p>But it goes further. By opting into these Facebook surveys each user was actually giving not just their data but that of many of their Facebook friends.</p><p>WYLIE: It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.</p><p>SOARES: Speaking to the U.K. Parliament Committee on data protection and fake news back in February, Cambridge Analytica denied they violated Facebook's terms.</p><p>NIX: They work with Facebook data, we don't have Facebook data. We do use Facebook as the platform to advertise as do all brands and most agencies, or all agencies I should say and we use Facebook as a means to gather data.</p><p>SOARES: The attention now turns to Facebook and how it reportedly allowed a data breach on this scale.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As I've said from the beginning --</p><p>SOARES: And more importantly how it was used to reach and influence voters ahead of the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>In a statement Facebook says the claim that this is a data breach is completely false and that those involved certified they had destroyed the data.</p><p>Meanwhile it says it's suspending the account of Chris Wylie, Cambridge Analytica as well as Professor Alexander Kogan who did not respond to our request for comment. If anything this shined a light in the dark heart of political advertising.</p><p>Isa Soares, CNN -- London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) VAUSE: Facebook has hired independent forensic auditors to conduct its own investigation. So for more on this, joining us now CNN's Andrew Stevens in Hong Kong; and in Oakland, California Jacob Ward, a fellow at the center for advanced study in behavioral sciences at Stanford University.</p><p>Jacob -- let's start with you. There's shock and anger that Cambridge Analytica would plunder the accumulated data of millions of Facebook users for political purposes -- why I do not know. There is shock and anger that Facebook allowed this to happen; again, why, I do not know.</p><p>But here is an old clip from Onion TV listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[00:04:59] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: After years of secretly monitoring the public we were astounded so many people would willingly publicize where they live, their religious and political views, an alphabetized list of all their friends, personal e-mail addresses, phone numbers, hundreds of photos of themselves and even status updates about what they were doing moment to moment. It is truly a dream come true for the CIA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: It's funny because it's true, you know.</p><p>JACOB WARD, FELLOW, CENTER FOR ADVANCED STUDY IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, STANFORD UNIVERSITY: That's right.</p><p>VAUSE: And this is the end result of essentially voluntarily giving up all of your private information.</p><p>WARD: That's absolutely correct. I mean John, you know, we're living -- I mean certainly Cambridge Analytica is sort of a cartoonish bad guy in this story. But the amazing thing, right, is that it's happening because that's exactly what Facebook is built for. You know, it was not -- certainly, you know, Cambridge Analytica used it in a way that it didn't give the company permission to use but it used it exactly as Facebook has intended to, to micro-target people. It's what Facebook is for as a business.</p><p>And when you put that also in the context as that Onion clip points out of us living in a world in which people are inviting companies to listen in on our conversation in our living rooms. Not only that, we're paying money to companies to put listening devices into our living rooms, to hand over pictures of our children that is being fed through facial recognition algorithms.</p><p>I mean the incredible range of things that we volunteer on a daily basis to these companies. I mean frankly I'm sort of glad that Cambridge Analytica is such a cartoonish bad guy so that people can sort of wake up, look around and go oh this isn't just about this sort of cute baby pictures I get from my neighbors.</p><p>This is about the future of truth and democracy and the free exchange of information. That feels like maybe a positive, a silver lining to an other wise pretty scary story.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, by sort of, you know, ripping the lid up all of this it has cost Facebook. So Andrew to you, Facebook had a pretty big fall in its share price on Monday and brought the market down with it. But that wasn't the only effect though from the big sell off on Wall Street but it was the biggest.</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It certainly was the biggest -- John, the biggest fall for Facebook in four years -- $36 billion right off their value.</p><p>And it wasn't just Facebook. It was the FAANGs which is an acronym for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. These are the big companies and they are all being hit, Facebook more than the others, for the same reason and that is these alleged breaches of security on personal data.</p><p>What is that going to mean for the reaction by government? How do they crack down on these big, big tech firms to ensure the security, the privacy of personal data which could come at a cost? But because if you think about it that personal data is at the very core of these companies' advertising strategies and that's where they're making money in advertising.</p><p>So if that gets crimped at all or significantly certainly that is going to hit the bottom line for these companies and that's why we're seeing this big selloff.</p><p>VAUSE: And back to you -- Jacob because, you know, what Andrew was saying, you know, one of the concerns for investors is actually the reverse for anyone who uses Facebook. You know, for the companies, the social media companies, there's a financial disincentive to give users more control over their own data, if people share less on Facebook and other social networks, they make less money.</p><p>WARD: That's absolutely correct. I mean, you know, for Facebook to now turn and say ok, we're going to be safeguarding, you know, clear and open communication between people that we're going to, you know, encourage the rise of more positive news or more truthful news -- all of that runs against their business model which we should all remember is simply keeping you on Facebook.</p><p>The more time you spend on Facebook, the more money they make. And anything that gets in the way of that cuts into their bottom line. And so, while on the one hand, I like to believe that a company like this would sort of take it seriously that they are the number one medium of choice for more than a third of the planet, I'd also like to point out that, you know, there isn't really a lot of money to be made in safeguarding democracy. The way they make money is by keeping us on Facebook and they'll do anything to do that.</p><p>VAUSE: Andrew -- just very quickly, what sort of regulations are lawmakers in Europe and the United States looking at or oversight or whatever? What can they do here? STEVEN: Well, at this stage they're investigating and that's all their saying right now, investigating exactly. And remember these are still reports, John, so they're being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic as to whether Facebook -- this happened and what Facebook's culpability was. And then they will take action.</p><p>But just to give you a sense of it, the European parliament saying this looked like a very clear breach of citizens' privacy -- a very, very clear breach. And in Europe that is a very big deal so they are likely to clamp down hard on this. Too early to say exactly what they would or would not do. But certainly, there'll be action.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. Jacob -- we'll finish up with you because over the weekend Cambridge Analytic hit Twitter and put out a fairly robust defense of its reputation. And one point it made was this. \"Advertising is not coercive. People are smarter than that.\" Really? People are smarter than that?</p><p>[00:10:04] WARD: Yes. It drives me crazy. That of all of the things that they put out publicly made me angriest.</p><p>We are working -- I'm in the middle right now of a two-year documentary project in which we have talked to Nobel prize-winning psychologist like Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel price-winning economist Richard Thaler.</p><p>All of these people, dozens of them, will tell you that that is total nonsense. That the human mind has a system by which it makes decisions. They call it heuristics (ph), the shortcuts by which you and I make decisions. And those short cuts, it turns out, are incredibly systematic across all cultures, even pre-modern cultures. We make the same decisions the same ways. Think of it as a programming language.</p><p>And so for all this talk about safeguarding democracy, Facebook and the rest of them are in the business of learning the programming language by which you and mi make decisions so that they can help to influence them. And so, you know, to say that advertising is not coercive, frankly I don't think coercive is a strong enough word for the power that these companies are about to hold over us.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. Jacob -- we'll leave it there. We're out of time but thank you so much and also Andrew in Hong Kong. Appreciate you being with us.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is back on the attack against the Russia investigation and he's targeting the special counsel Robert Mueller. On Monday he tweeted, \"It's a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest.\" The President lashed out at Mueller by name over the weekend, arguing his team is politically biased.</p><p>Republicans in Congress are warning the President to back off his attacks on Mueller. but there's not much support, at least among Republicans for legislation which would prevent the President from firing the special counsel. Well, for more on this, joining me now California talk radio host Ethan Bearman and Republican strategist Chris Faulkner. Good to see you guys. Thank you for coming in.</p><p>Ok. So we've got an increasing number of Republican lawmakers who are telling the President in no uncertain terms to simply lay off. Let's listen to a couple.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How would Republicans react if he fired Mueller?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think there would be a total upheaval at the Senate.</p><p>SENATOR ORRIN HATCH (R), UTAH: That would be the stupidest thing the President could do is fire him. Yes, he could do that but he's not going to do that. And shouldn't do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: You know -- And Chris, over the weekend, you know, Senator Lindsey Graham said if Trump was to fire Mueller it would be beginning of the end of his presidency. There's been a lot of talk.</p><p>Essentially they're doing nothing to protect the special counsel. There's legislation which is on hold before Congress to protect Mueller and they say it's not needed.</p><p>CHRIS FAULKNER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, if you look at the basic soft interest, most people can agree it's a bipartisan issue that most elected officials have. You know, if Republicans in Congress actually thought the President was going to jeopardize the majority in the House and the Senate by firing Mueller, they would pass legislation tomorrow.</p><p>They do not believe he's going to do that. So therefore there's no need to pass a law if there's not a need to do so.</p><p>VAUSE: What gives you this idea that he -- he's thought about it before.</p><p>FAULKNER: It's a fundamental Republican principle about it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: I get it. Every politician, you know, is out for himself, that's agreed on. But what is the indication that the President has no interest in firing Robert Mueller. I mean every indication is to the contrary, it seems.</p><p>FAULKNER: Every indication, other than he hasn't done it.</p><p>VAUSE: Yet.</p><p>FAULKNER: Right. Yet. You could say \"yet\" about almost anything the President has said. He hasn't done it yet. But if he wanted to -- if he was going to fire Mueller he already would have done it.</p><p>VAUSE: Ethan.</p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN, TALK RADIO HOST: Wow. A couple of things here. First off, President Trump just last year said he would sit down and testify with Robert Mueller. He said he would do that --</p><p>VAUSE: -- at the beginning of January.</p><p>BEARMAN: -- and again in January. Thank you.</p><p>And he has not done that and then he goes on the attack. But this is an effort to undermine the Mueller investigation so when something comes out he can say this whole thing is biased. The whole thing is terrible, none of it sticks. None of it matters. That's what's going on here.</p><p>Republicans for shame that they won't pass the legislation that needs to be passed. Although we could argue that it really is up to Rod Rosenstein to fire Robert Mueller and Rosenstein is not going to do that under the current circumstances.</p><p>VAUSE: To bad -- (INAUDIBLE) celebrity game, \"You're fired\".</p><p>BEARMAN: Yes. Right. I mean -- so yes, the Saturday night massacre could happen.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. So after -- what was it -- eight days ago, I think the President tweeted out that there would be no changes to his legal team. He's very happy with the team that was in place.</p><p>Well, there's been a new lawyer added to the President's personal legal team. It's a new attorney who seems to audition for the role by appearing on Fox News.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and if she didn't win the election to then frame <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>with a falsely created crime. Everything that we have seen from these texts and from all the facts developing shows that the FBI and senior DOJ officials conspired to violate the law and to deny <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>his civil rights.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. So Joe diGenova quickly played the role of pit bull. He won't take the lead but he will be the attack guy.</p><p>So I guess Chris -- that means there's next to no chance the President has plans of laying off Mueller.</p><p>FAULKNER: Well, presidents bring others (ph) personal legal defense team, of course, he's going to have somebody who's aggressive in personally defending him. I don't think anybody should be surprised by that. [00:15:07] If you are a high profile individual and you can afford to have a high profile legal defense team, you're going to hire someone who's going to aggressively pursue your case and aggressively makes sure that you have the possible defense he can possibly get.</p><p>VAUSE: Ethan, aggressively defending is one thing, trading in conspiracy theories I guess is something else.</p><p>BEARMAN: Yes, I don't understand what's happened to the Republican Party that suddenly it has become the home of conspiracy theories. Everybody is out to get him. Everything is dangerous. Everything -- Hillary Clinton -- everything is undermining democracy around the world.</p><p>Where is this coming from? But interestingly enough, that is a page, what he was just going, right out of the book Roy Cohn, which -- you know, that's the trainer of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>originally.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. So where is this coming from?</p><p>Well, here's part of reporting from the \"Washington Post\" which may explain why the President believes that the Mueller investigation is a partisan witch hunt.</p><p>\"Trump is not consulting with top advisers, including chief of staff John Kelly and chief White House lawyer Don McGahn on his Russian legal choices. All his comments about the probe, according to one person with knowledge of his actions, spoke on the condition of anonymity -- blah, blah, blah. He is instead watching television and calling friends.</p><p>Chris -- if by watching television this report means, you know, watching Fox News, then of course, he thinks it's a witch hunt ordered by President Hillary Clinton overseen by the U.N. national government.</p><p>FAULKNER: You know, we can continue to speculate on what the President watches or doesn't watch. Clearly someone is getting to go and leak this information to put it in the worst possible light because there is a continuing narrative, that everyone wants to promote in the media that the President is just too (INAUDIBLE) and watching the news all day.</p><p>VAUSE: We also do this.</p><p>FAULKNER: The inference is clearly there. But it --</p><p>VAUSE: Let me take you --</p><p>FAULKNER: -- continues to be a pattern that everyone wants to say well, the President is doing this because he's watching TV and throwing things at the television like he's Archie Bunker or something like that. Clearly that's not the case.</p><p>VAUSE: This is sort of the bubble in which the President chooses to live. You know, he goes from a campaign rally. He very rarely leaves, you know, the White House, (INAUDIBLE). You know, he watches Fox News.</p><p>FAULKNER: Most presidents don't leave the White House.</p><p>VAUSE: But at least they read the PDB and they listen to their advisors and they get outside advice. I mean this is a President who chooses what he watches and what he reads very, very carefully.</p><p>BEARMAN: Yes. And it's all a reality game show for him as well, of I'm going to pit one side against the other and see who wins in a battle of the wits. It's \"Survivor/Apprentice\" happening in the White House. And he's doing that with his legal team now, too, is what this is evidence of.</p><p>It's a level of instability that we have never seen in our lifetimes coming out of Washington D.C. And it's a very dangerous precedent. By the way, and what's going to happen next.</p><p>So when Mueller asks to sit down with President Trump, what is this -- this is going to be something that's battled all the way to the Supreme Court and it's going to be done in the ugliest way possible to further divide Americans.</p><p>VAUSE: We have a bit of idea what the Mueller team will be asking -- or they'd like to ask the President because there has been face-to- face meeting, or another one, between lawyers for Trump and the special counsel to talk about topics for this interview.</p><p>Here's part of that reporting. \"Mueller's team added granularity to the topics it originally discussed with the defense team months ago -- excuse me -- like the firing of FBI director James Comey. According to one of the sources, this time around for instance, the prosecutor said they would ask about Attorney General Jeff Sessions' involvement in the Comey dismissal and what Trump knew about national security advisor Michael Flynn's phone calls with then Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in late December 2016.\"</p><p>Again, you know, Chris -- if everything is above board, basic question why do we have such a cranky Commander-in-Chief and this also seems to indicate that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up by Thanksgiving. It's not wrapping up Christmas. It's not wrapping up by Easter. It's not wrapping up for a while.</p><p>FAULKNER: I think most Americans, myself included, we really want to give Bob Mueller the benefit of the doubt; long, long career in public service as a public servant; no indication to think that he would somehow be a bad actor in this or overly partisan.</p><p>But again, you just clearly read from leaked testimony, leaked documents, his special -- this special counsel, this special investigative process has been a non-stop leak-fest of things that the President supposedly said or didn't say and at some point they're eroding their own credibility to give (ph) critical investigation if they continue to leak things to the press and continue to involve attorneys that are clearly partisan hacks for the Democratic Party.</p><p>Fortunately Andrew McCabe is now no longer involved and hopefully we won't see any more of that. But this continual process of leaking this information and constantly talking about things that are supposed to be in confidence in terms of discussions with the President's attorneys is undermining their credibility to do their job.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>Although Ethan -- you know, a lot of the leaks have turned out to be true.</p><p>BEARMAN: Yes, they have. And by the way, who else complained the loudest about leaks was President Richard Nixon if I recall. And so this is --</p><p>VAUSE: And it failed him -- yes.</p><p>BEARMAN: Right. And so this is typically -- there is a lot of smoke happening here. There clearly are things that they're worried about being guilty of. President Trump, by the way, the one thing that I will give his legal team at all is that they're trying to protect him, just stop him from actually talking to Robert Mueller because as we now know the President in his words just makes things up when he talks to world leaders, so he'll probably do the same with Robert Mueller.</p><p>[00:20:04] VAUSE: Because (INAUDIBLE) an interesting relationship with the truth at times.</p><p>Chris, Ethan -- good to see you both.</p><p>BEARMAN: Thanks -- John.</p><p>FAULKNER: Thanks -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok.</p><p>Next here on NEWSROOM L.A., the U.S. military will resume its regular war games with South Korea but how will the North react? We'll take a look at what's at stake.</p><p>Also ahead, Russian President <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>won his fourth term with calls for Russian unity. But it remains to be seen if that means anything will actually change.</p><p>More on that when we come back.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, for weeks it's all been sunshine and roses between North and South Korea, a lot of friendly talk, playing together at the Olympics. But that newfound friendship might be tested soon with the announcement of the annual joint military drills by the U.S. and South Korea which will start April 1st and it's no joke.</p><p>Paula Hancocks live in Seoul this hour. So Paula, you know, the drills have been a big issue for the North. They were initially pushed back for the Winter Olympics to try and maintain the calm. So now they're back on. What's the potential here that these military drills could upset the applecart when it comes to the summit between <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and Kim Jong-un?</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, John -- the interesting things about this announcement that we have this morning, not that the drills are starting on April 1st but that the field training part of it, the (INAUDIBLE) is just going to be one month, this is according to a South Korean defense official.</p><p>Now usually these drills last for about two months so they are effectively halving the amount of time that that field training drill will take place. Interesting as well considering we heard from the Pentagon spokesman a few hours ago as well and he said that it would be at the same scale, scope and duration as previous years.</p><p>But clearly the amount of time that we are going to be seeing these drills going on is less. Now we have heard that there'll be 11,500 U.S. forces; 290,000 South Korean forces involved in this. There's also a computer simulation drill which goes for a couple of weeks.</p><p>But it's interesting if in fact these are shortened drills because there was a lot of speculation as to whether they would be going on during that potential meeting between the U.S. leader and the North Korean leader, much speculation that they would be shorter so that there wouldn't be that awkwardness or that potential for the thawing (ph) of relations to have an (INAUDIBLE) -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: Also in Finland, we had the face-to-face meeting between North and South Korean about the United States and the goal for the next round of talks. What more do we know?</p><p>HANCOCKS: Well, this is called the track 1.5 talks. They're not related to what we're expecting from <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and Kim Jong-un to be meeting. They're not preparation for that but they are an indication that the three sides are talking. Representatives from the U.S., South Korea, and North Korea are involved in that.</p><p>It's a more unofficial, more casual discussion between the three parties, quite often involving government officials if it's the 1.5. Although we understand that there are no South Korean or U.S. officials within there.</p><p>[00:25:10] There is though a top North Korean diplomat, Choe Kang-il (ph). He's the man who's in charge of the U.S. affairs in the foreign ministry in North Korea. He was also down here in South Korean during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and within those meetings with South Korea officials. So he's front and center.</p><p>So it's not the official preparations for any potential meetings but it's certainly a good chance for all sides to figure out where the other participants are and what the other participants want out of this potential foreign relations.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, they're still talking. We'll see if -- it's a good sign. Paula -- good to see you, thank you. Paula Hancocks live for us there in Seoul.</p><p>Well, next here on NEWSROOM L.A., <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>is promising better relations with the rest of the world for his fourth term as president. Yes, really, he said that. More in a moment.</p><p>VAUSE: Welcome back everybody. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour.</p><p>Facebook has hired independent forensic auditors to investigate how the date firm Cambridge Analytica used personal information in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook is under fire for not protecting its users' data. U.S. and European lawmakers are calling for hearings and possible new regulations.</p><p>Lawyers for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>are discussing specific topics for a potential interview with the special counsel in the Russia investigation. Sources say the two sides met face to face for the first time last week. On Monday, the U.S. President once again called the investigation a witch hunt.</p><p>U.S. says annual military exercises with South Korea will begin April 1st. They were postponed until after the winter games in Pyeongchang. The drills come as North Korea's Kim Jong-un prepares for a possible summit with <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>as early as May.</p><p>Well, after winning reelection in a land slide, Russian President <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>is trying for a softer tone towards his critics in the west. He met with his opponents from Sunday's election and assured them there will be no new arms race.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>VLADIMIR PUTIN, </nameText></person>RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Of course, we must vote and we will give the necessary attention to further strengthening the country's national defense capability. But I wanted to tell you now that no one is going to accelerate any kind of arms race.</p><p>On the contrary we plan to build relations with all countries in the world in a way that is constructive. WE will aim for, and of course, encourage our partners towards constructive dialogue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Robert English is director of the School of International Relations at the University of Southern California. Good to see you, Robert. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>[00:30:01] How much eye-rolling would there have been in Western capitals once they heard Putin talking about building constructive dialogue and constructive relations with all the countries in the world.</p><p>ROBERT ENGLISH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: I don't know, probably quite a bit but among those who look more closely at Russia and haven't got too swept up in some of the exaggerated, even hysterical threats, much less. They would see something positive there and hope that we've hit the bottom and maybe about to turn into a recovery in Russia's relations with the West. I see reason for some cautious optimism.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, so what are those reasons?</p><p>What specifically can you point to as an indication that maybe it is going to be Putin's word and maybe things will get better?</p><p>ENGLISH: Well, let me just say first why the exaggerated version is a little too simplistic, which is essentially that, now that he's got a new mandate, now that he's got total control at home, his hand is even freer for mischief abroad.</p><p>And his hand was free anyway. There's no reason to think that another mandate makes any difference. On the contrary, however, watching closely we've seen, in recent months, both moving out some of the kind of stagnant and more corrupt officials in the government and the top business positions for some younger and more creative blood, which lays the groundwork for perhaps some liberalization of the economy and also more discussion among think tanks, top pundits, in newspapers, television, more free discussion, including critical discussion of domestic and foreign issues.</p><p>It's not as if complete freedom of the press has returned but together those suggest that maybe Putin is thinking about a more liberal course, cautiously so, and maybe about his legacy, leaving something better after he goes.</p><p>VAUSE: That's a good question because right now there is no obvious successor to Putin. In some ways a pro-Putin successor is crucial for him if he -- to when he leaves the Kremlin, if nothing else to guarantee he does not stand trial on corruption charges that he isn't sent to jail.</p><p>Is there no obvious sign that he is grooming someone for that role, can we read that as he plans to stay on, that that there will be some kind of change to the constitution, a new position created of supreme leader and Putin will be there for a very long time to come?</p><p>ENGLISH: That's certainly possible but it's I think a little early to be that pessimistic. He's got six years now to loosen the system, allow maybe not just one but some group, multiple candidates to prove themselves in the defense ministry and maybe in the economics area, in business.</p><p>And we will see who emerges. That, of course, is my optimistic scenario.</p><p>VAUSE: I understand (INAUDIBLE) China. So stay with us because China's making plans for a Putin visit later this year and there he will find a ruler for life, a kindred spirit, perhaps, Xi Jinping. And there we find Matt Rivers.</p><p>And, Matt, just a few days after presidential term limits were abolished there by the National People's Congress, Xi Jinping has been given even more authority when it comes to courts, arrest and detention.</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, John, a hallmark of Xi Jinping's first term in office was this anticorruption drive that netted thousands and thousands of different members of the Communist Party throughout the country, put a lot of them in jail.</p><p>And what we've seen is a new agency here in China to institutionalize that drive, moving forward, a super ministry here that basically is tasked with continuing that anticorruption drive.</p><p>The critics say it was a very convenient way for Xi Jinping to purge a lot of his political enemies. What activists are saying is that even though the government says that this new super agency is going to act in conjunction with the justice ministry here, what they're saying is that this could act outside the rule of law and it could make an already bad situation for human rights here in China that much worse.</p><p>But what you're seeing here is this is the way Xi Jinping is choosing to wield this newfound power. He could be president for life. He's already had his name written into the party constitution. This kind of restructuring of the governmental bureaucracy here in China is how he will use his power.</p><p>And it's just a very good example of what he's been able to do, really, over the last six months by formalizing and institutionalizing this power grab that he's been so successful in -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: Early days, still, too, Matt. Thanks, Matt Rivers, live in Beijing, appreciate the update.</p><p>Robert, just back to you. Supporters in Russia of <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>have been looking to Xi Jinping as an example, they say, for Russia. There was one presidential candidate who is a Putin supporter, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to give my pronunciation.</p><p>He was on state television. He said that because voters seemed uninterested in electing a different leader then maybe they should just get rid of elections. He said these elections were the last ones. You should understand that. There will be a state council governed by the president.</p><p>And that's just one example. There's a lot of other people talking about making <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>supreme leader or sort of the ayatollah --</p><p>[00:35:00]</p><p>VAUSE: -- of Russia.</p><p>How serious is that sort of talk, at least people essentially just sucking up to Putin?</p><p>ENGLISH: I think it's more the latter and not only sucking but in the case of Zhirinovsky, he's known. He's as crackpot. He's the one who said we should take our nuclear waste, line on the border with the Baltics and install giant fans to blow it west.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: (INAUDIBLE) could have picked a better example.</p><p>ENGLISH: But, no, the people saying that, they're sucking up. You said it well yourself. It is too early to know if they're serious. But I -- again, we see signs -- look, Putin, I think, is a patriot. And he sees, even if we don't agree and even if it's objectively misguided or wrong in some cases, he sees himself doing what he thinks is best for Russia.</p><p>And the situation in China is very different. In Russia, it's time to relax. He has stabilized a crisis situation of a decade ago. He's improved things administratively and now the next task, he knows it well, is to loosen, liberalize and resume integration economically with the West.</p><p>VAUSE: Because it seems that Putin does not get credit for that because people are better off they can now go and buy houses. They do have more money. The economy hit the skids when they crashed the oil price. But it's coming back. And he does intend on liberalizing and investing in future industries as well.</p><p>And if all that happens -- and that's obviously a positive -- I guess the concern that many have is that won't happen and it'll just be a continuation of the last six or 18 years.</p><p>ENGLISH: It's hard for us to understand how Russians, intelligent Russians, would say democracy is not so great. Why do you Americans just measure it in terms of how much freedom, how much democracy?</p><p>But they had a gigantic experiment with democracy in the '90s and it backfired utterly for a variety of reasons, some foreign, some domestic. And so, objectively for them, a period of authoritarian rule made sense. It doesn't indefinitely. And I think they understand that, too.</p><p>VAUSE: So if you were Chinese (INAUDIBLE) think about democracy, that's not so good. (INAUDIBLE) they were more worried about (INAUDIBLE) so I guess in some ways it's (INAUDIBLE). Robert, thank you so much. Good to speak with you. Appreciate the point of view.</p><p>OK, now in Austin, Texas, police say a skilled bombmaker appears to be behind a string of deadly attacks. We'll have more details after the break.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: Uber has taken self-driving cars off the road after what's believed to be the first death involving a driverless car. Police in Tempe, Arizona, say an autonomous SUV struck and killed a woman as she walked her bicycle across the street. The vehicle was traveling about 5 miles over the limit, had a backup driver behind the wheel. Uber says it will cooperate with the investigation and the Maricopa County Attorney's Office will determine whether charges will be filed.</p><p>Police in Austin, Texas, are confirming what many have feared, a suspected serial bomber is on the loose. In the past two weeks, four bombs have exploded, killing two people, wounding four others. Brian --</p><p>[00:40:00]</p><p>VAUSE: -- Todd reports, the latest explosion, which happened just this past Sunday, made use of a more complicated system involving a tripwire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Austin is a city on edge as police say they are now on the hunt for what they believe is a serial bomber. The latest blast happened overnight, injuring two men who set off a hidden tripwire, triggering an explosion.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got tripwires there in the grass.</p><p>TODD (voice-over): Investigators say they see similarities in all four bombs that have exploded in the city since March 2nd. But following Sunday's incident, they now see something even more chilling.</p><p>BRIAN MANLEY, CHIEF OF POLICE, AUSTIN, TEXAS POLICE DEPARTMENT: The belief that we are now dealing with someone who is using tripwires shows a higher level of sophistication, a higher level of skill.</p><p>TODD (voice-over): Unlike the previous bombs which were stuffed inside packages apparently placed by the bomber at the homes of people of color. Two African-American men were killed and a Hispanic woman was injured.</p><p>But police and the FBI say the tripwire bomb overnight did not appear to target anyone specific. It was hidden near a fence in a predominantly White neighborhood and the two people injured are both White men.</p><p>Still, police are not ruling out the possibility that the previous bombings could have been hate crimes. Tonight, a former FBI profiler says the tripwire bomb might have been an attempt to throw investigators off the trail.</p><p>MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER PROFILER, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: Previous victims may have been targeted and now he wants to put time and distance between the targeted victims and make it appear that he's out just to randomly victimize anyone. So it could be a game-playing technique on the bomber's part.</p><p>TODD (voice-over): No matter the motive, investigators say their most urgent concern now is the bomber's change in tactics because the bomb overnight was not easily noticed. COMBS: We're very concerned that with tripwires, a child could be walking down a sidewalk and hit something.</p><p>TODD (voice-over): Overnight, police warned residents using a reverse 9-1-1 call system. And today, a school near the site of the bombing was shut down.</p><p>According to Mary Ellen O'Toole, who profiled the Unabomber for the FBI, the fear of random terror in Austin is exactly what the killer wants. She says she thinks the bomber is most likely a man who is arrogant and reveling in a sense of power.</p><p>O'TOOLE: This is someone that appears to be having -- enjoying -- some type of enjoyment over what he is doing, holding the city of Austin in a fixated state of fear. They are scared. They're upset.</p><p>TODD (voice-over): And tonight, police are appealing for help from the killer himself.</p><p>MANLEY: We asked him to contact us and gave him phone numbers to contact us at. And, again, we won't understand what the motive might be behind this or the reason behind this until we have an opportunity to talk to the suspect or suspects that are involved.</p><p>TODD: Police and FBI officials in Austin meanwhile are appealing for the public's help, saying they need anyone with surveillance video, other video or images of any suspicious activity to come forward. Police say they have persons of interest in this case, but so far, no suspects -- Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Thank you for watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles.

The selling pulled the Nasdaq Composite Index into correction territory, or 10 per cent below its May record close.</p><p>It is too early to assess whether these moves in Washington will fundamentally alter the companies. But they mark a new level of concern over a sector that prided itself in the past in staying out of the political spotlight.</p><p>\"The open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans,\" said Republican Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the -Judiciary Committee. \"But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content and communications.\" The big technology companies have ramped up dramatically their presence in Washington with lawyers and lobbyists to handle a moment that has been brewing for some time.</p><p>The internet industry - Google, Facebook and Amazon in particular - has poured money into lobbying in the capital at a record pace in 2018.</p><p>The FTC has been increasing its scrutiny of the tech companies in recent months, including with a task force, announced in Feb-ruary, to examine competition -issues in the technology marketplace.</p><p>Officials have said the task force will re-evaluate past government decisions that allowed major tech companies to acquire smaller operators that potentially could have been future rivals.</p><p>Among previous deals on the FTC's radar are Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and photo-sharing app Instagram.</p><p>The FTC's actions come as consumer advocates - as well as politicians - have begun urging that big tech companies, including Facebook, be broken up.</p><p>But some technology advocates argue that cracking down on the industry could hurt consumers as well as the economy, stifling innovation and growth.</p><p>The divvying up of \"Big Tech\" jurisdiction comes as antitrust enforcers, including Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim and FTC chairman Joe Simons, have expressed an eagerness to explore issues related to how Silicon Valley giants have changed the competitive landscape.</p><p>With a handful of tech titans amassing the power to sway large parts of the economy and society, the conversation over antitrust enforcement has shifted, with politicians, policymakers and academics across the ideological spectrum calling for a more aggressive approach.</p><p>The FTC already has spent more than a year investigating Facebook on privacy issues related to how it handles user data. That probe doesn't focus on antitrust questions of whether Facebook is stifling competition. The fact the commission formally -secured jurisdiction on those issues suggests it is considering even more rigorous scrutiny of the social media giant.</p><p>The Justice Department previously brought a civil case against the company for allegedly conspiring to fix prices on e-books, a case Apple lost. Apple had to pay $US400 million to consumers.The Justice Department also reached a settlement with Apple, Google and other tech companies in 2010 to resolve allegations they had agreed not to compete for each other's workers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-0ea977d2868c11e993cdb75eb9c3b995ae0bc520ef7429fe548b4764fbf77bb7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8B-7J91-JD3N-51YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Word of Delrahim's recusal came as other Justice Department officials met with state attorneys general to discuss their parallel investigations of Google and cooperation in enforcing antitrust laws in the tech industry.</p><p>The person wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Delrahim lobbied on Google's behalf in 2007 when the Mountain View, California-based search giant faced antitrust scrutiny over its acquisition of DoubleClick, a competitor in digital advertising.</p><p>The Justice Department's ethics office apparently found no potential conflict of interest when Delrahim sought guidance as the investigation of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple began last spring. But as the competition probe progressed, Delrahim \"revisited\" potential conflicts with the ethics staff, and he and the ethics office \"have decided that he should now recuse himself from a matter within the tech review in an abundance of caution,\" said a department statement, which did not mention Google.</p><p>Associate Deputy Attorney General Ryan Shores will continue to oversee the tech review, the statement said.</p><p>Shores, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and staff of the antitrust division met at Justice Department headquarters with state attorneys general \"to continue strengthening their multilateral antitrust law-enforcement cooperation concerning technology markets,\" the department said in a separate statement. \"The Department of Justice looks forward to continued bipartisan cooperation with the states.\"</p><p>Attorneys general for 50 states and territories are participating in the Google investigation, taking a deep look into the company's advertising business. They have asked Google for internal documents related to how it sells ads and tracks the behavior of people who use its search engine and other products.</p><p>Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.</p><p>Scrutiny of Big Tech has deepened and widened across the federal government, U.S. states and abroad. The FTC also is conducting a competition investigation of the four tech giants.

Word of Delrahim's recusal came as other Justice Department officials met with state attorneys general to discuss their parallel investigations of Google and cooperation in enforcing antitrust laws in the tech industry.</p><p>The person wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Delrahim lobbied on Google's behalf in 2007 when the Mountain View, California-based search giant faced antitrust scrutiny over its acquisition of DoubleClick, a competitor in digital advertising.</p><p>The Justice Department's ethics office apparently found no potential conflict of interest when Delrahim sought guidance as the investigation of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple began last spring. But as the competition probe progressed, Delrahim \"revisited\" potential conflicts with the ethics staff, and he and the ethics office \"have decided that he should now recuse himself from a matter within the tech review in an abundance of caution,\" said a department statement, which did not mention Google.</p><p>Associate Deputy Attorney General Ryan Shores will continue to oversee the tech review, the statement said.</p><p>Shores, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and staff of the antitrust division met at Justice Department headquarters with state attorneys general \"to continue strengthening their multilateral antitrust law-enforcement cooperation concerning technology markets,\" the department said in a separate statement. \"The Department of Justice looks forward to continued bipartisan cooperation with the states.\"</p><p>Attorneys general for 50 states and territories are participating in the Google investigation, taking a deep look into the company's advertising business. They have asked Google for internal documents related to how it sells ads and tracks the behavior of people who use its search engine and other products.</p><p>Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.</p><p>Scrutiny of Big Tech has deepened and widened across the federal government, U.S. states and abroad. The FTC also is conducting a competition investigation of the four tech giants.

Word of Delrahim's recusal came as other Justice Department officials met with state attorneys general to discuss their parallel investigations of Google and cooperation in enforcing antitrust laws in the tech industry.</p><p>The person wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Delrahim lobbied on Google's behalf in 2007 when the Mountain View, California-based search giant faced antitrust scrutiny over its acquisition of DoubleClick, a competitor in digital advertising.</p><p>The Justice Department's ethics office apparently found no potential conflict of interest when Delrahim sought guidance as the investigation of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple began last spring. But as the competition probe progressed, Delrahim \"revisited\" potential conflicts with the ethics staff, and he and the ethics office \"have decided that he should now recuse himself from a matter within the tech review in an abundance of caution,\" said a department statement, which did not mention Google.</p><p>Associate Deputy Attorney General Ryan Shores will continue to oversee the tech review, the statement said.</p><p>Shores, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and staff of the antitrust division met at Justice Department headquarters with state attorneys general \"to continue strengthening their multilateral antitrust law-enforcement cooperation concerning technology markets,\" the department said in a separate statement. \"The Department of Justice looks forward to continued bipartisan cooperation with the states.\"</p><p>Attorneys general for 50 states and territories are participating in the Google investigation, taking a deep look into the company's advertising business. They have asked Google for internal documents related to how it sells ads and tracks the behavior of people who use its search engine and other products.</p><p>Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.</p><p>Scrutiny of Big Tech has deepened and widened across the federal government, U.S. states and abroad.

Jim Sensenbrenner said, with a much more moderate tone, that \"being big is not necessarily bad.\" \"On the contrary, in America one should be rewarded for success,\" Sensenbrenner added.<br/>Unpublished audience<br/>The unprecedented joint hearing before the lower house judicial subcommittee features testimony from Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and his parent company Alphabet.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The session takes place amid a growing concern of the dominance of \"Big Tech\" and is part of an investigation into competition and antitrust law.</emphasis><br/><br/>But the questions are expected to shift to other issues, such as hate speech and content moderation, economic inequality, privacy and data protection, and even President Donald Trump's often virulent comments on the networks.<br/><br/>In early-prepared speeches, executives sought to highlight their roots and values as well as how their companies have benefited the average American.<br/><br/>\"An important way we contribute is to build products that help American users at small and large times, whether they're looking for a faster way home, learning how to cook a new dish on YouTube, or growing a small business,\" Pichai said in his comments.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cook,</emphasis> for his part, said that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis> is a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"uniquely American company whose success is only possible in that country\" and that the mission that motivates them is to \"enrich\" people's lives.</emphasis><br/><br/>Bezos, in his first appearance before a Congressional panel, spoke of his humble origins and the initial support of his parents to found his company, as well as the loss of billions of dollars in Amazon's early years.<br/><br/>\"I went from a steady job to a garage in Seattle to found my startup, fully understanding that it might not work,\" said Bezos, the richest man in the world according to his company's valuation.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zuckerberg</emphasis> called <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis> a \"proudly American company\" adding that the social media colossus story \"would not have been possible without U.S. laws encouraging competition and innovation.\"<br/><br/>Hours before the start of the hearing, the TikTok video platform, owned by The Chinese company ByteDance, accused Facebook of \"defamatory attacks\" that were \"disguised as patriotism and designed to end\" its presence in the United States.<br/><br/>Its chief executive, Kevin Mayer, said TiKTok receives\"Fair competition,\" adding that \"without TikTok, American advertisers would once again be left with few options.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">U.S. antitrust laws make it difficult for regulators to act against companies simply because they are large or dominant if they cannot prove that they harm consumers or abuse their market power.</emphasis><br/><br/>The judicial subcommittee could, however, establish an antitrust model for the digital age that requires a fundamental rewrite of the centuries-old laws governing competition.<br/><br/>Some analysts believe that the session may shed light on how these large technology platforms drown the competition by purchasing their rivals or directly copying products developed by third parties.<br/><br/>Apple's onerous commissions on its online app store and Amazon's terms on third-party vendors are expected to fall under the panel's glass.<br/><br/>Google, which has faced antitrust investigations in Europe, will be questioned about whether it favors its own services to the detriment of its rivals, while Facebook will have to vouch for its dominance of social media, including acquisitions of the Instagram image sharing service and WhatsApp messaging.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

AT...nd the FCC denied those claims, only to have them all come true a short while later[1]. Fast forward to this week and we're repeating history all over again. This morning U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero approved[2] (pdf) T-Mobile's controversial $26 billion merger with Sprint, shutting down a multi-state AG lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal. Citing ample evidence that the reduction of four major carriers to three would dull any incentive to compete on price, a coalition of AGs tried to stop the deal after it was rubber stamped by both the FCC and FTC. </p><p>But in his decision, Marrero tied himself into bizarre, esoteric knots in a bid to try and justify approval of the deal[3]:\"How the future manifests itself and brings to pass what it holds is a multifaceted phenomenon that is not necessarily guided by theoretical forces or mathematical models,' Marreno wrote. 'Instead, causal agents that engender knowing and purposeful human behavior, individual, and collective, fundamentally shape that narrative.\"That's deep, bro. Marreno at one point goes on at great length to suggest that it's \"unlikely\" that U.S. telecom giants, among the least competitive companies on the planet, would ever possibly act anti-competitively in the wake of the deal:\"In this court's view, in the intensely competitive and rapidly changing environment in which complex and dynamic markets operate, the anticompetitive business strategies and market effects Plaintiff States predict are unlikely. It is not likely, perhaps improbably or even not rational, that a major new or reinforced market participant, rather than vying aggressively to entire additional customers from competitor by introducing innovations, and investing more to protect and expand market share, would do the exact opposite, thereby risking har to its customer base.Here in reality, there's ample evidence from around the globe that such 4 to 3 market shifts result in higher prices and significant layoffs. From Canada[4] to Ireland[5], this kind of consolidation almost never ends well for consumers, competition, or the market. Hell, you only need look at Comcast, whose legendary status as one of the most despised companies in America is a direct byproduct of mindless M...nd a patent refusal to scale customer service alongside its relentless growth. US telecom consolidation has not been a good thing, no matter how many telecom-linked think tanks spin themselves into butter insisting otherwise. American antitrust enforcement and consumer protection has turned into a running joke[6]. The Trump administration uses antitrust to pursue weird, petty and pointless vendettas[7], while deals that create obvious market harm (AT...ime Warner, T-MobileSprint) are allowed to proceed. The FCC rubber stamped the T-Mobile merger before staffers had even read the full proposal[8]. The DOJ approved the deal against the advice[9] of its own staffers. The grotesqueness of the T-Mobile approval process couldn't have been any more blatant. Former FCC Commissioners from both parties, ranging from Mignon Clyburn[10] to Robert McDowell[11], lobbied to help gain regulatory approval, often without identifying themselves (in Op/Eds and elsewhere) as being on T-Mobile's payroll. T-Mobile also hired Trump ally Corey Lewandowski (just days after he mocked a kid with Down Syndrome on national TV[12]), and made a point of ramping up executive stays at Trump's DC hotel to further grease the wheels[13]. It clearly worked. To justify its approval of the deal, the DOJ created an absurd proposal[14] that involves shoveling some spectrum off to Dish Network, which will then be tasked with building up a new fourth replacement carrier over a period of seven years. Economists pointed out repeatedly the plan isn't likely to work[15]. Dish (whose history of flaky promises in wireless was even previously mocked by T-Mobile[16]) will spend much of that time as little more than a rebranded T-Mobile MVNO, and may never become fully viable. The effort is also likely to be undermined by AT...nd Verizon, which have every incentive to make sure Dish never becomes a viable fourth competitor. Who is supposed to prevent AT...nd Verizon from scuttling the effort? Who makes sure T-Mobile and Dish live up to their promises? Ajit Pai? The guy who mindlessly rubber stamps every fever dream[17] the telecom sector has? US consumers already pay some of the highest prices in the developed world thanks to regulatory capture and muted competition. A laundry list of economists have made it abundantly clear that further consolidation in wireless will only make the problem worse. There's literally forty years of documented history showing how these kinds of deals drive up prices, erode jobs, and result in worse overall service. While DC policy experts freak out about the perils of \"big tech,\" we're giving big telecom a free pass to build something that could be arguably far worse[18].Permalink[19] | Comments[20] | Email

It has also faced charges in Europe of requiring its partners to use its ad platform, and of using its dominant Android mobile system to favor Google apps.</p><p>For Facebook, Amazon and Apple, the cases are less clear, although each of them dominated important market segments.</p><p>European Union officials have begun looking into whether Amazon discriminates against third-party sellers on its platform. </p><p>Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has argued that Apple should not be able to run its App Store with its own services that compete against rivals such as Spotify, which has filed an EU complaint.</p><p>But experts argue that US law, as widely interpreted in recent years, requires that any case showd harm to consumers, a higher standard than in Europe. </p><p>Any monopoly litigation would be the first since the Microsoft case brought in the 1990s.</p><p>\"It definitely will be an uphill battle,\" said Christopher Sagers, a professor of antitrust at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.</p><p>\"The federal courts have become quite conservative on antitrust in recent years as has the Supreme Court.\"</p><p>- What happens now? -</p><p>The tech firms could face investigations from both the US Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, as well as hearings on competition in the House Judiciary Committee which has begun an investigation.</p><p>Avery Gardiner, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer and now a competition fellow at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, said these agencies constantly review practices of tech firms, but that the recent dividing up of responsibility may signal a more serious posture.</p><p>\"It sends a signal there is growing impatience for the regulators to start bringing some cases, but it doesn't change the underlying standard,\" Gardiner said.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, any major antitrust action could take many years to complete, analysts said.</p><p>\"An investigation can take one to two years, then a trial can drag on for a long time, and there will be appeals after that,\" said Blair Levin, a former Federal Communications Commission attorney who is a Brookings Institution fellow.</p><p>\"In that time you will have a presidential election, so a lot of things could change during the process.\"</p><p>The process could be streamlined because the EU cases have created a \"road map\" for US regulators, according to University of Tennessee law professor Maurice Stucke.</p><p>The legislative hearings will not be part of any enforcement action, but could uncover evidence that embarrasses the tech firms and eventually becomes part of an antitrust case.</p><p>Lawmakers may also review US antitrust standards in an effort to update laws for the digital era.</p><p>\"It's not clear whether those hearings have specific practices they want to address or if there is just a general unease\" about Big Tech, Levin said.</p><p>Still, any public hearings could shine a light on tech business practices and whip up public support for enforcement ahead of the 2020 US elections.</p><p>But critics of the antitrust push say monopoly laws are not suited to dealing with the troubling issues of data protection or privacy, which may be part of a separate legislative effort.</p><p>- What about a breakup? -</p><p>US antitrust law allows for \"structural\" remedies such as a breakup of a monopoly, but this has only happened twice since the Sherman Act was passed in 1890. Those cases were the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil and the 1982 split of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.</p><p>In the Microsoft case, a judge ordered a breakup of the software giant but that was reversed on appeal.</p><p>Courts may also impose a variety of \"behavioral\" remedies such as allowing rivals better access to platforms' technology and a ban on anti-competitive conduct, although these can be complicated to enforce.</p><p>\"It's highly unlikely that these companies ever get broken up,\" Levin said.</p><p>\"That is a very hard case to make. It takes a long time and by the time you would get to that, something else will happen\" to change the marketplace, he added.</p><p>Gardiner said that while courts prefer structural rather than behavioral remedies, regulators would need to make a clear case on how a breakup might address competitive harm.</p><p>\"They need to articulate the problem they're trying to solve and how a breakup would fix that,\" she said. \"It might just result in two large behemoths in different parts of the industry.\"</p><p>Facebook</p><p>Spotify</p><p>AMAZON.COM</p><p>APPLE INC.</p><p>MICROSOFT</p><p>GOOGLE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-US antitrust hammer for Big Tech what happens next? </dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8F-V571-JBV1-X0XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><timeReceived>9:19 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Agence France Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20278\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Just 23 significant merger investigations concluded last year, the second lowest since 22 concluded in 2013. The average investigation lasted 10.5 months, according to the report. The report comes just months after the Department of Justice announced reforms aimed at speeding up the merger review process. </p><p>US antitrust investigations of large mergers and acquisitions hit a five-year low in 2018 even as tech giants such as Google and Facebook saw their business practices increasingly fall under the government microscope. According to a new report from the law firm Dechert, US regulators concluded 23 significant antitrust merger investigations last year. That compares to 27 cases concluded in 2017 and 33 in 2016, according to the firm's Dechert Antitrust Merger Investigation Timing Tracker.[1] Dechert defines a \"significant\" investigation as anything reportable under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act which results in a closing statement, consent order, a complaint which challenges the transaction or the abandonment of a merger in which an anti-trust agency has to file a press release. \"This decrease under the Trump Administration does not necessarily reflect a decline in enforcement or aggressiveness by the agencies, but instead could be the result of fewer antitrust-sensitive deals due to a general decline in deal volume, or a trailing consequence of higher enforcement activity in recent years,\" Dechert noted. There were 37 significant investigations concluded in 2015, the highest number in the history of the tracker. The data comes at a time when tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon are under increasing regulatory scrutiny.President Trump said in November[2] that his administration is \"looking at\" tech giants Amazon, Google and Facebook to see if they are monopolies, and if they should be broken up. \"That doesn't mean we're doing it, but we're certainly looking at it,\" Trump told Axios's Jonathan Swan and Jim VandeHei. \"I think most people surmised that.\" It remains to be seen what kind of an effect the scrutiny will have on M...mong the big tech companies, which have billions of dollars in cash on their balance sheets and are increasingly competing with each other. Google's cloud business, which recently hired a CEO from Oracle, is believed to be on the hunt for big acquisitions [3]as it seeks to catch up with Amazon.The clock isn't getting any fasterWhile some dealmakers have been anticipating a speed up in government approval for big-ticket mergers, such a change has yet to materialize, according to Dechert. The average length of these investigation in 2018 was 10.5 months \u2014 just short of the 10.8 month record high from 2017, according to the report. However, Dechert wrote that \"2019 could be a year of changes in these antitrust merger trends,\" thanks to policy changes announced back in September. The Department of Justice announced[4] that it aims to complete merger reviews within six months moving forward. While things shift in the US, the European Union remains active in its own investigations. The EU finished 29 significant investigations in 2018, which is the highest in the history of the tracker. \"After early indications that the Trump Administration was on track to significantly reduce the average duration of significant U.S. merger investigations in 2018, the final result was more muted,\" Dechert said.

Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable,\" said Subcommittee Chair David N. Cicilline at the end of the hearing. \"We need to ensure the antitrust laws first written more than a century ago work in the digital age.\"<br/> The committee had previously conducted multiple internal hearings and had investigated \" millions of pages of evidence from these firms\" as part of its probe which is meant to decide the future of the country's antitrust laws and the role of big tech in the economy.<br/> \"Many of the practices used by these companies have harmful economic effects. They discourage entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, hike costs, and degrade quality,\" said Cicilline.<br/> \"Simply put: They have too much power. This power staves off new forms of competition, creativity, and innovation,\" he said. <br/> Here are the highlights from the hearing: <br/><br/>GoogleGoogle CEO Pichai faced the most intense scrutiny as part of the hearing. Lawmakers zeroed in on Google's practices in terms of search results and advertising. <br/> Cicilline began by questioning Google if it stole content from small businesses. <br/> \"Numerous online businesses told us that Google steals their content and privilege for its own sites in ways that profit Google, but crush everyone else,\" he said. \"Why does Google steal content from honest businesses?\" he asked. <br/> He further alleged Google of stealing reviews from Yelp and threatening the company. <br/> To which Pichai replied, \"We conduct ourselves to the highest standards,\" while disagreeing with the accusation.<br/> \"The evidence seems very clear to me as Google became the gateway to the internet, it began to abuse its power and use its surveillance over the web traffic to identify competitive threats and crush them,\" Cicilline said.<br/> The search giant was also questioned about its entry into the travel and real estate segment with listings of hotels and flight bookings As Google surfaces more information on its own search results, the offering has angered similar businesses. <br/> Rep. Pramila Jayapal questioned the Google CEO regarding oversight concerns related to ad spaces. <br/> \"It's running the marketplace, it's acting on the buy side, and it's acting on the sell-side at the same time - which is a major conflict of interest,\" she said. \"It allows you to set rates very low as a buyer of ad space from newspapers depriving them of ad revenue, and then also to sell high to small businesses that are very dependent on advertising on your platform. It sounds a bit like a stock market - except unlike a stock market, there's no regulation on your ad exchange market.\" <br/> Pichai replied \"we are deeply committed to journalism in this area,\" <br/> Republicans questioned Google about its reasoning for pulling out of a Pentagon project and accused the company of political biases which the Google CEO denied, stating that the company remains neutral. Questions were also raised regarding big tech aiding China's military efforts which Pichai denied stating that the company has a very minor presence in China. <br/><br/>Amazon  Jayapal questioned Bezos on a recent Wall Street Journal report accusing the company of using third-party seller data for its own gains. The report further claimed that Amazon employees had access to this data in order to strategize for Amazon's own product. <br/> The Amazon CEO refrained from completely denying the report. \"I can't answer that question yes or no. What I can tell you is we have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business but I can't guarantee that policy has never been violated,\" he said. \"If we found that somebody violated it, we would take action against them,\" he said.<br/> Rep. Lucy McBath questioned Bezos about its policies on \"systematically\" quashing businesses that thrive on the platform taking an example of a bookseller. The bookseller had claimed that the online retail giant had \"systematically blocked\" them from selling entire categories of books. \"We were never given a reason, Amazon didn't even provide us with a notice of why we were being restricted,\" she said. <br/> \"Isn't it an inherent conflict of interest for Amazon to produce and sell products that compete directly with third-party sellers, particularly when you, Amazon, set the rules of the game?\" asked Cicilline.<br/> \"The consumer is the one making the decisions,\" Bezos responded.<br/> Talking about th smart home market and the role of Amazon Echo in promoting Amazon products, Bezos said that though the market should be analysed on a case-by-case basis, \"It wouldn't surprise me if Alexa does sometimes promote our own products.\"<br/><br/>FacebookFacebook faced a barrage of questions related to its strategy of acquiring competitors, primarily Instagram. Zuckerberg faced the heat in terms of its strategy to quash competition by acquiring them. <br/> Jayapal specifically asked if the company copied features from its competitors and threatened. She cited a chat that Instagram's Kevin Systrom found Facebook had threatened them and said that he feared that the company would go in \"destroy mode\" if they didn't comply with the acquisition. She further said that Facebook had been working on its own version of a photo-sharing platform prior to the acquisition and had threatened Instagram stating that it would launch the product. <br/> Zuckerberg said he disagreed with the characterization and said that it \"adapted\" certain features from the competition. When asked how many companies had Facebook copied, Zuckerrbrg refrained from giving an exact number. Certain old emails had also come into light where Facebook had decided to adopt a rather aggressive strategy in terms of competition. <br/> Chairman Nadler noted a conversation Zuckerberg had with one of Facebook's senior engineers in 2012 where he said that the company was, \"likely buy just by any competitive startup, but it'll be a while before we can buy Google.\" Zuckerberg stated that the quote was meant to be a \"joke.\" <br/> When questioned on the ideology of Facebook moderators, Zuckerberg said that the moderators were trained to be neutral.<br/><br/>AppleApple's Cook perhaps faced the least amount of questions. When questioned about its power to increase commission for developers to place an app on its app stores, Cook said that they had not increased commission in years.<br/> \"The competition for developers - they can write their apps for Android or Windows or Xbox or PlayStation. We have fierce competition at the developer side and the customer side, which is essentially so competitive I would describe it as a street fight,\" he said.<br/> \"Apple the ability to control which apps are allowed to be marketed to Apple users. You will the immense power over small businesses,\" said Rep. Henry C. \"Hank\" Johnson.<br/> All four tech CEOs further agreed on not associating with brands and companies using forced labour upon being questioned by Rep. Ken Buck who cited the example of China using Uighur slave labour. <br/> The committee will now prepare its report based on its investigations and the testimonies with its recommendations on keeping these companies' market power in check which could be released by summer or early fall. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-A463199</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-7NB1-DYDW-705V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1308\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That could include digging into past tech mergers, such as Facebook Inc.'s 2014 acquisition of encrypted messaging service WhatsApp, or investigating whether Amazon.com Inc.</p><p>unfairly competes with third-party sellers on its Marketplace.</p><p>The investigation is expected to last 18 months and could include demands for tech executives to testify, as well as subpoenaing internal company records, said David Cicilline, the Democratic Congressman from Rhode Island who chairs the House judiciary's subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative Law.</p><p>At the hearings Tuesday, news publishers testified that tech behemoths Google and Facebook are cannibalizing the digital advertising revenues of media outlets that depend on internet platforms to reach audiences.</p><p>Media executives threw their support behind a proposed committee bill that would give publishers an exemption from antitrust laws prohibiting price collusion, allowing them to band together and press tech firms for more favourable ad revenue-sharing agreements.</p><p>\"No publisher on its own can stand up to the tech giants,\" said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, a trade association. The alliance released a study last week estimating that Google earned US$4.7-billion in revenues last year by aggregating news content without paying publishers.</p><p>White House officials are also turning their attention to Big Tech. Earlier this month, several media outlets reported that the Department of Justice would be responsible for any antitrust investigation into Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, while the Federal Trade Commission, a federal consumer watchdog, would investigate Amazon and Facebook. The FTC also unveiled a task force this year to examine whether past tech mergers and acquisitions harm competition.</p><p>Antitrust is the latest target of the growing discontentment with Silicon Valley on both sides of the political aisle in the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers have been holding regular hearings into the privacy and content moderation policies of tech firms since revelations more than a year ago that a political consulting firm had improperly accessed the personal information of millions of Facebook users.</p><p>\"It does seem like the dam has broken all at once,\" Nicole Perrin, principal analyst with market research firm eMarketer said in an online commentary.</p><p>The new investigations under way mark a significant shift in the way that U.S. regulators approach antitrust cases, which have traditionally focused on whether acquisitions or business practices harmed consumers through higher prices.</p><p>That is a difficult argument to make against tech companies, who typically offer their services for free or at low cost.</p><p>Instead, regulators have signalled they intend to broaden their probes to explore non-financial issues, such as whether tech firms have too much power over consumer data, or whether companies harm competition by controlling access to their platform in ways that favour their own products and services.</p><p>\"Where competition is harmed, consumers and markets lose with higher prices, lower quality, lower rate of innovation, less free speech and even lower privacy protections,\" Makan Delrahim, the top U.S. Justice official in charge of antitrust, told a conference in Tel Aviv last week.</p><p>\"Protecting competition means protecting all of those dimensions of competition.\"</p><p>Tech companies aren't sitting quietly amid the escalating scrutiny from Washington. Executives have been loudly pressing their case in recent weeks for why they their size and global reach benefits the U.S. economy.</p><p>\"I don't think anybody reasonable is going come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly,\" Tim Cook, the smartphone-maker's chief executive told CBS earlier this month.</p><p>Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos used his annual shareholder letter to point out that independent sellers now make up 58 per cent of the company's sales, up from 3 per cent when Amazon started in 1997.</p><p>\"Third-party sellers are kicking our firstparty butt. Badly,\" he wrote.</p><p>Increasingly, tech leaders argue that aggressive antitrust actions could hobble their ability to develop cutting-edge innovations, creating a risk that the U.S. could lose out to China in areas U.S. President Donald Trump has said are a priority, such as 5G wireless technology. \"[Chinese] companies are not going to be broken up,\" Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg told CNBC in May.</p><p>Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai told CNN Friday that new antitrust regulations could undermine U.S. national security by threatening U.S. leadership in areas such as artificial intelligence. \"I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it, it has a lot of unintended consequences,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20190617rbcdtechhearings</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC2-9FC1-F06S-31FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"980\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

This led some industry observers to question whether the two investigations would overlap.<br/>\"Based on news reports, it sounds like your agencies may be pursuing monopolization investigations of the same companies,\" said Lee. \"I don't think your agencies should be divvying up parts of a monopolization investigation of the same tech company.\"<br/>Lee asked both men if the process of deciding which agency would investigate which company - formally called the clearance process - had broken down.<br/>Simons said that for the vast majority of matters, it had not.<br/>\"I take that as a yes, things have broken down,\" said Lee.<br/>\"I would agree with that,\" Simons said.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Senator Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the panel, also pressed Delrahim on a decision to probe four US automakers for potentially breaking antitrust law over how they entered talks with California to curb emissions. The probe comes at a time when the Trump administration has battled the state on everything from immigration to census questions.<br/>Under questioning from Klobuchar, Delrahim repeatedly denied that there had been any contact or discussions between the White House and the Justice Department regarding the automakers or anything else related to antitrust.<br/>\"There's nothing wrong with these companies individually announcing higher emission standards if they want to,\" said Delrahim.<br/>Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, pressed Delrahim about chief executives like John Legere, the head of T-Mobile US Inc, who stayed at the Trump International Hotel, near the Justice Department, during some trips to Washington.<br/>\"My decisions are not based on the hotel stays of any merging parties,\" Delrahim responded.<br/>In June, a group of senators asked the government if the president had interfered in a review of the proposed $26 billion merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp.<br/>Klobuchar and Senator Cory Booker, both of whom are running for president and sit on the subcommittee, signed the letter, as did Senator Elizabeth Warren, also a candidate for the Democratic nomination.<br/>The Justice Department approved the deal, but states sued to stop it.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-219309</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBD-C761-JBYT-H27B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009EZR</classCode><className>SPRINT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC00092GF</classCode><className>T-MOBILE US INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001XSU</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE TELEKOM AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Although, others cautioned, a seismic breakup could take a significant amount of time.</p><p>Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, the trade group for online publishers, said that Google\u2019s anticompetitive practices hurt more than just individual publishers. \u201cIt\u2019s a regular Google narrative that this is a concern of legacy publishers or dying newspapers, or [it\u2019s] European protectionism, and this couldn\u2019t be further from the case,\u201d said Kint, whose trade body represents media companies including The New York Times and NBCUniversal. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a concern for the future of the media industry.\u201d</p><p>Kint believes that this concern extends to the advertising industry, including advertisers and their agencies.</p><p>In 2019, eMarketer estimated that Google brought in 37.2% of total online U.S. ad spend. Facebook, the other half of the so-called \u201cduopoly,\u201d accounted for 22.1%. Google had slipped year-over-year due to Amazon\u2019s encroachment, which took 8.8% of the pie. (The three companies combined made up 68.1% of the market).</p><p>Earlier this year, sources told Adweek that DOJ investigators are interested in how Google\u2019s complex ad stack, historically known as\u00a0DoubleClick, is intertwined with its ad exchange, and whether the algorithms underpinning it contain inherent bias. For instance, questions persist over whether Google\u2019s ad server, commonly known as DFP, favors its ad exchange, AdX, as an inventory supply source for publishers at the expense of third-party supply-side players.</p><p>Additionally, Google\u2019s 2015 changes to how third-party ads are served on YouTube, such as restricting access to third-party demand-side platforms, have been the subject of much controversy in recent years.</p><p>Some in the industry question if this will lead to Google voluntarily divesting its ad-tech assets, while others suggest that any government intervention will require it to better firewall its various components.</p><p>Ratko Vidakovic, founder and principal of ad-tech consultancy AdProfs, said a survey of the company\u2019s membership found interesting splits in opinion on how the federal government will actually crack down on the internet giant, which he said was \u201canyone\u2019s guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudging by our poll\u2019s results, the majority believe that the antitrust process will likely force Google to change its behavior and policies, and possibly incur some heavy fines,\u201d Vidakovic said. \u201cThat said, it was fascinating to see how many readers thought Google will escape untouched. That to me seems unlikely.\u201d</p><p>Ana Milicevic, principal and co-founder at consultancy outfit Sparrow Advisers, told Adweek any potential move forced by the government could be years away. Additionally, she pointed to how regulators elsewhere in the world are counteracting Big Tech\u2019s dominance.</p><p>\u201cIt would be about a three-year timeline at best,\u201d she said. \u201cLooking at how some events have happened in the past, I think it would be in the platform\u2019s interest to cut quick deals and put it all to bed.\u201d</p><p>Milicevic also went on to question whether the U.S. regulatory framework is equipped to legislate for the vast inequalities the market\u2014both in terms of data and ad spend. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to answer a new challenge with an old set of tools,\u201d she said, adding that simply proposing that Google is broken up may have limited benefit.</p><p>She highlighted how authorities elsewhere in the world are planning to force Facebook and Google to share ad revenues with premium publishers as a means of addressing the huge disparities in ad market share between platforms and publishers.</p><p>\u201cI am fascinated by what we\u2019re seeing in Australia, where regulatory action is being presented as commercial restitution,\u201d added Milicevic.</p><p>This model of regulation contrasts with the U.S., where regulatory arguments simply propose breaking up perceived monopolies. \u201cBreaking up the platforms simply because \u2018they\u2019re too big\u2019 doesn\u2018t really expose who\u2019s at fault or who\u2019s suffering because of their dominance,\u201d Milicevic noted.</p><p>Breaking up Big Tech is a hot topic in Washington, where it has been a pet issue of former Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. While President Donald Trump has stopped short of calling for the breakup of the tech giants, he has repeatedly expressed his animosity toward Google, Facebook and others for perceived bias against him.</p><p>Notably, Makan Delrahim, the DOJ\u2019s antirust chief, recused himself from the ongoing Google probe in February due to conflicts of interest arising from his prior work lobbying for Google\u2019s acquisition of DoubleClick. The investigation has been ongoing since last June\u2014eight months before Delrahim\u2019s recusal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1157145</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXW-35J1-DYRK-H00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 18, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

A major problem is that online advertising practices are complex and secretive, so people are not able to give meaningful consent as to how their personal data is used.</p><p>\u201cBig Tech is profiting by abusing an individual\u2019s right to privacy. We\u2019ve previously seen it with Facebook and now Google, with both embroiled in revelations of targeting of children and reports of secretive hidden websites to harvest data. This is a systemic problem with surveillance-driven Big Tech firms, and companies have got away with it for too long.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s fines, while welcome, are a drop in the ocean for a company that made nearly US$140 billion in revenue in 2018. There needs to be tougher efforts by governments to address the underlying human rights risks posed by such large-scale corporate surveillance.\u201d</p><p>Background</p><p>On Wednesday, US regulators agreed a settlement with Google of US$170 million and ordered changes to privacy on YouTube, after the tech giant was found to have harvested personal information from children without their parents\u2019 consent.</p><p>In response to the FTC settlement, YouTube\u2019s CEO stated the company will now limit data collection and use for children\u2019s content on the platform, and stop serving personalised advertising on such content.</p><p>The fine came on the same day the firm was accused of using secret hidden websites to harvest personal information, according to a report in the Financial Times.</p><p>In response to the Financial Times report, a spokesperson for Google said, \u201cWe do not serve personalised ads or send bid requests to bidders without user consent.\u201d The spokesperson also said that Google is co-operating with investigations in Ireland and the UK into its advertising business.</p><p>States have an obligation to protect human rights in the context of corporate activities, including through regulation and oversight.

However, they sometimes had trouble answering incisive questions about their business practices. They also had to confront various concerns about alleged political bias, its consequences on American democracy, and its role in China.<br/>The four CEOs testified remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were seated, in masks, inside the courtroom in Washington.<br/>Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon were accusations that they used their dominant platforms to compile competitor data in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.<br/>Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he could not guarantee that the company had not accessed information from vendors to manufacture competitive products, an accusation that the company and its executives have rejected earlier.<br/>Regulators in the United States and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with companies that sell on its website and whether the online commerce giant has used vendor information to create its own-branded products.<br/>\"We have a policy of not using vendor-specific information to help our private label business,\" Bezos said in response to a question from Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal. \"However, I cannot guarantee that this policy was not violated.\"<br/>In his opening statements, Pichai highlighted Google's value to family business in Bristol, Rhode Island, and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the residency districts of the president of the antitrust commission, Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, and Republican James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.<br/>However, the Google executive struggled when Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulate their results to lead users to their own digital services in order to increase their profits.<br/>Pichai repeatedly rejected Cicilline's attacks and noted that Google is trying to provide the most useful and relevant information to hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine every day in an attempt to get them back instead of going to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.<br/>While Democrats focused primarily on market competition, several Republicans voiced long-standing complaints that tech companies are censoring conservative voices, and questioned their business activities in China.<br/>\"Big tech companies go for the Conservatives,\" Rep. Jim Jordan said.<br/>In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to take action against companies, which he has accused, without presenting evidence, of prejudice against him and conservatives in general.<br/>___<br/>The Associated Press journalists Michael Liedtke in San Ramon, California;

It's been moving very quickly,' Barr told the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. </p><p>He added: 'We're talking very broadly with people and getting a lot of input from people in the industry and experts and so forth.'</p><p>'I'd like to have it completed some time next year. I think it's important to move quickly on things,' Barr said. 'These things have a cost to the marketplace and businesses. I think at some point the government has to fish or cut bait.'</p><p>Barr said that the Justice Department review was not limited to antitrust, but that looking for anti-competitive behavior was 'front and center.'</p><p>'The question is that when you have the kind of market power that some companies have in their market, then some conduct that may have made sense when they were the insurgent company in a growing industry can become anti-competitive because it ends up fortifying the monopoly,' he said.</p><p>The attorney general, however, also cited his previous work for Verizon Communications, in arguing that big companies provided some benefits to consumers, particularly in telecommunications.</p><p>'Big is not bad,' he said. 'I think in certain network industries you can be too Balkanized and no one has the scale necessary for the kind of innovation that we're seeing.' </p><p>President Donald Trump has relentlessly criticized the big tech companies by name in recent months. He frequently asserts that companies such as Facebook and Google are biased against him and conservative politicians. </p><p>                     WHAT THE INVESTIGATION WILL LOOK INTO AND WHO IS IN THE FIRING LINE                   </p><p> The investigation will look into whether Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple are unfairly dominating the market and exerting too much control over the internet. </p><p>It will look at how each of the businesses has expanded in recent years, and how they plan to move (or have already moved) into different services than the ones they were designed for. </p><p>How Amazon has moved from being a seller of books to seller of all things and now a giant in the cloud storage space too may be an example of this. </p><p>Facebook, for its part, has gone from connecting friends online to owning WhatsApp, another telecomms mammoth, Instagram and now it has set its sights on its own currency to allow transactions within its services. </p><p>Google will likely face questions over how its algorithms determine what the public sees when they search for things online. </p><p>The DoJ said it wants to use the investigation to determine whether there are any antitrust issues, then it will decide how to handle them. </p><p>The investigation mirrors another which is already underway by the House Judiciary subcommittee. </p><p>It also coincides with a Financial Services Committee probe into Libra, the cryptocurrency Facebook wants to spearhead. </p><p>The focus of the investigation closely mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>Its chairman, Rhode Island Democrat Rep. David Cicilline, has sharply criticized the conduct of Silicon Valley giants and said legislative or regulatory changes may be needed. He has called breaking up the companies a last resort. </p><p>In June, Reuters reported the Trump administration was gearing up to investigate whether Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet's Google misuse their massive market power, setting up what could be an unprecedented, wide-ranging probe of some of the world\u00b4s largest companies.</p><p>The Justice Department said the review 'is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want.'</p><p>In July, the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel pressed executives from the four firms about their competitive practices and noted that Google, Facebook, Amazon had a rising share of key markets. </p><p>Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies and their role in displacing or swallowing up existing businesses. It is rare for the government to seek to undo a consummated deal.</p><p>The most famous case in recent memory is the government's effort to break up Microsoft Corp. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact.</p><p>'There is growing consensus among venture capitalists and startups that there is a kill zone around Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple that prevents new startups from entering the market with innovative products and services to challenge these incumbents,' said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat who heads the subcommittee.</p><p>Technology companies face a backlash in the United States and across the world, fueled by concerns among competitors, lawmakers and consumer groups that they have too much power and are harming users and business rivals.</p><p>Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, praised the investigation and said a Senate tech task force she chairs would be looking at how to 'foster free markets and competition.'</p><p>One antitrust expert believes the DOJ investigation may prompt regulators to interpret U.S. competition law in new ways.</p><p>University of Pennsylvania law professor Herbert Hovenkamp said the companies may have been their abusing market power by collectively buying hundreds of startups in recent years to devour their technology and prevent them from growing into formidable rivals.</p><p>Traditionally, antitrust regulators have only sought to block acquisitions involving large companies in adjacent markets. But Hovenkamp says U.S. antitrust law is broad enough for regulators to consider the potential damage wrought by relatively small deals, too.</p><p>Is Big Tech headed for a big breakup?</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced a major antitrust investigation into unnamed tech giants, while the House Judiciary Committee has begun an unprecedented antitrust probe into Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices, and promises 'a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.'</p><p>In addition, at least two 2020 presidential hopefuls have expressed support for breaking up some of technology's biggest players amid concerns they have become too powerful.</p><p>Experts say breakups are unlikely in the short term, and Rep. David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a 'last resort.' But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have so far declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea.</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook 'accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.' CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for 'new rules' in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, 'even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,' Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>The Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to 'a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.'</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: 'Walmart is much larger.'</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: 'Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.'</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online.</p><p>Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-58588013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPV-H4P1-F021-61H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2439\"/><timeReceived>9:40 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The four tech companies have been lightning rods for regulator probes this year. In addition to the Justice investigations, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and Congress are looking at one or more of the companies. </p><p>\"We started in earnest in July. It's been moving very quickly,\" Barr told the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. \"We're talking very broadly with people and getting a lot of input from people in the industry and experts and so forth.\" \"I'd like to have it completed some time next year. I think it's important to move quickly on things,\" Barr said. \"These things have a cost to the marketplace and businesses. I think at some point the government has to fish or cut bait.\" Barr said that the Justice Department review was not limited to antitrust, but that looking for anti-competitive behavior was \"front and center.\" \"The question is that when you have the kind of market power that some companies have in their market, then some conduct that may have made sense when they were the insurgent company in a growing industry can become anti-competitive because it ends up fortifying the monopoly,\" he said. The attorney general, however, also cited his previous work for Verizon Communications , in arguing that big companies provided some benefits to consumers, particularly in telecommunications. \"Big is not bad,\" he said. \"I think in certain network industries you can be too Balkanized and no one has the scale necessary for the kind of innovation that we're seeing.\" (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Bill Berkrot) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12174282</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPS-48P1-JCDN-1045-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"300\"/><timeReceived>9:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The US hasn't seen this much tech industry antitrust activity since Microsoft faced off against the US Department of Justice two decades ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This time around, the targets are the huge internet platforms Google and Facebook.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some major moves have already come from the EU, under the direction of EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who this week was appointed to a second term in the role. In March, Vestager fined Google EUR 1.5 billion for uncompetitive practices in the advertising market it dominates. A year before that, the EU walloped the company with a EUR 4.34 billion fine for abusing its power in the mobile phone market. And in 2017, Vestager issued Google a EUR 2.4 billion antitrust fine for steering searches to its own online shopping service.</p><p>But the relevant federal bodies in the US - the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department - have done little over the years in which these platforms gained massive power. They've only recently sputtered into antitrust investigations, alongside ongoing hearings in Congress.</p><p>It's about time. Anti-tech sentiment from the US public is growing. Only 3 per cent said they felt tech companies could \"always be trusted\" and just a fourth felt they could be trusted \"most of the time\" in a survey published last year by Pew Research, which also noted \"around half of US adults (51 per cent) believe these companies should be regulated more than they are now\".</p><p>Notably, some presidential candidates eyeing the 2020 election have moved to align with that unease, suggesting that big tech platforms need to be regulated more vigorously, even broken up.</p><p>Set against a succession of done-and-dusted investigations in Europe, such belated activity, and campaign promises that cannot be acted upon without an election win, only serve to highlight further the staggering dearth of US federal action. </p><h>Formidable phalanx </h><p> A formidable phalanx of US state attorneys general has stepped into the breach in a tightly coordinated manner that will, at last, have tech companies sweating on their home turf. On Monday, 50 AGs - excluding California and Alabama's, but including those from the territories of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico - launched a major antitrust investigation into Google.</p><p>Announcing the investigation from the symbolic steps of the US supreme court, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton stated that \"Google's business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users' privacy and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information\". While the initial focus is on Google's advertising division, the AGs have indicated they intend the investigation to encompass far more over time.</p><p>Meanwhile, New York state attorney general Letitia James, announced last Friday that eight states plus the District of Columbia had begun an antitrust investigation into Facebook.</p><p>Can states, even as a unified group, achieve much? The answer is, yes. Not only can they enact significant state-level punishments and laws, but they could do it in a piecemeal way that creates a nightmare for companies who must comply with varying laws across multiple jurisdictions within\u00a0a single national market.</p><p>However, two concerns hover over any US and EU antitrust actions. First those with long memories can tell you the Microsoft action dragged on for years and even with findings against the company, actual remedies petered out in the face of technological change and a new, disinterested federal administration. Meaningful action must be swift and decisive.</p><p>The EU, by contrast, has shown antitrust vigour and mettle. But still, the fines so far may seem enormous, but for these massive companies they will barely make a dent in their annual accounts.</p><p>And while Vestager's reappointment this week will rattle Silicon Valley, she has publicly veered away from considering the most effective remedy: breaking up these tech giants.

The investigation is part of a larger antitrust case the US government's Department of Justice is building against Google.</p><p>Bloomberg reported that authorities have asked executives of Google's rival companies about pricing and operations of Google's network division. The inquiries reportedly focus on establishing whether Google pushes advertisers and publishers to use only its products by offering them discounts or special features, thereby blocking out competitors. Regulators are interested in understanding how Google's online search business interacts with its network division to increase its share of the digital advertisements market, reported Bloomberg.</p><p>The US Department of Justice and a group of attorneys general are currently working on bringing an antitrust lawsuit against Google in the coming weeks. However, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that some of the lawyers working on the investigation thought the case needed more as they still had to to sift through millions of pages of documents to find the evidence needed to win in court.</p><p>Google controls much of digital advertisement market</p><p>Last month, a House subcommittee on antitrust heard from the CEOs of Big Tech companies Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. During Google CEO Sundar Pichai's deposition, Representative Pramila Jayapal pointed out that the company controls 50-60% of the ad exchange market. And, by controlling middlemen like Google's Display &amp; Video 360 (DV360) and Google Ads, the company controls 90% of the buy-side market.</p><p>Jayapal had said Google had rigged the entire online advertising market by controlling both buy and sell-sides via its Ad Exchange - a marketplace to buy and sell advertising marketspace. She noted that Google could, due to this dominance, was able to set low rates as a buyer of ad space compared to newspapers, thereby depriving them of ad revenue, and ultimately sell it for higher revenue to small businesses who depend on Google for advertising. (Read: Key takeaways from Sundar Pichai's deposition)</p><p>Investigators looking into Google, according to the Bloomberg report, are focusing on all three aspects of its advertising business - the buy-side, the sell-side and the exchange itself.</p><p>What else is Google under scrutiny for?</p><p>* Decision to limit third-party access to YouTube ads: Investigators are reportedly looking into Google's decision to stop third parties from dealing in YouTube ads, and forcing the purchase of ads only through YouTube's own bidding tool. This concern had earlier been raised Representative Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) in the hearing last month. Armstrong had also noted that Google had limited interoperability of third-party analytics on YouTube, thereby forcing advertisers to use Google's Data Hub for any analysis.</p><p>* Use of dominance in search business for advantage in ad business: Google allows advertisers buying search ads (which appear on search results') to convert left-over funds from daily budgets to buy display ads. This option, that other companies cannot offer, makes Google's ad exchange the only practical option for publishers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0054275044</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PG-HG81-DXMP-K4FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"548\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 28, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

CASSIDY, MD, HEAD OF U.S. BANK EQUITY STRATEGY &amp; LARGE CAP BANK ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: We'd like to get started with the last presentation. But before we get started, I just want to thank everybody for making the 2019 BancAnalysts Association of Boston Conference a real success. Well, The Langham Hotel, which is under reconstruction, which is why we're here at the Four Seasons will not be finished next year, so you could expect to come back here next year.</p><p>But just really, with the Board and myself, I want to thank everybody for coming, and I'll turn it over to Gerry Benson.</p><p>GERARD BENSON;FIDELITY INVESTMENTS;EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST: All right. Thank you, Gerard. So up next, the last presentation of the day, we have U.S. Bancorp. U.S. Bancorp is the nation's fifth-largest commercial bank, headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota with $488 billion in assets. They provide a comprehensive line of banking, mortgage, investment, trust and payment services products to consumers, businesses and institutions. They consistently rank in the top quartile in performance metrics relative to peers.</p><p>Presenting today for U.S. Bancorp, we have Terry Dolan, Chief Financial Officer. Terry joined U.S. Bancorp in 1998 and was named CFO in 2016. And joining Terry is Derek White, Chief Digital Officer. So please join me in welcoming.</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE, CHIEF DIGITAL OFFICER, U.S. BANCORP: Thank you, Gerry. It's great to be with all of you today. I was encouraged to give just a little bit of background on myself before I get started.</p><p>But actually, before I begin, I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made today are subject to risk and uncertainty. Please review Slide 2 for more information.</p><p>Just to give you a bit more color on my own background, I've been out of the United States for the last 14 years. But before that, I was an entrepreneur in college, started a business that was a sports and marketing business. One of my clients was a financial institution called First USA Bank back in the day. Upon graduation from college, this client of mine, First USA, asked me to join them. We then built up a sports entertainment marketing business within First USA Bank. While at First USA Bank, I also participated in the creation of Wingspan, one of the first real Internet banks as well as their international business under the brand of Bank One.</p><p>Following that, left First USA Bank, raised $20 million from Bill Gurley to create what was Juniper Bank, a start-up de novo Internet bank, starting in '99 and 2000. We built that business and after 5 years exited that business to Barclays. It is now Barclays' cards and deposit business here in the United States.</p><p>As part of that sale to Barclays was asked to move across the pond. What was supposed to be 6 months turned into 14 years. We spent 2 years outside of London, 4 years in Dubai, 5 years back in London and then that stint at Barclays, which included work in emerging markets, in Dubai, and worked across all the business lines, my role in Barclays ended as Chief Design and Digital Officer across the enterprise, working with all business lines to create the future. And then went to BBVA, the European leader in efficiency and in digital, and led what was called Client Solutions at BBVA.</p><p>I joined U.S. Bank just about 5 months ago now in the role of Chief Digital Officer. Within this role, we look at -- some core teams within the role are an omnichannel team that looks across all interfaces of our human customers interacting with their money. I'll come on to that in a little bit more. Agile, that looks at how we create the future of the bank in a different way as well as the new innovation team that's looking at where are we going next and ask the questions as to why not. We also are looking very closely at emerging payments in RTP and other areas of the business, working with all of my peers on how we connect humans and money and how we monetize that through the financial products we offer through our businesses today.</p><p>Just moving to the slide deck and a couple of slides for today. Interactions, I believe, are the leading indicator for the future of every industry. And in banking, we have the privilege of working with every industry. We sit with the titans of industry and look at the future of their businesses. And the one thing that we see is how humans are interacting increasingly in digital and how that's changing from analog or traditional businesses into digital businesses. Interactions are a leading indicator for every industry. And how that translates into those interactions and how humans interact with a product and in banking, how they interact with money and how we, therefore, monetize those interactions is changing.</p><p>You can see on the top left that in U.S. Bank today, 70% of our customers are already digital. They've already gone there. Our customers are choosing to interact with their money in digital. On the right-hand side, you can see this visually represented by the customer interactions over a 48-hour period, 48-hour window, a glimpse into how our customers interact with their money. The blue line that you see there is humans, customers walking into our branches, interacting with their money and with our employees in our branches. The orange highlights our customer interactions on the consumer side of our business interacting with their money in digital.</p><p>Now there are 2 key things of why we show this. One, to show that even at the peak hours our branches are open and digital is open at about 3x as long as the physical door. Our customers are choosing to interact with their money or their company's money through digital at a multiple beyond that of which they do in physical. The second is to highlight that the digital door is always open, whereas the physical door, whether it's an office or whether it's a branch, closes. And digital allows our customers to interact with their money when and how they want. Now the important point is that as we move from a traditional bank to a digital bank and increasingly to a digital company is recognizing that as human behavior changes and human interactions change with money, therefore, the way that we monetize those interactions is quite different.</p><p>On the next slide, we outline how we're translating the vision that I shared at Investor Day, how we're translating that into our 6 key priorities at this stage of our digital evolution within U.S. Bank. The first of those is DIY for all 4 humans. The concept of DIY again applies across every industry. The simple ability for a human to be able to interact with a product and their money by themselves on a mobile device without requiring any other human intervention or help.</p><p>We define the 4 humans of banking as the consumer that makes decisions about my money. The small business that makes decisions about my money and my company's money and how they mix those together very frequently. The third human is the corporate executive, whether it's a family office, whether it's a corporate banker or sorry, a treasurer or a CFO and they're making decisions about their employer's money. The last is the U.S. Bank employee that is at the service of the other 4 humans.</p><p>This is important because in the digital world, we design around the human experience, human journey and I'm going to bring that to life even more. We design around those 4 humans and how those 4 humans interface with money, increasingly through digital, how you build and design a digital experience and then how you monetize it through those financial products that exist in that digital layer, that digital interface. It's all incredibly important. The first phase of any analog brick business moving to digital is the DIY and open the digital door. So the digital door is open to every feature, journey, experience that exists through a physical door.</p><p>Sorry. Before I get into a click-through or a double-click on each of these 6 priorities, I'd like to touch on this concept that we find very powerful in bringing our colleagues in the organization and how we organize our work around what we call above the glass and below the glass.</p><p>As we look at the 4 humans that exist above the glass, and again, touching on DIY for them, it's about building DIY-able experiences so they can do everything by themselves if they want to, if they want to, which we see they do. And the second is creating smart and personalized interactions and increasingly, at some point, autonomous interactions that actually use the data that we have captured within the organization and bring that back through the glass at the interaction level with our customers.</p><p>Now you can think of this simply, above the glass what matters in digital banking is billions and basis points. Now as bankers we're really good at managing billions and we're good at measuring against basis points. Why billions matter and what matters in the artificial intelligence, the machine learning world, Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest inventors of our time has said that AI, artificial intelligence, becomes real or becomes alive when you talk about billions. And we have billions of interactions with our customers today.</p><p>And looking at one of the hottest jobs in the digital world today is this concept called funnel management, as illustrated on the slide here. The way e-commerce companies manage sales and manage clicks and experiences in their world. Because simple tweaks to understanding how humans are interacting in a digital world, of how the billions of interactions at the top of the funnel translate into sales, into better, more efficient experiences at the bottom of the funnel and tweaks along every step of the way, whether it's clicks, whether it's taps, whether it's screens, whether it's prefilled or manually entered, are basic elements of digital.</p><p>And that's where we look at, is the digital door open? And then how do we make sure the experience and the billions of interactions that we have are amazing experiences. And small tweaks along the way, the science and the art brought together in tweaks, translates into greater bottom line impact in both sales that drives positive revenue as well as efficiency that creates positive jaws for us across the board. I could give you examples of this, of what we see as kind of best-in-class. The companies that we benchmark ourselves against are like the Booking.coms of the world as to how simple the experience is in travel.</p><p>You look at the traditional supermarkets and how easy is it to buy toothpaste online versus the way Amazon does it today. Is it 12 clicks or is it 1? All of that translates into funnel management from top to the bottom. I risk boring you with the science of this so let me move on to how the above the glass translates into the work that is done actually below the glass.</p><p>The below the glass things, we have 2 of our key priorities below the glass are around building a human-centric database -- I'm going to come on to that in a minute -- rather than product-centric, called Human 360 and reusable technologies. Driving those are data, the infrastructure and the human capital that we bring into the organization to ensure that we create a clean, reusable, reliable architecture below the glass that will drive efficiency, that will drive enormous customer satisfaction.</p><p>So let's, if we can, step through each of these 6 priorities or double-click on them to give you a bit more color around each of them. I mentioned that our goal is to DIY everything possible for the 4 humans. Now this is very measurable. And as bankers, we like to measure things. And so this is very measurable. And just to bring this to life, human #1, the consumer, each of us interacting with our money. You want to do 440 things with your money potentially. That is the perimeter. That is the potential of things that you might want to do with your money. Knowing that 440 is important. Why? Because we can dimension what it is that people, humans, want to do with money. Knowing those 440 things, we can then measure, are they available or are they not?</p><p>The top banks today are somewhere around 75-plus percent DIY-able in the consumer space. Consumer is more digitally advanced on DIY than the institutional businesses. If you say that in consumer businesses, say, 75-plus percent DIY-able as to why I would take my time and walk into a branch, it's 75%. On the institutional side, it may be 25% to 30%, showing and demonstrating enormous opportunity to simply start at the very basic level of digitizing a business, creating a digital business by looking at DIY, what are the journeys, what are the features, what are the things that CFOs, treasurers want to be able to do, and can they do it DIY? All of this, again, translates into positive revenues, efficiencies and greater customer experience.</p><p>By focusing on DIY and understanding what humans want to do with their money and how they interact with their money and the products that we monetize them through, we can then look at innovations that pop out of looking at each of these individual experiences, each of these individual journeys. And by prioritizing what matters most to the customer in a very simple level, 2 things. What matters most to the customer and how do we make money. Bringing those together, there's 2 examples that we've highlighted here that we have found resonate with our customers.</p><p>One example is Expense Wizard. So for any small business, for example, that wants to be able to -- or that their employees are managing their travel expenses, no one likes to keep track of the receipts and the paper receipts. Simply digitizing that experience that wouldn't necessarily be a traditional financial product but adds value to our customers, by creating that, it eliminates -- we give a virtual card, a corporate card to those customers. It creates a greater experience. It removes wastage out of the system. It reduces accounting risk. And it also gives a line of sight into forward purchasing power, which, from a data perspective, is incredibly powerful. And because you're shifting transactions from consumer card interchange to corporate card interchange, there's a very positive monetization opportunity.</p><p>The third is looking at geolocation within our mobile application. The ability for customers to be able to tie where they're actually purchasing with their mobile application, geolocation, has great benefits and helps us manage fraud, helps us help our customers, reduces call volume, problems with our customers, declined transactions and is driving great adoption across the board for our customers.</p><p>The second priority is this concept of once we make everything digitally available, then are we making it smart? Are we making it intelligent? Of the 440 things, are we using the data that we have today and bringing it back through the glass to the customer, to me, the end user, so that when I'm interacting in this platform, is my data helping me make decisions in a better way? You can see in banking, we've done a great job of capturing data, cleaning data, and then there's a lot of concept about putting it into a data lake, but that isn't the magic. The magic is pulling the data out of the lake, unlocking the lake. Yes, you want it to be safe and secure and be able to access it, but pulling it out of the lake back through the glass to the end user is where the magic happens. And this is where there's enormous opportunity in the future of banking at a per interaction level looking at, is the data used in the billions of interactions that we have with our customers and measuring how smart are our interaction.</p><p>Two examples of that, that we have within the company today that are these pockets of brilliance that we have within U.S. Bank. One of them is this -- we've served up since April in our new mobile banking application. We served up 400 million insights to our customers, where we help them understand their money better. And 85% of those insights, our customers come back and tell us that it's valuable, educational and driving greater interactions for them. On the second side is in our institutional business and the Corporate Trust business. You may or may not be aware of Pivot. But in the digital world, we call this a killer app. Anything that has over 50% market share in customer adoption resonates in what is called product market fit.</p><p>And in our Corporate Trust business, our customers today, our clients today are using Pivot to translate complex trade scenario analysis into visual decision-making tool that used to take 60 to 90 minutes now takes 1 to 2. Using data and presenting data in a way that is actionable and tangible for the end user, also giving projected and real-time cash flow at a moment's notice, that is, we find, incredibly valuable for our clients. Taking the learnings from Pivot and then bringing it into our other platforms across our other institutional businesses based on the product market fit, the design and how it resonates with the end user is an opportunity for us as we move forward.</p><p>The third priority that we've outlined, and I'll try to keep up with the slides here. The third priority that we've outlined is, if the what we want to do above the glass is DIY and smart, then how we do it, moving at speed and at scale is our third priority. And looking at the thousands of employees we now have across the organization across our Agile Studios, creating the way fintechs do, creating the way big tech does, bringing together financial products, the experience and technology all together in working scrums and teams in the agile way of working has enormous benefits.</p><p>It increases our speed to market in a positive way. We're able to validate our product market fit increasingly. Our time to revenue improves. But perhaps the most powerful of this and from a cultural standpoint when you talk about transforming the culture of an organization is that we get better at predicting the work that we need to do. By measuring on a fortnightly basis, on a quarterly basis the work that we think we want to get done, measuring that and being able to say, did we get 55% of what we said we were going to get done or did we get 85% of what we wanted to get done is incredibly powerful for colleagues to see that. And to see that we are good at predicting how we work and how we're going to deliver and increasing the speed at which we deliver.</p><p>Priority #4 is about building a human-centric database below the glass, connecting our data ecosystem and the data that we have that I already touched on in our data lake, making sure that it is easily accessible for us to be able to pull back through the glass is incredibly important. And measuring the usage of the data in the right ethical way, the way U.S. Bank has a reputation of trust and ethics is what we're focused on. And this will all be, we will be looking to integrate external data through APIs, using our internal data. All of this will be optimizing our core data infrastructure and also making sure that we bring in the right human capital that looks at it in the way that humans are interacting in digital.</p><p>Now this one might be a little bit too technical for the crowd, but this is where speed and efficiency become incredibly tangible and real. See, banking was built on financial products. And each financial product, if you want to take an analog financial product and you want to make it digital, the first step that many have done is to simply create a web application form or a web form. On the left-hand side, that's what this illustrates, is being able to take one product and make it digital, you would create from top to bottom, above the glass to below the glass, a siloed structure. And if you have 5 products, you would build all of the same components all the way across all 5 products.</p><p>Now on the right-hand side, by using this technology, and again, not to bore you, but the concept of microservices and APIs allows us to look across. And why Andy created this role is that he saw the opportunity for us to look across all of our financial products, see that they're becoming digital. These financial products come together in one digital interface. They're calling on services below the glass. And there's an opportunity for us to create once and reuse, which is the overall concept of an API. Instead of having multiple point-to-point solutions, creating services that if you have the 440 things above the glass and translating that into 900 microservices below the glass that can be reusable, that translates into efficiency.</p><p>Now the last item is how we look at the monetization of this, these human interactions in these interfaces across the company. And if we look at each of the financial products that exist today across the company, each of them will be made digital. And each of them will have a unique profit model in how we manifest them and how we generate revenues and efficiencies in a profit model per product at a digital level as well as through the traditional level. And there are ways that we can measure and monetize that.</p><p>And this is incredibly powerful and incredibly exciting. If you look at our organization less as an organizational chart and more like an operating system or the way network science works in the digital way. And that each of these P&amp;L centers across the bank are points on an operating network and they're origins of where the P&amp;L comes from, how we manifest that and bring that together in digital is incredibly exciting.</p><p>With that, I'll bring my comments to a close and I'll hand it over to Terry.</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN, VICE CHAIRMAN &amp; CFO, U.S. BANCORP: Thanks, Derek. Derek's been in the organization for about 6 months. I think you joined in April. And here's one of the things that I really appreciate about his leadership within our organization. I think of people in terms of 2 different groups, those that take the simple and make them complex and those that take the complex and make it simple. And Derek fits into that second category. He's really in a relatively short period of time been able to take what I would call, areas of excellence within our organization from a digital standpoint, think about our mortgage products that we talked about, our small business products that we talked about and our Pivot, as an example, in those areas of excellence, and he's been able to really look across the entire organization and help us really provide clarity with respect to what we need to be able to achieve from a digital standpoint.</p><p>One of our strategies is what we call One U.S. Bank. And what One U.S. Bank is all about is really being able to take the things that we do well within our product areas, our silos, if you will, our lines of businesses and really to think across the entire organization to be able to leverage everything we do in a way that it logically makes a lot more sense from a customer standpoint. So I appreciate that about his joining our team.</p><p>Everything he talked about and everything that we focus on within U.S. Bank is about creating value, creating value to our customers and our shareholders. And that's what this is all about.</p><p>I think about it in terms of 3 things. And Derek has talked about each one of these things. How do you end up thinking about digital and the services and products that you offer, that you're going to offer to your customers and how do you end up monetizing it in order to be able to get the economics out of it. That's the revenue side of the equation. The other side of the equation is, how do you end up thinking about the cost structure of the organization going into the future. How do you end up optimizing it in order to be able to get the value, the cost efficiencies out of the organization that you should get? And all of that with both a long-term and a short-term perspective in terms of how you end up managing the business because you have to be able to create sustainable cost structures that enable you to continuously reinvest in the business. And that is clearly a very significant goal for us at U.S. Bank.</p><p>One of the things, just as an example, we've talked about at Investor Day was our physical asset optimization. This is clearly an example where our customers' behaviors are changing in the branches. They're adopting digital in a very rapid pace. Today, 70% to 80% of service related to transactions that used to occur in the branches are happening above the glass and below the glass within the digital space. And so we're in the process of optimizing our physical asset structure in order to recognize that change in behavior. And we talked about the fact that we plan to close 10% to 15% of the branches over the course of the next year or so. And I also believe that there's opportunity to be able to expand upon that as we think about the future.</p><p>It's not just closing branches though, it's also opening branches. It's remodeling branches. It's moving branches, relocating branches into the right areas of our communities in order to be able to capture the highest level of growth. And it's also, from an employee perspective, rethinking the roles within the organization. What are the roles, what are the skill sets that are no longer needed or need to be de-emphasized in the organization and which ones do we need to expand upon and grow in the organization. And how do we allow and enable our employees to be able to make that transition.</p><p>In addition to the closure of the branches in our existing footprint, we're also looking at opening branches in new markets. These are markets where it will be a branch-lite, digital-first sort of strategy. We recently opened our first branch in Charlotte. We will have a network, we believe, of somewhere between 8 and 10 branches in that particular market and a network of ATMs of about 150 ATMs in order to be able to create a sense of presence within that community. And then using the digital tools that we have at our disposal and that we will roll out. We believe that, that is a strategy that can be very successful.</p><p>We are targeting markets where we already have presence, either from an employee perspective or a significant customer presence, either through our card business, our mortgage business, our auto business or a combination of all 3 of those. So these are customers that we already know and we want to be able to do business with and being able to use that branch-lite, digital-first strategy is how we're thinking about success in this particular area, at least in the near term.</p><p>So just to kind of wrap this up and then we'll take it to questions. U.S. Bank, as you know, is a company that is in a position of strength. We have the opportunity to be able to take that position of strength and the competitive advantages that we have as a result of that in order to be able to invest in our business. I think there are companies that are either going to be able to make that investment and embrace the digital transformation or not. And we want to be an organization that is embracing the digital change. And bringing Derek on as the Chief Digital Officer is going to enable us to be able to get there.</p><p>And with that, I'll close and we'll go to questions, I guess, Gerry. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Derek, I'd like to ask you about the long-term trend given you've had a very unique view of international, really high competition, future stuff. What opportunities and threats do you see with banks over the next 10 to 20 years, how the industry is going to change? And actually, given that you've worked at BBVA, a well-respected bank that's based in Europe, can you also include how open banking is going to change the banking sector there?</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE: Sure. Sorry, do we repeat the question or go ahead?</p><p>GERARD BENSON;FIDELITY INVESTMENTS;EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST: Yes. If you want to paraphrase.</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE: Okay. The question is in regard to trends, 10 to 20 years out even as well as views on open banking.</p><p>Trends, 10 to 20 years out, there are 20,000 banks in the world today, depending on how you measure it, somewhere between 16,000 to 20,000 banks in the world today, 6,000 to 7,000 of those banks exist here in the United States.</p><p>The indications, there are still markets around the world where 40 to 50-plus percent of the local country's population still do not have bank accounts. That is, as they describe in the emerging markets, world bankerizing at a rapid pace, but we're also seeing developments of monetary systems that sit outside of the traditional banking world. That is one opportunity. It is also a threat. Therefore, one of the key drivers of that will be the -- and as you look around the different regions of the world, from China, to Europe, to the United States is 3 kind of regions, the role of regulation is perhaps the greatest delineator of what banks do versus what big tech does versus what fintech does.</p><p>If you take China versus the United States, there's clear delineation in the United States as to what large ecosystems, large tech players, what large retailers can do in the banking space. That does not exist in the same way in China.</p><p>In Europe, which leads to the discussion on -- and we could talk much more about larger trends 10 to 20 years out, but there will be consolidation from the 20,000, call it, 20,000 banks down to, is it dozens in the future operating at a global scale or at a local market scale? There will be large consolidation. Technology will be a driver of that, both above and below the glass. Human adoption of that technology and how human behavior is comfortable engaging and making decisions around technology interaction with money will be a massive driver. Because at present, humans are interacting with technology in other spheres. That human behavioral adoption hasn't fully migrated to banking. And then regulation, those would be the big themes I would suggest long term.</p><p>As far as open banking, Europe is quite advanced in open banking. Who would have thought that GDPR-PSD2 could serve as -- that regulation could serve as a catalyst for innovation. It's happening in Europe. And as you see, the portability of data, the portability and the ability for a third party to initiate a payment on behalf of a customer and increasingly placing the ability for end users, customers to have more influence over their data is very clearly a trend that we will all be looking at. We, within U.S. Bank, do have an open banking platform. We are externalizing APIs in the right way. And there are different types of APIs, from data, to financial product, that can be exposed through open banking. The U.S. has some room for development in open banking.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: How far along are you in the Human 360? I mean how much of your data is kind of reusable? And do you have the infrastructure to fully implement a reusable tech aspect?</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE: The question is, how far are we along on priorities 4 and 5 that I've outlined on Human 360 and reusable tech.</p><p>I'd describe that as, we have one common core banking system across the bank, across all of the enterprise. We have a fairly clean architecture below the bank or sorry, below the glass that allows us to capture data, clean the data, store the data in a way that is reusable or is accessible for us to use. And the technology enables that. But we're on a journey. We have some work to do. But the path, most importantly, the path is very clear as to where we're heading. I'd hesitate to put an exact point on where we are in the journey, but we have a very clear path as to where we're heading. We have a clean environment and we're moving.</p><p>One of the great things, again, coming from outside of U.S. Bank inside U.S. Bank is [between] the platforms that we have, but most importantly, the simple business model. Our size allows us to move and will enable us to move at speed in the future.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Derek, your experience at WingspanBank, which reminds me of the time when we had this massive innovation where there was the existential threat from the original kind of de novo opportunities and you kind of alluded to it. But I guess what's different now versus then? Is it just the speed? Is it the technology? And why won't the banking system be able to defend against it like it did when there was kind of flash in the pan things that kind of came and ended up not being quite the disintermediators that they were going to be?</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE: So the question is, the likes of Wingspan came about had a big splash and appeared to be a big threat, what's changed? And I think that's...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can the system defend against...</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE: Can the system defend?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) the thing is for real and really different than other prior disintermediation, new technologies. Do you think you can defend better today than you did with dot com?</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE: Yes. The Internet was not designed to move money. The Internet was designed as a messaging platform and informational platform, but not designed for what it is today, and there's a lot of discussion on the evolution of the web. But the early advent of the Wingspans of the world, of making things available digitally on digital was the first phase. The second phase came about when mobile happened. And mobile happened and that changed the way that customers can take portability outside of the office and can DIY essentially anywhere that they want.</p><p>Again, I would suggest, while there's the human behavioral aspect of this and where humans already are, one of the biggest defenses is regulation that will protect what can and cannot be done. Because there are markets outside of the United States, for example, in Kenya, where 40-plus percent of the GDP moves through a currency that is mobile minutes, that is not a sovereign currency. That doesn't happen in every market. And regulation plays a role in the monetary system as well as defining the currency that moves through that monetary system.</p><p>I think we're in a position where fintechs have dissected banking into narrow experiences. But as those fintechs mature, what you see is the customers, the humans demanding a greater expanse in product offering beyond just their narrow offerings. So they're getting these multi-unicorn, decacorn valuations but monetizing through one financial product today and customers will start to demand more financial products as we mature.</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: I think the other thing, we talk about it from a strategic perspective at the Board, even over the course of the last 5 years, 10, 15 years ago, you might have had some of the fintech sort of activities or the Internet banking. But the advent of the significant investment in fintech on one side, of the huge tech companies on the other side that really are looking at how do you end up being relevant to the customer and it's all about the interactions and then how do you end up monetizing those interactions. And that is significantly different today than it was back then, which I think creates a huge threat.</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE: One of the big things that we see with the big techs, and we have relationships with all of them. Big tech has 3 priorities: scale to billions of users, increase the amount of interactions and time that their users are spending on their platform, then monetize through ads or through services or through products. We have a goal of having millions of customers, billions of interactions and monetizing through financial products. We meet at the interaction level, right?</p><p>And one of the key things as we look to that is that each of the big techs, many of the big techs, they're experimenting in how payments bridges into their ecosystem because that is the natural bridge where the financial ecosystem meets the tech ecosystem, it starts with payments. And a lot of the big techs have experimented on how payments increase with the amount of time and the number of interactions, which is their priority #2. One of their priorities is not to generate revenue through financial products, but the increased time, interactions on their platforms that they monetize through their traditional tech. And understanding that and how we can then partner with them, work with them and where they may be a threat is really important.</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: The other thing that I would add is just, if you think about -- one of the things that we have been trying to articulate is the importance of the payments business for U.S. Bank and I think our success as we think about that in the future. And I think, Derek, it's kind of worth spending just a minute or 2 on your thoughts regarding that.</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE: Yes. So one of the greatest things that we have within U.S. Bank is the 2 sides of the payments marketplace. And I think many people underestimate the value of having that. Having worked in Turkey, which outside of China is arguably the most advanced payments market in the world and a business there that has both sides of the marketplace, there are very few of our peers in the United States that have the acquiring and the issuing side of the marketplace. There are enormous benefits from having both of those. Because one, understanding a payments ecosystem and understanding the movement of money in that ecosystem and having 2 sides of the marketplace is incredibly valuable. Not only having that from an ecosystem standpoint, but Andy and Terry and Shailesh have spoken about the benefits of having payments and banking together.</p><p>Because see, as we have payments and understanding that tech's entry and threat into banking is starting primarily through payments because payments means data as well. Payments also allows us on both sides of the marketplace to bridge into banking. On the consumer side, on the issuing side is swipes, and they're using their card, we can then offer them banking products through the interactions that we have with them. On the merchant acquiring side, that allows us to then build deeper relationships on the institutional side of the house. So those 2 dimensions of understanding the 2 sides of the marketplace, and if we had more time, we could really bring to life the power of that and the bridging of that, but then also the banking side of it is incredibly powerful. And I think many analysts and others underestimate the power of having both sides of that marketplace.</p><p>GERARD BENSON;FIDELITY INVESTMENTS;EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST: Thanks, Derek.

Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's 2019 Investor Day. Thank you to all of you who have joined us here in New York, who are listening on our webcast. We have a full agenda for you today, including a Q&amp;A session at the end of the day where we're going to bring all of our presenters back on stage and you'll have an opportunity to ask any questions you might have.</p><p>During the day, you'll also have an opportunity at breaks and at lunch to go and visit our tech experience displays outside in the foyer. We have a number of our technology products that you can take a look at and take -- also talk to some of our tech ambassadors out there. All of our presentations today are available on our website at usbank.com.</p><p>Aside from all of the presenters you're going to be seeing here on stage today, we have with us in attendance our entire managing committee as well as over 25 of our most senior leaders here at the bank. They're here seated amongst you in the ballroom. They're also, as I mentioned, outside acting as tech ambassadors and with our tech displays. We encourage you all to seek them out during the day, talk to them. They're here to answer your questions. Not only to give you a better understanding of our businesses and our opportunities for growth, but also to give you a better sense of our culture and who we are as a company. We're also thrilled that 9 members of our Board of Directors were able to join us here today. And I want to take a moment and ask our Board members to just please stand and be recognized.</p><p>With us are David O'Maley, Art Collins, Olivia Kirtley, Dorothy Bridges. Over here, we have Elizabeth Buse, Kimberly Harris, David McKenney, Dr. O'dell Owens, and we are going to be having Doreen Woo Ho later join us.</p><p>Before we get started, I need to remind you that today's presentations are going to be including forward-looking statements that may be subject to risk and uncertainty. The factors that may cause those actual results to differ from those statements are included in the presentations on our website today as well as in our 10-K and future SEC filings. Some of our presentations are also going to include reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A list of those -- of -- I'm sorry, a description of those non-GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations to GAAP are also included in our presentation as well as our SEC filings. With that, let's get started.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ANDREW CECERE, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, U.S. BANCORP: Good morning. A lot certainly has changed. My favorite part of that presentation was the 2 to 10 year, did you see that? That was the only thing that was consistent, right? Heading downward.</p><p>I'm Andy Cecere, CEO of U.S. Bank. It's my pleasure to welcome you to the 2019 Investor Day.</p><p>First of all, let me thank you. I know you have a lot of pressures on your time, and I recognize that it's your choice to come here this morning, and I want to thank you for that.</p><p>I want to thank you for taking the time to listen to our story, and I want to thank you for the investment in our company. I believe we have a great story to tell. I believe we're positioned in an excellent place to win in this new environment, and I want to talk a little bit about what's changed over the last 3 years.</p><p>If you think about the evolving world we're in, let me start with the economic scenario. And I'll start by telling you that we have a lot of data at the company. A lot of early indicators that we look at in the credit group, in the payments group and so forth and none of those indications are recession upcoming. You're going to hear from Jodi and Mark a little later that our credit staff, as it relates to the consumer, commercial and corporate banking groups, are all consistent and stable.</p><p>From a spend standpoint, we have a lot of data there also. And as you recall at the end of 2018, there's little bit of a dip in spend activity, particularly on the consumer side of the equation. And as we talked about on the last 2 earnings call, this started to continue to go up, and we're seeing that stability there also, so spend is stable.</p><p>And finally, if you think about loan demand, that's also very consistent. You'll hear from Terry later, but that consistency has been in place for the last couple of quarters. So our data would indicate stable, continuing growing economy.</p><p>Now at the same time as you all know, we have conflicting messages as you think about global growth, China, trade, tariffs and Brexit. And probably most of all, what you're seeing in the yield curve and the indications about something might be happening. And that, sort of, conflicting set of messages is creating a lot of volatility, uncertainty in the marketplace absolutely, and we have to be able to react to that on an ongoing basis.</p><p>From a changing expectation standpoint, quite a lot has changed. But the one I want to focus on is individuals and businesses expectations around privacy and trust in technology. That is a fairly recent change in just the last almost 12 months that people have a heightened awareness of how their data's being used, and their protection of privacy of that data is becoming even more important to them.</p><p>From a regulatory environment, we've come a long way. You can think about the last 10 years, there was a tremendous increase in regulatory oversight in the banking industry, increased capital levels, increased liquidity levels. And I will say overall the banking industry is in a much safer, better place today. Now the last 3 years I would call more moderate and stable, and there's a lot of clarity and there was -- there hasn't been actually increases in regulatory oversight in the industry overall.</p><p>And in fact, I would say, a lot of the focus has shifted from capital and liquidity to overall reputation and operational risk and that's an area of focus that you'll hear a little bit about more in a moment.</p><p>And then finally, probably the most significant change that's occurred is related to technology and the digital revolution.</p><p>The fact is our customers, U.S. Bank customers, banking customers are all -- overall are impacted not just about what's happening in the banking industry but what's happening in the industries across the United States, and the expectations and the way they're dealing with the bank has changed quite dramatically.</p><p>If you think about 10 years ago, just about every transaction that occurred in the bank, occurred in the 4 walls of a branch. And today, 2/3 of transactions occur on a digital device, that's quite a change over a 10-year time frame. And even over the last couple of years that's moved up from about 50% to 67% and it continues -- that curve continues to be very steep. And customers' expectations around convenience and speed, uncertainty and safety and privacy have also increased quite dramatically. So that means for us that we have to rethink about the role of the branch, the number of branches and how we think about our branch network, and you're going to hear a lot more about that today. And certainly, the competitive landscape has changed.</p><p>You met a number of our Board of Directors, we have an annual strategic off-site that we talk to our Board every year. We've been doing that for the past 10 years and we talk about our competitors. And for many of those 10 years, our competitors would have been those circles around the blue U.S. Bank, principally our peer group banks. But as the Board knows, the last 3 years, we've expanded that quite dramatically to include the large tech platforms on the left and the fintech players on the right. Because the fact is, those are our competitors today just as much as the other banks. They are entering the financial services area -- arena principally through payments and money movement.</p><p>Banking traditionally, particularly deposit taking and lending, has a pretty wide moat around it. It's a regulated business and many of the fintech players and large tech platforms are not in that. However, they're entering through payments and sometimes creating partnerships to expand beyond that. And we recognize that and this is one of the key themes that you're going to hear today is that combination of payments and banking, I think, is as critical as it's ever been in the last few years. So a lot has changed in the environment. A lot has changed in the industry and a lot has changed at U.S. Bank. If you think about the last 3 years, we've done over 17 acquisitions, card portfolios, trust portfolios and a lot of increased capabilities, one of which we announced earlier this week. Software capabilities or payments capabilities across the board. We announced our first expansion into a new market in 10 years. Next month, we're going to go into Charlotte, North Carolina with what we're calling a digital first branch-light strategy, and Tim is going to talk a lot more about our thinking around that.</p><p>Kate will talk about brand campaign, but I will tell you that our name recognition, our brand awareness is much stronger today than it was just 3 years ago and certainly 6 years ago. We've gone from a regional bank to a national bank and that brand awareness is certainly out there. And finally, we've had a number of enhancements and product introductions across every customer segment in the bank and every single business line.</p><p>From a flexibility standpoint, probably one of the most significant changes is exiting the consent order. We were in the AML consent order for 3 years. And while we were in that order, we were increasing our expense base both from a technology and operational standpoint as well as the number of people focused on that initiative. The good news is we're past that heightened spend. We're in the stability phase as we sit today. And in fact, you're going to hear from Jodi, our objective is to optimize our overall risk management function.</p><p>The second important component of that is while we were in that consent order, we were bound and could not open new branches, which really limited our flexibility in terms of closing branches because we wanted to optimize the locations. And as a result of exiting that we, as you know, announced a 10% to 15% reduction in branches and a very different phase of the branches that branch that remains. What goes on in those 4 walls, as I talked about and Tim will talk about more, is very different today than it was just a few years ago. And that flexibility allows efficiency and effectiveness. And speaking of efficiency and effectiveness, if you look at the tech side of the equation, there's a lot that's changed there.</p><p>Now we've been an innovation, technology-driven company in our payments group for 2 decades. Our Elavon group has had agile studios going back to 2000 before anyone even knew what an agile studio was. But the fact was it was a little bit isolated in that group. In the last 18 months, it's been expanded to across the bank. We currently have 22 agile studios impacting every business line, it has completely changed the way we develop and execute in terms of our product management and product development. It's faster, it's quicker to market, it's much more customer centric and it's much more efficient, and you're going to hear more about that. But it's a new way of doing business. And that 22, I would expect to expand to double in the next year. That has allowed us to introduce some of the things you see on that slide like increased automated underwriting, instant decisioning. You're going to hear about some of the products and on revamped mobile app.</p><p>And finally, we've had a number of changes in the executive leadership. Probably the most recent -- certainly the most recent change is the creation of a Chief Digital Officer position. You're going to hear from Derek White later this morning. But I believe so strongly that the digital component of our success is critical that we created a managing level committee position that looks across the company at all the digital initiatives and making sure we're having this in a consistent, effective way introduced to all the clients regardless of business line and Derek's going to give you the vision around that shortly.</p><p>We have new leaders across HR and risk. Tim has taken over the combined Consumer and Business Banking group. And Gunjan is here today. At the last earnings call, I think Gunjan you were on the phone, you were 1 month away from starting, you wanted to make sure we had a good earnings call before we started but she is now here to talk about wealth management. So a lot's changed in the industry. A lot's changed at the bank, and I want to tell you well, how I think about where we are today.</p><p>Three things. Number one, I believe we're starting from a great position of strength. I will tell you this very honestly, I wouldn't trade places with anyone else in our peer group, and I'm going to tell you why. But I think we have all the attributes and the exact right timing to be really successful in this new environment.</p><p>Number two, those core competencies and advantages that got us here, that got us to this point to that position of strength that I talked about continue, and we're focused on retaining those strengths.</p><p>And number three, we recognize that the future is changing, and we have to continue to adjust to be successful in that new future.</p><p>Now let me talk about the position that we're (inaudible). So you all know that we're the fifth largest bank in the country. Just over $480 billion in assets and just over $80 billion of market cap. This is a great position to be in. Why is that? Because we're able to spend $2.5 billion in technology and operations around innovation on an annual basis. And that's important because that is much more than the banks below us are spending, number one. And number two is while the banks above us are spending more than that, we have a much simpler, less complex more straightforward business model.</p><p>So I would maintain that our $2.5 billion is much more effectively spent in terms of outcomes and production, and we're able to do that in this environment in a -- moving a lot more of our projects from defense to offense. You're going to hear a lot about that in a moment, but we're making tremendous progress. So when you think about M&amp;A, coming back to that point about the industry, M&amp;A is occurring in the industry and in payments for 2 reasons: number one is scale and number two is capabilities.</p><p>We believe we have the scale as I've already talked about, and importantly, we already have this great payments business sitting in U.S. Bank. And our objective is to weave that into the banking component because of the importance of payments and banking coming together in this new environment.</p><p>So really we have the scale and the competencies to be successful. So we do not believe we need to do an acquisition. However, it would not be prudent of us to put our head in the sand and not be aware what's going on in the market. So we will look at opportunities as they present themselves under the following lens, it's a long-term lens. You're going to hear about a lot of progress today, and we've made a lot of progress across the company and the momentum is terrific. So as we think about deals, we recognize that there's going to be a distraction with the deal, somewhere in the neighborhood of 18 months to 2.5 years. So the question we ask is will we be a better bank after that's done, 3 to 4 years from now than we would be on our own with the momentum we're making. So we're not looking at the short term or the day 1 announcement or that initial financial projection. It's the long-term positioning of the company and making sure we're in the best position possible given the momentum we have and that's how we think about it.</p><p>Now the second thing you'll notice from this chart is we are more valuable than we are big. If you look at the left-hand side, you'll see 1/4 of the size of the bank above us in terms of asset size. But if you look at the right, we're more than 1/2 in terms of value. And one of the key reasons for that is our returns. From an ROE, ROA and efficiency standpoint, this chart is the last 3 years. We are #1, #1 and #1. But if I did the last 10 years, we have the same position, #1 across the board. It's function of a lot of things but I wanted -- the message to you is our intent to retain that position in this new environment regardless of what happens.</p><p>And if you step back and look at our advantages, I'm going to classify them in 4 categories. I already talked about our financial discipline and our financial measurements. I would also maintain -- so we have a very good offense. I would also maintain, we have the best defense. You're going to hear from both Terry and Mark in terms of when the rough -- when the road gets rougher, we actually perform even better. That's true in the CCAR process, we have the least amount of capital implication. We make money even out of the most severely adverse scenario. It's true of our charge-off volatility, which is much less volatile in a harsh environment than anyone else. And importantly, we haven't changed our stripes in our credit underwriting so that financial discipline, that risk discipline which leads to the highest debt ratings in our peer group and among the highest on the globe, which is a tremendous advantage from a funding cost standpoint, a competence standpoint and a counterparty of choice standpoint. Huge opportunity, huge advantage and one that's very important to us.</p><p>Secondly, our business mix. We have this great diversity of businesses that offer diversity of sources of income about 1/2 of it, a little less than half in fees. Some of it from net interest income and together they really diversify during economic cycles. And importantly, unlike a number of banks, we have a number of unique business lines. Corporate trust, fund services and payments that are very capital efficient, high return, scalable businesses that we have a huge advantage in, which drives the efficiencies and the returns that I just talked about.</p><p>Number three, I talk about trust, confidence, being so important in this environment, and Kate will share with you some of the facts about how we've positioned -- how we're positioned very well from a trust standpoint.</p><p>We've always done things for the right reasons. Our employees are highly engaged. And that trust factor, which I think is even more important in this environment, is one that we're starting from a position of strength. And finally, our strategy, which is 4 simple components: number one, retaining the financial and risk management discipline, our trusted choice component; number two is looking at activities across the bank just like that across the bank. We spend very little time as a team thinking about business line by business line and really thinking about the customer at the center of everything we do; number three on the right, I'm a big believer in this, I think we have a great opportunity to continue to drive for simplicity across the company. Simplicity in the way customers deal with us and make it simple for employees to do their job.</p><p>And then finally, the future. We understand that things are changing rapidly. We're not going to just sit back and say, we've got it all in place. We don't need to change it all because we know what we're doing, and we'll just keep doing what we're doing. We need to adjust and we're recognizing that. So for those of you in the audience who have invested with us for the last 10 years, the good news is, those things that you invested in us for, our financial discipline, our business mix, our risk management and our culture are not going to change.</p><p>Those strengths are strengths that we recognize are critically important for the future, and we're not going to change our stripes.</p><p>However, I believe and our team believes strongly that those are necessary but insufficient to be successful in the future under this new environment. And the pivot we need to make while retaining those core competencies is to be more agile, innovative and you're going to hear this theme throughout the day more digitally focused across the board. So as we think about what we're investing in the future, I want to talk about this sort of balance.</p><p>One of you in the room came to speak to our Board about 2 years ago. And you said one of the things we like about U.S. Bank is that they manage the company forever, and that was a great way to say it because that's exactly how we think about it. We're managing a company for the long term. However, we recognize that while we manage the company for the long term, we need to perform in the short term.</p><p>I get that too, so I will never forget that. So this is great balance that we're looking at, which is optimizing things we're doing today to continue to invest for the things we want to be great at tomorrow.</p><p>The optimization on the left-hand side includes things like our business mix. So we've actually exited a number of businesses that either have limited competitive advantage from our perspective, are not going to be as critical in the future because they're paper-based businesses or demand a lot of investment with limited return.</p><p>Businesses like Retail Lockbox and our ATM driving business with cash operations, and we're going to continue to look at optimizing our business mix. I talked about physical asset optimization, a great opportunity for both efficiencies and effectiveness of what's going on in a branch, and we're looking at that across the board. Upper right, structure. Terry will talk about this a little bit more. We're looking across the company for spans of control and the way we're managing call centers across every area of the company looking for optimization and efficiencies.</p><p>And you're going to hear from Jeff on technology and risk. But technology and risk is an investment for the future but also optimizing the current, and Jeff's going to talk a lot about that. So we're doing all those things to optimize what we have here now in order to be successful in investing in the digital money movement capabilities as well as new markets in the future.</p><p>And as we think about that future investment, I think about it across 3 horizons. On a core business model, we want to be the very best consumer in business bank, the very best wealth manager, the very best payments business and corporate and commercial bank in the industry and running that as effectively for the benefit of our customers as possible. While at the same time, transforming the way we're doing that business, seeking that optimization and recognizing the technical investments that we need to make to continue going forward. And that middle category is sort of this horizon of 1 to 3 years. And all the while, looking at that future that horizon that's a little longer, little less clear but we know there are certain components that we need to have core capabilities to drive our success and have that agility and digital focus. So across those 3 horizons, we're focused on these 5 things.</p><p>Number one, relentlessly focusing on the customer. Everything we do at the company is with the customer in the center and all of our capabilities around that. The way we think about product development, technology, service, operations, communications, we're looking at the customer at the core of what we do.</p><p>Secondly, and you're -- if you do a word count, and what you're going to hear the word most today is going to be digital. I believe that digital is critical to the future of our success and being able to deliver digital capabilities in a seamless, convenient, agile, quick fashion is going to be critically important and we're investing heavily in that.</p><p>Data. Banks have always been great collectors of data, and have always been lousy users of data, right? And what we're focused on is collecting that data and using it for the benefit of the customers. You're going to hear about insights, insights to consumers around their objectives of savings goals and financial goals overall. Insights to businesses, to help them improve the way they're running their business. And that data component combined with that digital component is critically important.</p><p>Partnerships is another one. The other thing that we recognize is that we can't build everything ourselves and be everything to all customers. And you're going to hear about some of the partnerships today with some fintech players where they have as core capability, typically in a thin, unregulated slice of a capability often a front-end combined with our balance sheet, our customer base, our underwriting and our risk discipline. Together, we are stronger than we are separately, and we're going to continue to focus on partnerships across the board.</p><p>And then finally, really this concept of one U.S. Bank, breaking down the barriers of businesses, thinking about the customers and not just the way we're dealing with customers but internally the way we're optimizing across the company. We no longer do our investment prioritization business line by business line, we do it as a company. We do it as one entity across the board. So that's our focus area.</p><p>Now I know a lot of you have followed the company for a long time, and we have always focused on those things that we can control, and we will continue to do that. I can't control the economic environment, the interest rate environment but I can control the expenses and the optimization that we focused on. We're past our build on compliance as I talked about into the optimization phase. We've increased the tax relief in 2017, allowed us to increase our investment spend, which is now on the run rate and that's part of that $2.5 billion a year that I've talked about, and then we're looking for optimization across the board.</p><p>Terry is going to talk about our capital investment, and you're going to hear a lot about our investment overall -- capital return and our investment overall. Now one of the things I also recognize back to that balance component is we need to continue to perform in the short term and we're looking at the long term. And there were a few years principally during the consent order process that we were not able to deliver positive operating leverage. And I know that's important to you, it's important to me and our management team. However, in 7 of the past 8 quarters, we did deliver positive operating leverage for all the reasons I talked about. And on the second quarter call, and we've talked about it a few times, our objective was to achieve it in the range of 100 to 150 basis points for the year. Now since then as you know, rates have come down and the rate scenario has changed dramatically. And so while our intent is to continue to achieve positive operating leverage and to continue to have low single-digit expense growth, it's likely that we'll be somewhat below that 1% positive operating leverage in 2019 but still delivering positive operating leverage. Because if we did the things that would need -- or caused us to get to that level, it would not be prudent for the long term, and we want to manage this company for the long term and that's how we're thinking about it.</p><p>So as we think about how all this adds up, and I'm going to shortcut a slide that Terry is going to give you because it's so important is whatever the environment is, whatever the interest rate, the credit environment is in the long term, it's our intent to continue to return 14.5% to 17.5% ROE to our shareholders. We believe we have the business mix, the disciplines, the strengths, the core capabilities to do that on a consistent basis over the long term and that is our intent and Terry will talk more about the details about that in a moment. And that translates into a tangible return on equity somewhere between 18% and 20%. So I believe we're in a great spot. I believe we have the great -- the core capabilities, the strengths that have gotten us there and we're going to continue to maintain them, but we're going to build from that success given the future and what's important in the long term in order to be successful over the next 3, 5 and 10 years and that's the way we think about the company.</p><p>So what are you going to hear about today? We're going to split the discussion a little bit in terms of broad initiatives across the company, business line updates and then talking about our risk and financial discipline at the end. So at the beginning here, you're going to hear Kate talk about brand and culture and how important that is to our success and our unique position in that regard. You're going to hear Jeff von Gillern talk about our technology group, and he's going to talk about it both from the perspective of offense as well as defense and he's -- we have a great position on that on both sides. And then we're going to wrap up the morning part of this -- the first part of the morning with Derek talking about our digital strategy.</p><p>So again, thank you for your time and attention. I'm really excited about the story we're going to tell you, and we're going to kick it off with Kate Quinn, our Chief Administrative Officer, who's been with the company 6 years. Kate?</p><p>KATHERINE B. QUINN, VICE CHAIRMAN &amp; CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER, U.S. BANCORP: Good morning. Brand and culture are differentiators for U.S. Bank and they are fundamental to how we run our business. When we met last year in 2016, we talked about how strong brands drive better shareholder return. They also drive higher top line growth and they outperform the S&amp;P 500. I'll tell you today what we've done on our brand journey since then, where we're positioned and what's next for us.</p><p>So increasingly, people are not just buying what you do, they're buying why you do it. So when we began our brand journey, we started from the inside out. We started with our culture, which is a unique combination of IQ and EQ and that is reflected in our purpose statement. We invest our hearts and minds to power human potential. The trend of culture is very important. So when you think about the sea of black and white banking, this gray space is really, really important, the space of brand and culture. It unifies and rallies employees and it's why is felt across all of our stakeholders.</p><p>The intersection of brand and culture is differentiating, and it is really the unwritten rule set in which all decisions are made inside the company, and where -- is felt to all of our stakeholders again and it's how we conduct business. We were at a leadership off-site this past summer and we asked our top 200 leaders what is the secret sauce of U.S. Bank, and this is the word cloud that emerged from that. So for those of us who live and breathe it every day, it's no surprise that ethics, trust and collaboration rose to the top.</p><p>As I mentioned why it's felt across all of our stakeholder groups. For employees, it is -- our purpose is motivating for them, and we hear it all the time and there's a reason why we attract and retain top talent across the company. For our customers, they feel it in all of our efforts to earn their trust. And in fact, when we test proof points, when we test products and services, we test marketing messages, we test everything. Ethics and trust rises to the #1 spot for all customer segments, both consumers and businesses.</p><p>In terms of communities, we have an industry-leading reputation with our community partners, and again, it isn't because necessarily of what we do but how and why we engage with them. And lastly, you all feel it as well and our other shareholders. It's felt in our best-in-class return, our focus on the long term and our consistent performance of course. But we often know that expectations are definitely changing. So all stakeholders are now really expecting brands to have a voice on social issues. In fact, 92% of millennials want to work for and believe it's important to work for a company that has a social conscience. We hear it from all of our stakeholders internally and externally.</p><p>We also know that this heightened set of expectations is not just important to our customers and employees but it's also important to you. We hear the questions from you as well. So when we think about our social responsibility strategy and our focus, we've always been good at it, but we're getting even stronger at it, and we're focused in 3 areas: first, making sure that what we do has social impact and there are -- examples of this are things like enabling access to capital, financial wellness programs; secondly, we're focused on diversity, equity and inclusion, this is a critical focus area for us; and lastly, making sure that we're doing our part to address environmental challenges, and we do that through our products and services, through our partnerships but also through accountability and governance around these issues. So we will make sure to keep you posted as we evolve this strategy.</p><p>So you can probably tell when we started our brand launch, we were not focused on advertising. We were really focused on telling -- capturing and telling our story in a better, more integrated and consistent way across all of our stakeholder groups internally and externally, digitally and socially. And we also -- as Andy mentioned, we've really changed our focus from thinking about ourselves and presenting ourselves as a regional brand to presenting ourselves as a national brand. And of course, being a bank, we measure everything we do. And so we know that we have had strong impact. As expected, our brand awareness in U.S. Bank has increased over these past few years. We've also strengthened our most trusted choice positioning. We've had an undeniable positive impact on revenue and deposit share.</p><p>And lastly, we've also increased our, what we call, central customers, which are customers that have a deeper relationship with the bank. They're more engaged and more involved with us and you'll hear about [centralities] throughout the deck. So brand finance recognizes that we've increased our brand by 55% over the past 3 years and lots of other brands also recognized our performance from an external perspective. So for example, Ethisphere, Fortune, Forbes, DiversityInc.</p><p>In terms of our reputation with community partners, I mentioned this before, we have the strongest reputation amongst all banks with community partners. And again, this is because of how we engage with them, and how we commit to our success and their success within our communities. In terms of employee engagement, we historically have industry and company leading employee engagement scores. And we know that companies with highly engaged workforces outperform their peers by nearly 150%. Focusing on culture is good business. And when we think about how do we translate that employee engagement and our brand to growth, it's a very simple equation. Higher employee engagement leads to a stronger customer experience, which leads to revenue, retention and growth. So when we think about our employees and our customers, we think about them in a very similar way. This is all leveraged with data, analytics and insights that help us focus on knowing exactly what you spend time on.</p><p>So we work on attracting, retaining and developing our relationships with both employees and customers. And we focus on 3 things: one, creating compelling journeys for them both. For example, personalizing their experiences with us; secondly, enhancing and enabling their digital lives. As Andy said, you'll hear the word digital throughout the day; and lastly, by establishing really deep and meaningful relationships with both. This helps us build our customer brand as well as our employee brand resulting again in revenue, retention and growth. Trust will remain a competitive advantage for us. It is not going anywhere. It is going to be a foundational driver, top driver of business in our industry. As the world evolves, we will remain competitive, we will stay relevant with our brand, and we'll focus on the moments that matter to our employees and our customers.</p><p>We will continue to drive impact through our social strategies, and we will build trust at moments that matter most. We will tell our story through our brand campaign but really, our employees are our best brand ambassadors.</p><p>Let me just give you one example of that. In Northern California, during the wildfires, many employees and customers lost their homes. We weren't able to open our branch. We have a Branch Manager named [Taylor], and Taylor opened up his home to employees that had lost their homes. He invited them to stay with him, live with him. And from his home, he reached out to customers to make sure that they were safe, that they had what they needed during the crisis. This is a great example of our unique culture and how that impacts our customers in a positive way. Brands have become an agent of change at the bank. It supported some of our most critical initiatives and it grows engagement as well as revenue. It is a core competency for us and it is foundational to how we conduct our business every day. It's also foundational to the story that you will hear for the rest of the day. Brand and culture will remain differentiators for us to our business growth and success. Thank you.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Thanks, Kate. And [Taylor] is one of my heroes. I called him after that fire. And he said, \"You know what we're going to do, Andy? We're going to roast marshmallows.\" He was just -- he just had the best attitude I've ever seen. So just a great example of the employee base that we have.</p><p>So we're going to go from sort of the soft gray as you talked about, Kate, but important components to 0 and 1. So we're going to go off on the other side of your brain here for a minute and talk about technology and operations. This is important to our company for a number of reasons, but it's supportive for both the core as I talked about as well as the future. Jeff's been leading this group for 20 years, he's done a tremendous job. And I think we have the best technology group in banking and the best leader. Jeff.</p><p>JEFFRY H. VON GILLERN, VICE CHAIRMAN OF TECHNOLOGY &amp; OPERATIONS SERVICES, U.S. BANCORP: Thank you, Andy. Well, good morning, everyone. Now technology is the backbone that's helping enable to drive efficiency, productivity and growth for us. And as Andy talked about and I'll focus on today, we've increased our level of investment in the technology area at about $2.5 billion and that's in the run right now. But I think what's more important and hopefully I demonstrate to you today is how we're shifting the spend in that category.</p><p>We talk about offense and defense and we do our capital allocation, our investment allocation and we categorize against that. We also track all of our employee time against that, so it's something we're very focused on. And you're continuing to see the size of the pie related to offense, which is driving productivity and growth to get more investment than defense. And part of that is coming off the large compliance work that we did.</p><p>And in the category of defense, there was also some really good things that were done with the investments that were made for AML and KYC because that's a very data-ecosystem-driven environment. And so those investments at that time, we may categorize as defense. You're going to see where we're leveraging those investments because of the way that we're landing all of our transactional data in one place, we're going to be leveraging that quite significantly and applying AI and so forth to it. So that's an example of defense spend that's going to be optimizing the future for offense.</p><p>And I think the other thing that's really important as you look below that $2.5 billion, these are a lot of technologies on the left side that I'm going to talk about today. And we look at these as tools, not solutions and it's how you activate these and empower these things for business impact that's important. But we run a big operation. We have a constant focus on the run side and the maintenance side of that, and these new capabilities are going to allow us for every dollar we can take out of the run and the maintain side we can reinvest.</p><p>So when you think about that $2.5 billion, that's not just spending more, that's focused shift to offense. It's being prudent in defense because I would say that the security space is still continuing to get its fair share of investment and probably we'll continue to do that but it's how we're spending. And I'm going to take you through a little bit of how these technologies are going to allow us to optimize internally and to do some shifts in how we operate.</p><p>Today as you've heard, digital is a big thing, and we're going to introduce a term here today called above the glass and below the glass, as we talk about things today. I'll touch briefly on it. Derek is going to focus more on the above the glass, I'm going to spend more time on the below the glass and the optimization and the speed of the organization of things that we're focused on there.</p><p>But just simply put, it's not just the focus on our customers and consumers and how they interface with us in a digital world and how we make it simple for them intuitive, tailored, customized but it's also important for employees, and we have an equal focus on making sure that the employees' tools and capabilities are there to serve our customers as well. So that above the glass experience you'll see in our branches as well as our branch folks deal with customers as they come in and help educate them and train them on the digital space. The below the glass is really important, and I'm going to spend more time on that because that's where we've got tremendous opportunities to move faster, have more agility in the organization. That's changing the way that we work but it's also using technology tools differently and in a prudent way leveraging the cloud, which is a real key asset. And I'm going to talk more about that, there's a lot of focus on the cloud, and we've been keenly focused on that for the last 2 years, and I'll talk about the implications of that in our plans.</p><p>Probably one of the more powerful things are what are called application programming interfaces or APIs. And these are just -- they enable rapid access to data. And when you have many applications like a lot of banks do, it allows easy intuitive access to programs that already exist and drives efficiency, allows us to build things one time and reuse it many times. And so you're going to hear a lot more about APIs. In fact, if you were to look at our investment level in micro services and API, that's going to be a key enabler that's going to allow us to pull efficiency out of the core systems and have less dependency on those core systems. And that's an expense play but it's also a cycle time play and it's an efficiency for testing and software development that I'm going to talk a little bit more about today.</p><p>As you think about below the glass, we kind of keep it simple and we think about it in 3 categories. It's our architecture and we've had a very disciplined approach through our acquisitions in the past that we integrate, we move to single platforms. I'm a big, big believer in having limited complexity in the operation we have to the extent we can.</p><p>The way that we can limit complexity is not only a cost save but it also allows our change rates to go faster. So that single platform -- disciplined single platform architecture has been very important for us, pays dividends for us long term.</p><p>The other area is data, and you're going to hear a lot about data today. I'm going to talk about it but you'll hear it in a lot of other things. We have a tremendous amount of data, and we're not using it to our best advantage, and we have plans to scale that up. When we here 3 years ago, if I were to look back and look at where we are now, we've added hundreds of people in this space, we brought in tremendous new leadership. And I'll talk more about that. But this is a key focus for us and I'm going to give you some examples of where we're already using it and it's making a big impact. And then Andy talked about, we just have to change the way that we work and that's not just in the technology group, it's as a collective group. Putting the customer at the center, we've done a lot of changes. You heard about the agile studios where everybody's coming together, and we're codeveloping together with the customer in the center of it, and that's going to continue to evolve and continue to expand across the bank.</p><p>APIs and microservices are really important. And what we want to do here is we want to build these microservices, and we're doing this at a rapid rate to allow reuse of the technology and the code and it's going to make us much more efficient. We track how fast we can code and test. In the fourth quarter last year because of all of the automation that's coming through some of these new capabilities, we were able to do some optimization in the workforce in the neighborhood of several hundred people as a result of testing automation being built into the development process. And the reason that's important is not just for productivity and cost saves, but that automation is what it's told to do every time and it produces evidence and results that our auditors and our regulators are comfortable with but it also drives a lot of efficiency, and we're excited about the continued opportunities there.</p><p>Those are things within that $2.5 billion that every dollar of that we can get more efficient with, we can self-fund and so that's a big, big focus of our group is how do we self-fund not just go ask for more money. These type of technologies are very key to that.</p><p>Let me talk just a little bit about modernization. When I say modernization, it's enabling optimization. I'll use the mobile app, for example. That's the last -- this launch that we just had, and we rebuilt that completely from the ground up. It's a completely advanced new tech stack, highly automated from the build, the test, the deploy process. We did all that from start to finish in 8 months for the Apple platform and because of the efficiencies that we're in, Android rolled out 4 months later. So that's an example of a highly automated, highly collaborative, collective group with the customer in the center, risk management at the table, security at the table, built-in product that launched that's had great results. But we did it with fewer people than it took to do our last mobile update. We did it twice as fast, and we have opportunities to continue to get better at that. You can see some of the examples here of code test time from weeks to hours and so forth. So major productivity gains in this space.</p><p>We talked about data, and we've got a tremendous amount of data. We need to use that data better. We need to unlock that data so our employees can use it in their business lines in running their businesses. We use it for defense around fraud. We have a lot of commercial fraud tools that we use, and we're using data and AI on the back side of that to continue to drive down fraud losses in an efficient manner. We use it in the security space, and I'll talk more about that specifically a little bit but the security environment is data driven. It's all about data, it's about finding the needle in a haystack at machine speed, it's critical.</p><p>I mentioned 3 years ago when we were here, we've continually scaled this group up, so as I said, several hundred people dedicated to this now, new leadership that's coming that's very talented, and we're really going to make a big, big push on this.</p><p>When we did all of the AML/KYC work, we had to centralize and land all of our transaction data in one place and the funding for that was paid forward the time, and we need to now better advance that and better leverage that but we've got the building blocks and the foundation there to do that with, and we've got the people and the leadership to put the focus on it. It's a tremendous opportunity for us.</p><p>This is an example of it that's real, that occurred with our mobile app rollout, and this is an example of where we're customizing and bringing tailored experiences to the user based on access to real-time data and artificial intelligence. And the beauty of this, you can send out kind of generic tips to customers that don't feel personal, this is personal. And this has caused us to get some of the most positive feedback on the mobile app release, but better than the positive feedback is the engagement and the usage. If we look at our usage rates, now Tim is going to talk about this in more detail, our customers on a daily basis are using the app more. And that's because they're finding value. And that's what we want, we want to drive engagement, we want to drive more volume on that app.</p><p>And obviously, we want to continue to build feature function to be able to sell and to be able to do self service. Derek and Tim will talk more about that. But these are examples of that real-life capability of the mobile app, real-time access to data, artificial intelligence that's tailoring what it's presenting to our customers and it's been a very positive thing.</p><p>Andy talked about the Experience Studios. We're changing the way we work in a lot of different areas of the bank and the Experience Studios, we'll double those. We're planning to go from 22 to double it to 44. But the employees that work in those studios don't ever want to go back to the old way of work and which is really kind of neat and it's -- you go in those studios and you'll see more about this in a little bit, but I just want to give you my perspective and observation on it.</p><p>You can't tell who works for who, and it's kind of neat. And some of it you've got vendors in there, you've got customers in there in the middle of it but it's a collective team. And the other thing we've done is we've kept management out of there. We've let the people that know what they're doing do their job and make the decisions and resolve issues without having to do a whole bunch of escalation. So it's been positive and I think we've got tremendous upside as we continue to expand this across the rest of company.</p><p>Let me talk about cloud for just a little bit because there's been a lot of press and coverage on the cloud. We've been on a journey over the last 2 years. We run 2 highly efficient scalable data centers in North America, and we've been going private cloud in those data centers, and that just means highly virtualized, hyper converged. Those are all the practices you would have in a public cloud, too. We have been doing that in our internal data centers. We're now building all new applications. It's a tenet we have that it has to be public cloud ready. Our first large payment business gateway will go live in the cloud. That will be our next one the end of this month. So all new build is being built with cloud principles for cloud public. In addition to that, we're going across the application base and we do what's called a suitability study for applications that lend themselves well to the public cloud. We'll identify those and we'll refactor those and move those, but there's also an equal path that says we want to sunset some of these things and we want to get rid of them. The cloud has tremendous value from a standpoint of financial economics. We have a lot of vendor products that we use today but there's open source capabilities that are much, much cheaper.</p><p>The investment is all going in the cloud. That's where the new tools are, that's where the collaboration is, that's where the productivity is, and so we're very focused on it. But at the same time, we recognize anything we do has to be secure. And at the end of the day, if we're going to put our business in somebody else's house, we have to be accountable for the security of that. And to be accountable for the security of that, you've got to understand and guarantee that you understand what's going on in that cloud and that's a key focus for us. If we don't get that right, we have a trust and a reputation impact, and we take that extremely seriously.</p><p>On the topic of security, key focus for us, this is an area where we have tremendous information sharing amongst the banks but it's becoming more automated. The feeds we get through FS-ISAC that all the banks feed into the vectors go into that 5 billion data elements a day that we look at and we make decisions on at machine speed, and we're looking for that needle in a haystack. And on a typical day against that volume of activity, we'll have between 10 and 14 type of events that we need to have a human look at, decide to make a change to and so forth.</p><p>But in parallel with automation and orchestration, we're continuing to drive automated actions at a subsecond basis that we're comfortable with. And our automation penetration is about 20%. We have a goal to get that up closer to 40% to 50%. What that means is, we know enough about what's happened with a particular event. We're going to go ahead and through automation take action on that, and then we're going to make the security operations center where -- what occurred from an automation standpoint. And that's the only way that we're going to be able to keep up with the pace of activity and attacks and things that are going on. So it's a key focus for us. And although I put this in the defense category, this was probably the larger of the expense growth areas of -- in the area that I oversee.</p><p>So just in conclusion, there's going to be an impact to the way that we're changing the way we work both from a speed and agility standpoint. But we want to be anticipatory of customer needs and stay in front of those. We want our development processes to continue to be fast. But I'd tell you just in conclusion, we're laser focused on efficiency, productivity and growth. Thank you.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Things that I recognized early on in my role as CEO is that all these digital initiatives we had going on across the company, I think, would be better controlled and maximized for effectiveness and efficiency if they were under one leader across the company because we're really dealing with customers that segment across all the businesses. So we spent a fair bit of time identifying the role and finding the right person. And Derek White, who joined us from a European industry-leading bank in the digital front, joined us just 3 months ago. He has made a big change already. Derek, come up and talk about our digital experiences.</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE, CHIEF DIGITAL OFFICER, U.S. BANCORP: Thank you, Andy. It's a privilege to be with you here today. It's a privilege to be a part of U.S. Bank and a true privilege to be part of this leadership team. At U.S. Bank, we power human potential. Now I love that statement and you've heard from Kate that it is the very ethos in which this company operates. It is one of the things that attracted me to the company. But let me tell you before I get started, I'd like to touch on the 3 things that really drove my decision to join U.S. Bank.</p><p>The first is that we're the #1 rated bank in the world, and I don't need to explain to you the impact of what that does for us financially and how it positions us for growth. But what it was to me was a signal of when you -- we describe and use the word excellent. What is the ambition and what is the benchmark for excellent? Because that comes to the second point. In the interview process, I was able to meet with the managing team and sitting across the table from Andy and we were discussing the future of the company. He said, \"Derek, we are excellent at finance, we are excellent at credit risk management, we have the ambition to be excellent at digital.\" And so when Andy informed me that we're creating the Chief Digital Officer role, which is the third reason I chose to join U.S. Bank, the creation of this role and the opportunity to work with this leadership team to create the future of U.S. Bank for our customers, our clients and our employees was incredibly attractive.</p><p>Now there are 3 teams that are aligned into the Chief Digital Officer team. Those 3 teams are the omnichannel team, which is responsible for essentially all of the interaction platforms. You'll hear the term interactions a lot today. The interaction platforms is how our human customers are interacting with their money through our platforms. And that is the team that is defining the what of what we're going to create. The agile team is responsible for the studios that you've heard referenced and changing the how we take ideas and land them in the hands of our customers at speed and at scale. And the third is the innovation team that's asking the question where next and why not. Now one of the great strengths of U.S. Bank is our deep customer relationships. In order for us to become central, which Tim will elaborate on more in the definition of centrality, we know that we need to be digital first, create exceptional experiences and move at speed.</p><p>One of the privileges of working in banking is that in institutional banking, we get exposure to every industry, every sector. We get to sit at the table with the leaders that are shaping every industry and as I sit with Leslie and Jim and across the table from some of these leading clients, there are key messages that emerge. Every single one of their businesses, their industries is being disrupted and transformed and are -- they're addressing the same questions about digital, agile and their future. How do they capture the future in a way that responds to the way their customers are interacting with technology and their products.</p><p>It's about humans and human interaction with compute, human interaction with technology, human interaction with technology and products and/or services. In our industry, it's about humans interacting with money. We see that across the billions of interactions that we have with our customers. Billions of interactions that come through all of our channels. Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest inventors of our time, has said that the impact of AI comes to life when you deal with billions. That's how we bring the technology and the power of artificial intelligence, machine learning to life through the billions of interactions that we have with our customers.</p><p>Now this is important because the traffic. In the early '90s in the digital world, the early '90s was all about eyeballs. It was about impressions in the digital marketing world and it was about clicks. In our world, in banking, it's the shift of the traffic from the physical brick world to the digital world. And that started the move from brick to glass to the glass that we all carry around with us every day to increasingly to the air and how humans are interacting hands free with computers both in the car and the battle of the home through the echo, the portal, the pod.</p><p>Big tech is trying to attack in the same way because -- to dimension this in banking, the average human customer walks into a branch 10 times a year. They visit the glass or the mobile banking application 300 times a year. They are visiting digital ecosystems 3,000 times a year and these digital ecosystems have 3 goals in mind, the big tech. Andy talked about where the source of our competition, the threats and the opportunities for us are. One of those is the big techs. Big techs have 3 goals in mind: one, to scale the billions of users; two, to increase the amount of interactions and time that you spend on their platform. Reed Hastings has said that their competition is fleet. The third thing they then do is seek to monetize. Now take that model and contrast that against how banking starts. Why is this relevant? In a conversation with a Chief Executive at one of these big ecosystems of whom you would all know, he described their #1 KPI centers on their second priority, which is increasing interactions and engagements on their platform and their #1 KPI is messages sent.</p><p>In order to understand the future of banking and how humans are interacting with technology, the traffic has shifted at a rate of 30x the number of interactions in physical versus digital. We have to look at the business in an entirely different way, and I would suggest to you that the leading indicator for the future of banking is interaction.</p><p>Now with that as context, what are we doing to translate these learnings that we see across every industry, across our institutional clients. And as we listen and see how our customers are interacting with their money through U.S. Bank, it comes to a simple model of 4-2-3-1. And yes, I do know how to count backwards. And yes, you may be surprised that Andy even hired me. Even though I did it. Anyway, 4-2-3-1. It's about 4 humans of banking and then we over indexed on humans because in banking many times, institutions will talk about the customer as a product. There -- in the digital world, this is so essential to understand that we design around the human user because in the -- digital customers can navigate increasingly by themselves. Those 4 humans are me, my money, the consumer. The second is a small business owner that blends my money and my company's money. The third is the institutional employee, whether it's a treasurer in a large multinational corporate or someone sitting at family office that is managing money, making decisions about money, interacting with money on behalf of their employer or my employer. The fourth human is the U.S. Bank employee that is supporting and enabling the other 3 humans that are interacting with money. Now those 4 humans interact with money in only 1 of 2 ways, and this is where digital becomes very tangible, real 1s and 0s. And that is you can -- those humans interact either in a DIY world, do-it-yourself world, or in a shared glass experience.</p><p>DIY is the ability and this principle is so simple. It's not self service. It is the ability to do it yourself in the mobile device without having to talk to a human if you don't want to and it's the first step of digital evolution for any bank. The principle of DIY or a shared glass experience where we bring data to life and increased transparency through a shared glass experience with our customers as they enter our branches.</p><p>Now why is this model important and relevant especially for today in this audience? DIY is a 20% cost income ratio or efficiency model business. Shared glass experiences -- shared experiences are a 60% cost income or efficiency model business. DIY has higher customer satisfaction, higher revenues, lower cost. Four humans interact with technology and money in 2 ways. There are 3 ways for organizations any company, Leslie's and Jim's clients can measure it as well as banks can measure it. The first is, is it -- is digital available? When we say digital first, is it available? Are the 50 reasons that I would leave my home and walk into a branch, spend the time to physically walk into a brick -- into a brick branch, is it available for me to do that? In our mobile banking application, you could do 74% of the things that you would take the time to walk into a physical branch to do. It's very tangible, it's very measurable.</p><p>The consumer business is more mature than the institutional businesses and that's natural across our industry. But the same principle applies across every business we have. Once it is available that helps me to do it by myself, then can I make smarter decisions and is the data, as has been talked by Jeff and Andy, are we using the data to bring it back through the glass to the customer that is in a DIY experience? Because in banking see over the last 7 years, there's been a lot of discussion about data lakes and capturing the data that comes in through every interaction, cleaning the data and then parking in this beautiful pristine lake as it's safe and secure. But the real secret in the digital world is bringing that data back out of the lake through the glass into the experience and measuring in every one of these billions of interactions that we have, are we using the data? Because when we use the data and it's a smart interaction, I make smarter decisions. Now the third phase, this is where it gets really fun, is autonomy.</p><p>One of the industries in which we work is the automotive industry. And in the automotive industry, they define 5 levels of autonomy. The Tesla today is somewhere between a level 2, level 3 autonomy and it can easily be described as feed on, hands on and mind on.</p><p>Now feed off has been around for a very long time in the automotive industry. Hands off has been around for less time. If you ever spent an hour going 150 miles an hour on the Autobahn hands off, your mind is shattered. This is relevant because building trust in the digital world is about enabling and using our data to help people make decisions themselves, but also how do you build trust to the point where we can build a self-driven bank account and they will trust us to guide them to their destination. Four humans, 2 interaction models, 3 key ways to measure digital maturity and building digital trust in the future. All comes to the simplicity of the U.S. Bank model, the focus that we have on being and creating #1 amazing experiences as our leading indicator for our future. This translates -- we're translating this into 5 priorities for us as a digital team working with each of the businesses that we have and you'll hear from later today. Our business leaders know what our customers want and how we make money. We sit with them. We identify how do we collectively create the future together by: one, DIY-ing the future for all 4 humans; two, creating smart interactions; three, ensuring that we have the data below the glass that we can bring through the glass back to the customer, that the architecture is clean, simple, reusable microservices and APIs because the 400 things that a human wants to do above the glass translates into 900 plus microservices below the glass, very tangible, very measurable, very real.</p><p>And the one area that I'd like to just expand on a little bit that's been touched on as well is the speed and scale, which we're creating the future and that's in these -- in the studios that we have. The agile studios where -- we've been at it for 18 months. We have core teams that are creating the future in these studios. But it is -- agile has expanded beyond these studios broader into the organization. We're collaborating across every part of the organization. One of the biggest surprises to me having worked in other organizations that are agile is that risk is sitting at the table embedded in every single one of these studios and helping us shape and design the future rather than sitting and watching from the outside trying to control and it's incredibly, incredibly powerful.</p><p>That's changed the rhythm at which we create from years to months. Now just 2 examples to bring this to life, chosen 2 institutional example. You'll hear several examples throughout the day, and again, there are some examples outside the door.</p><p>The first is in our corporate banking space where we are helping Jim and Leslie's clients to be able to help their customers choose how they receive payments, choose how they receive reimbursements. It's a -- the clients had 3 challenges in mind: one is that they're dealing with paper checks; two is that they did not want to disrupt their clients experience. They wanted a seamless enrollment process; and three, they didn't want to store customer data. So we created an experience that addresses the $1 trillion opportunity. It's designed around the clients in mind and it's having -- and it's live in the market today giving our clients the opportunity for their brand to be present through the entire payments process and their end customers choose how they receive payment. The second example is what in the digital world would be described as a killer app. This killer app was created 5 years ago and is now dominant 50% market share and it is pivot. And we've recently introduced the first mobile version of pivot and brought the power of data to life to allow our end users to be able to use Tableau and data visualization to help them make better decisions. There are many, many more examples of this across the business.</p><p>But in summary, our digital initiatives span across the organization. We're working on designing the future around the 4 humans of banking. We're doing it above the glass and below the glass in a very connected and coherent way. We're moving at speed and at scale, translating ideas into the hands of our customers at the speed of technology companies. We're realizing the benefits in customer satisfaction, in revenues and in expenses. Digital and DIY are the basic table stakes. The real power comes to life as we use our data as we make billions of interactions with our customers smart and increasingly autonomous. And this is the long game and we're in it for the long term. Thank you all very much.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Thanks, Derek. I told you you'd hear the word digital a few times this morning. So we're going to take a 15-minute break now, and then after break, we'll go to the business line updates. I would encourage you, you can hear about the digital applications and our products and services. But outside in the foyer, we have actual examples with some hosts there who will want to take you through those technical experiences. So I really encourage you to do that. And for those on the webcast, we'll reconvene at 10:00 Eastern time. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: All right. It's 10:00, and we'll get started. So I kicked off the day talking about the 3 things that I mentioned. We're starting from a position of strength, the core competencies that got us here we're going to continue focus on and we're going to continue to invest in the future.</p><p>The next 4 presentations are going to take those core messages and really transform them in how we are thinking about them from a business line standpoint. We're both optimizing today as well as investing for the future. And we're going to start with Gunjan Kedia, who's been with us for 3 years and leads our Wealth Management and Investor Services (sic) [Wealth Management and Investment Services] group and a great example of both transforming our dealing with the customers in this new environment and also a unique set of businesses. Gunjan?</p><p>GUNJAN KEDIA, VICE CHAIRMAN OF WEALTH MANAGEMENT &amp; INVESTMENT SERVICES, U.S. BANCORP: Thank you, Andy. Good morning. It's my pleasure to present the Wealth Management and Investment Services business this morning. We are -- this division is about 13% the revenues of U.S. Bank, 21% of the fees, 21% of deposits. The business -- the division is really a collection of 3 large businesses, all of them focused on the investment part of the financial institution. 1/3 of it is Wealth Management and 2/3 of this is Investment Services with Corporate Trust being the larger of the 2 businesses.</p><p>You'll see on the bottom right where 61% of our revenues are fee income. So these are very capital-efficient businesses. On the right-hand side, the number that I'd like to point out is the ROA, 6-plus percent ROA across all of these businesses. So very capital-efficient, very high-fee growth businesses.</p><p>Some financial highlights. We have grown revenue about 7% to 7.3% over the last 3 years. The loan growth story has been very, very strong. I'll describe that a little bit. It was a big part of our strategy in Wealth Management, and we are a very strong deposit gatherer, 5% increase in deposits kind of industry-leading efforts here.</p><p>The underpinning of all of these businesses really global financial assets. That is slightly different from many other banking businesses that we have that are propelled by metrics like population growth or GDP growth or consumer spend. Financial assets, when they deepen, even if it's in APAC where we are not present, helps us in the U.S. because U.S. managers invest -- U.S. investors invest globally. And financial markets have been over the last 30 years steadily deepening as economies mature. One metric is that financial assets have grown at about 2%, 2.5% -- 2.5x GDP. In the time frame that we are showing you, we have grown between 8% to 9%. The asset pools itself has grown about 4% and 5%. And our outperformance comes: one because we are concentrated in the U.S. that has done better than the globe and also market share gains. So very, very good core attractive revenue profile here.</p><p>Let me just talk about the Wealth Management business first. We're organized in 4 channels. All of the channels are supported by foundational capabilities, practices and functions that are common. So our chief investment officer, our credit officer, our fiduciary practice, our operations, the product and technology service all our channels.</p><p>Let me start with Ascent. This is our ultra-high net worth business. We launched this business about 8 years back, and it has grown very rapidly for us in the 8 years. We are in 5 offices now. It's a very successful business, but you'll see it addresses a fairly niche and small market for us.</p><p>Our largest business is the private wealth business. The legacy of this business is the old bank trust book. So it's a very profitable business with all of the changes in regulatory tax reforms where the state tax exemption limits have steadily gone up. The demand for trust in the industry is quite muted at this point. So our work in this business has really been to transition it and transform it to a broad-based Private Wealth business. And 2 years back, we had a very important milestone in this business where the trust part of the business became less than half the business. We have focused very much in this business and broadening from just the investment part of Private Wealth, and that's why we've gotten the 12%, 13% loan growth. Our banking practice has grown. Our insurance practice has grown here. So very successful business. We have these beautiful tower offices, about 30 locations that we serve clients out of.</p><p>Moving next to Affluent. Affluent is really our largest growth opportunity. These are $250,000 to $3 million in net investable assets of clients. This business, 3 years back when we were talking to you, was very challenged. You will remember, at that point, the Department of Labor fiduciary rule was at the height of its uncertain outcome. It had the potential of changing the risk profile of the industry quite rapidly. The core product set of the industry, which used to be annuities, were in structural decline. Both supply and demand had compressed. And as a result of it, a lot of advisers have left the industry.</p><p>Today, we find ourselves in an environment that is much, much healthier for this industry. This is the bread and butter of U.S. Bank's client base as well, so our opportunity is quite good. We started the transformation in this business about 3 years back when we fundamentally said to ourselves that the way to serve a client well is to bring all of U.S. Bank to the client and not have them try to find us when they needed us.</p><p>So we created the construct of a team that included an adviser, a banker and other specialists. We align their books, we align their commission structure. We align the space where they were sitting and their management chains became uniform. Now this concept, as many of you might know, is not new in the industry. What has been unique to us is that we've actually made it work. This is a real testimony to the U.S. Bank culture. Our financial advisers that are quite different culturally from our bankers have come together in the best interest of a client to serve them well. The last 2 years, we have seen kind of fruits of this labor and boy, it was labor. This was hard work to try and construct this chemistry between people who are quite different culturally. We've seen double-digit growth emerging. We don't question the model anymore, and it's now about scaling. We are quite small in this business yet. We do cover about half of Tim's branches, 1,500 branches are served to some coverage from financial institutions. We think across our households, about 3 in 10 American households have investable assets out of their 401(k). So we have 12 million households that really love U.S. Bank that recognize the name. Our opportunity is quite significant here.</p><p>The last thing I'll mention very quickly is this Emerging Wealth business. About 2 years back, we introduced the robo-advisor, rebranded automated investor. This is a digital-only offering, and it is meant to serve the needs of the early investor. It takes about a decade for an investor to accumulate $250,000 plus in assets, and where the needs become complicated enough that a team needs to serve them. So this is a new business for us, just getting going. I should mention all of our channels are fully aligned with the U.S. Bank footprint by design. We'll continue to stay that way. Our goal is to be the investment option for a client who's had familiarity and experience with U.S. Bank for a good amount of their time.</p><p>So Andy talked about digital being the word count winner, so let me do my bit here. We started the digital transformation of wealth in 2015. Actually, Terry launched it when he was in my position. And since then every year, we have dropped fairly substantive capabilities along the way. We talked about the robo-advisor. We have just introduced version 2 this year, which is much improved. We introduced digital planning, a real commitment to service clients holistically. It's a collaborative tool. It has been a very successful capability for us. What we are working for most is data aggregation and data analytics. You heard from Jeff. You've heard from Derek. And I will tell you this corporate capability on data analytics has been a sheer joy to me. It is so cool for our business. Our predictive models can actually tell us which client is at risk of attrition. We have seen our attrition drop 2 percentage points. It's a powerful profit lever. We can tell and predict not who's wealthy. That's actually table sticks. You can literally Google a person and you can know who's wealthy. But what we can tell is where are they encountering a life moment that matters, so that we have the right advice offered at the right time. We can tell who's getting married in a year, who's about to have a baby, who might have a divorce, who's thinking of moving because they have a new job lined up. And those are the tools and techniques that we are really utilizing to augment a robust referral model that exists. We have a metric that we measure called the Wealth Management Digital Interaction and that is steadily growing at 33%.</p><p>So the last point I wanted to make is just around the product set and what this means for deepening our relationship. We have every product that a wealthy person might need. In our industry, in the wealth industry, there are 4 formats that are dominant. The biggest is the broker/dealer world. The second is the bank-owned wealth management. The Independent RIAs is the third and the digital platforms, like Fidelity and Schwab. Everybody is trying to get to the place that we are already in, where they can truly offer all product sets. We have had these products for a long time. What's new is, all of the compensation, culture, team organization that actually, let's the adviser team deliver all of these products. I've shown you the metric on the right-hand side. The adviser productivity has really shot up in the last 3 years driven by new client acquisitions, much more than cross-sell within a relationship.</p><p>So that's the story on wealth. Let me turn to Investment Services, also a business focused on investments but on the institutional side. This business, the set of businesses is quite unique to U.S. Bank compared to our peer group. Very capital-efficient business. Let me talk about Corporate Trust. This is kind of a technical business. It really started during the California Gold Rush when an individual -- a trusted third-party used to hold cash between a commitment made by an investor and a gold prospector. We have become that individual trusted, and we are the corporate trustee. Today, by law, every time there's a bond issuance, a securitization, any kind of a debt raise, a third-party corporate trustee is needed, and we hold the cash interest. So you have to be a bank today, and that's why we gather a lot of deposits. A majority of these deposits are operational deposits. That's our business. We have #1 or #2 market share in almost every segment that we play in and the root cause is technology. Our technology platform here is called Pivot. Derek was kind enough to label it a killer app. Thank you, Derek. The creativity of the app is less the user experience, although that has improved with the help of the digital office, but the data and the analytics and the insights behind it allow every credit manager to manage their risk in a very high-quality way, and we are able to provide that in the real-time.</p><p>Fund Services is the second business, focused on money managers. Though -- this business was so high return in the 80s as they rode the wave of mutual fund assets. It attracted significant players and capital in the industry. We have a very niche, unique position. We compete with massive players in this, but we are very good with complexity. The credit managers that are corporate trust managers are shared in large part by this business. And because our operating model is quite different from some of the large players, we don't have massive functionalization. We don't have off-shoring. We have a very stable group of people who really understand managers. Our business model appeals to that kind of niche, and we have really done well in that niche. Assets under administration is the metric that this industry uses. We clock in at $6.8 trillion. That makes us #8 globally. So we are quite substantive here.</p><p>How did we build this business? Because it is a unique business, it's a combination of acquisitions and organic growth. We have done 23 acquisitions in the last 15, 20 years, got very good at doing them quickly and integrating them on one platform. In recent years, it has more been driven by organic growth just because the industry has consolidated. I will tell you outside of the U.S., the industry remains quite fragmented. And in certain niches, like the alternative segment, the industry is quite fragmented. So M&amp;A remains a big part of our strategy, and we are always looking. So today, we have 22,000 clients, 80 offices, about 5,000 wonderful colleagues serving clients.</p><p>Here I want to talk a little bit about how our business model is different because of U.S. Bank ownership. I've been here 3 years. I've studied this a lot. This business is more profitable than I thought it should be, and I figured out why. So I just want to share some numbers with you. The power of the deposits and the balance sheet is very strong at U.S. Bank. We've grown deposits in the last 3 years at 6% that far outpaces the industry growth rate. What is really powerful is the NIM applied against these deposits, that's more than twice the industry average. You can do the math on $72 billion in deposits here on what twice the NIM means in terms of our profit and our ability to invest in technology that has just rolled up our market share organically.</p><p>I would be remiss if I didn't mention points 2 and 3. I call it like fee salespeople and fee distribution, thanks to U.S. Bank. Leslie and Jim will describe the Corporate and Commercial franchise to you. It is an excellent franchise. The relationship's really deep. And every time they're negotiating credit, we are on the table as the fee-based option to complete the relationship, quite a unique angle on business. The contribution of a Community Bank, which I would not have thought was a immediate synergy with our investment servicing business, but I'll give you an example. We are #1 in our municipality segment. There are 40,000 municipalities and townships in the U.S. If you really had to -- the segment is huge, but so fragmented. If you had to go call on these people, these are [tiny views] you need hundreds of people. We have thousands of people. They understand our product set, and they bring the referrals to us. So quite an interesting story, and the ownership by U.S. Bank has been quite an important part of the growth story in these businesses.</p><p>Let me just describe a couple of case examples. So you know how organic growth is happening in this industry. On the left-hand side, we have a registered investment adviser. In 2010, they had just gotten started. A few of them split out from a large company. They had some clients that needed bank custody. They liked our service. When they started their own funds, they hired the fund services part and all new fund launches have come to us. They are $25 billion in assets today, very large RIA. And more recently, the Wealth Management partnership with them has been we provide all the banking and credit for their investment clients. Their fee revenue has also now qualified them for a credit relationship, and the revenue has grown about 13x in a short period of time. We can repeat the story on the right-hand side about a very large, very elite global asset manager. They're a credit manager. We acquired them. We had [tiny relation] with them through an acquisition. And they liked our service, started giving us more, grew rapidly. We just grew with them. Their fee profile made them eligible for corporate credit, and these guys are very grateful if you can give them corporate credit. So the relationship has deepened. Then they went to London, they took us with them, and we are growing globally with them, 23x the revenue. So that's kind of a simple way of you serve a client well kind of grow with them.</p><p>Our strategy on the investment servicing side, just to bring it home a little bit, the technology and digital capabilities, a real white space between us and our competitors, and we intend to keep it there. There is a lot of support from our technology and digital offices to try and keep up the platform, and Pivot is now expanding to every client that we are servicing from an Investment Services standpoint. Technology is also very important to drive cost and productivity. These are ops and tech businesses. And lots of distributed ledger technology, lot of natural language processing that we're introducing to just drive operating leverage. Our operating leverage in this business is very strong, very scalable businesses.</p><p>Global expansion, which we have a lot of opportunities on, has been a big focus over the last 3 years, and will drive our growth going forward. We have just enhanced our European depository products. There was a lot of press releases a few months back, completely revamped our global custody network, much better quality. And we are just setting up shop in Luxembourg. So lots of headroom there with M&amp;A and organic growth.</p><p>Finally, delivering one U.S. Bank. I gave some examples on the balance sheet synergies, the distribution synergies. We are also building out our securities lending and foreign exchange capabilities, which we have, but haven't been fully scaled and optimized yet.</p><p>So that's really our story. Let me just close it out. In summary, just to remind you of some key messages we'd like to have you take away. On the Wealth Management side, we're in an incredibly strong position on the high end of the wealth segment. The product set is complete, clients are very happy. The word-of-mouth referrals that were networked along with data analytics, it's just a really nice business. And a big growth opportunity is in the Affluent segment. We think the team concept is very successful, and we have made it work. So that's going to be the growth driver of this business going forward.</p><p>On Investment Services, we are at scale in a very capital-intensive business with barriers to entry. It's very efficient, high fee, high growth. We want to keep up the lead through products and technology, and growth will come from organic market share, global expansions, augmented by M&amp;A.</p><p>So thank you. We're very proud of this business. Thank you for letting me present this a little bit. And with that, let me pass it back to you.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Thanks, Gunjan. So I talked about business mix earlier. This is a great example of capital-efficient, scalable businesses that are fee-oriented, offer high returns and are a little unique to the banking. So great example of that in this business. Now we're going to go to a business -- Consumer and Business Banking that most banks have. But earlier, I talked about this concept of balance, about optimizing today to invest for tomorrow. And I think no business has seen more of that change and that optimization and balance for the future than the consumer bank. Tim has been leading us for 2 years, and he's going to tell you the story.</p><p>TIMOTHY A. WELSH, VICE CHAIRMAN OF CONSUMER BANKING SALES &amp; SUPPORT, U.S. BANCORP: Thanks very much, Andy. Very grateful for the opportunity to be with all of you this morning and to represent our 30,000 colleagues who work in Consumer and Business Banking.</p><p>Let me describe a little bit about Consumer and Business Banking just so you have some of the context here. We represent about half the loans and deposits across U.S. Bank, about 40% of the revenue. And if you look at the split, it's about little more than 80% traditional consumer businesses. Think mortgage, auto, checking accounts, et cetera. And then about a little less than 20% small business, business banking is what we call it. So that gives you a little bit of sense of the scale -- reach of the business. We've been fortunate to have steady increases in loans and deposits over the last couple of years, and we're going to talk more in detail about what is driving that, but you'll see several different factors. And I know this will come as a big surprise to you, but we're very focused on digital. You might have heard that a little bit. And what -- we passed a critical threshold here recently in the consumer bank, which is that we're now above 50% of our customers actively engaged digitally. What you see is also a huge increase in mobile that's really up there. Very, very significant growth in mobile. We're going to talk about the mobile app that Jeff and others have referenced, really being a pivotal part of that. Andy talked about the fact that 2/3 of our transactions are occurring digitally. And very importantly, we're seeing sales migrate to the digital channels. What you're seeing here is more than 1/3 of our loans actually being, in some manner, done digitally. And we're going to talk about why that's been happening because we've been making significant investments in that area. But this is a pivotal switch also, which is, it's not just about transactions occurring digitally, but also about the sales migrating in that direction, and we're certainly seeing that.</p><p>Given the scale of the business, we're quite substantial player in many parts of Consumer and Business Banking. You see some of the rankings here, #4 mortgage lender, #4 servicer, #5 in auto. The rankings are sort of interesting. But what's much more interesting, I think, is if you think about how these different businesses become ways to attract new customers to the bank because we -- sometimes we think about people coming to a bank first as from a checking account, and we certainly have our share of those. But what we're actually finding is that the real value in being in so many different consumer businesses, not just mortgage, auto, but also credit cards, which Shailesh will talk about, is that today half of our customers come to U.S. Bank for the first time through one of those lending products. And it's an enormous opportunity for us. So it's nice to have those good positions, but what it really reflects is an opportunity to attract hundreds of thousands of new customers every year to U.S. Bank and be given the privilege of trying to serve them.</p><p>So let's talk about some of the key strategies and initiatives that we have going on in Consumer and Business Banking. And I am going to bucket these into 2 categories. The first is, as you have heard, we are becoming digital, and we're going to talk about that in a lot of detail. But very importantly, we also believe that customers still want and value and benefit from human interactions with our bankers. And we're going to talk about exactly how the digital and human work together because we think that is a critical component of success and most importantly, it's a critical component of being incredibly helpful to our customers, which is what we're trying to do. All of that new interactions with digital and our people allows us to think about an entirely different physical distribution system. And we're going to talk a lot about that. Andy referenced the efficiencies that we're seeing in that front. It is absolutely efficiencies, but also as he highlighted effectiveness. We're able to do things for customers in our branches that we haven't been able to do before. We're going to touch on both of those elements.</p><p>So as we think about our customers, we've been talking about the fact that they are absolutely at the center of everything we do. And I want to tie this back to something that Kate started with. Kate said that we're here to power human potential. We invest our hearts and minds to do that. And Derek highlighted that, that's a reason he came to this bank. I want to then connect this -- the idea of centrality. We're becoming -- we're trying to become central to the lives of our customers. That's important. What that means is that we're really valuable to our customers that they depend on us, that they think of us, that they have an emotional connection to us in ways that are really meaningful. We're not just a mortgage that they pay or an auto loan bill. If all that -- if that's all we are, then we're not doing anything to power their potential. So this concept of centrality is very important, and the core underlying element of it is the idea of engagement. What we're trying to do with our customers is engage with them as frequently as we can. Derek talked about this with the large tech companies. He highlighted the fact that they focus on time spent with them. That's an idea that we're trying to replicate, but we're trying to do it in a very important way. We want to interact with our customers a lot, but we want to make sure that every time we do, we are helpful to them. If we are helpful to them and they interact with us a lot, it will help us build trust, which Kate and Andy highlighted, is so central to what we're doing. So that's really the core. Power human potential by engaging a lot, become central. We become really valuable to them, and naturally, it expands our relationship with them over time. So that's really at the core of what we're doing. And we want to talk about that with regard to specific segments of customers. So we're going to talk about it first with small -- with mortgages; and then talk about it for small business customers; and then third, digital overall.</p><p>So let's talk about mortgage. Why start here? If you think about most consumers, one of the biggest financial decisions that they will make in their life is buying a home. It's exciting. It's full of joy when they actually get in the home and it's also can be full of anxiety along the way because you want to make sure that you're actually able to live in that dream home that you've seen. So we want to make this process as simple and understandable for the customers as possible. And so about 2 years ago, we started investing in technology that would make it a whole lot easier to get a mortgage. And as you see, we've been steadily building that investment over time. A couple of highlights. Middle -- late last year, we were the first bank to introduce, what we call, instant decision. We're able to pull data from lots of different financial institutions. And for credit -- for certain credit-approved customers, we can give them a credit approval in minutes. What that means is you can literally be standing in the condo in Manhattan here that you have just found, you can type into your phone and apply right on your phone. And assuming you're qualified, you can get that decision while you're still in that living room. We then have used digital analytics and data to help our mortgage loan officers make sure that they get the best leads. So Gunjan talked about this. We now know when people are moving or prospect of moving. We can generate a lead to suggest a call that's helpful. We've now applied the same technology to our home equity process, and we've also done it to our mortgage servicing. We actually have millions of customers who's mortgages we serve. And you don't think about that as particularly digitally engaging opportunity, but in fact, not only have we made it easier to make a payment on your mortgage, we've actually made it easier for you to learn about your neighborhood and to see how other houses are selling in your neighborhood. That's incredibly valuable, and we're seeing our mortgage servicing customers get excited about that as well. So this is a really powerful opportunity for us to become central in something that is so important and this is going to be an area that we are investing on continuously. Because we believe if we were going to be central to someone's life that we need to be really, really helpful to them in getting a home.</p><p>I want you to then think about a small business owner. I love talking to small business owners. They're some of the most passionate, enthusiastic people you'll ever find. And you know what they're passionate about? They're passionate about their business. They are not passionate about funding their business, right? And so we thought, we should make that simple. And so we were the first bank in the country to introduce a loan of up to $200,000 -- $250,000 that you can apply for online or with the help of a banker, and we can give you a near-instant decision. A process that typically took days or weeks now takes hours or maybe a few days and often can be done in under an hour. It's unbelievably fast. We did this not just through cool technology and believe me, the technology is pretty cool. But we did it because we changed our process. You'll see here that we reduced the number of fields that we ask them to fill up by more than 70%, so that we can give them a loan a whole lot faster. We made it much, much simpler. But I want to highlight something because you all know that we have great risk management and credit guidelines. We didn't change any of that. Same risk criteria, same compliance standards, all we did was make the process a whole lot simpler. And that was just the beginning. We're now investing in our -- in loans up to $2.5 million, so we've significantly automated and simplified the process for loans, all the way up to $2.5 million. We introduced that in August. And when we go into Charlotte, we're going to do something that is really powerful, a terrific one U.S. Bank story, which is that we're going to be introducing in Charlotte what we call the triple play: checking, credit and importantly, merchant services because what we realized is our small business customers want all of those things brought together in a very simple manner.</p><p>What I would highlight about this is that this is another example of how customers respond digitally, but then also engage with people. And it's a great story, as an example, from Appleton, Wisconsin where a customer -- a prospect, excuse me, finds this tool online, applies for a loan, gets the loan, comes into our branch and says, \"Can I transfer all of my business accounts to you?\" Fortunately, we were able to say yes.</p><p>So that's the kind of human and digital interaction that is so powerful here. What I would highlight about these 2 stories, the mortgage and the small business, is not just that we're able to do great things for the customers, but we're also able to see real benefits for the bank. You saw on the mortgage slide, huge improvements. 25% reduction in cycle time. Material increases in market share. Costs, we're able to process 30% more mortgages with the same team. The same thing is happening in these small business loans. We're making huge increases in volumes with the same level of productivity. So what's important here is what is good for the mortgage customer, what is good for that business customer, also benefits the economics of the bank.</p><p>Now I also want to talk about the fact that we've been describing mobile banking, and both Derek and Jeff have talked about our new mobile app. And it's extraordinary how fast we've redesigned it, et cetera. But I want to underscore that this is not just a neat technology. There is an idea under here that I want to make sure you fully appreciate. What is different about this, what we've tried to make different is back to this idea of centrality, right? What we said in centrality is we want to engage with the customer a lot so that we can be helpful to them, and this app is designed to do that. So in very simple ways, what you see is, if you use our app and you have one of our credit cards, every time you use your credit card, it pops up and says you just spent $30 at this restaurant. Lets you know that it's a great fraud-protection tool. It, by the way, also creates very interesting dialogues between husbands and wives, which is not something that we're in control, but that's an example of the interactions. But what is also happening here is that we're able to provide personalized insights to people in ways that are genuinely helpful to them. So what you see is, in just the 4 months, the first 4 months that we launched the Apple version of this, we created 100 million personalized insights that we provided to our customers. And almost 90% of them, they said we're really helpful to them. So that's a different way of interacting. Every time you get on the app, you see something very often. It says, boy, look at your spending pattern. Did you realize that this -- your deposit just came in. All of those helpful kinds of things come to you on a regular basis in the app. And what we're seeing as a result of that is a significant increase in the amount of engagement. Already in the short time since we've introduced the app, we're seeing a 50% increase in the amount of interactions and engagements that customers have on our app. So this is a material shift not only in the technology, but in the underlying idea. And we believe that, that allows us to become more central, which allows deeper relationships, more trust, all of that.</p><p>Only other point I want to make about the app is that it, in fact, allows us to be truly one U.S. Bank. And you see on the right-hand side of this, you can do wealth, you can do business banking. All of these kinds of things are available to you through the app because: A, it makes it easier for consumers; but B, you think about small business as an example. Small businesses, they expect the same conveniences in their business life that they do in their personal life, and that's where we're going to be able to integrate these things as easily as possible.</p><p>So what I've touched on now is that we're trying to become central to the lives of our customers by digitizing so many different aspects. And when we do that, we also create new opportunities for human interaction, like I talked about in the business banking, but also ways that significantly improve our economics, and you saw those mortgage numbers, the small business numbers, et cetera. You're also seeing that with the app. What we're seeing just as an example of the efficiency measures is that we're seeing a material reduction in call volume in our call centers, right? Because people can do so many things themselves, just as Derek referenced, DIY, right? So significant cost reductions there. But perhaps the most material place we're seeing efficiencies and effectiveness changes are in our branches. And many of you have wondered how we're doing on our physical asset optimization process. We've talked about the fact very publicly that by the first quarter of 2021, we will have about 10% to 15% net reduction in the number of our branches, and I want you to know that we are well on the path to that. In this year alone, we've closed 140 branches. I'm going to come to the reinvestment side of this in just a second because I want to emphasize this is not just about closings. This is about finding growth opportunities in many new places. But it's also not just about the physical footprint, it's about what goes on in that branch that's also critically important. When you think about it, if you can do so many things in your life digitally, what do you need to do in a branch? Well, we're finding at least a couple of things that are really important to do in branches. The first is people often need help, often help with the technology. What we're discovering is, we put all these great features into our app. And you know what, many people discover them on -- those features on their own, but a lot of people don't. A lot of people really value having somebody to talk to about the different features. You think about a simple feature like mobile check deposit. I suspect many of you use that. Take a picture, deposit the check. But many customers actually don't know about that. And what we're finding is enormous success helping educate them about those kinds of features. And there are countless features that we can provide that education for. At the same time, what we're also seeing is that people say, Gosh, now that I have all this information about myself because my app aggregates things, all my different customer information, what goals do I have? Can I talk to somebody about goals? And how do I think about managing for the future? Those kinds of discussions we're also having in branches. So what I would highlight is that we're absolutely changing our physical footprint both to reduce costs and to increase growth, but we're also changing the nature of what happens there in the branch in order to be really helpful to our customers.</p><p>You're all also aware that we're exploring new markets, and let me tell you how we think about new markets. We've announced, of course, that we're going into Charlotte, but let me describe the underlying logic of why we're going into Charlotte. The first is, we're looking for markets where we already have a presence. Now many of you are aware that we have more than 800 of our colleagues who live and work in Charlotte already. They've invested millions of dollars and tens of thousands of hours of volunteering to help build a presence for us in Charlotte, but that's not all we have in Charlotte. Remember, I mentioned that many customers come to us to the bank from credit card, auto, mortgage. We already have through those product lines, tens of thousands of customers in Charlotte, and we've got a material portion of our assets and deposits and things like that, particularly loans in that area, okay? So it's one thing to say, oh, U.S. Bank's going to a new market. I'd like you to think maybe about a different way to contemplate that, which is U.S. Bank is bringing a branch to a place where we already have a great reputation, great employee base and a terrific set of customers. And that's what we're doing, just as Andy said, branch-light, digital-first going to serve customers we already have and hopefully, beginning to expand that over time. And we will pick other markets like that where we have a great presence already, where we've got a lot of customers and where we think we can bring the branch to them to serve a broader set of their needs and become more central to their lives.</p><p>And I'd also highlight some of the reinvestment opportunities. It's not just places like Charlotte. Charlotte making a lot of great headlines, and we're very excited about it. But as we look across our footprint, what we've highlighted here are all the places where we're going to be doing renovations or new branches because we see enormous growth potential in those places. What often happened, for example, is we'll have a great downtown set of locations in a city, but see opportunities in new suburbs where we haven't had a branch before to be able to grow in those areas. Or we perhaps have a branch in those areas and we get the opportunity to renovate it and make it look more contemporary and be more inviting for the kinds of new services that we're offering in that area.</p><p>So in summary, I'd highlight a couple of things. The first is, we really are trying to become central to the lives of our customers so that we can power their human potential. That's the core. And this concept of centrality is rooted in the notion of engagement, making it easy for them to interact with us, and importantly, that those engagements be helpful to them. We're also trying to do this in a way that is incredibly simple. You saw that in the mortgage process. You saw that in the small business loan. We're trying to make it incredibly simple for the customer so that they can do the things in their lives they want to, like run that business or go to Disney World or whatever it is that they're trying to do. We're also cognizant for us to be able to do this, we need to be able to operate at speed, and Derek and Jeff and others have highlighted this. Almost all of the innovations that we have talked about in the consumer bank in the last -- little bit here, almost all of those innovations have been done in the last 18 months, building on, just as Andy said, the terrific example of innovation we had in our payments business. And so what we see is an enormous amount of speed that we are able to achieve, and we expect that speed to accelerate as we go forward. And the reason for that is very simple, our customers' expectations are rising all the time. They expect more and more out of us. And so while we're incredibly excited about all the innovations that we've been able to develop so far, we know this is just the beginning. And we're going to continue to work at that level of pace and intensity to keep up with those rising expectations because we are absolutely determined to be central to their lives so that we can really help them power their potential, lives the lives that they want to live.</p><p>Thank you very much for the opportunity to describe what's happening with Consumer and Business Banking.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Thanks, Tim. So centrality, simplicity, optimization and reinvestment. A lot of change going on in the consumer bank, and I think we have a clear strategy for what we're trying to achieve.</p><p>Next up is Corporate and Commercial Banking. And I will tell you, this is a business that over the last 10 years has gone through a lot of change. So the change in Corporate and Commercial happened in many cases, and they're going to really benefit from what they've created and the structure they have from a one U.S. Bank standpoint, but the next set of changes you're going to hear about is the real-time payments component that's going to change the way companies do business and the way we're going to help them achieve those goals. So you're going to hear from Jim Kelligrew and Leslie Godridge, who lead this business. Both of them have been in here in excess of 10 years and they have a great story to tell us. Start with Jim.</p><p>JAMES B. KELLIGREW, VICE CHAIRMAN OF CORPORATE &amp; COMMERCIAL BANKING, U.S. BANCORP: Thank you, Andy. So let's go through a quick snapshot of the Corporate and Commercial Bank, just our financials. So first 3 primary customer segments: Commercial Banking, we define it as clients with revenues of $25 million to $500 million. It's what I think all of us think about as middle market clients. We have a big corporate banking business, obviously. It's $500 million revenues and above. We define it also -- that also includes any government entities. And third primary one would be commercial real estate, which is targeted more on the upper middle market and above, and both public and institutional clients.</p><p>We have 2 big product areas: fixed income cap markets and treasury management, which I'll get to a little bit more in a second. But also just note, 18% of the bank's revenues and roughly 1/3 of the deposits and 1/3 of the loans. So treasury management and fixed income and capital markets about the same number of revenues. Fixed income and capital markets is very client-driven and origination-focused. There is no proprietary trading. We don't have an equity capital markets business. And so that obviously gives us a very kind of -- versus our peers, much more predictable consistent revenue stream.</p><p>Looking quickly at our loan portfolio, it's very diversified and high credit quality. The largest component part is large corporate, which is predominantly investment-grade. In addition to the 3 primary customer segments that I mentioned, the other piece there is called specialized finance, which is basically 2 big parts: an asset-based lending business and an equipment leasing business.</p><p>When you look at our loan growth, there are 3 underlying factors that I would say for the 1% CAGR over the last -- 2016 to 2018. One is we saw really good solid C&amp;I loan growth and activity. We also saw in 2018, as all of you know because of tax reform, a significant amount of loan payoffs, corporations with lots of cash in their balance sheet. And then third, we just kept a very consistent and disciplined approach to our commercial real estate loan underwriting.</p><p>On the deposit side, the story there is really that 1% from 2016 to 2018. If you strip out one large financial customer who's been migrating from the bank due to an acquisition, an event, our growth is more about 4%.</p><p>So looking at our competitive advantages. I've been in banking for 32 years and I've been at U.S. Bank for 10 years. And I have to tell you that U.S. Bank has an awesome underlying platform to build and grow a corporate and commercial bank. It's a big reason of why we've been successful in the past and have been growing market share. It will be -- continue to be a very big reason why we're going to be successful in the future.</p><p>More specifically, our highest debt ratings really truly differentiate us versus our competitors, particularly for certain product areas and more specifically in our markets-based businesses. So think about being a counterparty on an interest rate swap being the highest-rated foreign currency transaction, et cetera. So we are the counterparty of choice because of our highest debt ratings.</p><p>Our best-in-class risk discipline and I would add to that our strong ethical culture really resonates well with our client base with U.S. as a really safe and dependable long-term relationship.</p><p>Our strong, significant and unique presences in Shailesh's payments business and in Gunjan's Corporate Trust business gives us a competitive advantage where we can offer more holistic solutions to our clients across products that really differentiates us versus our competition. And as Derek powerfully articulated earlier, our culture of innovation underpins numerous B2B opportunities to be value-add and focus on the digital piece.</p><p>Looking quickly at our strategy and key initiatives, expanding reach. That's all about going into new markets, and we'll talk more about that in a second as well as new product offerings or enhancing our existing product offerings. Second is deepening relationships. Think about that as we continue to deepen relationships, we want to become a lead bank, which really has a multiplier effect across our product areas, especially in capital markets. And third, which Leslie is going to hit on in a little while, is the digitization of business payments.</p><p>So looking at expanding our reach, I wanted to look back at time for just a second and go back 10, 12 years ago. The last economic downturn, which was not fun for all of us in banking. U.S. Bank, as far as the commercial -- Corporate and Commercial piece, we had a regional presence, so look at the shaded area with the red stars. We were kind of a good, solid regional bank in the CCB space. We had limited and basic loan products. We lent money, did deposits, letters of credit, et cetera.</p><p>Our competition in the meantime during that same period, as I think we all know, was significantly pulling back or pulling out of markets and products. It was not a fun time. We took advantage of that, and the first step was hiring Leslie in our New York office to build our large corporate business. That was about 10, 11 years ago. I joined about a year later, joined in Charlotte to build out all the capital markets businesses.</p><p>So now fast forward and we'll talk more about that in a second. We have a -- we'd had a fully national presence, a lot different than 10, 12 years ago. But more specifically and more recently, over the last 18 to 24 months, we've been expanding our middle market presence in key states and having really great success, so Texas, Florida, North Carolina, which Tim mentioned, and New York. And those have been actually from a low base, actually 0 from a couple of years ago, our fastest areas for loan and deposit growth. So that's really, really exciting.</p><p>We've also established a mid-corporate initiative. So what we found was, we were doing really well in the middle market and really well on the large corporate and the space between under Leslie's leadership, which is $500 million to $3 billion, where we now have initiative and we're really making some great strides there as well. And you can see there just on the right part of the map, the green stars, again, that just kind of fills in with the national presence.</p><p>And then more specifically, talking on the right side, just about product areas, right? So we developed a new asset-backed warehouse lending business that just kicked off earlier this year. It's been very successful so far, but the point I wanted to make there it's complementary to what we're already doing. It's very complementary to our investment-grade corporate bond business. It's extremely complementary with Gunjan's Corporate Trust business. And if you may remember, it's #1 in the structured trust area, which is -- a lot that is asset-backed. And so we have a lot of good reciprocal back and forth there where they're helping us win business and we're helping them win business. And then we're investing heavily because it's a huge product for us, and we're very successful at it modernizing our Treasury Management platform. And Leslie, again, will get more into the targeted money movement solutions, which obviously we've been talking a lot about today.</p><p>So when we say deepening relationships and uptiering credit, that's what we're really talking about becoming a lead relationship. The top relationship or top 3 to 5 relationships, and I'll talk more about that in a second. But how do we get there? Our best-in-class debt ratings and our consistency I talked about, our competitive advantages has helped us win roles as competitors pull back or maybe they're not pulling back, but they have headline risk. Obviously, they've been -- the market's strong right now, but there have been banks that have headline risk and sometimes clients get nervous and they come to us. And we've been really successful in our industry verticals, which Leslie developed over the last, again, 5 to 10 years, where we've uptiered credit relationships, become a lead bank, which has a really nice impact on the rest of our businesses. And so proof in the pudding, look at the right there. So last Investor Day, 3 years ago to today, our number of lead loan relationships has been growing at a 10% annual rate and that's huge because lead loan relationships is the primary driver to building a deep relationship and doing other products within the corporate and commercial bank with our clients.</p><p>So in that regard, a great example. If you look on the upper-right box, is our investment-grade corporate bond business. Now to step back just to remind you, 10 years ago, the business didn't exist. It's when I joined in 2009, okay? 3 years ago, at Investor Day, we showed stats that we had moved up on the lead and co-managed basis, so that's just being an underwriter in a corporate bond deal, okay, to #6 with 33% share. That's 33% of every deal. There's 100 deals, we [won] 33 of them. Fast-forward to today, we're #5 with 42%, 42% of every transaction. So that's what I think of as the footprint, the breadth. We're in the big leagues now, which is great. But the needle mover as far as our PPI or our revenues is the bottom right. That's where we become a lead. And being a lead lending relationship helped that. So 3 years ago, we were 11th and 13% market share by number of deals. That is now 3 years later, #9; in the top 10, 20.4% with plenty of room for growth. And if you question that, look to the left, this is internal data but just showing our fixed income and capital markets businesses across all our clients within Corporate and Commercial Banking roughly whether that we lent money to them or not, it's roughly 5%, 6% to fixed income and capital markets with us. Those that are the lending relationships, it doubles. And obviously, as we lead relationships, it gets even greater. So there is plenty, plenty of opportunity. And I would honestly say, being in banking for 32 years, we're barely scratching the surface. We have lots of runway.</p><p>And with that, I'm going to hand the mic over to Leslie Godridge. She's going to go in a little more detail and some examples of deepening relationships as well as our money movement strategy.</p><p>LESLIE J. V. GODRIDGE, VICE CHAIRMAN OF CORPORATE &amp; COMMERCIAL BANKING, U.S. BANCORP: Thank you. Thank you. Leveraging the strength of one U.S. Bank. You just heard from Jim about how we've uptiered with credit, expanded our capital markets, done a lot of things, used the credit as an entry into many relationships. What you see on the screen right now is the full set of products across the U.S. Bank platform. Presently, we have a full set of point solutions. But what we're working on right now is integrating those solutions to provide our customers with a seamless experience, just like you heard they want in their retail life, they wanted in their corporate life. So I'm going to show you 2 examples where we've done this. On the left is an auto manufacturer. On the right is an iconic consumer beverage company. As we expanded our product suite, you can see on the screen how we've definitely enhanced the relationship. But you also should notice the revenue growth. We doubled with the auto manufacturer, and with the consumer beverage company, we went from less than $1 million 4 years ago to $8.5 million over the past 4 years. Now why does this matter? It matters because there is such a rapid shift from paper to digital, and we have an opportunity to grow and deepen our relationship there. The market for B2B payments is $23 trillion, and 60% of the business is still done via paper, but that's changing rapidly. You heard Derek talk about the digitization of money movement. As paper-based payments shift to digital, it's going to change how all of our companies do business over the next 5 to 10 years, and nowhere will that have more effect than in the Corporate and Commercial Banking space.</p><p>As B2B payments shift from paper to digital, we can support and add value to our customers. We know our clients' priorities. It's to simplify operations, it's to optimize cash flow, and that's why -- and that's exactly why we're investing and focusing on those areas. Real-time payment solutions, APIs, data analytics, this will eliminate paper. It will make it easier to connect to the bank and it will enable data-driven decisions. All this adds up to simpler and more productive ways for our companies to do business.</p><p>So in summary, we feel good in Corporate and Commercial Bank where we are. We've spent the past 10 years creating products, expanding our geographies. We're going to continue to leverage that investment. And now we have a huge opportunity as we are uniquely positioned with a good percentage of our customers already with Treasury Management and payments, and we're going to expand into this business-to-business payment market and get our fair share.</p><p>So with that, I will turn it back to Andy.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Thanks, Leslie. So Leslie talked about the tremendous impact that payments is having in the business environment and we've had a big Payments business for 2 decades. In fact, it's one of the reasons that a lot of you are -- have a high interest in U.S. Bank as our Payments business. I would maintain that there is no point, like, right now, that this has become more important to banking because of the integration of banking services and payments and money movements. So we're very fortunate to have this great business and we have this great opportunity of integrating the capabilities across the rest of the bank and Shailesh is going to talk about that. Shailesh?</p><p>SHAILESH M. KOTWAL, VICE CHAIRMAN OF PAYMENT SERVICES, U.S. BANCORP: Thanks, Andy. So we have a really distinguished payments business. You've heard about it all day today. And it's really, really important in the world we are in, where increasingly payments activity driven by the frequency and importance of its activity, is becoming the cornerstone of all relationships. You certainly know that on the consumer side, but it is also true now increasingly, both in the small and large corporate side, also in the government space.</p><p>I'll share with you a little bit more detail about our business, but 3 things really put us at an advantage: one is, we have one of the broadest product sets in the marketplace as far as payments activity is concerned; and the second is, we have a seamless integrated proprietary set of platforms that allow us to present this activity in a very meaningful way to our clients in the way they are beginning to expect in the marketplace; and thirdly, you'll find that we have one of the most diversified, distinguished set of distribution assets that we can deploy against this opportunity that is in front of us.</p><p>Let's get into the details here. Payments represent about 29% of U.S. Bank's revenue stream. But more importantly, we contribute about 40% -- just over 40% of our fee-based businesses, and Andy talked about this morning about the importance of fee-based activity, and how, in many times, it is countercyclical relative to some of the other businesses that we have under the umbrella of U.S. Bank.</p><p>These are also highly efficient businesses and high returning businesses. So let's look at each of these businesses in a little more detail.</p><p>The first one -- the 3 businesses that make up our payments business is our issuing business, makes up about 65% of our revenues within payments. The next one is our merchant acquiring business, makes up about 25% of our business. And the last piece is our corporate payments business, which operates in the very attractive B2B space that generates just under 10%.</p><p>And you will see down in the second half of this page is we've been growing this business at fairly attractive rates. The merchant business, as you're well aware, was impacted by some of the joint venture exits that we went through over the last couple of years. But you will also know that through this year, first half of 2019, that business has returned solidly to mid-single digits as we had committed.</p><p>Andy mentioned that we are the fifth-largest bank. You're familiar with our size and scale, but you will see here that we are top 5 performers across all of the payments activities that we participate in. We certainly are #5, #4 in our issuing and merchant acquiring businesses, but we also are a leading provider in the increasingly important commercial payments business. We are #2 in that space and #1 in some of the activities. We are the largest provider of payment services to the U.S. government, and we are the #1 provider of financial services to other smaller institutions. I'll get into that a little more detail.</p><p>So you will see that we are operating at scale, not only on the consumer side of the house but increasingly important on the B2B side of payments activity. The largest of our payments businesses, the retail payments business, this is our classic issuing business. We issue cards across all 3 major networks: Visa, Mastercard as well as American Express, but we also are a national player in this business. Thanks to the footprint that we have, but also the partnerships that we have, we have customers across all 50 states.</p><p>One of the unique advantages of this business and perhaps the best-kept secret is our operating platform. It's truly unique, it's proprietary and it allows us to service, not only some of the larger clients like Fidelity but through that same platform, we can offer distinguished turnkey solutions to some of the smallest credit unions in this country.</p><p>We do business with over 1,400 financial institutions, and collectively, they provide us distribution through more than 15,000 branches in this country. It's unprecedented reach.</p><p>Our Elan branded program also allows us -- think this technology platform, just an analogy here, think of it as one big house. That's our proprietary platform. But it has individual rooms that are these individual relationships that we have with all these financial institutions. And each room has its own entry point and exit point. So they get this turnkey solution that is fully customizable to them on an almost ad hoc basis, most of them on a self-service basis.</p><p>We also have a fairly focused co-brand strategy that provides us access to great names like Fidelity and REI, but there is no concentration risk in this portfolio. We have substantial partnerships here. You see there are 13 major partnerships, but through these partnerships, we have added distribution capability of another 18,000 distribution points, again, adding to that distribution reach that I talked about earlier on.</p><p>The next one is on merchant acquiring business, roughly 1/4 of the revenue, but this is one of our most international businesses within U.S. Bank. We, obviously, have a large footprint here in North America, but about 1/3 of this business is based in Europe and growing quite nicely. Again, in this space, we have a proprietary platform, single platform that can help customers operate over 100 different currencies and that platform is available in over 25 different markets. Provides us unique opportunities in places like Europe, where increasingly merchants are looking for Pan-European solutions. And one of the most entrenched providers in Europe can't provide that service that we can, and we've been doing that for a number of years.</p><p>Even more important, in this new era where merchants are buying merchant services through software solutions, this new concept of integrated software vendors, and for those of you that are not familiar, with ISVs or integrated software vendors, think of it as if you're a small business owner and you're buying an inventory management system, payment processing is fully integrated inside of that inventory management system. And so we provide services that integrate our services into these software packages that are then bought and sold via these software solutions that are very popular and we have doubled down on this ISVs. I'm delighted to let you know that our software vendor partnerships, just over last year, is up 40%.</p><p>The next one you're familiar with, which is our focus in this space around vertical base solutions because many of these verticals have their own needs, distinct needs that require the need to leverage the underlying data and we've been at it for a long time.</p><p>We have a commanding position in the airline space. We provide our services to over 100 different airlines globally. But we're also a leading provider, both in the hospitality as well as in the healthcare space. In the hospitality space, we service one of the -- some of the best-known hotel chains in the world, and we are the leading provider in the increasingly important healthcare space here in North America.</p><p>What we are also doing is making sure increasingly for these merchants providing payment services is not enough. They're also looking for integrated banking solutions and that plays right into our advantage, having one of the best banking capabilities, along with some of the richest merchant offerings and our ability to provide a more integrated solution to this customer base.</p><p>And the third piece of business that we have in here is our corporate payments business. We've been in this business for over 30 years. It positions us really well in this accounts payable automation push that is underway. We have a great set of product capabilities. Our virtual pay capabilities is outpacing the B2B payments market growth. That positions us well in the market that Leslie just talked about. The $23 trillion of money movement that is moving from essentially paper-based to a more digitized data-driven activity, and I'll touch more upon that later.</p><p>We serve over 200 of Fortune 500 companies in this space. And that's, again, largely because of the relationship we have through our Corporate and Commercial bank. That gives us a seat at the table and increasingly these customers are looking for more holistic solutions. We operate 2 of the largest proprietary end-to-end networks in this space. We provide freight payment solutions. Just last year, we issued payments to over 5,500 carriers in this country. But we also operate a propriety closed-loop fuel servicing business and that's through our Voyager network. Voyager is accepted in this country over 320,000 locations. The point here is not only reach but in this world where payments is becoming more important, the ability and knowledge to operate closed-loop network is increasingly important. We operate 2 of those in-house and have been doing so for a very long period of time.</p><p>This drive to virtual pay is fueling growth and our ability to capture the position that we have working closely with our Corporate and Commercial bank positions us really well to make sure we capture the flows in this transition that is taking place.</p><p>Let me spend a minute about something Andy talked about at the start of the day here today. In this era of change and digitization that we've been talking about all day, there is a changing customer expectation. It's yet clearly driven by simplicity and ease of use that Derek talked about earlier on. But in the payments space, what is also important is control and security over that payment stream that is so vitally important for these businesses. Andy talked about the moat around loans and deposits that arguably are getting stronger because of AML- and BSA-type regulations. One might argue that the moat around simple payment activity is narrowing or maybe even evaporating. And that plays right into our advantage because payments by itself is less meaningful to customers. They are looking for much more broader solutions. And given the breadth of relationship that we have and the breadth of products that we have, we are best-placed to leverage the data which we've been doing for well over a decade to be able to provide these customers with more holistic solutions.</p><p>Let me give you a little more depth around this. Take the traditional buying and selling process, and the top chart describes how payments used to get conducted. And for 60% of the cases, that still occurs today. You want to buy something, you go to a separate program in Europe to create a purchase order. You go someplace else to get your invoice. You go to a third place to make the payment. Somebody else goes to another place to go get that payment, reconcile it to the back end and on and on it goes. These were all individually provided bought and sold.</p><p>What we are trying to do is bring it all together in one place so the underlying data can travel much more effortlessly throughout these processes. So now think about the fact that if you're making a payroll, you want to make sure that, that integrates into your cash flow management environment. If you're buying inventory, you want to make sure that it ties back into your inventory management system. You are no longer just concerned about making and receiving that payment. That's a given. How well those can integrate into your back end activities is what is going to determine who becomes successful at this and we've been at it for quite some time. We're going to double down on it.</p><p>So that leads to our strategy, what are we looking to do over the next few years. You've heard about digitization, leveraging data. I'll talk a little bit more about how we are looking to expand that reach that we have. And last but not least, it's continuing to leverage these unique platforms that we have that allow us better integration at lower cost and efficiency for our benefit, but also importantly, for the benefit of our customers.</p><p>Yes. Digitization, Derek talked a lot about our ability to get seamless services to our customers. But what is more important is not that these services are available, but how well are those utilized. Let me give you a couple of examples.</p><p>We double down on digital acquisition for our card business. 3 years ago, I talked about the fact that we're going to do that. Our digital contribution for account origination in the credit card space is up 60% over this period of time. We launched simple services driven by geolocation-type technology that has become available more recently. Our consumer customers have adopted that over 50% of the time. So it's not the availability of this service, it's how well is it integrated into the technology that customers are expecting to use.</p><p>An example on the merchant side, where we are leveraging capabilities like virtual pay to allow customers that operate in the travel and tourism industry to make payments through digitized processes. This is a highly paper-intensive industry. When you book travel online, the back end payment settlement between the travel agency and the hotel or the airline that you bought the ticket on is largely paper-based. That's over a $200 billion TAM for us to operate in. We are digitizing that, not only through our own capabilities but also partnering with some of the leading players like Amadeus in this space.</p><p>Yes. We are continuing to expand our distribution and our product capability. Just a few examples, you know we've acquired some very attractive portfolios over the last 3 years like Fidelity. But what you might not be aware is we've done over 60 such small transactions through our Elan brand, acquiring over $3 billion of assets over that period of time. And we've just added over 6 different companies that add capabilities in the merchant and the very important B2B space.</p><p>The Expense Wizard, at the bottom of the page here, is an interesting piece of technology. It's actually available for your review outside. It's really cool. It targets, what I call, the infrequent traveler. Think about the individual that's coming for an interview in one of your offices. They don't have your corporate card. How do they issue payments? Highly paper-based, very troublesome and the back end process of claiming that expense is, at best, friction-filled. This product completely transforms and eliminates that process, but also provides the entity, in my example, you, the hiring manager, complete control over how they traveled, where they stay, where they eat. And all of that is fully automized and completely in sync with your internal corporate policies.</p><p>So it's not just the ability to make the payment and take out the friction from the process. It is making that process a lot more efficient and a lot less friction-filled.</p><p>This is an important page for us. The left-hand side describes how largely banking and payments used to get conducted, even as recently as a few years back. Banking products have their own silos and they bought and sold through customers through those silos and payments product had their own silos. And merchant acquiring was largely who got first to that merchant with that point-of-sale device. That is no longer true. Increasingly, we sit across the business manager, the owner, the CFO or the treasurer, and they're demanding the left-hand side and the right-hand side come together more holistically, not only from a pricing standpoint, but there is a much more deeper need. They want to make sure that these processes are integrated back into their back end, allows them to manage their own cash flow a lot better, allows us to have better conversations with them about financing their needs and protecting their supply chains.</p><p>This is a fundamental shift that is occurring. Andy touched upon some of the M&amp;A activity in the payment space. It is all coming together because everybody is recognizing that payments is better placed when it is better integrated through other activities that we provide to our customers, whether it is the consumer, or certainly true, in the ever more important B2B space.</p><p>So in summary, let me leave you with these thoughts. We operate at scale across both consumer and B2B franchises. We have a fantastic set of distribution capabilities that we are augmenting. We're doubling down on our platform to provide omni-commerce solutions to our customers, we've terrific in-house platforms that we can leverage that provide efficiency for us and for our customers. But most importantly, because we are part of this unique institution, we can provide our customers with integrated payments and banking solutions.</p><p>And with that, thank you.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Thank you, Shailesh.</p><p>So you heard from all 4 of our businesses. You've heard the concept of digital integration, optimization, change, looking and transforming for the new expectations to the customer base. We're going to break for lunch now. We'll reconvene at 12:30 Eastern time. I would encourage you to experience some of those digital capabilities live and in-person right outside. We have a number of individuals anxious to show you what we're able to do. We'll reconvene at 12:30, we'll talk about risk, and then Terry will wrap it up with finance.</p><p>So thanks a lot. Enjoy lunch.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Okay. Good afternoon. I hope you enjoyed lunch, and we will get started again with the individuals on the webcast as well as those in the audience. So we talked about the overall strategy, we talked a little bit about technology, digital innovation, our brand and our culture, we gave a business line update, and we are going to ramp up the afternoon talking about some of those core disciplines I mentioned earlier starting with our risk management discipline. You've known U.S. Bank for a number of years as being one of the strongest credit risk managers in the industry and that continues. And we're going to talk about that today, but we're also going to talk about some of the other emerging risks that we face as an industry as a bank overall, and applying some of those same strengths to those risks as we think about the way we manage risk management in the company. With us this morning -- this afternoon, excuse me, are Jodi Richard, who has been Chief Risk Officer for just under a year and with the bank for 5 years; and Mark Runkel, who has been Chief Risk -- Chief Credit Risk Officer for over 6 years. I'll hand it over to Jodi.</p><p>JODI L. RICHARD, VICE CHAIRMAN &amp; CHIEF RISK OFFICER, U.S. BANCORP: Thank you, Andy. Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to be here today to talk to you about our risk management strategy as well as our risk management processes. Processes that are time-tested and a core competency of U.S. Bank. When I became CRO last October, I was fortunate enough to inherit a strong risk program. You heard this morning from Andy, we have invested a lot in our compliance and risk programs over the last 3 to 4 years. We've done that in our people as well as our technology. So one of my roles stepping into this was to say, how do we take what we've built and how do we optimize that for the future. So that's a lot of the strategy that you'll hear me speak about today. But before I go there, I do want to reinforce that the building blocks in governance that underpin our risk discipline will not and have not changed.</p><p>When we talk about our strategy, really what I'm talking about is enabling that strong or ensuring that strong risk discipline and control environment to enable business and revenue growth and we're always evolving our thinking. So when I look into the areas I want to focus on, I want to focus on ensuring that we have sustainable programs in place. So I'm not going to take the eye off the ball on what we've built, we'll maintain those and mature those into the future. We also want to look and stay ahead of emerging risk and incorporate those into our programs and manage those for the future. A lot of our emerging risk tied to our strategy, and we need to sit side-by-side with the business and the technology groups to manage those risks as they are being implemented.</p><p>And the last 3 items that you see on the left side of the slide are all around optimization. How do we simplify our processes? How do we use and leverage data in a better way to optimize, if you will, our risk management capabilities and then how do we remain agile to support the business growth? And on the right-hand side of the slide, you'll see our core principles for risk appetite, and I wanted to stress that the business line strategies that you heard earlier today are aligned with our risk appetite and sets a strong foundation for our governance. We have invested, as I've said before, in building up our risk programs over the last several years. We did that around our AML/BSA and our compliance programs, but we've also built our other programs, and in that building process, we've learned a lot and those lessons learned, if you will, are what we call keys to success, and I just highlight a few of them here. The need to ensure we have top talent in specialized areas. We need to have consistent processes toned throughout the organization that is consistent, good reporting, and escalation. We need to make continued investments in new technologies and automation and we need to promote more of the value, if you will, of relationships with regulators, with industry participants, experts as well as law enforcement. I mentioned these elements are present across all of our risk programs, our structure is sound and sustainable, and we have mature risk routines in place. That said, we're always looking around corners and staying ahead of emerging risk. We're investing in people, data analytics and technology to mitigate those risks. Our key and emerging risk a lot of what we've already talked about today, Andy mentioned some this morning, reputation, customer privacy, tariffs that are going on, but a lot of these risks are operational as well as some of the risks that you see on these slides actually directly tied to our strategy, digital interactions, competitive environment, real-time payments, emerging technology. What this means is, we understand our strategy, but we also understand the risk that, that strategy employs, and the risk organizations sits with the business, sits with technology to enable, if you will, that business growth in a prudent and safe way.</p><p>I want to take a moment and highlight a few of our key risks, one being cybersecurity. Jeff mentioned earlier today the investment in our cyber defenses and controls. The risk organization sit side-by-side with the technology and security group to ensure that we also, from a risk management perspective, are testing those controls as well as understanding our risk exposure. So we've done several things, we've built an executive cyber dashboard that has key metrics in order to escalate items of our program in a quick manner. We conduct independent assessments using a series of industry experts to test our controls, identify potential gaps as well as help us identify potential vulnerabilities and stay ahead of the evolving industry best practice, and we are constantly refining our playbooks, our scenario planning as well as learning from others. We have our Board here today and I'm sure they would tell you that cybersecurity is a key board focus and we dedicate time at every meeting to this topic. One of the largest changes over the past few years is the changing risk landscape and money movement. And you have seen this from -- you heard from Leslie and Shailesh, this is a core in our business strategy. So this is an area that Jeff also talked about that we've invested in technologies and people to enhance our fraud detection capabilities. We have fraud behavior analytics that we have on the front end. We have also enhanced our real-time transaction processing, we've moved from a batch environment to a real-time environment. We also are ensuring our operational processes are resilient and meet real-time needs on that 24 hours a day. And as I mentioned, while we focus a lot of our technology enhancements here, they also are supported by the risk organization.</p><p>Let's talk a minute about optimization. We've been talking about this all day and nowhere are we doing it more than in the risk organization, but I want to start first with how we're supporting business growth. We're aligned with the business in the agile studios. Derek talked about how risk is embedded in those studios providing real-time feedback in an effort to support business growth. I want to pause a minute and reinforce to you that agile does not mean fragile. We are not cutting corners in risk management, we are applying our same underwriting standards, our same compliance policies, but we're sitting with the business side-by-side giving them real-time feedback and this has been extremely successful for us.</p><p>If I move over to the other side, this is how we're acting within, if you will, risk management how we're innovating, simplifying and optimizing. We have our own risk studio where we have a dedicated team that helps the entire risk organization across credit, operational, compliance, BSA/AML, to look for those opportunities that might be pain points that we feel we can be more efficient and effective. We also look at our org structure and look to see where maybe we could consolidate to avoid duplication and overlap and to better streamline. We did that earlier this year in our second line of defense, testing teams, combining those to bring consistency, reduce staff, and drive for the future.</p><p>I would say where we have the most opportunity for optimization is leveraging our data and analytics. We are advancing our risk processes here, and I took a moment and you'll see I've highlighted some real numbers on the slide for account originations and transaction monitoring. These are investments in new tools and models that have proven effective in annual loss avoidance in the space that crosses both the credit and fraud spectrum. We're also using what we've built, you heard Jeff talk about the system and the platform that have transactional data in it that was built for AML KYC. We are using this and advancing our AI and machine learning to detect suspicious behavior in our AML monitoring program. We've doubled the accuracy in this, improving our efficiencies. And finally, we're using data and automation in a smarter way that has allowed us to be more efficient, but most importantly, effective in our quality assurance testing.</p><p>I'd like to transition over to Mark to talk about credit risk.</p><p>MARK G. RUNKEL, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER, U.S. BANCORP: Great. Thank you, Jodi, and good afternoon. We have a strong risk management and credit culture at the company and that strong credit culture is critical for us to be able to support and grow throughout the economic cycle. The second piece is that it enables us to be the most trusted choice for all of our key constituents including our customers. And finally, it produces consistent results. Our culture is really built on 5 pillars and I'll start with that we're a relationship-based lender; second, we're a cash flow lender, so we look at the collateral in our underwriting analysis really as a secondary source of repayment; third, we stay very consistent in our underwriting throughout the economic cycle, so we're not making major adjustments to our underwriting over time; fourth, we're proactive in our portfolio risk management approach in terms of active portfolio management; and finally, we have great portfolio diversification. We think of our diversification from a product type, asset class. We think of it from a geography, property type. All of those key characteristics help us deliver consistent results, and you'll see here during the last economic downturn we had the least amount of volatility compared to any of our peer group and is one that we know is true and tested and is why we're not going to be making any changes to our culture as we move forward. It's at this point in the credit cycle we are beginning to see others in the industry starting to go down market. You're not going to see that show up in any of their credit performance statistics today because it's too early, but what you want to stay focused in on is the origination quality and you'll see we continue to be very disciplined in our originations. On the consumer side, we continue to be a prime-based lender and you can see that based on the quality of the credit scores and all of our consumer originated portfolios. We do not offer any subprime programs and we've stayed out of that business.</p><p>On the commercial side, we continue to be investment grade quality or equivalent. We do have what I would say is a much smaller leveraged loan portfolio compared to our peer banks. It's less than 2% of the commitments of the overall company and the only place we participate in leveraged loans is really to support existing customers who are doing strategic acquisitions, where their senior debt may be greater than 3x and total debt is over 4x. So it's a relatively small portion of the portfolio, but areas that we will support existing customers.</p><p>In our commercial estate business, that's another area that we have been very disciplined and consistent because we've been in the business for a long time and we've been through many cycles. That approach served us extremely well coming out of the last economic downturn where you did see us taking market share and really growing that portfolio. At this point in the credit cycle, we're seeing others becoming more aggressive in offering structures that we're not comfortable with, and so we're not going to change our lending standards, and that's why you've seen us lag in terms of a from a growth perspective over the last couple of years, but we're comfortable with that.</p><p>We talk about proactive portfolio risk management, that's both looking internally within the portfolio as well as externally. When I look internally to our portfolio, I think of the delinquencies, risk rating, nonaccruals, all of those are very strong across all of our portfolios, stronger than we were at going into the last economic downturn, and we're also monitoring the external environment. Now look at the unemployment market and what's going on in the labor market in particular. I look at unemployment claims, and I look at the rates. And you can see on the chart on the far left that those remain at very, very low levels. Housing continues to be strong and the BBB bond spread is probably the only place we have seen any kind of, what I would say, movement in any of the key external metrics that we're monitoring just due to the flattening of the yield curve. So as I look at the portfolio internally as well as externally, I have great confidence that in the near term that we think credit quality will remain relatively stable going forward.</p><p>Finally on our through the cycle expected loss, when I was here 3 years ago in 2016 I shared this slide with you as well. Our expected losses through the cycle, we said, was going to be between 95 basis points and 100 basis points. We've continued to grow the portfolio the last 3 years in a very prudent approach and diversified across all of our assets and in businesses, and that through the cycle has not changed and remains at 95 to 100 basis points.</p><p>JODI L. RICHARD: So in summary, I want to end where I started that risk management processes are time-tested and a core competency of U.S. Bank and through our strong and proven risk discipline with our deliberate focus on the changing environment, we are proactively managing emerging risk, supporting business and revenue growth, and are setup for long-term success. Thank you.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Thanks, Jodi. Thanks, Mark. So we talked a lot about strategies, initiatives, key areas of focus, strengths and areas of investment. And I know for this audience, what you really want to know is, how does this all translate into financial implications and numbers? Terry Dolan has been with the company 20 years. He and I have worked together for a long time. He has been in the CFO role for 3. And I think there's no one better to bring it home in terms of the financial implications of all this than Terry. Terry?</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN, VICE CHAIRMAN &amp; CFO, U.S. BANCORP: Thanks, Andy. So good afternoon, everybody, and thank you very much for being here on Investor Day. It is really important for us to be able to share our story with you and to help you understand some of the great things that are really happening here at U.S. Bank. And I think you have seen during the day, Andy started by really giving a nice strategic overview in terms of the -- what's happening in the organization, but also some of the changes that are happening in the environment out there, some of the challenges that exist within the banking industry, but more importantly, some of the opportunities that exist for a company that is willing to take -- to invest in the business and to take that opportunity. And you heard from Kate about our culture within the organization, and some of the things we have been doing from a brand perspective. You heard from Derek and Jeff about above the glass and below the glass, and that above the glass is really focused around all the great things that we are focused on with respect to our customers and the experiences we are trying to drive, the interactions we are trying to create. And Jeff focused below the glass in terms of how we're going to be able to deliver that from a technology standpoint, the micro services, the APIs, the tech stack, our cloud strategy and all those things that are going to be able to drive efficiencies as we think about the business going forward. And then you had an opportunity to see how some of those broad strategies tie into the things that the lines of businesses are doing. And I hope one of the themes that you saw is that many of those things are interconnected, payments helping to drive small business loan growth in the future, et cetera.</p><p>So what I want to do is maybe provide kind of a capstone for the day with respect to how that translates from a financial management perspective for our organization. What I want to do is to talk a little bit about the last 3 years and the performance during that time frame. Andy talked about the fact that we feel like we are well positioned, in a position of strength. That will be my second segment. And then I'm going to talk about long-term strategic objectives for the organization over the next 3 years.</p><p>So let me talk about first of all, bottom line, net income and earnings per share. And 3 years ago, we said that our goal or our expectation with respect to net income was to grow at 6% to 8%, and for earnings per share to be able to grow somewhere between 8% and 10%. If you end up looking out how we ended up performing, we actually ended up getting there, but we ended up getting there in a lot of different way than maybe what we had expected, and probably not on a core basis the way that we had hoped to see. So our revenue was a little bit lower and I'll show you that here in a minute. Our expenses were a little bit higher in the sense that we weren't able to bring that efficiency ratio down as much as what we would like, but we also made up with that by great credit quality and our ability to have lower credit losses than what we were anticipating, and then we got benefit with respect to the tax reform act in late 2017.</p><p>If we think about the balance sheet from a loan perspective, we grew the loans in line with the rest of our peer group. Mark talked about the composition of our portfolio between 2017 and 2019. That composition really hasn't changed. Maybe Commercial Real Estate had come down a little bit. When you think about that overall growth during that particular time frame though, I want you to think about at least 3 things, maybe 4 things. One is we sold our student loan portfolio during that particular point in time, we sold off our FDIC covered loan, insured loans during that time frame. We made some very conscious decisions with respect to our commercial real estate and the construction aspect associated with that particular portfolio to downsize that thinking about the risk associated with that type of a portfolio and how it performs in a recessionary environment. So those are 3 things that we consciously made some decisions on. And then with tax reform, loan growth in 2018 was very challenging and that certainly was one of the factors in terms of why revenue growth, in terms of net interest income was a little lower. If you think about deposits, deposits, we over that 3-year time frame grew a little bit faster than our peer group at 10.4%. The composition again is roughly 50% retail, 50% institutional, made up of the wholesale deposits within Leslie and Jim's world as well as our Corporate Trust business, which is a significant deposit gatherer for us. So about 50-50 in terms of how we think about the mix. The mix between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits shifted a little bit, but that's something that we certainly anticipated, and expected 3 years ago because we were expecting a rise in rate environment. Jim mentioned the fact that during -- couple of years ago, we had a client that was acquired by a financial institution, and a lot of their deposits migrated to their parent. If you end up backing that out, our deposits actually grew at about 13%. So relative to our peer group, we actually performed fundamentally very well with respect to deposit gathering during this particular time frame.</p><p>Let's talk about revenue growth. So net interest income grew at about 5%. We had set a target of 6% to 8% 3 years ago. One of the primary drivers associated with that is we got some additional tailwind relating to the rise in rate environment, which is what we were expecting, although the yield curve flattened on us a little bit. And the other thing is that in 2018 because of excess cash, tax repatriation, corporates going through the restructuring of their balance sheets, we saw a little bit better capital markets activities, but we saw loan pay downs, et cetera occurring in that particular time frame and you see in -- or you saw in 2018 loan growth was a little lower. Fee income, quite frankly was a little bit disappointing for us. We had expected and guided that our fee growth during this time frame would be somewhere between 5% and 7%. Ultimately it was about 3%, 2.9%. Couple of different things that were driving that, mortgage banking revenue was actually a drag during that 3-year time frame, some years as much as 18% to 20%. And our merchant acquiring business, as Shailesh talked a little bit about, we made some decisions with respect to divesting joint ventures. And we also made some decisions to exit certain businesses or relationships that were high-volume, but very low margin, possibly even breakeven. So there are some things that we ended up influencing. The positive, if you think about it, is that we have now hit an inflection point with respect to our mortgage banking business starting to grow in the second, and we expect stronger growth as we think about the third and fourth quarter and into 2020, and our merchant acquiring business has been accelerating over the last several quarters and we continue to expect that to continue to accelerate as we think about the future. So we had some headwinds, which we believe are now -- have hit some inflection points.</p><p>From an efficiency standpoint, we ended up in 2018, in early 2019, in that high 54%. So we didn't really make the progress that we expected, we certainly expected in 2016 that our efficiency ratio would start to migrate down and probably be in that 53 sort of percentage point range at this particular point in time. One of the biggest drivers, and we've talked about it is that in 2015, '16, '17 and even a little bit in 2018, our risk and compliance costs were elevated. Some of those years growing in excess of 25%. And so what was a headwind for us during that particular time frame from an efficiency perspective and from a cost perspective has moderated and that should be an opportunity for us. Also during this entire time frame, we were continuing to invest in the business, and we also stepped up our investment, and I'll talk a little bit about that in a moment, but clearly, we added 5 to 10 pounds and we really didn't expect to do that during this time frame.</p><p>Let's talk about returns. U.S. Bank has continued to be an industry-leading organization with respect to returns, and our profitability is driven by a lot of different factors. It's driven by our mix of our business, the fact that we have a lot of businesses that are capital efficient. We have disciplined capital deployment, et cetera. In every one of the categories that we end up measuring though, U.S. Bank's returns are at the top of the industry. If you think about sustainability, over the course the last 3 years really over the course of the last 10 years, U.S. Bank has demonstrated because of our lower credit risk profile, our diversified mix of businesses that we are able to sustain our earnings power during difficult times, and we are able to reduce the amount of capital depletion for credit losses during times of stress. And those things translate into our ability to sustain a dividend over a period of time. And if you look at dividends over the last 3 years, our dividends have grown by 11.8% on a compounded growth perspective. And 2 years ago, we increased the dividend by more than 23%; this last year, 13.5% as part of the CCAR cycle. So our dividend growth has been very nice during that time frame.</p><p>I'd like to talk about why we feel like we're in a position of strength and we're well positioned as we think about the future, and I'll talk about a number of different things that Andy gave a overview before. The first is that we have a diversified business mix and now we talk about 4 different businesses and you heard from all those businesses here today, but underneath that is really 50 different business that all act a little bit different in different points in the business cycle, and that enables us to be able to have lower volatility with respect to our earnings throughout various types of business cycles, particularly in terms of fee-based revenue. We have a couple of businesses that differentiate us. We have our payments business, and I'll tell you that among our peer group there are peers that would die to have our merchant acquiring our payments business because they know and understand the importance of payments is going to play in the future of banking in the next several years and we've talked about that throughout the day. Gunjan talked about our Corporate Trust business. Our Corporate Trust business is capital efficient, it's a huge deposit gatherer, particularly in times of stress. It is fee-based, it's relationship-based, and it is a business that generates high returns. All these businesses help to contribute to our fee and net interest income balance within our company.</p><p>More importantly, we feel like we're in preferred businesses and the businesses that we really like. It's the right businesses for U.S. Bank. Importantly, our payments revenues are overweighted relative to our peer group and our trading and equity M&amp;A sort of activities is under weighted. So those are businesses that typically have more volatility where you have to rub 2 sticks together every quarter in order to make your numbers, and as you go through stress our -- significant requirements with respect to capital. And so those tend to be more challenging as you think about resolution trust -- resolution plans and planning through a stressful cycle, and we do not have that particular business. Now we do have a capital markets business, it's in the fixed income side of the equation. It's very much tied to our wholesale and our corporate and commercial banking business and what it does is it ends up, as Jim talked about, really leveraging that credit relationship that we have with our customers and it actually acts as a way of reducing volatility because often times when the yield curve flattens, the fixed income capital market picks up, even though you may see payoffs occurring on the lending side of the equation. So it actually helps to reduce volatility in our situation because of the type of businesses that we are in.</p><p>Our credit ratings. Our credit ratings are among the highest not only in the United States, but in the globe. And that has some significant competitive advantages from a financial standpoint. It's a lower cost of funding for the organization, it provides us with a pricing advantage. So you think about it from a loan growth perspective, our ability to be able to price more effectively in terms of being able to grow the balance sheet, and it tends to be a flight to quality. So U.S. Bank tends to be a flight to quality during stress and as a result, enables us to be able to gather deposits at such point in time when you want it, and it reflects that trust that we've talked about and consumer confidence.</p><p>Asset sensitivity and liquidity. We believe again that these are competitive opportunities for us as we think about the next 3 years. Let me talk about the liquidity first. If you think about our risk profile, we have liquidity coming out of our ears. We have more than enough liquidity, and in fact, we believe that, that is an opportunity for us as we think about the tailoring rules change that will enable us, we believe, to redeploy, optimize or think about our investment portfolio in the tune of $10 billion to $20 billion. And that gives us a lot of different options, which I believe is going to be very beneficial in this sort of a rate environment.</p><p>With respect to interest rate sensitivity, we are relatively neutral in terms of our asset sensitivity compared to our peers. And while we give up a little bit when rates are rising, we end up performing relatively better in a declining rate environment, and I believe that based upon where the Fed is today and what 2020 looks like, that will be a competitive advantage for us. We tend to be balanced, about 50% short term, 50% long term. The durations of assets and liabilities are pretty well matched and of course, the interest rate environment is going to be an industry wide challenge for the near term.</p><p>Let me come back to cost structure. When you think about cost structure within U.S. Bank, relative to the industry we are pretty fit and lean, but we know as I said that we put on a few pounds. Andy is a cyclist and in fact, when he comes to New York he oftentimes goes to the Peloton Studio and so I want you to have this thought process in your mind. Everybody on the management team when they come to work, they get on the bicycle and they work hard. They push hard in order to be able to drive cost efficiencies, to be able to think about above the glass and what we are going to do with respect to driving and improving our customer experience, which is going to translate into revenue growth. Jeff talked about the efficiencies within our technology stack and moving to the cloud. All of those things are in play. When we think about the next 3 years, we have the opportunities to be able to optimize more of our business and do things like rationalizing our risk management programs to make them not only more efficient, but more effective in the future. All those different sort of opportunities exist. We are fit and lean relative to our peer group because of the fact that we have single processing platforms, we fully integrate acquisitions when they occur. We have businesses of scale, and they run efficiently. They are capital efficient as well. And there is a lot of opportunities as we think about the future.</p><p>So now I would like to talk a little bit about the long term strategic expectations. And maybe to frame that out a little bit, what I would like to do is start by talking about some of the competitive challenges during the last 3 years that now are starting to become opportunities. I talked a little bit about our asset sensitivity. That lower asset sensitivity in the future results in stronger relative performance in terms of net interest margin as rates decline. The elevated risk and compliance costs that were driving up our efficiency ratio in the past have moderated. And so we have an opportunity to be able to either reinvest those dollars in other parts of the business in order to be able to digitize and get the efficiencies in terms of DIY that Derek ended up talking about, or gain other efficiencies within our organization.</p><p>Andy talked about that -- the fact that AML/BSA and the consent order was a bit restricting with respect to our branch optimization. That has been lifted at the end of 2018. And Tim and his team have been working on physical asset optimization and moving forward with respect to reducing our branches, on a net basis, somewhere between 10% and 15%. We believe that we have the opportunity to be able to increase that as we move forward, especially as many of the digital initiatives that we talked about take shape.</p><p>Our credit risk profile is sometimes moderate growth in a rising rate environment and a robust economy. We're prepared for a recession in the event that it takes place, and we will perform well in a recession. In the last 3 years, there has been significant capital distributions that have occurred within the industry. Now we've started at a lower capital levels because of our risk profile, but that run associated with capital distributions, higher capital distributions is pretty much coming to the end.</p><p>But U.S. Bank is in a position with the tailoring rules to be able to take advantage of that and to be able to manage our capital a little lower in the future, and I'll talk about that here in a minute. So when we were putting together the next 3 years from a financial perspective, I just kind of want to share a couple of key considerations. Like the Fed, we don't see a recession occurring, but if it does, we're ready for it. Business is relatively robust. Consumer confidence is strong, unemployment is relatively low. So when we end up looking at the economy, we feel pretty good about it. The thing, obviously, that is creating a lot of uncertainty in the markets is really related to geopolitical issues, trade or tariff wars and things like that, that are happening.</p><p>There -- from a global perspective, global rates are very low. And when you end up thinking about the economic growth in Europe and in China starting to slow. We have a lot of global investors that are coming to the United States, buying treasuries because on a relative basis, they can find yield. And so that is causing -- those 2 things are causing short-term rates in the Fed that will reposition itself to move downward, and we think they are likely to move down to a target of 1% to 1.50%, we've assumed 1.50%. But the long end of the curve is also going to be relatively flat, we believe, at least through much of 2020. Credit quality will be stable.</p><p>I'd like to talk about, from a financial perspective, 4 things that we're very focused on. The first is portfolio management of our businesses.</p><p>Now one of the things that we have done over the course of the last couple of years is really take a really hard look at all of our businesses to think about their market attractiveness, their growth characteristics. Are they principally cash-based businesses? Are they paper-based businesses? Are they businesses that we ought to be thinking about divesting or exiting? And in fact, a year ago last year, we sold our Elan ATM processing business. We got out of Retail Lockbox. We're exiting that particular business. We sold our student lending. We sold our FDIC covered loan portfolio. All those things really for the purpose of taking the capital that you would have to dedicate to those activities and reinvesting it in digital activities, agile studios, and all the different things that you ended up hearing about. The second thing from a financial perspective is physical asset optimization. And most importantly, we believe that there is an opportunity to be able to accelerate that, to be able to increase the repositioning of our branches in the future. And when I talk about that, I think about it both in terms of the reduction, in terms of branch closures, but also the reinvestment that Tim talked about in new branches in high-growth areas, remodeling branches in high-growth areas so that we are creating a better experience for our customers and creating revenue-growth opportunities as well as optimization of the branch. And of course, what we will be doing is taking into consideration the pace of the digital adoption and the digital -- digitization, digital transformation that is occurring in the bank in order to be able to make that decision as to how and when to do that.</p><p>The third area is really around cost structures, cost optimization and focusing how we end up thinking about that. We talked about the agile studios. And a great part about the agile studios is we have the customers right there helping us to design the experience and to help think about it from the perspective of how that will help revenues to grow in the future. But it's also about simple, better, faster. Many of those studios are focused on the business process on how we make things below the glass more efficient, better speed-to-market, et cetera, that is really around that pillar of simplification. We have cloud computing, technology stack. We have organizational design, all these things that we're looking at. Management spans and layers, and we've pulled the trigger on some of that, and we have other ideas. Tim in taking over the Consumer and Business Banking has restructured his management team in order to be more centered around the markets and more central to our customers within those markets and as a result being able to get efficiencies in his business as well. So we are looking at every one of those things when we're on our bicycle every day. All of that is really to help us focus around how do we take that to reinvest for the future growth of the company. And there's a lot of different initiatives on here that are identified that we talked about during the day. But what I'd like to leave with you with respect to this aspect is we've stepped up the amount of investment. It's more than doubled in terms of capital expenditure over the course of the last 4 or 5 years. Where it used to be focused around defense, now the majority of it is really focused around offense. And we spend about $2.5 billion on technology each and every year. And as Andy said, we do believe that we have the scale, the simple business model that would enable that to be more than sufficient as we think about the future.</p><p>So one of the things that I know I have gotten lots of questions on as I sat through different investor conferences is really around CECL. And it's been interesting because all the questions on CECL have been around the day 1 impact. And so let me kind of go through that. Day 1 impact for U.S. Bank is going to be somewhere between 25% and 35% of the existing reserve. Our existing reserve at the end of the second quarter was about $4.5 billion. And so we anticipate that when we adopt CECL on January 1 of 2020, that the impact is going to be somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion increase. Now the amount of that increase is influenced by whatever the macroeconomic factors are at that particular point in time. But at this particular point in time, again, when we think about whether or not there is a recession on the horizon, we really don't see that.</p><p>The other thing it's influenced in terms of the size is really around the characteristics of your portfolio. To the extent that you're more higher weighted with respect to credit cards, your assets are longer dated in terms of having a higher mix of mortgage or installment loans, you'll tend to have a higher percentage of reserve build on that day of adoption. And in our situation, that's going to be the case. That represents, today, an allowance of about 1.5% going to an allowance that's about 1.9% to 2%. The thing that hasn't been asked by anybody is, what is the day 2 impact with respect to CECL? And how is that going to affect organizations in the future? Now that's going to have industry-wide sort of implications. But I think one way just to kind of simply think about it is that this is an expected loss over the life of the loan, which means that the provisioning that you have to do will be higher than what you have had to do in the past. And if we are growing loans in order to keep our reserve at 2%, assuming that credit stays stable, you're going to have to provide for that growth at roughly 2%, which is going to be higher than what it's been in the past. And so I want -- I think that's an important question for everybody to kind of keep in mind. I think there's 2 other things that I would just say and that is that there's going to be -- under this methodology, there's going to be greater volatility that's going to occur under stress and the comparability from one firm to the next is going to be difficult. And the reason for that is, our economic outlook for the next 2 to 3 years is most likely going to be different than firm A's outlook and firm B's outlook. And so I think one of the things we'll end up grappling with within the industry is how do we look at that comparability across the various firms. I'd like to also spend a moment on capital management. When you think about capital management -- when we think about capital management, we have certain objectives. We want to be well capitalized. We want to maintain that high credit rating that we enjoy, and we want to be sustainable throughout the business cycle. We have a capital target of 8.5%. Currently, we're running at about 9.5%. And we believe that after the adoption of CECL and the tailoring rules, that's going to be about 9.6%. What that represents is opportunity from a buyback perspective because our expectation is that we will start to manage that 9.5%, 9.6% down somewhere between 8.5% and 9% in the future. And so that is an opportunity for our organization as we think about the next 3 years relative maybe to our peers.</p><p>So let's talk about long-term growth expectations over the next 3 years. From a revenue perspective, in 2016, we had identified 6% to 8%. We brought that down a percentage point, 5% to 7%. Now that is going to be probably a little bit more -- over that 3-year time frame, maybe a little bit more weighted on the balance sheet side than on the fee-based side because of things like integrating merchant acquiring into our small business lending and being able to do POS sort of lending capabilities in the future. We think that there is opportunity for growth in that area. Expenses we're guiding to 2% to 4% in the future. Net income at 5% to 7%, which is revised down by a percentage point. And earnings per share to -- at 7% to 10%, the lower end being revised down a little bit. Again, this assumes the adoption of CECL, a relatively stable credit environment. And the other thing that I would say is that this isn't what 2020 is going to look like. If you end up thinking about the rate environment that we're in right now, that's going to create revenue pressure across the entire industry. And so this is how we think about '21 to '22 kind of in that sort of time frame.</p><p>Long-term profitability expectations. Andy talked about this earlier. Essentially, unchanged although we've increased the return on equity target from 13.5% to 16.5% range up to 14.5% to 17.5% range in the future. And again, this assumes the adoption of CECL in the first quarter.</p><p>From a capital management policy perspective, we're also making changes relative to 2016. And our capital distributions have been in the high 70s over the course of last several years based upon the growth characteristics of risk-weighted assets. I want to kind of point you to the right-hand side of the screen though. One of the things that -- when we think about our capital distribution policy, we really want to be overweighting a little bit more on the dividend side than we have in the past. So we've increased our target payout for dividends from 30% to 40% up to 35% to 45%. And we've decreased the reinvestment and acquisition target from 20% to 40%, down to 15% to 35%. What that implies is over the course of next 3 years as we see balance sheet growth of kind of in that 5% range if we're distributing out at that 75% to 80% level. Now again, as we think about our capital level being at 9.6% after CECL, we have the opportunity to be above this range for some period of time.</p><p>Then I want to leave you with this thought. Andy started by saying, the company -- we manage the company forever. And it's important for us to be able to balance both our short-term objectives with our long-term objectives.</p><p>Our business mix and the characteristics of our organization generate consistent, predictable and repeatable earnings. Our low-risk profile enables us to be able to manage through a stressful rate environment -- a stressful environment and the ability to sustain that dividend over a period of time. We have a long track record of being able to generate best-in-class returns, and those returns result in best-in-class growth of our book value per share. And it's those factors that we believe supports the valuation that we have within the industry, and it's something we've earned and something that we're going to protect over time.</p><p>So now I'd like to just shift gears from the long-term expectations to just give a little bit of update in terms of third quarter guidance for 2019.</p><p>Generally, we are reiterating our guidance for the third quarter. However, net interest income will grow but will grow modestly. When we think about our loan growth, our linked quarter loan growth for the third quarter, it's going to be very similar to the second quarter. At the -- on our last earnings call, we had guided that net interest margin was likely to grow from -- or decline, excuse me, 8 to 9 basis points from the second quarter. We actually think because of the rate environment and the volatility that's existed, coming down roughly 25 basis points across the curve. That net interest margin is probably going to decline somewhere between 10 and 11 basis points. And I'll remind you that 4 basis points of that decline is related to having to balloon the balance sheet after the European regulatory agency's changed some policies related to transitioning deposits between -- outside of the European Union. And that's a onetime idiosyncratic thing that will impact the third quarter, but won't really carry over into the fourth quarter. So you just have to keep that in mind.</p><p>From a noninterest income perspective, we continue to guide that noninterest income is going to grow in the mid-single digits, although mortgage banking revenue is likely to be a little stronger than what we had expected and our capital markets business is going to be stronger than what we expected. Keep in mind that both those businesses are commission-based type of businesses, and so salary compensation related to that revenue is likely to go up a little bit.</p><p>From a positive operating leverage perspective, and Andy talked about this earlier, we've been guiding to a range of 1% to 1.5% on a full year basis, and because of the interest rate environment, it's likely that we are going to be slightly or somewhat below that range on a full year basis and on a core basis. From a tax rate perspective, we expect the tax rate to be at 20% on a taxable equivalent basis and credit quality continues to be stable. So thank you very much.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Great. Thanks, Terry. So we're going to bring all the presenters up on the stage to answer any questions you may have to close it out. And while we gather the chairs, I want you to take a look at this commercial. Kate talked about being there for the moments that matter, Tim talked about centrality. I think this ad represents both of those concepts very well. Why don't you guys come on up?</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: I think that's a terrific ad. I'm going to take it off your [inning] otherwise they're going to be focused only on that. All right. What can we answer for you? And we have -- because we are webcast, we have some microphones that will be brought to your tables so we can ask the question over the web. Why don't we start with Mike right upfront? Mike Mayo?</p><p>MICHAEL LAWRENCE MAYO, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Andy, we talked a little bit about this. Look, over 10 years, best-in-class performance; over 3 years, best-in-class performance. Today, best-in-class debt spreads. But we've seen other companies going back, Sears, Kodak, Xerox. Within the banking industry, we had legacy Wachovia, legacy JPMorgan, great debt spreads but they didn't evolve. And so what can you do to prevent complacency at your firm? Maybe we can just go down the line. You talked about like the positives. What's the biggest risk to you and each one of you not achieving your objectives?</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Yes. Mike, I'm going to try not to go down the line because we'll probably take too much time, but let me give you the essence of the question because we talk a lot about this. And in fact, we were just with our senior managers. We do this once a year with the top 200 managers of the company, and I actually use that example is that one of my objectives is to not be Sears, Roebuck, right, because we are performing very well. And you're absolutely right, and we've performed well for a long time. But I believe strongly as does this team that we need to pivot in these areas that we've talked about to continue that strength. So we're not going to lose what got us here. But we have to recognize that we have to change. And I will tell you that this team's all on board. The senior managers at that Denver offsite are on board, and we recognize that.</p><p>And part of it is the proof is in the pudding in terms of what we've been accomplishing. So not only do we have the belief that we need to change, we are changing in every single way in the way we're delivering, the way we're operating, the way we're performing, and the way we're developing, but thanks for the question.</p><p>MICHAEL LAWRENCE MAYO: And one more topic. When you say pivot, what does that mean? Do you...</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: What I mean by pivot is that keeping those strengths around financial risk discipline, the business mix that we have but being more agile in our approach, more innovative and more digital in terms of everything we're doing. Thank you. Right there.</p><p>JOHN G. PANCARI, SENIOR MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: John Pancari, Evercore ISI. Just a quick question on -- for Terry on the revenue guidance, the 5% to 7%. That still seems a bit aggressive when you look at where you've been running at in the 3% to 4%, maybe in the previous years, granted different operating environment, but could you just talk about why you believe that 5% to 7% is achievable?</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: Yes. So if you think about it and I talked a little bit about this in my presentation. We think that from a net interest income perspective, that was a little bit subdued because of some of the loan growth issues and some of the portfolios that I ended up talking about. The real question is what happens with respect to fee income? And how does that end up accelerating? And again, some of the biggest drags over the course of last 3 years has been significant drag related to the mortgage banking revenue and then some of the drag related to merchant acquiring. And both of those businesses have really shifted. They are starting now to accelerate. And I think it's from a couple of different reasons. And some of it is just kind of the macroeconomic environment being a little bit different. But if you heard today from a mortgage banking perspective, we've made some significant investments to shift away from third-party correspondents sort of mortgage banking into retail-based mortgage banking. The digital app has made a huge difference in terms of being able to capture those applications to -- and be able to kind of get it to closure. And so even though the macroeconomic environment right now supports growth, we actually expect it before that the mortgage banking revenue to start to accelerate and become not a drag but an opportunity as we thought about the future. If you think about the merchant acquiring space, I think there is a couple of different dynamics. And Shailesh talked about the fact that tying that into our banking products and services. That's an important part of our strategy. You think about Square and other organizations have done some of that. The opportunity from a revenue growth and a balance sheet growth perspective is significant. The other thing is that we've been making some significant investments in our payments space. If you think -- and he talked about 5 or 6 acquisitions that we've done over the course of the last couple of years, some product capabilities in terms of integrated software solutions and all sorts of things. And that revenue is now starting to accelerate. We're seeing sales growth in the 7%, 8%, 9% within that space. And so we feel pretty confident that, that part, which is a big part of our revenue from a fee perspective is going to be positive.</p><p>JOHN G. PANCARI: Just one quick follow-up. Are you able to break up that 5% to 7% by spread income versus fees?</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: Yes. We ended up talking about that. Here is what I would say is that I think it's probably a little bit more overweighted to spread and a little bit underweighted relative to fees if you're going to come up with that. And again, the thinking behind that is because we have some fee-based businesses that we can tie into small business and consumer lending activities, et cetera. And again, the example that I gave is the merchant acquiring, we think that, that helps to drive loan growth in the future.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Is that Betsy?</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: I think it's Betsy. Yes.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: The light's in my eyes, Betsy. Sorry.</p><p>BETSY LYNN GRASECK, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Betsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley. Couple of questions regarding the tailoring rule. So I think I'll start with Terry first. You mentioned the $10 billion to $20 billion of liquidity improvement or utilization that you talked about. Could you just give us a sense as to what the dynamic is between that flex point of $10 billion to $20 billion? What's going to drive the $10 billion improvement? What's going to drive the $20 billion improvement?</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: Yes. It -- they're still trying to decide whether or not we would be subject kind of the modified LCR or just kind of bringing the LCR requirement down from 100% to 85%. So that really kind of helps determine the extent of it.</p><p>BETSY LYNN GRASECK: And over what time frame do you think you'd be able to utilize that?</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: Yes. I mean we're hoping and we believe that the tailoring rules what -- we know what the Fed has said is that they want to be able to adopt those rules by the end of the year. So it is a part of the next CCAR cycle. That means that it's most likely to be effective sometime in the first quarter so from a timing standpoint. And then I think we need to make some decisions as to what do we end up doing. Do we end up selling securities and paying down debt? Do we -- what do we end up doing? We haven't quite decided. But in any of those situations, I think the opportunity for net interest margin expansion exists because of it.</p><p>BETSY LYNN GRASECK: And then, Andy, could you just give us a sense as to strategically, how you think your positioning changes once tailoring rule goes into place?</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: So I don't think it changes our investment philosophy and the areas of focus that we talked about. I think that tailoring rule will impact us principally financially in 2 areas: number one is the securities portfolio and the amount of liquidity we have in the balance sheet; and number two is the capital component and our ability to manage closer to our target capital levels. In terms of our strategies, in terms of the investments we're making, I don't think there's a lot of impact. Thanks, Betsy.</p><p>ERIKA NAJARIAN, MD AND HEAD OF US BANKS EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Erika Najarian, Bank of America. This question is for Derek. When we're back here 3 years from now, what would be the top 3 accomplishments that you think you could tell us about?</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE: Thank you for the question. First off that we're a DIY organization where our customers not just in the retail bank but across all of our businesses, the 4 humans can DIY across the bank. Two is that we can visibly demonstrate the power of data in helping those humans make decisions and that three that we've built trust with them to where they can trust us to help make decisions on their behalf to create essentially the self-driving bank account.</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: And four, we're all wearing jeans. So he's converted...</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: I'm taking my tie off right now but...</p><p>ERIKA NAJARIAN: The second question is a little bit more boring. So in terms of CECL and how we should think about earnings volatility for banks in the next downturn, clearly, I think most of the room accepts that U.S. Bancorp has a more resilient credit profile. But in theory, given that you are already going to 2% on Jan 1, does that mean that the incremental impact to your earnings is simply due to the increase in charge-offs rather than reserve building as well? Or is the math on CECL in a recession just way more volatile than we're thinking it's going to be?</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: The math is way more volatile than you're thinking it's going to be. It won't be able to just look at changes in charge-offs. And the reason for it is that -- think about it, one of the things we end up doing and what the industry is still kind of working through is this idea of having a forward-looking view with respect to what's going to happen in the economy, which is really hard to do. And so what you end up doing is, you end up probability weighting the likelihood of a recession versus a recovery, et cetera. When you're moving into a recession, you know it's going to be, let's say, moderate or a hard recession. That probability weighting is going to go way up with respect to a recessionary sort of outlook, and that has a multiplying effect with respect to the volatility of the provision that you're going to have to take in that quarter, in that year, whatever might be the case. And again, this is an industry-wide issue that's going to end up existing that is going to create that volatility.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: And to your point, Terry made earlier, not only does it create volatility in the company, it creates comparability challenges across companies because each company is making their own economic assumption. So we could be projecting a downturn. Bank A could be projecting stability or actually improvement. And we're going to have very different results.</p><p>I want to go right here in the front row, table 12.</p><p>SAUL MARTINEZ, MD &amp; ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Saul Martinez from UBS. A follow-up on credit. How much conservatism are you building into your -- through the cycle losses because the 95 to 100 isn't much higher than what most banks, at least, are saying they think they're through the cycle losses are? And I know there's some mix element to it, but is materially higher even within the businesses or within the lending segments. And how much of that is actually filtering into your CECL calculations because, obviously, your annual loss rates are a very important input into that? And there is an argument to be made, and I know there's a lot of safeguards in terms of what you can do with CECL, but there's also a lot of flexibility within the frameworks. And there is an incentive to reserve as much as -- it can be argued that there's an incentive to reserve as much as possible within the contract of CECL to withstand and have some cushion if things are worse than expected.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Mark, you want to address that?</p><p>MARK G. RUNKEL: Yes. No, I could go ahead and answer that one. Through the cycle expected loss, I would say there's not -- we don't build extra conservatism into that process. It's how the portfolios have performed, our underwriting strategies and what our expectations are. As it relates to CECL, what I would say is we use a completely set of different models that we use to be able to look at the portfolios that we use to drive those results. So they're kind of separate processes. But one does not have more conservatism than the other.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: And one of the reasons for the differences versus other banks, Mark, is our mix of credit card versus the overall -- it's a prime portfolio. It's a wonderful portfolio, but the charge-offs are at a high 3% to 4%. And that mix, being higher than most other banks in our peer group, causes us to be a little higher through the cycle.</p><p>SAUL MARTINEZ: What's your reasonable and supportable for CECL?</p><p>MARK G. RUNKEL: We typically disclose the reasonable. It's typically a 3-year time horizon.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Right there and then we'll go back there, okay?</p><p>CHRISTOPH M. KOTOWSKI, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO. INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer. Moving from the accounting to the economic reality. If we could just take a hypothetical -- unemployment is currently around 4%. Let's say, it goes to 6%. So that's a 50% increase. What would you expect the actual loan losses to do? Would they increase 50%? Would they increase more than 50%? And if you could give any color on that relative to your expectations on consumer versus commercial [lore]. And again, assume the slowdown is kind of uniform across the economy, just as a simplifying assumption.</p><p>MARK G. RUNKEL: Yes. With that assumption, what I would say is we run many scenarios. One, we run is what is more of a moderate recession, which would be under the CCAR adverse scenario, which unemployment actually goes up to about 7%. We see GDP declining about 4%. Under that scenario, we see our loss rates moving from maybe around that 50 basis points, whereas today up to -- closer to 150 to 175 basis points. What I'd say is, when we model it, it's probably on the lower end of that range but within that range.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: And Chris, you brought up a good point. Everything we're talking about is an accounting change, not an economic change. So it's not going to change the way we think about underwriting or the portfolio mix or what we have. Because when it comes down, when it gets better, it's going to be a lot better from a volatile standpoint. So it's going to be more volatility back and forth, but the economics don't change at all. And we judge and underwrite on economics. Matt?</p><p>MATTHEW D. O'CONNOR, MD IN EQUITY RESEARCH, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank. A couple of bigger picture questions. First, on M&amp;A. You talked about evaluating a potential bank deal by whether it makes you a better company looking 3 to 4 years out. Maybe you can elaborate on how you would define what makes USB a better company.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Yes. And Matt, thanks for that question because I had a couple of questions at break. I want to clarify something. What I said is we will look less at that [Time 0] impact. I did not mean to imply that we're going to do something hugely dilutive. In fact, it was just the opposite. What I meant to say is we could do -- given our PE ratio, we could do a lot of accretive deals, right? That's not the best way to look at it. Just because we can do accretion at Time 0 , we will be a better company 3 years from now. And my focus is on that 3 years from now. And specific to your question is, are we going to be better positioned with better capabilities and scale that's materially different than we are today and against the progress we're making today? So what that tells you is we wouldn't do some small transaction that's going to take our eye off the ball and the progress we're making. It'd have to be material. They have to have the capabilities and/or the product set or the scale in a material way.</p><p>MARK G. RUNKEL: And financially beneficial.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: And financially beneficial. Always financially beneficial.</p><p>MATTHEW D. O'CONNOR: Following up on the M&amp;A, I think the perception is that you're more open to doing deals now than maybe you did in the past. And I don't know if that's true or if it's more that you weren't able to do deals a couple of years ago and that you're always kind of open-minded, but never really anxious...</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: It's a good question and a fair question. We were constrained during the [consent tour] that we couldn't do M&amp;A. So we were very limited in the type of M&amp;A we could do. And we have been doing transactions, more of capabilities transactions as opposed to whole things or traditional transactions. A consideration is now today -- Tim talked about entering new markets in this digital-first, branch-lite strategy. We're able to go in a new market without buying a high premium deposit base that's going to have runoff, closing the branches and paying up for that, than losing it to [Time 0]. So the financial dynamics have changed a lot. But if it's a material opportunity, we'll take a look at it. So we were a little constrained, but it's always something we think about.</p><p>MATTHEW D. O'CONNOR: And then just separate topic, I think one of the challenges for the banking industry right now and how investors/analysts look at it is the revenue growth outlook is very challenging, whether rates goes low as a forward curve or maybe not as bad. It's tough to see, whether it's a 5% or 7%, or even a little bit less. It's a tough revenue outlook out there. The question is, if your ROE is 10, there's not much you can do to induce revenue growth. If your ROE is in the high teens, you can make the decision to sacrifice some of your returns to drive revenue. And that's the position that, I think, clearly you guys are in, and I want to get your thoughts on potentially sacrificing some of your returns to drive revenue growth.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: We'd like to retain the returns in the 14.5% to 17% range. I think we have opportunities to grow within that return dynamic. And if the revenue opportunity is less than the [5 to 7] that we're projecting, we'll manage expenses consistent with the revenue outlook and what we can achieve. We're still focused on that performance in the near term while investing in the short term, but we'll manage for whatever the environment offers us.</p><p>Right here.</p><p>ROBERT SCOTT SIEFERS, PRINCIPAL OF EQUITY RESEARCH, SANDLER O'NEILL + PARTNERS, L.P., RESEARCH DIVISION: Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Terry, when you look at the capital targets, the 8.5% common equity Tier 1. Can you discuss for a second, just the circumstances under which you do start talking more vocally about the range. Like, it'd be better to manage to 9% now versus 8.5% only because, I guess, it represents about half the excess that you have, if you sort of take out that 50 basis point gap.</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: Yes. Well, the way we kind of think about it, again, we have those different objectives. But the 8.5% is really driven based upon -- we think about sustainability through the cycle, we think about volatility that could occur, unexpected sort of losses that could occur. To be able to have sufficient capital to be able to absorb that and still be able to sustain our dividend and all those sorts of things. When you end up looking at our risk profile, our 8.5% relative to our peer group is really set relative to kind of those peers based upon the risk profile that we have. How we end up making decisions with respect to -- do we end up managing closer to 9 or to 8.5 or whatever is in part driven by, currently, the fact that we are subject to volatility in the investment portfolio for unrealized gains and losses. And so we have been running slightly higher than that. The other thing is that we always have to take into consideration the credit rating agencies and how they view our risk and what it's going to take in order to maintain that credit rating. So we're always in active kind of discussion or dialogue with respect to that, and helping to make that decision in terms of where we're going to manage the overall capital level.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Gerard. Table 12.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets. When we go back in time and look at the different cycles on credit, it seems like it's always a different area that blows up. 1990, it was the office market. '01, '02, we had the frauds with WorldCom and Enron. And of course, the subprime was the last one. Can you guys give us some color what you think the next credit -- where you're kind of keeping your eyes extra peeled where we could maybe have some problems?</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Mark, why don't you start and I'll add?</p><p>MARK G. RUNKEL: Yes. I would just say we continue to remain focused on kind of the leverage market and especially a lot of the lending is happening outside of the banking system today, right, in the highly leveraged space. So that's an area that we think potentially could lead to some economic downturn or slowdown and would need some pullback. And we'd probably see that show up first in maybe some of the consumer portfolios as unemployment begins to rise. And so we're focused in on both of those areas. But I'm really focused in on that leverage market that's, again, outside of the banking system.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: And probably, Mark, the second category would be commercial real estate, which is one of the reasons we're being a little bit more conservative in that market because we're seeing some [structure] out there that are a little aggressive.</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: Yes. Maybe I would add. So the Fed has -- or the regulators, in general, have been just concerned about looking at lending within the corporate world. And when I say that -- primarily in that, what I would say, third tier, fourth tier, middle market-type of corporate America that maybe doesn't have the same access to the capital markets, et cetera. Many of them have been leveraging up. And I think that they've been leveraging up not necessarily through the banking system but through the shadow banking system. And I think that's an area where they have a concern. The concern, maybe from a banking perspective, is what sort of spillover effect could that have if you had stress in that particular sector.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: And just to pivot on the second question. Obviously, today, you spoke a lot about digitalization. Many of us go to these Investor Days of your peers and they, too, talk about digitalization. So do you look at it as more table stakes, and it really is how you can execute rather than the digitalization itself is the competitive advantage. And then as a tie-in to that, how can a new retail consumer/customer test your app before opening up an account, so that you could then show them that you are better than JPMorgan or better than [Bay] because, to my knowledge, you really have to have an account open to test those apps.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Derek, why don't you start and Tim add on in the apps? Or Tim's right there.</p><p>DEREK JENSEN WHITE: Yes. I think we see this -- the easiest way to articulate it is the way I started this morning is that we're excellent at finance. We're excellent at risk management. We have the appetite to be excellent at digital. And the definition of excellent is pretty established based on our financial track record. Digital DIY is absolute table stakes. It's absolutely essential. But I do want to make it very clear: DIY can translate into very positive financial jaws. And that gets into, is a DIY available? Can you -- how our interactions flowing through and the positive revenue and cost dynamics that flow through that. When it comes to the application itself, we do have demos that are available online for customers to be able to see as well as getting into the application.</p><p>TIMOTHY A. WELSH: And just to build on that, I think as Derek alluded to, the basics of digital will be essential. I mean they'll be table stakes, as you said, Gerard. I do think there are 2 sources of potential advantage. The first is around personalization that comes from data. And you heard some discussion of that already. The second is the ability of the organization to continue to adapt. So how quickly you can implement new innovations is also a key part of the advantage that I think will be -- can be built up over time. And on your last point about the app, we actually -- not only do we have the videos and things that Derek described, but our app is available to prospects now. So people -- and that was a strategic choice, so that people can do exactly what you say and test it out a little bit.</p><p>KENNETH MICHAEL USDIN, MD AND SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Two questions related to the engines of growth. You talked a lot about through the business lines. But when you think about the loan book especially, and you look out to the next 3-year period, what do you see as the best opportunities for growth and return inside the loan book? I'll start with that one and then come back to the follow-up.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Terry talked a little bit about this and you hear some of the business lines, I see a lot of opportunities in many portfolios. Our auto portfolio is doing wonderfully. Our mortgage portfolio, Tim talked about that, which is sale, but we also have it on the books. The commercial and corporate products, I think, are strong. We're in some new areas of growth. Card. The card portfolio is growing tremendously. So the only area that's lagging a little bit is that CRE area that we talked about as well as the leverage lending, but across the other portfolios, I am seeing strength across all of them both consumer as well as institution.</p><p>KENNETH MICHAEL USDIN: So there's not like a new or different area where you're either becoming incrementally more focused on and putting more capital to or taking away outside of the ones you just said?</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Well, yes, a small business might be one area that we're going to have more opportunity. And this gets back to the integration of the payments capabilities with the banking capabilities.</p><p>KENNETH MICHAEL USDIN: And the second thing is that in the past Investor Days, you have talked about potential growth rates across the business lines. This year, not giving so much specific color. But can you help us understand what -- is anything different versus last time? Do you think that there's a relatively stronger engine of growth versus when it's a little softer just because of the prospects or the secular growth that's available?</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: So let me just kind of start. So when we end up thinking about the various lines of business from a revenue growth point of view, I would say that the characteristics of slightly bringing down our overall targets is really kind of cast across all those lines of businesses a bit. I would say that, again, we tend to think that the payment space has and the wealth management space has a little bit higher growth sort of opportunities in the future relative to the other ones. But that's very consistent with what we've shown in the past.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: And I also say, one of the thoughts is -- I talked -- we talked a lot about this concept of one U.S. Bank and this integration across business lines. So take it a small business merchant opportunity, it is an opportunity for multiple business lines. So as we think about where the growth is going to come, it's going to come in many places. So we wanted to think about it in a one U.S. Bank way.</p><p>Yes. Vivek.</p><p>VIVEK JUNEJA, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: If rates -- as you're thinking about your long-term growth rates, if rates stay low for an extended period of time, what does that do to your time frame for achieving those growth rates, for one. For second, it sounds like you're factoring in that for 2020, at least, mortgage banking is a big driver. You probably got some benefits from the LCR tailoring rules. So that gives you a lift up. But once those are done, if you can weave that thinking also into your longer-term what's a...</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Yes. So obviously, that question is really hard to answer simply because I have no idea where rates are going to go from one week to the next as opposed to 2020 or 2021. But if you just kind of make the assumption that rates are going to be lower, and the yield curve is going to be flatter, at least through 2020, I think that creates a revenue challenge at least through 2020. But then I think that, that tends to stabilize. And the underlying fundamentals of the growth of the book of business is what's then going to end up driving net interest income kind of going forward from there. And that's assuming things kind of stay stabilized relative to where they're at today.</p><p>VIVEK JUNEJA: And, Terry, in areas we then look out say, a year or 2 out or even 3 years out of the next Investor Day, given that you're expecting loan growth from some of these small business payments-related initiatives to pick up LCR tailoring to help on the NII, what should we expect the mix of NII to fee revenues start to look like?</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: Yes. It's roughly 42% today. And as we kind of think about out 3 years, just based upon kind of our assumptions, we expect it's going to stay fairly close to that going out into the 3-year sort of time horizon.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: I agree with that. The one caveat I would give you, Vivek, is that what I think is going to also change in the industry is the way we're paid for the value we deliver. And the traditional spread on the balance sheet component and the fee component may adjust over time as we think about things like real-time payments and treasury management compensating balance fees and the like. So we'll get revenue, but it may be in different buckets versus what we're traditionally thinking about.</p><p>Right here. John.</p><p>JOHN EAMON MCDONALD, SENIOR ANALYST LARGE-CAP BANKS, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: John McDonald from Autonomous. I wanted to ask about the operating leverage dynamics. And Terry, maybe a near-term question; and Andy, longer term. Terry, for the near term, I think it's understandable that it's a little tougher to get to that goal for the year given the rate environment. I guess is that what changed in your equation? You did 98 basis points operating leverage in the first half, so you're kind of expecting some things to get better in the second half. Just maybe a little bit of color there.</p><p>And Andy, longer term, how did you come up with that [1 to 1.5] for this year? Is that kind of a longer-term goal? Could you see that evolving differently over time? It would be helpful.</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: Yes. So if you look at the first half of the year, we're basically at 1%, so that 1.0. And if you remember, at the end of the second quarter, we just said, from the time we set that guide to the end of the second quarter, that guide was really set in September or December of the year and, of course, the yield curve flattened a fair amount. You can manage, I think, through some of that, but at some particular point in time, you have to make that decision between short term and long term. And then the other thing is that when it's happening in September, the levers that you might be able to pull relative to the year are just difficult to be able to both execute and see the benefit of within a relatively short period of time. So we have to kind of take that into consideration. Again, when we think about where the yield curve is today, and I know John Stern is here, so it might be different about 10 minutes from now. But in terms of where it's at today, I think it's going to be somewhat lower than that 1%, but we're going to do everything we can to manage the expenses the way that we know we can.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Our timing is impeccable. September 12, we picked for Investor Day, right? So 60 days ago, we were in July, in the earnings call, we expected the [1 to 1.50]. And in the subsequent 45 days, rates went down 50 to 60 basis points. We went from one rate increase decline expectation to 3, right? And all that, so we're doing all the modeling. And then in the last week, the 10-year goes from -- up [20], right? So all these -- it's changing dramatically as we speak, right? So we're always trying to achieve that positive operating leverage. As we talked about, John, I think we have a lot of opportunities in the company while retaining the investment that's necessary for success in the future to optimize what we're doing today. So I'm very confident in positive operating leverage. And I think that range is the opportunity that we have on a go-forward basis.</p><p>TERRANCE R. DOLAN: And I would come back to one of the questions that was earlier and that is, if you don't make the investments in your business to evolve, you're going to find yourself at the valley of death. And we need to make sure that we are making investments to digitize and move this organization forward. And so that gets back to the balance of making some maybe short-term decisions that are going to benefit us in the long term. And again, where the yield curve ends up, who knows, but we're just going to end up having to manage whatever comes at us.</p><p>MICHAEL LAWRENCE MAYO: Well, I sent a text to my wife and I asked her, she -- we're in New York City. \"Have you heard of U.S. Bank?\" And what do you think her answer was?</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Is she a football fan?</p><p>MICHAEL LAWRENCE MAYO: She does not watch the Super Bowl. But she said, \"Why are you bothering me?\" But no, she hasn't heard of it. And so I guess the question here is, as you move out of market in retail, half the country, you don't have branches. I'm not -- I don't feel too nervous saying 3 years from now, I don't think your out-of-market retail expansion is going to make a big dent in your firm. And if that's the case, then how can you look at customers for lifetime value the same way some of the largest banks can? And if you can't look at your customers for total lifetime value, we put this in our preview report. I'm raised in Cincinnati; I go to a school, Wash U in St. Louis. I moved to Milwaukee. I then get married and moved to New York City, and I'm not dealing with U.S. Bank anymore. So some of your larger banks can do that. You might not be able to do it the same way. Therefore, doesn't that change the way you think about bank acquisitions? Another thing is what is your retention rate these days with your retail customers, say, over decades?</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Right. Kate, why don't you start on the brand? And Tim, talk a little bit about retail customers, and I'll close it out.</p><p>KATHERINE B. QUINN: Sure. And of course, we are -- you're right. There are many people that have not heard of U.S. Bank, that haven't been exposed to the brand. However, we're being really smart about how we acquire customers out of footprint. So for example, and I think Tim mentioned this, we have hundreds of thousands of customers outside of our retail footprint that may have a mortgage with us or a credit card with us. And what we have been doing is doing tests to understand, okay, well, what other rights do we have to that customer, for example? How do we groom them to be a broader U.S. Bank customer, and we've been very successful in some of those pilots. So we're getting smarter and smarter about how we do it, how we optimize it with the data and insights that we have.</p><p>I also think that there are many examples of now through digitization and other product improvements that we can move across geographies, and we are working on many, many other initiatives that enable us to have sort of a ubiquitous capability versus being married to our geography.</p><p>TIMOTHY A. WELSH: And I would just add a couple of points, I think, to that, Mike. The first is that, as Kate alluded to, we do have customers all across the country, and we are demonstrating the ability to, particularly through digital tools, serve them in multiple ways. So that's one of the real benefits, for example, of having mortgage servicing as part of our app. Someone who is a mortgage-servicing customer actually downloads the app, but to Gerard's question, can actually see all the different parts and offerings that we have. And that turns out to be a terrific tool. It, by the way, does solve your Washington University student problem because they move from geographies and keep the same app, and so that's a big part of it. And you are right that we will need to build branches. Just as we have indicated, we will in some high-profile markets to build some more awareness. But we're seeing very strong retention of our customers, and we're seeing a real openness to the kind of offering that we have, in part because the digitization is good, and in part because they're seeing our credit card, auto or mortgage experience be pretty positive, and that opens them up to other possibilities that they may have with the bank.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Mike, I'd add one thing to it. Because we tried to enter new markets in a digital-only, no branch, new customer-basis, and what we actually got was negative selection. We got either customers who we had to pay very high rates to attract as there was nothing else attracting to the U.S. Bank and/or they weren't able to bank at other banks. This concept of these customers who already have U.S. Bank in their wallet one way, shape or form and extending the relationships across the markets that we have branches and don't have branches and sometimes they have branches in this digital-first, branch-lite strategy, I think, is the right way to go.</p><p>MICHAEL LAWRENCE MAYO: And do you have figures on retail customer retention? And how has that changed this decade or over decades because that's the dream, right? That you can hold these customers for life? Are you actually seeing that in the data? And how does your data compare to industry data?</p><p>TIMOTHY A. WELSH: What we've looked at over a long time, and I'm not sure I can comment on the industry, but for ourselves, when we look at this concept of centrality that we talked about, which is a combination of: are we your primary bank, are you engaging with us a lot and do we have a broad relationship with you? When we look at those customers, they are substantially more profitable, and they have much higher retention than a typical customer. And that's why we're so focused on that metric and moving that number.</p><p>ANDREW CECERE: Other questions?</p><p>All right. Well, why don't I -- thank you. Thank you for your questions. And thank you again for your attendance. Why don't I close it out with just a few remarks? So we started the day talking about the 3 components of how we want you to think about the company. Number one, we're starting from a position of strength. We have a lot of capabilities and core competencies that is our intent to retain. But at the same time, we recognize that we need to adjust and pivot for some of those new capabilities around agile innovation and digital. And you saw a number of business line initiatives that take that into account. And we talked about the business mix we have, the high return businesses, the capital efficiency that we have, the industry-leading returns and industry-leading risk management. Importantly, throughout the day, and back to some of the questions that were asked just now, we recognize that we need to change, retain what we're strong at but adjusting change for the future. That requires investments. It requires an attitude of adoption and agility, and it requires us recognizing we need to do things differently. And the way we're thinking about this is optimizing today, recognizing those things that we can get better at to continue to invest in the future.</p><p>Now the thing I didn't talk about this morning is what gives me the most confidence is the team up here on the stage. I think we have the best leaders in banking. I think we have the best business leaders, the best risk leaders, and the best finance leaders, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished thus far. So I want to leave you with this thought. We're managing for the long term while delivering near-term results that support a pathway to the future. If you're an investor in U.S. Bank, thank you. I'm confident your investment is well placed.</p><p>Thank you for your time today, and thanks for the questions.

Several U.S. lawmakers had previously called for oversight of big tech companies such as Amazon, expressing a growing concern about the size of the largest tech firms and their market power. The authorities were allowed to review some documents on Amazon laptops but were not allowed to take anything with them, according to the report, which added that Fed officials were not aware of the Capital One data breach under way at the time. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Capital One said earlier this week that 106 million people who had applied for credit cards in the United States and Canada had their personal data exposed. The breach, which occurred between March 12 and July 17, stemmed from Capital One's decision to store data in Amazon's cloud unit, called Amazon Web Services (AWS), where a former employee named Paige Thompson managed to access its data. She was charged with computer fraud by federal prosecutors in Seattle. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11774420</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPT-SG81-DYWP-R3K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"260\"/><timeReceived>11:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The visit by Federal Reserve examiners was made around the same time as, prosecutors alleged, a woman in Seattle was trying to access a Capital One Financial Corp database stored on Amazon's cloud server, the Journal reported <url normalizedValue=\"https://on.wsj.com/334v73h\">https://on.wsj.com/334v73h</url>. The authorities examined Amazon's resiliency and backup systems and described their visit as the first in their ongoing oversight of the company, the report added. </p><p>Several U.S. lawmakers had previously called for oversight of big tech companies such as Amazon, expressing a growing concern about the size of the largest tech firms and their market power. The authorities were allowed to review some documents on Amazon laptops but were not allowed to take anything with them, according to the report, which added that Fed officials were not aware of the Capital One data breach under way at the time. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Capital One said earlier this week that 106 million people who had applied for credit cards in the United States and Canada had their personal data exposed. The breach, which occurred between March 12 and July 17, stemmed from Capital One's decision to store data in Amazon's cloud unit, called Amazon Web Services (AWS), where a former employee named Paige Thompson managed to access its data. She was charged with computer fraud by federal prosecutors in Seattle.

This independent bureau whi...</p><p>The United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has received over 90 responses from various stakeholders\u2019 in the financial services sector on its advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) issued last month.    This independent bureau which operates under the U.S Treasury made highlights in July after it was approved for banks within its jurisdiction to act as crypto custodians. From the responses on the ANPR, some banks including PNC and the U.S are actually interested in scaling operations into the crypto scene.    With the OCC still at the initial stages towards rulemaking, some figures in the industry believe that now is the best time for innovators to give their input to the agency. Prominent firms that aired their views on the OCC ANPR for digital currency policies include Visa, Facebook\u2019s Novi, Stripe, ConsenSys and Google which even suggested that the OCC should incentivize FinTech developments through hackathons, pilots and innovation competitions.   Industry Stakeholders Take!   A few issues appeared to have been more common for most of the stakeholders who gave their feedback before the August 3 deadline. The American Bankers Association (ABA) which wrote a letter as part of its contribution mainly highlighted the need for a consensus in taxonomy and terminology amongst other areas for the integration to happen seamlessly. The ABA letter reads,    \u201cEffective policy analysis on crypto assets is essential to maintaining banks\u2019 capacity to innovate, but it may be inhibited by the lack of common terminology. A common taxonomy and understanding of crypto assets\u2019 risks and features, broadly consistent and coordinated across all the relevant regulators, is essential to fostering prudent innovation within a sound risk management framework.\u201d    User protection policies were also highlighted in terms of privacy and security given the delicate balance needed to maintain some fundamental aspects of cryptocurrencies. Coin Center\u2019s Research Director, Peter Van Vulkenburgh, was of the opinion that banks can actually provide privacy and surveil their clients\u2019 activities through private coin and other features within crypto ecosystems. These sentiments on privacy and security were also echoed by MasterCard\u2019s Tina Woo as she went to highlight the underlying potential,    \u201cWe believe cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology hold the potential to enhance operational resiliency, improve auditability, and enable new functionalities.\u201d    Finally, an interesting perspective was raised by 3 rd party crypto service providers which appear to be in favor of banks sub-contracting for critical crypto services.

Although Chinese banks still enjoy heftier margins and lighter regulations than Western institutions, they are aware that fighting Big Tech on volume is not an easy strategy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's why Chinese banks focus on reviewing what \"value for clients\" truly means as a starting point to design innovative business models based on a new platform concept: the hybrid open-banking advisory platform.</p><p>The should matter to Western banks struggling to differentiate in a more transparent and digitally oriented financial world. It puts into perspective the choice many firms are pondering: whether to focus on scaling faster on volume, or to invest in generating new value such as shifting revenues towards fee-based services.</p><p>Generating new value requires innovation. Institutions must replace the traditional product catalog with relationship models based on holistic goal-setting investing. Generating more volume in comparison seems like an easier strategy; institutions assume they just plug simplified, product-driven business models into digital and mobile banking.</p><p>However, volume strategies face two major hurdles on digital:</p><p>For starters, banks will have to with Big Tech companies, which have many more digital touchpoints and can more easily win clients in the zero-margins race.</p><p>Secondly, digitizing investment products doesn't work well. If banks offer $1,000 personal loans at zero interest on their apps, they can expect a huge number of clicks. But it is also a big risk management problem. And if banks pitch customers to invest $1,000 in a portfolio on their apps, they can't expect much adoption (as experienced by robo advisers).</p><p>Currently, banks rely on these types of traditional platforms: factory, distribution and marketplace.</p><p>Factory platforms are fairly product-centric and transaction-based. They focus strategically on back-end operations providing access to their banking licenses as a utility. This is a short-term win and a risky strategy because Chinese Big Techs already have acquired banking licenses.</p><p>The distribution model is more client-centric but still transaction based. Banks use artificial intelligence and big data to understand client journeys. Thus, they propose the best product or service which can be sourced internally or delivered through a fintech. This can also be a short-term win and a risky strategy because clients know nothing about banks' efforts to personalize their offers and only receive a product.</p><p>The model starts client-centric but the revenues are product-centric, forcing banks to compete on volumes. Once more, Big Tech will always know more than any banks about final clients, due to their prime digital access to personal data.</p><p>The marketplace is also product-centric but more service-based. Financial institutions build open banking marketplaces where fintech and bank offers compete to match client demand. Thus, banks make money on fees to access the platform and fintech retrocessions.</p><p>This might result in a short-term loss because most banks would struggle to become a large enough marketplace to compete with Big Tech platforms. Also, many clients are not self-directed, and would not feel comfortable to access a totally digital marketplace for investment products and insurance products.</p><p>Therefore, financial firms must transform from three directions: From transactions to services; from products to customer centricity; or from branches to open banking.</p><p>The advisory model is one which is both client-centric and service-based. Financial institutions can adopt a hybrid model that motivates clients to bank for higher transparent margins. This will save a bank's profitability by adding real value to clients and repositioning balance sheets sustainably.</p><p>Digital is a pull technology (a demand-driven mechanism), while investing and insuring are push economies (offer-driven industries).</p><p>That being said, people are more pull-oriented when spending money: they have a clear motivation about what type of products they need when logging into Amazon. Only then does Amazon \"push\" its best offers to the shopper.</p><p>But when it comes to making financial decisions, consumers rely on push-oriented decisions. Most people want to weigh an advisory recommendation first before committing to an investment, as very few understand financial products, the risks and potential returns.</p><p>Therefore, the platform configuration on digital banking must also address how humans get motivated when it comes to finance. There can be a hybrid model (human relationships supported by AI) or a digital platform operating with true conversational AI - a technology that is still developing. Regardless, reinforcing clients' understanding about finance will be critical to motivate them on digital banking.</p><p>There is the question of whether banks should try to become digital distribution channels of financial products. Jeff Bezos , publishers complained that users could share negative book reviews. He explained that Amazon was not a distribution channel of books on the internet. Rather, Amazon's role was, first and foremost, to provide advice to its users about the best book to buy.</p><p>Here's the lesson for banks: if the initial client motivation cannot not be addressed, all other marketing techniques to optimize sales will not be effective. Meaning, clients will onboard but not generate transactions. Negative reviews were the needed mechanism to generate advisory-trust on the platform.</p><p>The real scope of fintech innovation is not to digitize products but to form knowledge-based relationships.</p><p>Big data and AI have two roles to play. Both will be infused into digital advisory platforms to learn more about clients. But AI is also needed to help clients understand banks and their new value propositions, as well as their attached fees.</p><p>By providing clients this transparency and service, banks can create open banking advisory platforms that bundle proprietary and fintech services; generate return on investment from new client-based fees; and differentiate themselves from Big Tech competitors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016e-47dc-db24-a96f-5ffe0b950000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XG1-5W11-F06X-W0KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

Although Chinese banks still enjoy heftier margins and lighter regulations than Western institutions, they are aware that fighting Big Tech on volume is not an easy strategy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's why Chinese banks focus on reviewing what \"value for clients\" truly means as a starting point to design innovative business models based on a new platform concept: the hybrid open-banking advisory platform.</p><p>TheChinese conversationshould matter to Western banks struggling to differentiate in a more transparent and digitally oriented financial world. It puts into perspective the choice many firms are pondering: whether to focus on scaling faster on volume, or to invest in generating new value such as shifting revenues towards fee-based services.</p><p>Generating new value requires innovation. Institutions must replace the traditional product catalog with relationship models based on holistic goal-setting investing. Generating more volume in comparison seems like an easier strategy; institutions assume they just plug simplified, product-driven business models into digital and mobile banking.</p><p>However, volume strategies face two major hurdles on digital:</p><p>For starters, banks will have tofight head-to-headwith Big Tech companies, which have many more digital touchpoints and can more easily win clients in the zero-margins race.</p><p>Secondly, digitizing investment products doesn't work well. If banks offer $1,000 personal loans at zero interest on their apps, they can expect a huge number of clicks. But it is also a big risk management problem. And if banks pitch customers to invest $1,000 in a portfolio on their apps, they can't expect much adoption (as experienced by robo advisers).</p><p>Currently, banks rely on these types of traditional platforms: factory, distribution and marketplace.</p><p>Factory platforms are fairly product-centric and transaction-based. They focus strategically on back-end operations providing access to their banking licenses as a utility. This is a short-term win and a risky strategy because Chinese Big Techs already have acquired banking licenses.</p><p>The distribution model is more client-centric but still transaction based. Banks use artificial intelligence and big data to understand client journeys. Thus, they propose the best product or service which can be sourced internally or delivered through a fintech. This can also be a short-term win and a risky strategy because clients know nothing about banks' efforts to personalize their offers and only receive a product.</p><p>The model starts client-centric but the revenues are product-centric, forcing banks to compete on volumes. Once more, Big Tech will always know more than any banks about final clients, due to their prime digital access to personal data.</p><p>The marketplace is also product-centric but more service-based. Financial institutions build open banking marketplaces where fintech and bank offers compete to match client demand. Thus, banks make money on fees to access the platform and fintech retrocessions.</p><p>This might result in a short-term loss because most banks would struggle to become a large enough marketplace to compete with Big Tech platforms. Also, many clients are not self-directed, and would not feel comfortable to access a totally digital marketplace for investment products and insurance products.</p><p>Therefore, financial firms must transform from three directions: From transactions to services; from products to customer centricity; or from branches to open banking.</p><p>The advisory model is one which is both client-centric and service-based. Financial institutions can adopt a hybrid model that motivates clients to bank for higher transparent margins. This will save a bank's profitability by adding real value to clients and repositioning balance sheets sustainably.</p><p>Digital is a pull technology (a demand-driven mechanism), while investing and insuring are push economies (offer-driven industries).</p><p>That being said, people are more pull-oriented when spending money: they have a clear motivation about what type of products they need when logging into Amazon. Only then does Amazon \"push\" its best offers to the shopper.</p><p>But when it comes to making financial decisions, consumers rely on push-oriented decisions. Most people want to weigh an advisory recommendation first before committing to an investment, as very few understand financial products, the risks and potential returns.</p><p>Therefore, the platform configuration on digital banking must also address how humans get motivated when it comes to finance. There can be a hybrid model (human relationships supported by AI) or a digital platform operating with true conversational AI - a technology that is still developing. Regardless, reinforcing clients' understanding about finance will be critical to motivate them on digital banking.</p><p>There is the question of whether banks should try to become digital distribution channels of financial products. Jeff Bezosonce recalled how in the 1990s, publishers complained that users could share negative book reviews. He explained that Amazon was not a distribution channel of books on the internet. Rather, Amazon's role was, first and foremost, to provide advice to its users about the best book to buy.</p><p>Here's the lesson for banks: if the initial client motivation cannot not be addressed, all other marketing techniques to optimize sales will not be effective. Meaning, clients will onboard but not generate transactions. Negative reviews were the needed mechanism to generate advisory-trust on the platform.</p><p>The real scope of fintech innovation is not to digitize products but to form knowledge-based relationships.</p><p>Big data and AI have two roles to play. Both will be infused into digital advisory platforms to learn more about clients. But AI is also needed to help clients understand banks and their new value propositions, as well as their attached fees.</p><p>By providing clients this transparency and service, banks can create open banking advisory platforms that bundle proprietary and fintech services; generate return on investment from new client-based fees; and differentiate themselves from Big Tech competitors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016e-47dc-db24-a96f-5ffe0b950000-217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XG1-5W11-F06X-W0MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

U.S. banks will set aside up to $320 billion to cover potential credit losses in 2020 due to the financial strain of the pandemic, according to a new report from Accenture (NYSE: ACN).</p><p>Titled \"How Banks Can Prepare for the Looming Credit Crisis,\" the report projects that banks globally will set aside up to 2.4% of their existing credit books to cover expected losses in unpaid loans \u2015nearly double what banks wrote off during the 2008 global financial crisis. The impact will vary across the globe depending upon the level of government-funded stimulus programs and the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In the U.S., around 9% of home loans were in forbearance as of June, up 6 percentage points since March. In the U.K., payment holidays were issued on one in six mortgages and 1.5 million credit cards and personal loans.</p><p>\"Banks will play a critical role in helping absorb the economic impact of the global pandemic and stimulating a rapid recovery for consumers and small businesses,\" said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture who leads its Banking practice globally. \"As public programs wind down, the burden of holding extra capital to protect against credit defaults will fall on banks' balance sheets. To inform their credit management strategies, banks will need a clear-sighted and data-driven view of the current level of credit risk while keeping a long-term view of the customer at the forefront.\"</p><p>In 2019, U.S. banks set aside US$55 billion to cover potential loan losses; Accenture estimates that banks will need to hold an additional US$210 billion to US$265 billion to cover potential write-offs for bad loans in 2020 depending on the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19.

U.S. banks will set aside up to $ 320 billion to cover potential credit losses in 2020 due to the financial strain of the pandemic, according to a new report from Accenture (NYSE: ACN).</p><p><br/><br/>Titled 'How Banks Can Prepare for the Looming Credit Crisis,' the report projects that banks globally will set aside up to 2.4% of their existing credit books to cover expected losses in unpaid loans --nearly double what banks wrote off during the 2008 global financial crisis. The impact will vary across the globe depending upon the level of government-funded stimulus programs and the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In the U.S., around 9% of home loans were in forbearance as of June, up 6 percentage points since March. In the U.K., payment holidays were issued on one in six mortgages and 1.5 million credit cards and personal loans.<br/><br/>'Banks will play a critical role in helping absorb the economic impact of the global pandemic and stimulating a rapid recovery for consumers and small businesses,' said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture who leads its Banking practice globally. 'As public programs wind down, the burden of holding extra capital to protect against credit defaults will fall on banks' balance sheets. To inform their credit management strategies, banks will need a clear-sighted and data-driven view of the current level of credit risk while keeping a long-term view of the customer at the forefront.'<br/><br/>In 2019, U.S. banks set aside US$ 55 billion to cover potential loan losses; Accenture estimates that banks will need to hold an additional US$ 210 billion to US$ 265 billion to cover potential write-offs for bad loans in 2020 depending on the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In Europe, banks might write off up to US$ 460 billion in 2020, an increase of US$ 370 billion from 2019; and in China, banks might write off up to US$ 360 billion in 2020, a US$ 190 billion increase from 2019.<br/><br/>In the increasingly debt-driven economy, banks are faced with managing their existing loan books while also making decisions around extending new credit.

U.S. banks will set aside up to $ 320 billion to cover potential credit losses in 2020 due to the financial strain of the pandemic, according to a new report from Accenture (NYSE: ACN).</p><p><br/><br/>Titled \"How Banks Can Prepare for the Looming Credit Crisis,\" the report projects that banks globally will set aside up to 2.4% of their existing credit books to cover expected losses in unpaid loans -nearly double what banks wrote off during the 2008 global financial crisis. The impact will vary across the globe depending upon the level of government-funded stimulus programs and the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In the U.S., around 9% of home loans were in forbearance as of June, up 6 percentage points since March. In the U.K., payment holidays were issued on one in six mortgages and 1.5 million credit cards and personal loans.<br/><br/>\"Banks will play a critical role in helping absorb the economic impact of the global pandemic and stimulating a rapid recovery for consumers and small businesses,\" said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture who leads its Banking practice globally. \"As public programs wind down, the burden of holding extra capital to protect against credit defaults will fall on banks' balance sheets. To inform their credit management strategies, banks will need a clear-sighted and data-driven view of the current level of credit risk while keeping a long-term view of the customer at the forefront.\"<br/><br/>In 2019, U.S. banks set aside US$ 55 billion to cover potential loan losses; Accenture estimates that banks will need to hold an additional US$ 210 billion to US$ 265 billion to cover potential write-offs for bad loans in 2020 depending on the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In Europe, banks might write off up to US$ 460 billion in 2020, an increase of US$ 370 billion from 2019; and in China, banks might write off up to US$ 360 billion in 2020, a US$ 190 billion increase from 2019.<br/><br/>In the increasingly debt-driven economy, banks are faced with managing their existing loan books while also making decisions around extending new credit. The report notes that doing so could lead to record levels of public and private debt worldwide, which some analysts predict could reach as high as $ 200 trillion by the end of 2020. This might ultimately threaten the ability of businesses and consumers to repay their debts.<br/><br/>Large banks in a position of strength when the pandemic hit<br/><br/>Many banks entered the pandemic with the financial resilience to absorb considerable credit losses, with the world's largest banks holding capital reserves well above what regulators require, according to Accenture analysis. The report notes that the top five U.S. banks set aside US$ 60 billion in reserves during the first half of the year and that European banks set aside almost US$ 18 billion in the first quarter of 2020. These reserves will start to be drawn down as stimulus funding dries up, causing accounts to go delinquent.<br/><br/>\"Banks will have to maneuver carefully to strike the right balance between rescuing individual and small business customers and protecting their own profitability and solvency,\" McIntyre said. \"This will require difficult decisions around which credit extensions will help an ultimately financially viable customer versus delaying the inevitable delinquency. To make these decisions, banks can apply the firepower of data and analytics capabilities that they've built over the past decade to help inform surgical credit management strategies tailored for specific industries and geographies -ultimately providing the type of high-end treatment typically reserved for high-net-worth and corporate customers.\"<br/><br/>Banks' temporary blind-spot in credit management<br/><br/>The report notes that in an environment where payment holidays aren't being reflected in consumers' credit scores and the underlying health of a business is masked by furlough and payroll protection schemes, banks can take a data-driven approach to manage their credit portfolio. This approach can provide a broader context of the current environment and how business and consumer behaviors have changed as a result of COVID-19.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, banks' credit management units have shrunk back to bare bones. Many banks will need to quickly scale up resources and collections capabilities to a magnitude beyond what they can traditionally handle to meet the expected rising levels of default. By combining the digital technologies they've built over the past decade with their people on the front lines, banks can provide personalized advice and empathetic guidance to offer creative solutions to help customers bridge the widening financial gap.<br/><br/>The report provides recommendations for how banks can strengthen their credit management capabilities and prepare their business and operations for the challenges to come, while managing potentially conflicting priorities. These include:<br/><br/>- engaging with regulators to avoid/minimize unintended consequences such as new credit drying up;<br/><br/>- operating with clear guidance and transparency on collections and recovery;<br/><br/>- ensuring fair treatment for borrowers while also having a clear view of customers' creditworthiness; and<br/><br/>- managing balance sheet risk while providing advice that helps businesses and consumers navigate through the financial crisis.<br/><br/>\"While it might be tempting for banks to pull back on extending new credit in the current environment, the demand for credit will rise and be met - if not by banks then by non-traditional lenders,\" McIntyre said. \"Competition isn't coming just from fintechs and big tech, but increasingly from large, well-capitalized companies offering finance options for their products and services. If banks attempt to aggressively reduce offers of credit, what might start as a slow trickle of customers turning to alternate lenders could quickly become roaring rapids that can drastically change the tide of lending.\"<br/><br/>The full report can be accessed here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis\">https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis</url>.<br/><br/>About Accenture<br/><br/>Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations, with digital capabilities across all of these services.

The impact will vary across the globe depending upon the level of government-funded stimulus programs and the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In the U.S., around 9% of home loans were in forbearance as of June, up 6 percentage points since March. In the U.K., payment holidays were issued on one in six mortgages and 1.5 million credit cards and personal loans.<br/><br/>\"Banks will play a critical role in helping absorb the economic impact of the global pandemic and stimulating a rapid recovery for consumers and small businesses,\" said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture who leads its Banking practice globally. \"As public programs wind down, the burden of holding extra capital to protect against credit defaults will fall on banks' balance sheets. To inform their credit management strategies, banks will need a clear-sighted and data-driven view of the current level of credit risk while keeping a long-term view of the customer at the forefront.\"<br/><br/>In 2019, U.S. banks set aside US$ 55 billion to cover potential loan losses; Accenture estimates that banks will need to hold an additional US$ 210 billion to US$ 265 billion to cover potential write-offs for bad loans in 2020 depending on the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In Europe, banks might write off up to US$ 460 billion in 2020, an increase of US$ 370 billion from 2019; and in China, banks might write off up to US$ 360 billion in 2020, a US$ 190 billion increase from 2019.<br/><br/>In the increasingly debt-driven economy, banks are faced with managing their existing loan books while also making decisions around extending new credit. The report notes that doing so could lead to record levels of public and private debt worldwide, which some analysts predict could reach as high as $ 200 trillion by the end of 2020. This might ultimately threaten the ability of businesses and consumers to repay their debts.<br/><br/>Large banks in a position of strength when the pandemic hit<br/><br/>Many banks entered the pandemic with the financial resilience to absorb considerable credit losses, with the world's largest banks holding capital reserves well above what regulators require, according to Accenture analysis. The report notes that the top five U.S. banks set aside US$ 60 billion in reserves during the first half of the year and that European banks set aside almost US$ 18 billion in the first quarter of 2020. These reserves will start to be drawn down as stimulus funding dries up, causing accounts to go delinquent.<br/><br/>\"Banks will have to maneuver carefully to strike the right balance between rescuing individual and small business customers and protecting their own profitability and solvency,\" McIntyre said. \"This will require difficult decisions around which credit extensions will help an ultimately financially viable customer versus delaying the inevitable delinquency. To make these decisions, banks can apply the firepower of data and analytics capabilities that they've built over the past decade to help inform surgical credit management strategies tailored for specific industries and geographies -ultimately providing the type of high-end treatment typically reserved for high-net-worth and corporate customers.\"<br/><br/>Banks' temporary blind-spot in credit management<br/><br/>The report notes that in an environment where payment holidays aren't being reflected in consumers' credit scores and the underlying health of a business is masked by furlough and payroll protection schemes, banks can take a data-driven approach to manage their credit portfolio. This approach can provide a broader context of the current environment and how business and consumer behaviors have changed as a result of COVID-19.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, banks' credit management units have shrunk back to bare bones. Many banks will need to quickly scale up resources and collections capabilities to a magnitude beyond what they can traditionally handle to meet the expected rising levels of default. By combining the digital technologies they've built over the past decade with their people on the front lines, banks can provide personalized advice and empathetic guidance to offer creative solutions to help customers bridge the widening financial gap.<br/><br/>The report provides recommendations for how banks can strengthen their credit management capabilities and prepare their business and operations for the challenges to come, while managing potentially conflicting priorities. These include:<br/><br/>- engaging with regulators to avoid/minimize unintended consequences such as new credit drying up;<br/><br/>- operating with clear guidance and transparency on collections and recovery;<br/><br/>- ensuring fair treatment for borrowers while also having a clear view of customers' creditworthiness; and<br/><br/>- managing balance sheet risk while providing advice that helps businesses and consumers navigate through the financial crisis.<br/><br/>\"While it might be tempting for banks to pull back on extending new credit in the current environment, the demand for credit will rise and be met - if not by banks then by non-traditional lenders,\" McIntyre said. \"Competition isn't coming just from fintechs and big tech, but increasingly from large, well-capitalized companies offering finance options for their products and services. If banks attempt to aggressively reduce offers of credit, what might start as a slow trickle of customers turning to alternate lenders could quickly become roaring rapids that can drastically change the tide of lending.\"<br/><br/>The full report can be accessed here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis\">https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis</url>.<br/><br/>About Accenture<br/><br/>Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations, with digital capabilities across all of these services.

U.S. banks will set aside up to $320 billion to cover potential credit losses in 2020 due to the financial strain of the pandemic, according to a new report from Accenture (NYSE: ACN). Titled , the report projects that banks globally will set aside up to 2.4% of their existing credit books to cover expected losses in unpaid loans \u2022nearly double what banks wrote off during the 2008 global financial crisis.

Banks will play a critical role in helping absorb the economic impact of the global pandemic and stimulating a rapid recovery for consumers and small businesses, said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture who leads its Banking practice globally. As public programs wind down, the burden of holding extra capital to protect against credit defaults will fall on banks balance sheets.

In Europe, banks might write off up to US$460 billion in 2020, an increase of US$370 billion from 2019; and in China, banks might write off up to US$360 billion in 2020, a US$190 billion increase from 2019.  In the increasingly debt-driven economy, banks are faced with managing their existing loan books while also making decisions around extending new credit. The report notes that doing so could lead to record levels of public and private debt worldwide, which some analysts predict could reach as high as $200 trillion by the end of 2020. This might ultimately threaten the ability of businesses and consumers to repay their debts.  Large banks in a position of strength when the pandemic hit Many banks entered the pandemic with the financial resilience to absorb considerable credit losses, with the worlds largest banks holding capital reserves well above what regulators require, according to Accenture analysis.

Banks temporary blind-spot in credit management The report notes that in an environment where payment holidays arent being reflected in consumers credit scores and the underlying health of a business is masked by furlough and payroll protection schemes, banks can take a data-driven approach to manage their credit portfolio. This approach can provide a broader context of the current environment and how business and consumer behaviors have changed as a result of COVID-19.  Over the past decade, banks credit management units have shrunk back to bare bones. Many banks will need to quickly scale up resources and collections capabilities to a magnitude beyond what they can traditionally handle to meet the expected rising levels of default. By combining the digital technologies theyve built over the past decade with their people on the front lines, banks can provide personalized advice and empathetic guidance to offer creative solutions to help customers bridge the widening financial gap.  The report provides recommendations for how banks can strengthen their credit management capabilities and prepare their business and operations for the challenges to come, while managing potentially conflicting priorities. These include:  engaging with regulators to avoid/minimize unintended consequences such as new credit drying up; operating with clear guidance and transparency on collections and recovery; ensuring fair treatment for borrowers while also having a clear view of customers creditworthiness; and managing balance sheet risk while providing advice that helps businesses and consumers navigate through the financial crisis.   While it might be tempting for banks to pull back on extending new credit in the current environment, the demand for credit will rise and be met \u2022 if not by banks then by non-traditional lenders, McIntyre said. Competition isnt coming just from fintechs and big tech, but increasingly from large, well-capitalized companies offering finance options for their products and services.

U.S. banks will set aside up to $320 billion to cover potential credit losses in 2020 due to the financial strain of the pandemic, according to a new report from Accenture (NYSE: ACN).      Banks\u2019 cost of risk in times of crisis   Titled \u201c How Banks Can Prepare for the Looming Credit Crisis ,\u201d the report projects that banks globally will set aside up to 2.4% of their existing credit books to cover expected losses in unpaid loans \u2015nearly double what banks wrote off during the 2008 global financial crisis. The impact will vary across the globe depending upon the level of government-funded stimulus programs and the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In the U.S., around 9% of home loans were in forbearance as of June, up 6 percentage points since March. In the U.K., payment holidays were issued on one in six mortgages and 1.5 million credit cards and personal loans.   \u201cBanks will play a critical role in helping absorb the economic impact of the global pandemic and stimulating a rapid recovery for consumers and small businesses,\u201d said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture who leads its Banking practice globally. \u201cAs public programs wind down, the burden of holding extra capital to protect against credit defaults will fall on banks\u2019 balance sheets. To inform their credit management strategies, banks will need a clear-sighted and data-driven view of the current level of credit risk while keeping a long-term view of the customer at the forefront.\u201d   In 2019, U.S. banks set aside US$55 billion to cover potential loan losses; Accenture estimates that banks will need to hold an additional US$210 billion to US$265 billion to cover potential write-offs for bad loans in 2020 depending on the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In Europe, banks might write off up to US$460 billion in 2020, an increase of US$370 billion from 2019; and in China, banks might write off up to US$360 billion in 2020, a US$190 billion increase from 2019.   In the increasingly debt-driven economy, banks are faced with managing their existing loan books while also making decisions around extending new credit. The report notes that doing so could lead to record levels of public and private debt worldwide, which some analysts predict could reach as high as $200 trillion by the end of 2020. This might ultimately threaten the ability of businesses and consumers to repay their debts.   Large banks in a position of strength when the pandemic hit   Many banks entered the pandemic with the financial resilience to absorb considerable credit losses, with the world\u2019s largest banks holding capital reserves well above what regulators require, according to Accenture analysis. The report notes that the top five U.S. banks set aside US$60 billion in reserves during the first half of the year and that European banks set aside almost US$18 billion in the first quarter of 2020. These reserves will start to be drawn down as stimulus funding dries up, causing accounts to go delinquent.   \u201cBanks will have to maneuver carefully to strike the right balance between rescuing individual and small business customers and protecting their own profitability and solvency,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cThis will require difficult decisions around which credit extensions will help an ultimately financially viable customer versus delaying the inevitable delinquency. To make these decisions, banks can apply the firepower of data and analytics capabilities that they\u2019ve built over the past decade to help inform surgical credit management strategies tailored for specific industries and geographies \u2015ultimately providing the type of high-end treatment typically reserved for high-net-worth and corporate customers.\u201d   Banks\u2019 temporary blind-spot in credit management   The report notes that in an environment where payment holidays aren\u2019t being reflected in consumers\u2019 credit scores and the underlying health of a business is masked by furlough and payroll protection schemes, banks can take a data-driven approach to manage their credit portfolio. This approach can provide a broader context of the current environment and how business and consumer behaviors have changed as a result of COVID-19.   Over the past decade, banks\u2019 credit management units have shrunk back to bare bones. Many banks will need to quickly scale up resources and collections capabilities to a magnitude beyond what they can traditionally handle to meet the expected rising levels of default. By combining the digital technologies they\u2019ve built over the past decade with their people on the front lines, banks can provide personalized advice and empathetic guidance to offer creative solutions to help customers bridge the widening financial gap.   The report provides recommendations for how banks can strengthen their credit management capabilities and prepare their business and operations for the challenges to come, while managing potentially conflicting priorities. These include:  engaging with regulators to avoid/minimize unintended consequences such as new credit drying up; operating with clear guidance and transparency on collections and recovery; ensuring fair treatment for borrowers while also having a clear view of customers\u2019 creditworthiness; and managing balance sheet risk while providing advice that helps businesses and consumers navigate through the financial crisis.   \u201cWhile it might be tempting for banks to pull back on extending new credit in the current environment, the demand for credit will rise and be met \u2015 if not by banks then by non-traditional lenders,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cCompetition isn\u2019t coming just from fintechs and big tech, but increasingly from large, well-capitalized companies offering finance options for their products and services. If banks attempt to aggressively reduce offers of credit, what might start as a slow trickle of customers turning to alternate lenders could quickly become roaring rapids that can drastically change the tide of lending.\u201d   About Accenture   Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations, with digital capabilities across all of these services.

U.S. banks will set aside up to $320 billion to cover potential credit losses in 2020 due to the financial strain of the pandemic, according to a new report from Accenture (NYSE: ACN).    Titled \u201c How Banks Can Prepare for the Looming Credit Crisis ,\u201d the report projects that banks globally will set aside up to 2.4% of their existing credit books to cover expected losses in unpaid loans \u2015nearly double what banks wrote off during the 2008 global financial crisis. The impact will vary across the globe depending upon the level of government-funded stimulus programs and the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In the U.S., around 9% of home loans were in forbearance as of June, up 6 percentage points since March. In the U.K., payment holidays were issued on one in six mortgages and 1.5 million credit cards and personal loans.    \u201cBanks will play a critical role in helping absorb the economic impact of the global pandemic and stimulating a rapid recovery for consumers and small businesses,\u201d said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture who leads its Banking practice globally. \u201cAs public programs wind down, the burden of holding extra capital to protect against credit defaults will fall on banks\u2019 balance sheets. To inform their credit management strategies, banks will need a clear-sighted and data-driven view of the current level of credit risk while keeping a long-term view of the customer at the forefront.\u201d    In 2019, U.S. banks set aside US$55 billion to cover potential loan losses; Accenture estimates that banks will need to hold an additional US$210 billion to US$265 billion to cover potential write-offs for bad loans in 2020 depending on the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In Europe, banks might write off up to US$460 billion in 2020, an increase of US$370 billion from 2019; and in China, banks might write off up to US$360 billion in 2020, a US$190 billion increase from 2019.    In the increasingly debt-driven economy, banks are faced with managing their existing loan books while also making decisions around extending new credit. The report notes that doing so could lead to record levels of public and private debt worldwide, which some analysts predict could reach as high as $200 trillion by the end of 2020. This might ultimately threaten the ability of businesses and consumers to repay their debts.     Large banks in a position of strength when the pandemic hit  Many banks entered the pandemic with the financial resilience to absorb considerable credit losses, with the world\u2019s largest banks holding capital reserves well above what regulators require, according to Accenture analysis. The report notes that the top five U.S. banks set aside US$60 billion in reserves during the first half of the year and that European banks set aside almost US$18 billion in the first quarter of 2020. These reserves will start to be drawn down as stimulus funding dries up, causing accounts to go delinquent.    \u201cBanks will have to maneuver carefully to strike the right balance between rescuing individual and small business customers and protecting their own profitability and solvency,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cThis will require difficult decisions around which credit extensions will help an ultimately financially viable customer versus delaying the inevitable delinquency. To make these decisions, banks can apply the firepower of data and analytics capabilities that they\u2019ve built over the past decade to help inform surgical credit management strategies tailored for specific industries and geographies \u2015ultimately providing the type of high-end treatment typically reserved for high-net-worth and corporate customers.\u201d     Banks\u2019 temporary blind-spot in credit management  The report notes that in an environment where payment holidays aren\u2019t being reflected in consumers\u2019 credit scores and the underlying health of a business is masked by furlough and payroll protection schemes, banks can take a data-driven approach to manage their credit portfolio. This approach can provide a broader context of the current environment and how business and consumer behaviors have changed as a result of COVID-19.    Over the past decade, banks\u2019 credit management units have shrunk back to bare bones. Many banks will need to quickly scale up resources and collections capabilities to a magnitude beyond what they can traditionally handle to meet the expected rising levels of default. By combining the digital technologies they\u2019ve built over the past decade with their people on the front lines, banks can provide personalized advice and empathetic guidance to offer creative solutions to help customers bridge the widening financial gap.    The report provides recommendations for how banks can strengthen their credit management capabilities and prepare their business and operations for the challenges to come, while managing potentially conflicting priorities. These include:    engaging with regulators to avoid/minimize unintended consequences such as new credit drying up;  operating with clear guidance and transparency on collections and recovery;  ensuring fair treatment for borrowers while also having a clear view of customers\u2019 creditworthiness; and  managing balance sheet risk while providing advice that helps businesses and consumers navigate through the financial crisis.    \u201cWhile it might be tempting for banks to pull back on extending new credit in the current environment, the demand for credit will rise and be met \u2015 if not by banks then by non-traditional lenders,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cCompetition isn\u2019t coming just from fintechs and big tech, but increasingly from large, well-capitalized companies offering finance options for their products and services. If banks attempt to aggressively reduce offers of credit, what might start as a slow trickle of customers turning to alternate lenders could quickly become roaring rapids that can drastically change the tide of lending.\u201d    The full report can be accessed here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis\">https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis</url> .

In Europe, banks might write off up to US$460 billion in 2020, an increase of US$370 billion from 2019; and in China, banks might write off up to US$360 billion in 2020, a US$190 billion increase from 2019.</p><p>In the increasingly debt-driven economy, banks are faced with managing their existing loan books while also making decisions around extending new credit. The report notes that doing so could lead to record levels of public and private debt worldwide, which some analysts predict could reach as high as $200 trillion by the end of 2020. This might ultimately threaten the ability of businesses and consumers to repay their debts.</p><p>Large banks in a position of strength when the pandemic hit<br/>Many banks entered the pandemic with the financial resilience to absorb considerable credit losses, with the world's largest banks holding capital reserves well above what regulators require, according to Accenture analysis. The report notes that the top five U.S. banks set aside US$60 billion in reserves during the first half of the year and that European banks set aside almost US$18 billion in the first quarter of 2020. These reserves will start to be drawn down as stimulus funding dries up, causing accounts to go delinquent.</p><p>\"Banks will have to maneuver carefully to strike the right balance between rescuing individual and small business customers and protecting their own profitability and solvency,\" McIntyre said. \"This will require difficult decisions around which credit extensions will help an ultimately financially viable customer versus delaying the inevitable delinquency. To make these decisions, banks can apply the firepower of data and analytics capabilities that they've built over the past decade to help inform surgical credit management strategies tailored for specific industries and geographies ?ultimately providing the type of high-end treatment typically reserved for high-net-worth and corporate customers.\"</p><p>Banks' temporary blind-spot in credit management<br/>The report notes that in an environment where payment holidays aren't being reflected in consumers' credit scores and the underlying health of a business is masked by furlough and payroll protection schemes, banks can take a data-driven approach to manage their credit portfolio. This approach can provide a broader context of the current environment and how business and consumer behaviors have changed as a result of COVID-19.</p><p>Over the past decade, banks' credit management units have shrunk back to bare bones. Many banks will need to quickly scale up resources and collections capabilities to a magnitude beyond what they can traditionally handle to meet the expected rising levels of default. By combining the digital technologies they've built over the past decade with their people on the front lines, banks can provide personalized advice and empathetic guidance to offer creative solutions to help customers bridge the widening financial gap.</p><p>The report provides recommendations for how banks can strengthen their credit management capabilities and prepare their business and operations for the challenges to come, while managing potentially conflicting priorities. These include:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>engaging with regulators to avoid/minimize unintended consequences such as new credit drying up;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>operating with clear guidance and transparency on collections and recovery;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>ensuring fair treatment for borrowers while also having a clear view of customers' creditworthiness; and</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>managing balance sheet risk while providing advice that helps businesses and consumers navigate through the financial crisis.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>\"While it might be tempting for banks to pull back on extending new credit in the current environment, the demand for credit will rise and be met ? if not by banks then by non-traditional lenders,\" McIntyre said. \"Competition isn't coming just from fintechs and big tech, but increasingly from large, well-capitalized companies offering finance options for their products and services. If banks attempt to aggressively reduce offers of credit, what might start as a slow trickle of customers turning to alternate lenders could quickly become roaring rapids that can drastically change the tide of lending.\"</p><p>The full report can be accessed here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accenture.com%2Fus-en%2Finsights%2Fbanking%2Fcoronavirus-credit-crisis&amp;esheet=52256730&amp;newsitemid=20200728005228&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accenture.com%2Fus-en%2Finsights%2Fbanking%2Fcoronavirus-credit-crisis&amp;index=2&amp;md5=67e152af195b12c9bdf30c26455a117b\">https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis</url> .</p><p>About Accenture<br/>Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations, with digital capabilities across all of these services.

The announcement follows similar inquiries underway in Congress and at the Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust oversight responsibilities with the Justice Department.</p><p>The Justice Department did not name specific companies in a news release announcing its review, but noted that it would look into concerns about search, social media and some retail services \u2014 presumably putting Google, Facebook, and Amazon on notice.</p><p>The pressure on tech giants has ended decades of deferential treatment toward the industry. In Congress, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is holding hearings and conducting its own investigation of the market power and behavior of the big tech companies.</p><p>At a hearing last week, with witnesses from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple, Representative David Cicilline, chairman of the subcommittee, said that the government stance for too long was to celebrate the new tech economy rather than scrutinize its corporate leaders.</p><p>\"Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,\" Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said in his opening statement. \"As a result, the Internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Cicilline sent letters to three of the companies at last week's hearing \u2014 Google, Facebook, and Apple. He is seeking answers to questions posed at the hearing, but not directly addressed by the witnesses. Cicilline characterized those earlier replies as \"evasive, incomplete, or misleading.\"</p><p>In announcing the review, the Justice Department said it would look into whether the Internet companies were \"harming consumers.\" For most of the last four decades, US courts and regulators have interpreted the consumer harm standard of antitrust to mean that company behavior led to higher prices, but it's challenging to make that argument when services like Google and Facebook are free and Amazon is celebrated for low prices and convenient delivery.</p><p>This latest review comes on the heels of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission splitting up potential antitrust investigations into Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-a7c94d8a-ada0-11e9-872b-e97458d81249</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-DHH1-DYHJ-32M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"474\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She has graciously left us with our Big Story, a collaboration with James and Stephanie Findlay in New Delhi on how nationalist fervour in India is turning against Chinese investors \u2014 creating an opening for US tech companies to steal a march on their rivals.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The TikTok tumult remained at the top of the geopolitical agenda, with Donald Trump unexpectedly backing a proposed takeover by Microsoft \u2014 but with some curious caveats, including an unheard-of kickback for the US Treasury (Top 10). One of the beneficiaries: Japan\u2019s Line. Not so merry: LinkedIn, the latest sandbox for Chinese espionage (both Top 10).</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Don\u2019t miss Henny Sender\u2019s analysis of how China\u2019s central bank is turning to a digital currency to rein in its own dominant tech giants (Best of Comment).

Let\u2019s get to it.</emphasis></p><p>The Big Story </p><p>India is becoming the first big overseas battleground in the US-China tech war. US big tech companies are making ground against Chinese competitors as anti-Chinese sentiment bristles following a brutal border clash, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1df5dfd-36c4-49e6-bc56-506bf3ca3444\"> according to this analysis in the Financial Times</url>.</p><p>An explosion of Chinese venture capital investments \u2014 amounting to $4.3bn since the start of 2017 \u2014 is looking increasingly exposed and new Chinese deals are at a standstill. By contrast, US venture capital and M&amp;A inflows are surging.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications:</emphasis> China\u2019s dominance of India\u2019s tech start-up scene has hitherto been strong. Seven out of India\u2019s top 10 unicorns are backed by a Chinese strategic investor versus only one backed by a US counterpart. But a policy shift since the border clash in June imperils China Inc\u2019s position.</p><p>Scores of Chinese apps \u2014 including TikTok, WeChat, Weibo and others \u2014 have been banned by New Delhi. Google Pay, meanwhile, has emerged as the leading payments app in India while previous market leader Paytm, a $16bn start-up backed by Alibaba, is languishing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot:</emphasis> Big US tech \u2014 including Google, Facebook, Amazon and others \u2014 is seeing India as an El Dorado and gaining ground on Chinese competitors. But India\u2019s market is never straightforward. The trials of Vodafone and Cairn Energy should stand as cautionary tales.

Many of the protections and rights for data subjects outlined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)[3] mirror those of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[4], making it one of the strictest and most progressive pieces of data security legislation in US history. Under the CCPA, consumers will have the right to request the data that companies have collected on them, request the deletion of that data, and deny third-party access to it. </p><p>Companies not up to CCPA snuff will be subject to steep sanctions, including fines of up to $7,500 for each intentional violation and up to $750 for every consumer affected in the event of a data breach.The delay in passing federal data protection laws means that companies including Amazon, Facebook, Google, and even retailers like Walmart that depend on consumer data for their user tracking and advertising must comply with the robust restrictions of the new California law. Major US tech companies, as well as associated businesses that depend on them, had been pushing for more lenient federal laws[5] to be created to get ahead of the CCPA, set to come into force on 1st January 2020, but the prospect of passing any legislation in the midst of current congressional debates does not look promising. \"This will be tremendously challenging... companies need to really focus on complying with California now because there is not going to be a life raft from a federal level,\" said Gary Kibel, technology and privacy partner at Davis ...lbert law firm, speaking to Reuters. Despite the efforts of some senators to draft a federal bill by the end of the year, negotiations are still ongoing for matters such as how to adequately facilitate consumers' informed consent so they may choose to opt-out of personally-identifiable data collection, and how such a process would be enforced. The information that can be considered private and the consumer information that can be freely exchanged with third parties are also up for continued congressional debate, though they are already included in California's new law. Although negotiations over federal legislation are still underway, many lobbyists remain optimistic that the privacy bill will pass, given that data security is a bipartisan issue and the new law won't take a penny out of taxpayers' pockets.

However, the bill is still unconfirmed and is being consulted by the House Finance Services Committee. </p><p>But tech companies are now feeling the heat to stay away from the financial services sector.The bill is being introduced in light of Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra which is to be launched in 2020. The social media giant has collaborated with PayPal, Mastercard and Uber to govern the new coin.PresidentDonald Trump is the latest critic of Libra and other cryptocurrencies[2]. Trump, according to CNBC[3], demanded that companies seek a banking charter and make themselves subject to U.S. and global regulations if they wanted to become a bank. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, had also said that Libra could not move forward unless it addressed concerns over privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.Facebook has a long way to go though and breaching privacy is the ghost that comes back to haunt its CEO again and again.

What are people telling you?</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, you know, what I find remarkable about this event is, what didn't happen. It's true that oil prices moved up, but they really didn't move up very much. If you think, you know, what would have happened 10 years ago, if we had tankers being shelled like this, in the Strait of Hormuz?</p><p>You know, you would be looking at major increases in oil prices and I think the reason that's not happening right now, is because the United States has a shale boom going on. If you actually look at domestic shale producer stocks yesterday, they all went up.</p><p>The U.S. shale boom is insulating the U.S. economy and financial markets from events like this, which is really good news for the U.S. economy, for the global economy. You know, one of those tankers was a Japanese tanker. You know, this could be problems for other countries that depend on Gulf oil.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon, I've been saying this for years and years and years, for as long as I've been, certainly, on television, about the importance of our energy security. Energy security is national security. And to -- basically, the more oil we can produce, we are --</p><p>Again, don't have to worry about a supply disruption, number one, but we also have greater control and power over these nations, these oil-producing nations that hate us, like Iran.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right. You know, if Iran did this, and that's what Secretary Pompeo said, I don't think all the evidence is in, but if Iran did this, all they're really doing is hurting themselves and hurting other oil producers in the Gulf nations. Because, you know, anyone looking for a stable source of oil supply in the world, right now, you know, has to be looking at the United States.</p><p>And, you know, when you look at what's going on in Venezuela, the potential for transportation disruptions in the Middle East, the U.S. is a stable distributor. And, you know, I think we're also -- the United States is still building out its infrastructure.</p><p>We've got pipeline infrastructure going up there. This is going to make it even easier to ship from the Permian Basin in the months and years ahead, so, you know, again, it's really remarkable to me. I think 10 or 20 years ago, I would be sitting here today, saying this could be the kind of thing that could cause a recession.</p><p>And today, I'm saying, you know, if you look at -- if you look at what happened at 10-year treasury yield, stock prices, oil prices, it doesn't register on a one month or three-month basis, if you look at charts over one or three months. You don't even see this event yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We are the world's number one oil producer. We produce more oil than even Saudi Arabia and Russia, I think based on the most recent information, and oil is still -- even through yesterday's close, it's still down in a bear market, it's down more than 21 percent from the recent high hit in April of this year.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's exactly right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon, I want to move on to tariffs, hundreds of American companies including Wal-Mart, Costco, Target, sending a letter to President Trump, writing against tariffs, the White House Economic Advisor, Larry Kudlow, speaking yesterday, about the upcoming G20 Summit and a potential meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi-Jinping. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER, UNITED STATES: President Trump has indicated his strong desire for a meeting. But the meeting is not yet arranged, formally. He's also indicated that if the meeting doesn't come to pass, there may be consequences. But he would prefer the meeting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: One of the world's largest chip makers, meantime, Broadcom, cutting its revenue forecast, amounting to about $2 billion in lost sales, Jon, as a result of banning Chinese telecom giant, Huawei. These are the two fronts, again, the tariff fight and then, a really cracking down on the espionage and theft by the likes of Huawei, your reaction to both of those stories?</p><p>Does it do -- does this do anything, a warning from a major chip maker and then also pushback from these U.S. corporations?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I think the President is comfortable with where he stands on tariffs with the Chinese. He tried to use tariffs with Mexico, as a lever in the immigration debate, and he kind of got a lot of blowback on that.</p><p>You know, when it -- when it comes to China, the President's view is, it's raising a bunch of revenues. There's a debate going on about whether that's a tax on U.S. consumers or a tax on Chinese companies. But I think he's comfortable with what's happening.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, we're not seeing tariffs on China, show up, in consumer prices at this point. You know, all the inflation data are below the Fed's two percent target, so I think the President feels like he still has leverage in this debate with the Chinese and he's going to take his time and let this thing play out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Moving on to this, you big nerd. I say that as your friend. This is an incredible story, in the Wall Street Journal today. It's an article that you co-wrote with Kate Davidson. And the headline reads how Washington learned to love debt and deficits.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And here's part of what you wrote. Moody's projects that within a decade interest payments will consume more than 20 percent of federal revenue, well above most other developed nations and exceeding U.S. levels in the 1980s and 1990s when debt worries consumed Wall Street and Washington.</p><p>Former Senator Alan Simpson, retired in Wyoming, anticipates a reckoning. If you spend more than you earn, you lose your butt.</p><p>But, again, this is also -- and you write about this. This is a -- you called it a mini revolution in academia, where leading scholars are debating whether we can run these really high debt levels and high deficits.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes. So, Dagen, you and I have talked about this a lot on Maria's show, I mean, the big -- the key factor here is, what's going on with U.S. borrowing costs? Ten-year treasury yields are now near two percent.</p><p>I mean, this defies every prediction that every economic model has. You know, when borrowing -- when government debt soars like this, the models say that interest costs should increase and that corporate borrowing should be crowded out by government borrowing. And it hasn't happened.</p><p>Right now, the governments' interest payments are being held down by very low interest rates and corporate borrowing is booming, even as government borrowing is booming.</p><p>And so, you know, there's a real sense of, you know, choose your term. You could say complacency here, in Washington, or you could say just comfort that these high debt levels aren't a problem for the United States government.</p><p>You know, when I talk to people like Alan Simpson, very colorful guy, you saw from that quote, what they worry about is that, you know, this comfort level is going to go away some day. Interest rates, they're two percent today. They could be going higher in the future, and then we're talking about a real problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon, in all your reporting, and you go into some incredible detail and I encourage everybody to read the story, in terms of the -- just our interest costs, the interest on our debt, the amount of money we spend, it's going to swamp Medicaid this year, and in five years, it's going to top what we spend on national defense.</p><p>Do people think that this could basically -- that longer term interest rates, all of a sudden, could snap back where the government and all those in charge of this federal borrowing are shocked and there is a global economic shock, if you will?</p><p>HILSENRATH: This is where the debate is going on in academia. What the economists have woken up to is the fact that interest rates have tended to be lower than the economy's growth rate for most of the post-World War II period. Interest rates have consistently defied expectations for that snapback that you talk about.</p><p>And so the idea, in academia, is what maybe all this debt isn't a problem because the economy keeps growing faster than the interest cost is costing us to manage the rising debt.</p><p>Well, the worry is that, you know, once you recognize some pattern, like interest rates tend to be low, they defy that expectation and smack you in the face. And so, the worry is that interest rates are going to snap back and snap us in the face. But the problem is, people have been predicting that for years, and it hasn't happened.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I said nerd, but you know what I think of you, you know that -- I think that -- and you are one of the best there is, in terms of economics and journalism. So, Jon, thank you. It's great to see you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>PetSmart's online business, adding energy to the IPO market, Cheryl Casone has the details, hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: You know this name, Dagen, good morning, Chewy.com, pricing its initial public offering at $22.00 per share, higher than expected for the range.</p><p>Chewy has yet to make a profit, but they sold more stock than they planned and the company is now valued at more than $8 billion, starts trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker, C-H-W-Y.</p><p>Hot IPO market helping PetSmart and another retailer, Neiman Marcus, resolve disputes with their creditors.</p><p>Wall Street Journal is reporting that both companies are promised lenders to use money from their IPOs to pay off debt, Neiman Marcus agreeing to give creditors the first $450 million from the sale, or IPO, of its online business (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>PetSmart is using more than half the proceeds from Chewy's IPO to reduce its debt load.</p><p>Trump administration going to allow employees to use special pre-tax health arrangements to buy insurance that includes policies that don't comply with Obamacare protections. The administration says the rule is expected to expand coverage by 2029 to an estimated 800,000 people that were previously uninsured.</p><p>For more on this, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta is going to join MORNINGS WITH MARIA at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Then, there is this, KPMG, preparing to pay as much as $50 million to end an SEC investigation. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the fine would be the highest ever imposed on an auditor, in an SEC action. KPMG is facing criminal charges after four partners were found sharing confidential information about which of the firm's audits would be examined by regulators.</p><p>And those are your headlines, Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl. We'll see you shortly. Coming up, Facebook, getting into crypto, big names reportedly backing the social media giant's plan for a digital currency. Plus, an historic win for Toronto, the Raptors winning their first NBA title, all the highlights in sports. Plus, how rapper, Drake, celebrated, coming up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A big show coming up this morning. U.S. Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, for what the administration is doing on health insurance, health care costs.</p><p>Arkansas Congressman, House Financial Services Committee Member, French Hill, former Pennsylvania Governor, and Ballard Spahr Special Consel, Ed Rendell, and former Commanding Officer of the USS Cole, Commander Kirk Lippold, you don't want to miss any of these gentlemen.</p><p>Talking to the producer this morning, Tammy, we were saying there's so much to cover, where are we going to put it all?</p><p>Well, we're getting to this top story, Facebook's new cryptocurrency, the social media giant reportedly getting big backers for its new virtual money venture called Libra, set to be unveiled next week and launched next year.</p><p>This is according to the Wall Street Journal, the Journal also reporting that more than one dozen companies, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber, all signing up, each investing around $10 million.</p><p>Joining the conversation all morning long, CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, along with former Investment Banker, former NFL star, CEO of the Brewer Group, Jack Brewer. Welcome one and all. What do you make of this? This is a big move for Facebook, getting all these names signed on is important.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Yes, it's a big deal. There's a couple things happening here, I think, first and foremost, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, all these companies do not want to be on the outside, looking in, so it makes sense for them to come in and do a deal because it's sort of a free bet, right?</p><p>You have a lot of these payment processing companies worried about big tech coming in on their turf. Everyone's worried about Amazon getting into financial services. So, this is more of a defensive play to make sure they're part of the conversation.</p><p>And also, for Facebook, it makes sense because they can reduce slippage and fraud through having a cryptocurrency where it's actually validated through the payment processing system, so they know who the users are buying. So, I think it actually does make sense for both sides.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's also a pushback on Bitcoin as well.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Right. And you've seen Bitcoin and all these other cryptocurrencies be extremely volatile. The positive about this new cryptocurrency, the Libra, is that it's going to be backed by a basket of government securities, so that's positive. It will help keep the volatility in this new currency down, I think.</p><p>But the question for me, really, is, when you think about Facebook, who's having all this privacy concerns, they're going to be the ones in there, verifying and recording these transactions. Are they going to be able to keep them private and not, you know, let the -- let those transactions be released to the public.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP: The security concerns, for me, have elevated. I recently got hacked, and I tell you, it's very, very bad experience. I mean, what they're doing now, they're going in and actually forcing you to pay for your own website. They stole my social media and everything. But they're using Bitcoin, and no one can trace it. And so, for me, it's about the security concerns.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, they tried to extort you?</p><p>BREWER: They did extort me. It wasn't trying, they did extort me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Did you call the federal authorities?</p><p>BREWER: I've called everyone. You can do almost nothing. I've tried with Instagram, couldn't get my Instagram account back. They literally took my -- this is my -- this is my nonprofit. They took my nonprofit and put up just horrible explicit words on the screen, I mean, it's just a bad, bad, bad situation.</p><p>And so, my hope is that, hopefully, Facebook or some of these bigger organizations can come in and add some more security to this crypto --</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, what -- and we can get in here. But, what you're saying is that there is no governance and protection for the people using these platforms now, and when you are hacked, they don't do anything or they do paltry little. Like, this is -- if your identity is stolen, something to that effect, like that's -- law enforcement needs to be brought into the picture.</p><p>So, your question is, why would anybody trust these platforms to, basically, with a new currency, if you will, if they can't even manage what the businesses that they have now and protect the users on these platforms.</p><p>KELLY: Well, I just want to bring up a point earlier. We were talking about Bitcoin. And Bitcoin is seen more as a store value and there's networks being put around it like the lightning network to actually do payment processing systems. But, this is completely separate from this. And this is more of a closed architecture financial services system between all these vendors that are within it.</p><p>So, I think, there actually going to be accountability across all board. Now, Facebook will exert control because they are --</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're not going to actually control the currency directly.</p><p>KELLY: Right. They won't control. They can't -- they can't control it, right, because then, I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's in an effort -- they made that decision in an effort to basically stem the concerns about them -- the privacy.</p><p>KELLY: Right. But as the developer, they can decide who comes in and who comes out of the consortium, of who can use it, what platforms can use it, so they can't control the actual currency and the value, but they can control certain aspects.</p><p>BREWER: That's good. We need that, because they have to do something.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm sorry about that.</p><p>BREWER: Yes, I mean, t's been terrible, I mean, what a bad experience.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's literally you don't know who to call.</p><p>BREWER: And law enforcement can do nothing because it's over their head and they don't understand it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wow. Coming up, Kim Kardashian, back at the White House, discussing criminal justice reform and her new initiative with Lyft, coming up, plus, Jessica Biel, facing critics over what appears to be an anti- vaccination stance. The actress says that's not the case. We explain, ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Headlines across America this morning. The New York Post writes this. Cuba Gooding Jr. struts out of court, offers support for David Ortiz after arraignment. Gooding Jr., pleading not guilty to charges of sexual abuse stemming from an alleged incident in a Manhattan club.</p><p>The Oscar-winner's only comment, get well, Big Papi, extending well wishes to Red Sox legend, David Ortiz, who was shot over the weekend.</p><p>The L.A. Times reporting this, Jessica Biel, facing criticism, explains why she opposes California vaccination bill. The actress insisting she's not an anti-vaxxer, but does support families having the right to make educational medical decisions for their children with their doctors.</p><p>The legislation looks to give the state more control over exemptions, critics quick to reject Biel's comments. One Twitter user saying, this is why we don't take health advice from movie stars. And it was other celebrities who actually caused this anti-vaccination trend and the giant measles outbreak that we're seeing in the country.</p><p>Meantime, the Sun Sentinel saying driverless big rigs could be hitting Florida highways next year. Are you ready, good buddy? Semi-trucks without drivers are coming to Florida highways as early as next year, and with no real warning.</p><p>The autonomous driving systems apparently don't need to be tested, inspected or certified under a new state law, taking effect July the 1st.</p><p>Kevin, this also goes to the issue of how quickly we're going to see these autonomous vehicles, nationwide. I think that's what people are trying to figure out, how soon that will happen.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, and it's funny because USPS is actually testing this in routes in Texas, actually, for delivering the mail. So, this is actually coming sooner than we think, but we actually still need to build out our systems and infrastructures from the cellphone towers and the fiber optic networks to process all these information for autonomous driving vehicles, so it's going hand in hand. It's pretty interesting.</p><p>BELL: Isn't it a little scary, though, that semis are going to come out before regular cars?</p><p>KELLY: Well, there's a lack of semi-truck drivers, right? And trucking is one of the biggest costs in its supply chain for retailers. So, we're talking about these tariffs hitting (INAUDIBLE) if they could reduce the cost of trucking and labor, that could actually help them.</p><p>BREWER: Yes, I mean, if they start hiring some guys that have criminal backgrounds for nonviolent crimes, you have plenty of guys to drive the trucks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Amen.</p><p>BREWER: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'd say, look out for the teamsters union, pushing back on this, a little bit. Coming up, shake-up at the White House, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, leaving her post as press secretary. And meantime, a watchdog group is pushing for President Trump to fire advisor, Kellyanne Conway, we have details on that.</p><p>And this construction worker dad became an Instagram influencer to prove how easy it is, but there is a huge catch.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday, June 14th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Futures are pointing to a lower, open a 78 point loss on the Dow Futures right now. Chip makers are under pressure after broad come warned of lower sales due to the Huawei ban.</p><p>Again, we're talking about what is going to the sacrifice for companies and even individuals as we take on China? We didn't expect the Chinese industrial production numbers also hitting the market. This after markets finished up slightly but off to session highs yesterday. But the major averages this week going into Friday are up across the board.</p><p>With the Dow transports being the biggest gainer, two percent gain there that usually seen as a good sign for the market.</p><p>Breaking -- and let's check on global market action in Europe. We have losses across the board in England, France, and Germany, but the losses all less than one present at the moment.</p><p>In Asia overnight, again, that industrial production number, to not only the week. Data in China, retail sales rising 7.2 percent, but that is the slowest pace since 2003.</p><p>U.S. retail sales. We're looking at the Asian markets here down across- the-board, except for a gain on the Nikkei in Japan. We got retail sales here in the United States, out two hours from now. We will have full analysis in what it means for the direction of the market and also the Federal Reserve. What it's going to do?</p><p>Kim Kardashian back at the White House. Details on the new program that's aiming to help prisoners with Lyft.</p><p>Plus, construction worker turn -- turned Instagram influencer. But his story might not be exactly what you think.</p><p>And, oh, Canada, the Toronto Raptors winning their first never NBA championship. And Drake celebrating with some new music.</p><p>Our top story this half hour. White House staffing shakeup. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders leaving her post. The president making the announcement yesterday. \"After 3-1/2 years, our wonderful Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be leaving the White House at the end of the month and going home to the great state of Arkansas.</p><p>She is a very special person with extraordinary talents, who has done an incredible job. I hope she decides to run for governor of Arkansas -- she would be fantastic. Sarah, thank you for a job well done.\"</p><p>Joining me now, Washington Times opinion editor, Fox News contributor and fellow Virginian, Charlie Hurt. Hey, Charlie.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is important, though, because again, the president does need a tough and unwavering spokesperson going into the election year next year. Who do you think it is? This isn't a surprise but, who do you think is on deck to take Sarah's place?</p><p>HURT: I don't know. It's going to -- those are very, very tough shoes to fill. I think that -- and Sarah has done a terrific job, and she's working for a very, very difficult unusual boss. A guy who is kind of his own press secretary. A guy who has very, very specific opinions about how he wants the job done.</p><p>And she's done -- and she's done it against a hostile press. The likes of which we've -- I don't feel like we've ever seen before in modern times -- in modern times. I mean, it's just incredible the hostility that she faces. And she does it -- I think she does with grace, I think she's done it with as much candor as you could expect from a press secretary of any president. But she -- you know, and I think they're going to be tough shoes to fill.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The venom directed at her while she was in the job and even after she left yesterday, venom especially from women, which at this point, I guess, we shouldn't be surprised by that, women on the left.</p><p>But also, just the harassment of her and her family, whether is that restaurant that was in Lexington, Virginia. Or, I know that like -- you know, some celebrity at Disney world was like taking selfies with her and her family and the kids in the background.</p><p>Again, what is wrong with these people? And does it discourage somebody from taking this job?</p><p>HURT: Well, you know -- you know, obviously, that position is always been a tough. It's always been a tough position and there is always a lot of -- you know, a lot of questions directed at the principle, in this case, the president.</p><p>But my goodness, what we have seen it's so different about this is how much of that venom has been directed at her personally. And it's unprecedented. And I think that it's a -- it's a real -- you know, it's a real stain on the -- I think the news profession. As well as -- you know, indicator of sort of modern times where everybody has access to media and can sort of -- and little things ricochet around the Internet and -- but it's really disgusting.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I call it asymmetric outrage.</p><p>HURT: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon Stewart's outrage for the 9/11 first responders, that's justified. That makes sense, that's where you should direct that anger.</p><p>HURT: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But this, it's just mind-boggling.</p><p>HURT: And I think that always amazes me, Dagen is I don't know how these people keep it up. I don't know how you manufacture this amount of rage over stupid things. And the net result -- you can say whatever you want to about this president. But the net result is that this president has overseen a remarkably transparent administration.</p><p>And a -- and a perfect example is the -- is the whole controversy yesterday about whether or not, you know, President Trump would go running to the FBI if before an adversary brought dirt on a political opponent.</p><p>He openly disagreed with his FBI director. How is that anything other than transparent? That's great. As a -- as a guy who grew up -- he worked for newspapers, I love that sort of transparent disagreement, but not -- but not this press.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, and they said boo, not a (INAUDIBLE) about Hillary Clinton paying a foreign Intel.</p><p>HURT: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Former foreign intelligence agency to go to Russia and dig up dirt on her political opponent, and then put that information in the hands of the FBI. And then turned around and use it to spy on her opponent. Again, just incredible.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HURT: You could make it up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Turning to Kellyanne Conway, this is -- this is pretty serious. The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel taking aim at the White House adviser. Saying, she should be removed from working in the federal government.</p><p>Conway being accused of violating the Hatch Act, which aims to stop people working in federal government from affecting elections after she made heated remarks during recent television news interviews.</p><p>Speaking to Neil Cavuto, former Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett weighed in on how she thinks President Obama would have handled a similar situation. Listen to this, Charlie.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: You would make a comment (INAUDIBLE) people, right? And you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VALERIE JARRETT, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: No, not a political one at all. No, not when you're on the White House, not when you're in the briefing room or on the North Lawn. Absolutely not.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: So, her comments and they recommend that she take a hike. You agree with that now.</p><p>JARRETT: Well I think that's up to her boss, and my guess is he's not interested in what I have to say. All I can tell you is what the Obama White House would have done. President Obama would have had zero tolerance for that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Would he have fired you?</p><p>JARRETT: I think if I had, had violated the Hatch Act, yes, he would have fired me.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Charlie your reaction to all that.</p><p>Look, I'm all in favor of enforcing the Hatch Act, but it's never been really enforced. And this is another example of where you have this double standard. And not only is it just the double standard, but it's a double standard against an administration that has withstood unprecedented.</p><p>Venom and vitriol from the press and from the outside. And so, the idea that you have Kellyanne Conway, going on T.V., defending her boss, defending the administration. And that turns into some violation of the Hatch Act, which, of course, nobody enforces anyway. It's absolutely ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just see a lot of misdirected anger.</p><p>HURT: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And on the left, if they don't like the president, well, they clearly want to impeach him just simply because they don't like him and like the way he speaks, a lot of that. But again --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HURT: But again, if your-- if your anger, rage, and attention and energy or miss focus. What happens? You end up running somebody like Hillary Clinton who loses.</p><p>HURT: Yes. No, that's it. And, of course, that's the problem that the Democrats face going into 2020. If they -- if the only thing that they have. If the candidate they pick is the candidate who's the best at attacking Donald Trump and complaining about Donald Trump. They're not going to win anything.</p><p>They have to present an actual vision that is positive, that is attractive to regular American voters. And specifically to the Independents that Donald Trump -- you know, stripped out of the Democratic column.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, and I point this out. There's editorial from Andy Puzder in the journal today. Wage gains are rising and the most and lower paying industries without a $15 minimum wage. So, they're going to have to figure out a way to counter that.</p><p>HURT: Yes, if you -- if you strip out the -- their hatred of Donald Trump's style, 90 percent of Americans would be satisfied with the job that Donald Trump is doing. But because of this -- and, of course, that you know, you look at this poll numbers, and people, you know, they make fun of them they say is poll numbers are low.</p><p>And I'm like, my goodness, look at the unprecedented negative press coverage, whose poll numbers wouldn't be through the floor if they got this kind of this level of vitriolic press coverage.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Charlie, good to see you.</p><p>HURT: Good to see you, Dagen;</p><p>MCDOWELL: Have a fantastic weekend my friend. Charles Hurt.</p><p>Kim Kardashian, meantime, returning to the White House, doubling down on her push for criminal justice reform. Cheryl Casone has more. Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Hey, Dagen. Well, with President Trump at her side, Kim Kardashian announcing an initiative with Lyft. Designed to help former prisoners get to job interviews.</p><p>Kardashian meeting with the president several times about criminal justice reform. Remember she successfully lobbied President Trump to pardon Alice Marie Johnson, who is serving a life sentence without parole for drug offenses.</p><p>Well, our very own Maria Bartiromo had a chance to sit down with real estate developer and billionaire Larry Silverstein. They covered everything from lessons learned after 9/11 to the state of the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: So, what are you seeing then and dissolve this conversation happening right now that a recession is on the horizon. Look at the inverted yield curve. The Federal Reserve just recently said, look, we stand ready to act to cut rates. Do you see a recession on the horizon?</p><p>LARRY SILVERSTEIN, REAL STATE DEVELOPER: Honestly, I don't. But then again, I'm a little bit of optimistic. I tend to look at things with rose covered glasses. But as I also look around I see much of America doing well. But the economy, much of the economy is strong and doing well.</p><p>Producing -- I mean, look at the job market -- the job market is really nothing sort of remarkable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, you can catch more of Maria interview with Larry Silverstein tonight on Maria Bartiromo's \"WALL STREET\" That is at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Can't wait to watch that.</p><p>Well, a Texas father and construction worker who became a popular Instagram influencer is actually -- well, it was kind of a stunt -- to be honest with you. Here is the story. Twitter user Barbara L, claimed that after she explained what an influencer was to her dad, Omar, he start an Instagram account that show he's like he works at construction, and likes to drink coffee.</p><p>The account racked up hundreds of thousands of followers, guys. But BuzzFeed news says the entire operation was a marketing project, and it was orchestrated by a local coffee company. I feel very wrong and very upset about this. How could be? Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, there is no spots -- excuse me, I was leaning down, looking at my Instagram account.</p><p>CASONE: But yes, well, make sure it's not hacked. You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I get it, we're going to talk about this as the morning wears on. But those photos were two posts that was sure. That's why I was like those selfies are just too good.</p><p>CASONE: I'm obviously just naive, I fell for it. What can I say?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, somehow, every photo I take of myself I add 20 years which is really not good.</p><p>CASONE: Do not.</p><p>BREWER: No.</p><p>KELLY: Well, if Omar doesn't know what an influencer is, and then all of the sudden he's posting photos like this, I mean, come on, you got to think.</p><p>BELL: I am interested -- I'm --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We should ban anybody referring to their job, their profession as influencer.</p><p>BREWER: I can't say that I'll get in trouble.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What?</p><p>BREWER: Fast data.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. Coming up, worrying about money. A new report details financial concerns stressing Americans out the most. And oh, Canada, the Toronto Raptors, winning their first ever NBA championship. How rapper Drake celebrated with new tunes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Americans both optimistic and anxious about money. A first on Fox interview here, a new Merrill Edge survey showing that 56 percent of Americans admit they \"treat themselves when they meet a financial goal.\" Some top rewards include material purchases, buying clothes, taking a vacation, eating out at a nice restaurant and indulging in spa or beauty treatments. Joining us now, Bank of America Head of Consumer Banking and Investments, Aron Levine. Good to see you, Aron.</p><p>ARON LEVINE, HEAD OF CONSUMER BANKING AND INVESTMENTS, BANK OF AMERICA: Great to see you again. What jumped out in this survey that you did? Was it surprising?</p><p>LEVINE: A couple of things. One, there is this combination of, sort of, hopeful optimism for the future; meaning down the road, I'm going to be OK. But then, right now, the sort of next three to five-year periods people are incredible stressed and they're stressed about how are they going to manage all that competing priorities, how do I save for retirement, how do I save for a home, how do I handle paying for vacations? All those competing priorities is creating a lot of stress. And I guess the good news is the solution side over half the respondents said they're seeking advice either digitally or with an advisor and two thirds said they're going to do that soon which is way above what I used talk about here a couple years ago, right? So, more and more people saying I'm at a point where I truly need advice.</p><p>BELL: The adoption of digital and mobile advise, is that really just because the coming-of-age millennials? Even Gen-Z is starting, to your survey shows, really worry about their financial situation and their future. Is it just because the younger people are moving towards mobile or do you also see the older generation moving that way as well?</p><p>LEVINE: Yes, what's fantastic with our clients -- we actually see everyone across the spectrum, certainly younger investors are the first and quickest, and maybe that's the only way they've ever done it. But now, we're seeing more and more clients who had historically -- they've done it themselves, now saying: hey, we're the digital platform, I actually want to add an advisor or just people saying, you know what, it is so complicated and I'm not sure that I have the right plan. So, that's the planning side that people are really looking for advice on, not so much the investment side.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And how do they engage? I started my career in Merrill 12 years ago, and we definitely couldn't go on digitally. We talked to an advisor. So, are they actually in a chat room? Or how do they engage with their advisor?</p><p>LEVINE: Yes, what's fantastic is certainly with our platform, Merrill Guide Investing, you can engage in a multiple -- you can walk into a financial center and talk to someone in person, you can do it through chat, you can do it through video, you can do it through phone. So, I think the key is clients need the advice they wanted. And the question is: can we deliver it in the way they're most comfortable? And it's all of the above. There's no longer either/or -- it's an and. Can I do it digitally and in person? Can I do it on the phone and digitally? And that's how it's all working now.</p><p>KELLY: Just really quick. So, are they stressed because of the cost of living has gone up as well as the cost of education? Is that what's stressing them out?</p><p>LEVIN: Yes, there's a whole series of stresses. One is just in general: student debt, I know you guys talk a lot about that. That's certainly a high one. I think fears of just where the economy is and just general -- you know, the recessionary fears. But their own personal debt is the number one stress. And then, on top of that, there's this overall feeling of is the economy going to stay strong? Is it going to be for them? Are they going to be able to keep their job?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know Gen-Z mental health, 73 percent, said that money worries are taking a toll with 69 percent saying it is impacting their physical health. That's really incredible. Aron, good to see you.</p><p>LEVINE: Yes, great to see you guys. Thanks so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Please come back soon.</p><p>LEVINE: Always. Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Aron Levin. Coming up, a historic victory for Toronto. The Raptors winning their first NBA championship. The highlights in sports, plus how the rapper, Drake, celebrated, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: An exciting, historic night for Raptors fans, see? I was up too late watching that game as the team clinches its first-ever NBA championship.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kyle Lowery is just in bound, and that's it. There's a new NBA champion, and it's a team from Toronto, Canada. We the north are now, we the champions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Was that Mike Breen? Joining me now, Sports Reporter Mike Gunzelman. Mike and I, the reason I bring that up, is because Mike and I both know Mike Breen.</p><p>MIKE GUNZELMAN, SPORTS REPORTER: Mike Breen is the best, obviously. Yes, we definitely love them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, tell me about the game last night. What jumped out at you?</p><p>GUNZELMAN: Yes, I mean, it was wild. I mean, you got to realize this was going back and forth. And the Warriors were the clear favorites to win the whole, entire season, and then then Raptors come in and they beat them not once, not twice but three times on the Warriors own home-court. If you are a fan of partying, go to Toronto right now because you're sure they're still partying. First franchise title for them and also the first major sports championship for Canada since 1993 when the Canadians won.</p><p>So, you can just imagine just the chaos and just how much energy was going on. Now, for the game itself, literally came down -- I'm also kind of tired because it went down the last second, you know what I mean? It literally went down last second, back and forth. But just an overall amazing time for sure, not only for sports, NBA et cetera, but for the Raptors -- because they were the clear underdog here and then they just came out to perform. That pure grit. And just won't stop.</p><p>KELLY: Well, to be -- to true Canadian form, it was an unconventional year, where they sat their best players who didn't play consecutive. And so, everyone is starting to talk about it and that's how you beat the best, right? Or perceive best team is you -- unconventional methods.</p><p>GUNZELMAN: It's also interesting with the Warriors. I mean, some people are like: well, the Raptors -- clearly, they deserve to win, but the Warriors were banged. You have Kevin Durant who was hurt, then he comes back, and he tears Achilles within the first 11 minutes of coming back. Then last night, on top of all that, Klay Thompson, leading scorer of the game, drops 30 points. All right, Klay's ready. Boom! Two minutes left. Right there -- you see right there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Boom! ACL.</p><p>GUNZELMAN: He tore his ACL. He's out six months to a year, and he was the best player on the court at the time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real quick before we move on to the U.S. Open. The new Drake song, have you heard it?</p><p>GUNZELMAN: Just what we need more of in our life -- more Drake, right? But he's dropping two songs today in celebration. They haven't come out just yet but I'm sure they'll be great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Recorded last minute when you're tired. No, I'm joking. A busy -- he clearly didn't jinx it, if he recorded it in advance. A busy first day at the U.S. Open in Pebble Beach. Golfer Rory Sabatini making an impressive hole in one. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A moment ago at 12. Rory Sabatini, 202 yards away. What! Yes, you should celebrate!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: What are you watching for? That was awesome! We all did that.</p><p>GUNZELMAN: The U.S. Open has been actually pretty exciting so far. You know, day one, first of all, hole-in-one, that's one of the best things in all the sports when that happens. So, shout out to him, he finished one over. But you know, the big story, Justin Rose is your leader, six under - - tied the all-time record with Tiger Woods for single a day, shot 65 on the day. My boy, Tiger, you know, a barstool comes on here a lot. They always say, make Sundays great again, you need Tiger to make Sundays great again.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you made this morning great. Mike Gunzelman, thank you so much.</p><p>GUNZELMAN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Big heart for Mike Breen, too. I know he's not watching. He's in bed. Still ahead, parents, listen up, Amazon accused of recording your children through Alexa. The lawsuits, next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
